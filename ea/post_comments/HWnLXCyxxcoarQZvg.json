I expect this would make it even harder to pivot to new things or treat EA as a question, it also wouldn\u2019t be unifying for many folks (e.g. who having been thinking about AI safety for a decade or who don\u2019t buy longtermism). According to me, the bulk of people who call themselves EAs, like most groups, are too slow to update on new arguments and information and I would expect that having a written and agreed upon history would not help with this.

Some reasons that come to mind: too busy doing other things they think are important, might come across as self aggrandizing, who\u2019s going to read it?-and ways I expect it to get read are weird and indoctorinaty (\u201cwelcome to the club, here\u2019s a book about our history\u201d, as opposed to \u201coh, you want to do lots of good, here are some ideas that might be useful\u201d), it doesn\u2019t directly improve the world and the indirect path to impact is shakier than other meta things.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not saying this is necessarily a bad idea.
