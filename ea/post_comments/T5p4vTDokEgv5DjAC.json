Both because of a) the boring reason that <i>average</i> change hides a lot of variance, and b) because these differences are a true global average, rather than population-density weighted. (so for example, it might well be the case that the places with more humans, will experience on average larger temperature increases).<br><br>So how much temperature change does 1\u00baC global average change feel, anthropically? Both in terms of average temperature increases and peak temperature increases. And if 1\u00baC global average change feels like X.Y\u00baC, do we expect this to scale roughly linearly with temperature increases within the usual range? &nbsp;</p><p>I mention this because I suspect I and others intuitively underestimate climate impact because we think 2 degrees doesn't \"feel\" like a lot.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Linch"}}, {"_id": "WdkZwo2SgQDFgYC3W", "postedAt": "2022-09-13T23:23:27.299Z", "postId": "T5p4vTDokEgv5DjAC", "htmlBody": "<p>Does John feel like he learned generalizable lessons/heuristics/updates from studying climate change that ports over to studying other GCRs like unaligned AI or novel pandemics?
