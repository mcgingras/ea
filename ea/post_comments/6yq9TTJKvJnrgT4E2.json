My first reaction is that interdepartmental bureaucracy is quite a different beast to an evidence-to-policy process. I agree that splitting development policy/programmes across multiple government depts causes lots of problems and is generally to be avoided if possible (I\u2019m thinking about the UK system but imagine the challenges are similar in the US and elsewhere).</p><p>Of course you do need some bureaucracy to facilitate evidence-to-policy too, but on the whole I think it\u2019s absolutely worth the time. For public policy we should aim to make a small number of decisions really well. The idea a small efficient group who just know what to do and crack on is appealing; it\u2019s a more heroic narrative than a careful weighing of the evidence. Though I can\u2019t imagine the users of this forum need persuading of the importance of using evidence to do better than our intuitions and overcome our biases.&nbsp;</p><p>Incidentally, I feel this kind of we-know-what-to-do-let\u2019s-crack-on instinct is more acceptable in development policy than domestic, and in my view development policy would benefit from being much more considered. We cause a lot of chaos and harm to systems in LMICs in the way we offer development assistance, even through programmes that are supporting valuable services. I think all of the major GHI\u2019s do great work, but all could benefit from substantial reforms. Though again, this is somewhat separate from the point about interdepartmental bureaucracy.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "atCH8g3LBLtBe6gxy", "user": {"username": "TomDrake"}}]
