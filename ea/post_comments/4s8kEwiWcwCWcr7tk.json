The time reversal algorithm mentioned here seems to be a concrete way to achieve perfectly accurate ancestor simulation, and though the timescales involved may be enormous, the required computational infrastructure is quite achievable in terms of how much we could make. I do not make any claims as to the details of such a project, but the algorithm exists and will likely see use as quantum computers become commonplace. It is possible to measure individual atoms, and molecular nanotechnology can be created. Thus, this is a question of engineering rather than a physical impossibility.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Mythopoeist"}}]
