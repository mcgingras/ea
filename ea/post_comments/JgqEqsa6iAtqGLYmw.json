So, even if one has \"30% credence in <i>deprivationism</i>&nbsp;and 100% credence that the neutral point is below one\", assuming AMF (or other life-saving interventions which score highly under deprivationist views) currently receives more than 30 % of resources, one could reasonably direct (at the current margin) all donations to StrongMinds (or other life-improving interventions which score highly under epicurean views).</p><p>I also wonder whether GiveWell's moral weights being majorly determined by its donors (60 %) has the intention of capturing other effects besides those directly related to the death of the person.

Taken together, these results suggest the ITN distribution campaigns may have caused fertility to increase unexpectedly and temporarily, or that these increases may just be a tempo effect \u2013 changes in fertility timing which do not lead to increased completed fertility</p><p>[Conclusion:] In contrast, our findings do not support the contention that erosion of international funding for malaria control, specifically of ITNs, would lead to higher fertility rates in the short-run. While our results are suggestive that this may be the case for long-run fertility, we show the exact opposite for the short-run</p></blockquote><p>If the results are suggestive that decreasing ITNs leads to higher long-run fertility, AMF would tend to decrease longterm fertility. This would tend to decrease the future population size, but it is unclear whether this is good or bad.</p><p>I guess population size considerations did not play much of a role on the moral weight answers of GiveWell's donors.

I wanted to share a couple comments on it as well as a couple specific questions.</p><p>First, I think it's really good you're looking at these questions in so much detail despite the fact that they can feel unpleasant or difficult. I personally think that there's something pretty screwed up about the world when a random upper-middle class person in the United States can choose whether someone in Sub-Saharan Africa lives or dies depending on the choice of how much and where to donate. But given that's the world we live in, I think it's really important to do our best to try and figure out answers to these kinds of moral questions you're looking at. (Note: I also think it's worth trying to bring about systemic changes to remove the need for aid, but systemic change isn't something that we can snap our fingers and bring about. It's a complex process that carries its own costs and benefits, and the potential for systemic change doesn't remove the need to think carefully about options for improving wellbeing immediately).&nbsp;</p><p>In light of my more general feelings, I'm pretty strongly in favor of efforts that try and ask aid recipients what they want and value, rather than trying to make these tradeoffs based on our own moral reasoning. For that reason, I've been very pleased that GiveWell has incorporated surveys in its computation of moral weights, and I'll be very excited to see the results from HLI's survey on the neutral point. I would love to see more survey work that tries to tease out views on deprivationism vs. TRIA vs. Epicurianism among individuals actually impacted by aid. However, these might be complicated enough questions that focus groups and other more in-depth approaches would work better than surveys.&nbsp;</p><p>With those comments out of the way, I also wanted to ask a couple specific questions:</p><ol><li>When you computed your 4 WELLBY/$1,000 cost-effectiveness estimate for AMF's development effects, is that after correcting for the previous <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/?commentId=Bfzg5aoGgG56q6cnK\">arithmetic error</a> from the Dozen Doubts post? (Edit: I tried to check this myself, but the Google sheet link didn't seem to work for me).</li><li>Does anyone use a simple total utilitarian framework when doing this kind of cost-benefit accounting? I would think that such a framework might look sort of in between deprivationism and Epicurianism, depending on how interventions impacted fertility. I don't want to come across as endorsing the total utilitarian framework as a uniquely desirable one to use, but it seems worth at least thinking about in this context.&nbsp;</li></ol>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "MHR"}}, {"_id": "avBxGBxd7Lc9RJWK2", "postedAt": "2022-11-18T19:49:48.050Z", "postId": "JgqEqsa6iAtqGLYmw", "htmlBody": "<p>Yes, we try to account for the benefit that'd accrue to everyone who doesn't get sick.

But more seriously, we considered adding this perspective, but we found it difficult to implement and more difficult to communicate. The difficulty with incorporating fertility is when to stop counting. Take the immediate \"replacement\" effect. Roodman (<a href=\"https://davidroodman.com/blog/2014/04/16/the-mortality-fertility-link/\">2014</a>) estimates for every &nbsp;4 children who die, this leads to between 1 and 2 extra children being born. So if we just stop there, adding fertility in a totalist perspective makes AMF look relatively worse. But why stop there? Why not count the next generation? If we save 4 people, but only 2 are counterfactually created, then there are still 2 people who could have 3 children of their own. So instead of just saving 4 people (which would have been the result in the non-totalist analysis), you've actually saved &nbsp;8! Double the value! But would it make sense to add the generation after that? What about the 4th, 5th or 6th generations?<i><strong> At what point are we just making up numbers?</strong></i> A further issue is that this whole discussion doesn't incorporate a whole lot of more speculative effects that could potentially swamp the totalists calculus. These are infamously tough problems like: is it better or worse for the rest of the population for more people to exist? AKA is the world under or overpopulated? Does adding new people increase or decrease existential risk? I don't have good, confident answers to these questions, and I'd be sceptical of anyone who claims to! My hunch is that if you're a totalist, your view on saving lives will probably not be driven by crunching the numbers about fertility but about your speculation on how adding people affects the wellbeing of the population and existential security.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnts5hb962xqj\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefts5hb962xqj\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>But the IDinsight report on this topic (<a href=\"https://www.idinsight.org/project/using-peoples-preferences-and-values-to-inform-funding-decisions/\">2019</a>) made me think this type of work may be more difficult to do in very low-income settings than I might have hoped.&nbsp;</p></div></li></ol>", "parentCommentId": "emwd8ahRvj52ufmxz", "user": {"username": "JoelMcGuire"}}, {"_id": "sRzqku9iiBsBPTnPe", "postedAt": "2022-11-18T20:44:44.797Z", "postId": "JgqEqsa6iAtqGLYmw", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks Joel!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "avBxGBxd7Lc9RJWK2", "user": {"username": "Khorton"}}, {"_id": "DECyNgY7C43LvscZr", "postedAt": "2022-11-18T22:26:07.748Z", "postId": "JgqEqsa6iAtqGLYmw", "htmlBody": "<p>Skimming through this, this is great!

If we take GiveWell's estimate that the morbidity reduction is equal to a 9% of AMF's pre-adjustment benefits, that means that per $100000, morbidity reduction generates 0.09*8570 = 771 units of value.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on how I think you're doing it, when you go to calculate the non-life-extension benefits of AMF, you compute the benefits of morbidity reduction as 9% of (development benefits + avoided bereavement). If we just work with GiveWell's numbers (which don't include the bereavement effects), that would be 0.09*2582 = 232 units of value/$100000. Then when you go to calculate the life-extension benefits, you add in a 9% adjustment for morbidity reduction, which is &nbsp;0.09*5987 = 539 units of value/$100000. But that bookkeeping doesn't make any sense, as all the morbidity benefits should be accounted for in the non-life-extension category. &nbsp;Doing it the way I think you are, where you're adding a factor of 0.09 to all benefits, ends up making AMF look worse in the Epicurean case, as well as in all cases with a higher neutral point for happiness.&nbsp;</p><p>This is actually even more important because you're applying such a big downward adjustment to GiveWell's numbers. If we divide GiveWell's estimate of the development benefits by 4, &nbsp;then the development benefits are about 709 units of value/$100000 and the total morbidity reduction benefits under GiveWell's assumptions are 9% of the new total, or 597 units of value/$100000. If you do the bookkeeping how I think you're doing, only 58 units of value/$100000 of morbidity reduction would get attributed to the non-life-extension benefit category. Correctly attributing all 597 units of value/$100000 from morbidity reduction nearly doubles the estimated non-life-extension benefits of AMF.&nbsp;</p><p>I recognize that to some extent we're working with made-up numbers here. But I think the general point that the supplemental adjustments need to be handled with care when doing this kind of component analysis is an important one. However, I do apologize in advance if I'm misunderstanding how you're approaching this right now.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "Cac7zFTtukujjtEkS", "user": {"username": "MHR"}}, {"_id": "irruMjMabnkGbhmbX", "postedAt": "2022-11-20T15:55:19.838Z", "postId": "JgqEqsa6iAtqGLYmw", "htmlBody": "<p>Yep that makes sense to me</p>", "parentCommentId": "ByhH9GPoxWHdhiEwg", "user": {"username": "MHR"}}, {"_id": "mAaKSk3rQtzPNY2Dn", "postedAt": "2022-11-21T15:52:27.606Z", "postId": "JgqEqsa6iAtqGLYmw", "htmlBody": "<p>Well, if we think feelings matter, we should try to quantify them in a sensible way.

With a loved one in mind whom we care about we do not leave room for any variable to arise and cause harm to them, and we are committed to the safety and well-being of them as was we can very well consider a universally human virtue, as we do take responsibility for those we love and care for.</p><p>If we look at the characters in the old tale of Cain and Abel, the projected shame denied facing by Cain is elementally psychological in the depicted scenario through the expression <i>\"Am I my brother's keeper?\" </i>- which is the very sunk-cost fallacy that is the whole of my point.</p><p>We are <i>\"our brother's keepers\" &nbsp;</i>when we sincerely care.
