Effective Altruism is or should be about doing the most good. Organisations which are explicitly labelled Effective Altruist are only a small part of that. Claiming that EA is now more talent constrained than funding constrained implicitly refers to Effective Altruist orgs being more talent than funding constrained. </p>\n<p>Whether 'doing the most good' in the world is more talent than funding constrained is much harder to prove but is the actually important question.</p>\n<p>If we focus the debate on EA orgs and our general vision as a movement on orgs that are labelled EA, the EA Community runs the risk of overlooking efforts and opportunities which aren't branded EA.</p>\n<p>Of course fixing global poverty takes more than ten people working on the problem. Filling the funding gap for GiveWell recommended charities won't be enough to fix it either. Using EA branded framing isn't special to you - but it can make us lose track of the bigger picture of all the problems that still need to be solved, and all the funding that is still needed for that.</p>\n<p>If you want to focus on fixing global poverty, just because EA focuses on GW recommended charities doesn't mean EtG is the best approach - how about training to be a development economist instead? The world still needs more than ten additional ones of that. (Edit: But it is not obvious to me whether global poverty as a whole is more talent or funding constrained - you'd need to poll leading people who actually work in the field, e.g. leading development economists or development professors.)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Denise_Melchin"}}, {"_id": "yNyx6NQKCKdtuHa4F", "postedAt": "2018-05-21T00:28:43.842Z", "postId": "CjPrNjSeDJJpHJhXk", "htmlBody": "<p>Here's what Lewis Bollard <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/lewis-bollard-end-factory-farming/\">had to say</a> about the talent vs. funding issue when asked about it on the 80,000 Hours podcast (in September 2017):</p>\n<p><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong> My impression is that fa \u2026. animal welfare organisations, at least the ones that I\u2019m aware of, they are associated with Effective Altruism are often among the most funding constrained. That they often feel like they\u2019re most limited by access to money. Does this suggest that people who are concerned with animal welfare should be more inclined to do earning to give and, perhaps, rather than work in the area, instead make money and give it away?</p>\n<p><strong>Lewis Bollard:</strong> I don\u2019t think so. I think that that was true until two years ago, or it was true until eighteen months ago when we started ground making in this field. I think the situation has dramatically improved in terms of funding largely because of Open Phil. Entering this field, but also because there are a number of other very generous donors who\u2019ve either entered the field or significantly increased their giving in the last two years.</p>\n<p>Right now I think there is a bigger talent gap than financial gap for farm animal welfare groups. That\u2019s not to say it will always be that way, and I certainly do think that someone whose aptitude or inclination is heavily toward earning to give, it could still well make sense. If someone has great quantitative skills and enjoys working at a hedge fund, then I would say earn to give. That could be still a really powerful way and we will more and more funders over time to continue scaling up the movement, but all things equal, I would encourage someone to focus more on the talent piece now because I do think that things have really flipped in the last few years, and I\u2019m pretty optimistic that the funding will continue to grow in this space for animal welfare.</p>\n<p><strong>Robert Wiblin:</strong> What makes you confident about that? You don\u2019t expect to be fired in the next few years?</p>\n<p><strong>Lewis Bollard:</strong> First, I hope I won\u2019t be fired, but I think there\u2019s a deep commitment from the Open Philanthropy Project to continue strong funding in this space, to continue funding on at least the level we\u2019re funding currently and hopefully more.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve also just seen a number of new large-ish funders coming online. Just in the last two years I would say the number of funders giving more than two hundred thousand dollars a year has doubled, and I\u2019ve started to see real interest from some other major potential funders.</p>\n<p>I think it\u2019s natural that, as this issue has gained public prominence, so were there a lot of potential donors, or people who have great wealth, have realised that this is something important and this is something that they can make a great difference.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "RandomEA"}}, {"_id": "LfG4PGrvPeLmqCqGh", "postedAt": "2018-05-21T10:12:54.411Z", "postId": "CjPrNjSeDJJpHJhXk", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>One gripe I have with this debate is the focus on EA orgs</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is a bit unfair.

It just seems immediately odd that if you think that Earning To Give to some global poverty charities is on a par with other common EA career choices in terms of marginal impact (i.e. assuming you think &quot;poverty&quot; should be on the table at all for us), that the size of this funding gap is the equivalent of ~$0.086pp for the bottom billion. And in fact the linked post gives a funding gap of something more like $400 million for GiveWell's top charities alone (on top of expected funding from Good Ventures and donors who aren't influenced by GiveWell), with GiveDirectly able to absorb &quot;over 100 million dollars&quot;. But it's not so odd if you think that the expected value of donating to GiveWell-recommended charities is several orders of magnitude greater compared to the average global poverty charity.

(And how was your talent gap estimated? Is it just a counting up of the number of currently hiring open positions on the EA job board?)</p><p>Benjamin&#x27;s analysis, as I understand it, is that EA&#x27;s growing financial influence means that more money is going to come in pretty soon, and also that effective altruists are pretty good at redirecting outside funds to their causes (so, if you build good talent infrastructure and rigorously demonstrate impact and a funding gap, funding will come) </p><p>Is this a correct summary of your respective arguments?

I&#x27;m not actually sure what the source of this disagreement is, other than Katherine and Joe having different intuitions, or bird&#x27;s eye views of different parts of the landscape? Has Joe written more on this topic? If it&#x27;s just a matter of two people&#x27;s intuitions, it doesn&#x27;t leave much room for evaluating either claim.

Is that correct?)</p><p>(Motivation: I&#x27;m reading this post now as part of the CE incubation program&#x27;s reading list, and felt surprised because the conclusions conflicted with my intuitions, some of which I think were originally formed by reading Benjamin&#x27;s posts a few years ago. As the program aims to set me on a path which will potentially help me cause redirection of funding, redirection of talent, create room for more talent, and/or create room for more funding within global poverty or animal issues, the answers to these questions may be of practical value to me.)</p><p>I&#x27;d be happy if either of you could weigh in on this / explain the nature and sources of disagreement (if there is in fact a disagreement) a bit more! </p><p>(PS - can I tag two people to be notified by a comment?
