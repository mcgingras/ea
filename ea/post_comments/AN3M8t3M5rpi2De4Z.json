Also need to do a ton of work in African countries to create the political will and technical plans for rapid rollout.</p><p>From an advocacy perspective, 1Day's main idea is to generate a ton of public attention to achieve the goals above (particularly the money) -- ideally by bringing in new philanthropic funders, though that may be unrealistic. But there will also be more targeted campaigns at the international institution and African country levels.</p><p>Current rollout plans are unclear, but the below probably gives the best sense of current international institution goals.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BGozDmeMyxbwM3gLg/pvvft9wieektmxx9sgdj\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BGozDmeMyxbwM3gLg/tomtdx86j9yxehgzuu8c 130w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BGozDmeMyxbwM3gLg/ulgb4dj9cqwcrd99s9bz 260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BGozDmeMyxbwM3gLg/onag9hkanwv9qyx0llry 390w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BGozDmeMyxbwM3gLg/qt0fgyz8obauolfjhfbx 520w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BGozDmeMyxbwM3gLg/msahhgaathfmujb0txnn 650w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BGozDmeMyxbwM3gLg/zf5k2u10mh37srcmslcc 780w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BGozDmeMyxbwM3gLg/l33q5ofniim0icyugv5l 910w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BGozDmeMyxbwM3gLg/ydlpf4mczau0vwxkstpc 1040w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BGozDmeMyxbwM3gLg/xhyenx94tbqqambvuzoi 1170w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BGozDmeMyxbwM3gLg/h6ehtgifyjwes1opwmfi 1256w\"></figure><p>As you can see, current vision doesn't get to the predicted steady state (80 million doses) until about 2027.
