Changing the pledge isn't about undermining the focus on extreme poverty, it's about recognising that what we ultimately care about is <em>saving lives</em>, no matter where or when they are, whether they are in the developing world, the developed world, or in the future. Some people think the best way to save lives is to donate to far-future oriented causes, others think the best way is to donate to poverty causes - these people disagree, but mostly they agree that what they ultimately care about is the same and this is just a really tough question. Given that none of us can be certain that poverty is the best cause to focus on, it seems beneficial to be more inclusive of other potentially effective cause areas, so we can encourage more discussion and debate amongst the people who disagree.

Riffing off the GWWC pledge, I'm thinking something like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;I recognise that I can do a significant amount of good, by committing part of my income to those less fortunate \u2014 that I can live well enough on a smaller income \u2014 that the need is great.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;I recognise that I can help relieve the suffering and fulfill the promise of many lives, by allocating my gift wisely \u2014 to the worthiest causes \u2014 to the most credible interventions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;I here pledge that for the rest of my life or until the day I retire, I shall give at least ten percent of what I earn to whichever initiatives can most effectively use it to improve the lives of others, now and in the years to come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;I make this pledge freely, openly, and sincerely.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If this is going to be our 'big-tent' pledge, and is going to bear the name 'effective altruism', it's important that it say a little more than GWWC does about, for example, epistemic rigor. The Church of Scientology might claim (perhaps even in good faith) to be an effective way to help people, but we have non-arbitrary grounds for excluding Scientology as a pledge-meeting organization if it fails the &quot;credibility&quot; test.</p>\n<p>If we went with a pledge like this, we could also have a page informally unpacking what we mean by parts of the pledge, to further guard against diluting EA. E.g., we can unpack &quot;<strong>worthiest causes</strong>&quot; as &quot;causes that purport to dramatically improve the welfare of those most in need&quot;, and unpack &quot;<strong>credible interventions</strong>&quot; as &quot;interventions whose efficacy has been argued for reasonably, explicitly, and on scientifically tenable grounds&quot;. The latter isn't meant to exclude promising new possibilities that are somewhat speculative; but it should exclude causes that have yet to be argued for, or whose only supporting arguments have been unambiguously refuted.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "RobBensinger"}}, {"_id": "zY8ZbF5zX5H6i8HCu", "postedAt": "2014-10-23T10:15:51.736Z", "postId": "9Xp7BGoKnbSiP3Ng8", "htmlBody": "<p>I quite like the current slightly slow and ponderous language.

(Cross-posting my response from Facebook): With regard to your point about there being multiple pledges, we have been considering various options, including GWWC having multiple pledges, EAO running a pledge through the effective-altruism.com, having a pledge as part of the forum, and looking to the donation registry to fulfil this function. None of these seem nearly as promising to us. GWWC has built up quite a base of infrastructure, credibility and branding, which it would be time-consuming and difficult to replicate. (EAO is not interested in doing so, and the forum and registry don't seem terribly suited to doing so). I kind of agree with Jen that pledging is a little weird, so it would likely seem strange to have a series of different orgs with different pledges. This still leaves the option of GWWC having two - we already have the infrastructure and are seen as the 'pledging organisation'. However, we're very hesitant to have two separate pledges.

All other causes EAs commonly endorse (i.e. animal welfare, x-risk) have much poorer common sense credentials.</p>\n<p>GWWC is a valuable intersection between Effective Altruism and the wider world. In one direction, GWWC packages some EA ideals (moral commitment, looking at evidence and data carefully, some moves towards cause agnosticism) in a manner that not-too-inferentially distant from most people, and a common route for people getting 'more EA'. Looking the other way, the wider appeal of global poverty over the currently-coalescing 'Tenets of Effective Altruism' can attract those not 'fully on board', and this group of more liminal 'EA' people can be an anchor against the EA community drifting further towards becoming an insular, epistemically overconfident and morally arrogant monoculture. </p>\n<p>Insofar as the changes to the pledge (and the ethos motivating them) pushes GWWC towards being an avowedly 'EA organisation'; insofar as their membership have less to do with commonsensically good things like 'stopping extreme poverty'; and insofar as it risks pushing away those inclined to ally with the 'EA movement', these changes threaten the goods GWWC brings to the EA movement. I also fear knock-on effects to GWWC itself and the millions of pounds it encourages and directs to good causes (is there a plan to survey the current members of GWWC about this change in the pledge?)</p>\n<p>I agree that the 'EA community' should have a cause-neutral way to make a morally serious declaration of commitment, and especially to convert what I hope to be wildly successful outreach efforts into concrete action to make the world better. One could do worse than modelling this community on GWWC, given how successful it has been. </p>\n<p>But I don't think GWWC can be this community whilst maintaining its focus on global poverty. I don't see how subtle changes to the wording of the pledge to make it in principle 'animal rights friendly' help when in practice GWWC's entire website is about global poverty and never mentions animal suffering once. Nor do I see how cause-agnosticism is squared with a tagline that exorts, &quot;Join us in the fight against global poverty&quot;. I worry about Giving What We Can's mission being incrementally hollowed out to make it a more welcoming home to EAs who think global poverty is a distraction from a far more important cause; or it being half-heartedly maintained as an atavistic facade by a cognoscenti who take it as received wisdom that fighting global poverty isn't really the most important thing GWWC does anymore. </p>\n<p>The other alternatives; of trying to construct a cause-neutral parallel to GWWC, preferably before the books launch, or a status quo devoid of a central hub new EAs can go to; are far from ideal either. Yet the former is not hopeless (c.f. Tom et al.'s work on a donation registry), and a community norm about giving could propagate without a centralized group (and perhaps we should fear a single EA group becoming too central to the movement).

On similar grounds, I do not really like the language &quot;beyond poverty.&quot;</p>\n<p>Many commenters have focused on the effects of a change on GWWC's branding and its ability to attract additional members. These may be important effects. But depending on how seriously you take the pledge and on how narrowly you read it, the direct effect may also be quite important. Namely, the a narrow reading of the current pledge entails a substantial commitment to a particular cause, which does not seem compatible with a cause agnostic outlook and a reasonable degree of epistemic humility--especially not for donors early in life (including much of GWWC's current audience). Though GWWC need not and probably should not broaden its scope to be a general EA organization, I do think that being in direct tension with effectiveness would be bad.</p>\n<p>Relatedly, many future-focused EA's have signed the pledge on the basis of views such as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The change is not likely to make a difference to people who think that the best way to help others is to ensure that the future will go well, since the pledge already explicitly includes people who will live in the future, as well as those alive now. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is a plausible view in some cases, but in others it is a stretch. For example, I think <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/9f/on_progress_and_prosperity/\">it is plausible</a> that our altruistic priorities may be quite different if we consider the very long-term, rather than restricting our attention to the coming centuries. One could debate whether such effects can be classified as &quot;helping people in developing countries,&quot; but (1) I suspect that for most precise definitions of developing countries, they couldn't, (2) in any case, a casual listener would be very unlikly interpret the phrase this way. I would not want to be in the position of defending this interpretation in a discussion of my own giving, and I think that many people would view it as an intentional misrepresentation.</p>\n<p>That said, I would probably not sign a modified version of the pledge either.  Though I currently give substantially more than 10% of my income away, I am not confident that donation will remain the most effective way to do good (I understand that in principle investment in profitable enterprises or in my own human capital could be carried out in a way consistent with a sufficiently broad reading of the pledge, but I would be even more uncomfortable with this than with donating to non-development causes). I suspect that (a modest probability) * (10% of my income) is more important than the possible positive effects. Hopefully my view can be informative, but I don't think it should be given much weight as such.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Paul_Christiano"}}, {"_id": "sLzEdDJAXEJRLdSfb", "postedAt": "2014-10-25T07:48:03.624Z", "postId": "9Xp7BGoKnbSiP3Ng8", "htmlBody": "<p>True, but I meant that to me saving even one life seems clearly worth giving up 10% of my income for.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "3P36YbcbSNmXGTF8Y", "user": {"username": "Tom_Ash"}}, {"_id": "oe99wNhDxxk89qhMe", "postedAt": "2014-10-25T11:47:39.851Z", "postId": "9Xp7BGoKnbSiP3Ng8", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>The other alternatives; of trying to construct a cause-neutral parallel to GWWC, preferably before the books launch, or a status quo devoid of a central hub new EAs can go to; are far from ideal either.

We\u2019ll likely reach out to members we know well and haven\u2019t heard from yet. Then I was planning to write up a new doc of the considerations people had, and our revised thoughts. \nI definitely agree with your assessment of fighting extreme poverty being something basically all morally serious people care about, and that allowing GWWC to be seen as a credible, reasonable organisation. I don\u2019t think that would be harmed by our saying that it is possible that there are other really effective causes out there though. I think the best way to conceptualise this is as follows: GWWC is trying to convince people that effectiveness in helping others is really important; that fighting poverty is amazingly effective; that we in developed countries are super lucky and should do more to help; that we should make a commitment to give and to give as effectively as we can. I\u2019m not convinced that it detracts from that message that it does not specify that the commitment must be to, and only to, fighting extreme poverty, even though that is what we as an organisation are focused on. \nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s wholly fair to characterise this change as one which means that GWWC\u2019s mission would only be half-heartedly maintained. We care deeply about eradicating extreme poverty, and will continue to do so. Having some members who think that there may be even more effective ways to help those in developing countries than fighting current poverty (whether that be by donating to Cool Earth or FHI) in any way detracted from our focus on global poverty. Nor do I think it\u2019s fair to characterise our members who do think that as not caring deeply about extreme poverty. I believe they still think that eradicating extreme poverty through treating NTDs and malaria is hugely important, very effective, and something which we should be spreading awareness. I would expect any members who joined under the new pledge and were donating to causes other than current poverty eradication to feel the same way. Therefore, I don\u2019t think their joining would take away from our continuing to focus on eradicating extreme poverty, and assessing charities with that purpose.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "HPg7Pq2ijYkPY8RM4", "user": {"username": "Michelle_Hutchinson"}}, {"_id": "YmmJ7vHbYdsF9mZJs", "postedAt": "2014-10-25T14:07:14.488Z", "postId": "9Xp7BGoKnbSiP3Ng8", "htmlBody": "<p>I agree that's a good point about it being the amount of donations that really needs the commitment device.

I think this would be in keeping with the behavior of other EA organizations who both push their own causes and try to help the movement as a whole with whatever their comparative advantage is.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Scott Alexander"}}, {"_id": "EhEZqRTsb3nkLWG7S", "postedAt": "2014-11-11T23:57:55.438Z", "postId": "9Xp7BGoKnbSiP3Ng8", "htmlBody": "<p>In practice all of these figures seriously underestimate the full impact because they don't consider flow-through effects such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the people whose lives are saved will have more children themselves, perhaps resulting in hundreds of extra lives over the very long term (I know of people who have 100+ great grandchildren)</li>\n<li>people for centuries or millennia into the future will be richer because the country developed economically sooner as a result of having healthier, better educated, and more productive people now (this is a version of 'astronomical waste').</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If the direct impact is lower, the flow-through effects will also be lower, but '$3,000 per life saved' is still very misleading as an indication of the absolute cost-effectiveness.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "3P36YbcbSNmXGTF8Y", "user": {"username": "Robert_Wiblin"}}, {"_id": "PAe6kdhHYQjNugGoZ", "postedAt": "2014-11-12T01:11:51.605Z", "postId": "9Xp7BGoKnbSiP3Ng8", "htmlBody": "<p>I am already a member, but I am in favour of changing the pledge because I see 'cause neutrality' as one of the most valuable and distinctive components of effective altruism.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Robert_Wiblin"}}, {"_id": "iMSAcSkiMEmambx7d", "postedAt": "2015-12-12T18:52:25.684Z", "postId": "9Xp7BGoKnbSiP3Ng8", "htmlBody": "<p>&quot;Perhaps this is difficult for utilitarians, who despite perhaps academically understanding the importance of game theory and rules, in practice often act like the stereotype of act utilitarians.&quot;</p>\n<p>I'm curious what you think the &quot;stereotype of act utilitarians&quot; is, unless it's &quot;hypocrite.&quot; I literally know exactly zero people who &quot;in practice often act&quot; in a manner that is most conducive to the greater good in the short term (you can probably argue about burnout and self-care, complicated game theory and signaling, etc...but then you're closer <em>in practice</em> to rule or Two-Level/Hare's utilitarianism, certainly not the stereotype of act utilitarians!)
