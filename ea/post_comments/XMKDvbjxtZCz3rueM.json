I think the value in this course is <i>higher</i> if you're from an underprivileged background or if you're a \"big fish in a small pond\" at a solid but non-elite university.</p><p>Mainly, it's because you'll get to hang out with other strong students across &nbsp;a range of contexts. You attend rigorous lectures, solve problem sets, and socialize with them. Last year, this included talking to PhD students at top universities. Particularly for potential PhD applicants, it's a <strong>very</strong> good way to test your fit and seeing what your weaknesses / strengths are relative to other people. And for me, it was a good way to remove some of the idolization I had of other people.</p><p>For some, this means realizing their initial career path is arduous but interesting and ultimately doable. For others, this means realizing \"Oh wow this is too much and not that useful to me. I need to rethink my career path.\" Both are useful updates.<br><br>Also, as a general vibe, I found that GPI as a whole talks about diversity, equity and inclusiveness in a very thought out and genuine way.
