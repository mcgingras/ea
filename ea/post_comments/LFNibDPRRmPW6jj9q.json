Presumably you'll readily agree with the statement, \"I wish these funds had not been stolen\". This is something I'd expect anybody to say.

This would make her complicit in the theft.</p><p>In contrast, clawbacks against money that have already been spent are much less clear. I think there are lots of situations where you can view that as the law being discordant with fairness, and it's not inconsistent to hope that you don't have to go through that.

Even his own excuse, in the Twitter DM with Piper, is that the money was deposited in an Alameda account and they just never sent that $8b to FTX.
