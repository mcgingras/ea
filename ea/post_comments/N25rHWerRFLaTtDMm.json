I may have raised this in a private channel, but I want to take the time to point out that based on anecdotal experience, I think LEAN &amp; CEA shouldn't be seeding groups without taking the time to make sure the groups are mentored, managed by motivated individual(s), and grown to sustainability. I found my local group last year and it was essentially dilapidated. I felt a responsibility to run it but was mostly unsuccessful in establishing contact to obtain help managing it until some time in 2017. I'm predicting these kinds of problems will diminish at least somewhat now that LEAN &amp; Rethink have full-time staff, the Mentoring program, more group calls, etc. :)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "DonyChristie"}}]
