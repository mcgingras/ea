To try and respond:</p><ol><li>I did try to be clear in distinguishing late abortions from all abortions - sorry if I did not explain myself very clearly! The large majority of the post - including all the arguments and references in the section on the ethics of abortion - refers to abortion in general, and is applicable to all abortions. So I do not think it is true that I used only late term abortions in my defence of fetal moral status. I only introduced late-term abortion in one short paragraph, where (I think) I made it clear that I was offering this as a separate argument even for those who were unpersuaded by the main post, and clarified the (reduced, but still large) scale of the problem for people who fall into that camp: \"<strong>Even if</strong> one has no problem with early abortion, 10% of abortions are after 13 weeks\u2019 gestation, at which point fetuses are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/week-by-week/1-to-12/12-weeks\">fully formed</a>, and likely conscious and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jme.bmj.com/content/46/1/3\">able to feel pain</a>.<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MwmdpSBMuzNDmvNHp/the-effective-altruist-case-for-pro-life-anti-abortion?commentId=5kebaSHeWWf8GQzhe#_ftn9\">[9]</a> This would amount to at least 3 million relatively late abortions each year globally \u2013 and potentially many more if abortion were to become more normalised and permitted around the world.\"</li><li>I'm aware that Wikipedia has a certain perspective on fetal pain - as it does on many things! - but I think that the evidence shows that perspective to be false. I linked to a recent paper from the world's leading researcher on this topic (Stuart Derbyshire) who used to hold something like the Wikipedia view, but who has now changed his mind because of evidence of thalamo-cortical precursors developing much earlier in pregnancy - around 12 weeks - than previously thought. Derbyshire himself is pro-choice. In addition, the papers I linked to challenge the necessity of the cortex for pain experience.</li></ol><p>Thanks again for your comment.

Well, prior to forming a cerebral cortex, newly created neurons are stored on a \u201csubplate\u201d. Once the cerebral cortex is formed, the neurons on the subplate migrate there and the subplate goes away. The authors claim that at around 12 weeks, neural pathways <i>start</i> to form between the thalamus and the subplate. It's possible that the neurons on this subplate experience some form of sensory pain. How this pain would compare to that of comparable animals is not explored in the paper.&nbsp;</p><p>They repeatedly note that this is a continuous process over the 12-24 week period, and that 12 weeks is the <i>minimum</i> for possible pain perception. The idea is that with these connections in place, it\u2019s possible that pain signals may enter the subplate and be experienced by the neurons there in a subconcious manner. Note that they never say this happens for sure, just that they \u201cno longer view it as impossible\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>What the OP also didn\u2019t mention was what the whole debate was mainly about: whether or not to use analgesia or anaesthesia when performing abortions.
