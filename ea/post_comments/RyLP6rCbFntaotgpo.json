This year, applications have skyrocketed to around 700 so far (up from 174 in 2022), competing for ~50 places. Most of these applications are from people new to Leaf, but we\u2019ll also have some of the most engaged or promising participants from our earlier online programmes attending, plus some returnees from last year. Longer-term, I hope to develop a pipeline of various (online) programmes and competitions all feeding into identifying a truly exceptional cohort for the residentials.</p><p>It\u2019s early days to comment on engagement relative to last year, but I\u2019m optimistic about some of the variations we\u2019ll be trying, such as the mentorship programme. Of course, success here depends on building up a great team of staff, speakers, and mentors.
