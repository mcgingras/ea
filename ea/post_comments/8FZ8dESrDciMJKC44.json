Those jobs are also better paid, and they have larger benefits to society in terms of helping a country grow. If this is the main benefit, then negative spillovers likely won't be large, because they are taking jobs that less educated people couldn't do. Plus, noncognitive benefits of school, in terms of better socialization, are real.</p>\n<p>I'm not aware of direct evidence on negative spillovers, but it's also important to point out that <em>positive</em> spillovers are also very plausible. More educated people can help their peers learn, not just in the classroom but also on the job. Plus if more educated people are <a href=\"https://fqueiro.github.io/entrep_hc_final.pdf\">better able to create successful businesses</a>, then they create jobs for others in a positive-sum way.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "ufvixi5NjnraLf4wa", "user": {"username": "therealslimkt"}}, {"_id": "NNQwczKXeZ34DXxCs", "postedAt": "2023-12-28T08:44:17.828Z", "postId": "8FZ8dESrDciMJKC44", "htmlBody": "<p>There's definite possibility here - even potentially in marking and monitoring lessons.

If you do make more money from going to more school, we don\u2019t really know why. It could be that you just came from a family that was always going to use their connections for you.
