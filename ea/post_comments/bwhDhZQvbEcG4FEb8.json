There was a time when I purchased this 10,000 lumen <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Brightness-Waterproof-Daylight-Worklights-Construction/dp/B08HZ8P8WJ/ref=sr_1_9?keywords=construction+lamp&amp;qid=1636861077&amp;sr=8-9\">lamp</a> to ail my poor sentiment during the sophomore year of college. The power in my room blew out once I purchased a second lamp, and I was left without electricity in my dorm for 2 weeks. Imagine treating everyone with SAD - 100,000 lumens each. I wonder how much electricity this would be collectively. Each person would need around this amount of light for some duration of some interval of the year. What would be the net positive impact of this intervention? Would the increased productivity and mood conferred outweigh the costs of the massive electrical usage? I can imagine that it might be the case that simply living somewhere else during the worst parts of the year for people with SAD is better than a 100,000 lumen room, which I assume uses much more electrical power than most rooms.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "rodeo_flagellum"}}, {"_id": "rdkkafDQqgjfYoETN", "postedAt": "2021-11-14T04:14:28.765Z", "postId": "bwhDhZQvbEcG4FEb8", "htmlBody": "<p>How did the electricity blow out once you had 2 100W lamps?
