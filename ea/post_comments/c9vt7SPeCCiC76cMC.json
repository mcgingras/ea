There's an element of making personal sacrifices for the greater good that exists in EA, which doesn't exist in the same way for an academic discipline.

EAs have already made the argument that mental health could be an effective cause area.  If that's true, \"mental health for EAs\" could be a doubly effective cause area.  Beyond the first-order benefit of improving someone's mental health, you can improve someone's mental health in a way that enables them to do good.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "BuT8DG7QtbDoQTDHr", "user": {"username": "chinscratch"}}, {"_id": "7sTbigGyvjgbxAFcy", "postedAt": "2023-09-29T09:00:39.456Z", "postId": "c9vt7SPeCCiC76cMC", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for reaching out and asking how the community can support me during this time.
