Something seeming obvious to oneself isn't premise for its truth. </p>\n<p>If you follow the history of utilitarianism, it is a history of increasing dilution, from the moral naturalism of Bentham's conception of a unified human good psychologically motivating all human action, to Mill's pluralising of that good, to Sidgwick's wholesale rejection of naturalism and value commensurability, and argument that the only register of independent human valuation is mere intuition, to Moore's final reductio of the tradition in Principia Ethica ('morality consists in a non-natural good, whatever I feel it to be, but by the way, aesthetics and interpersonal enjoyment are far and away superior'). Suffice it to say that nearly all utilitarians are intuitionists today, which I honestly can't take seriously as an independent reason for action, and is a standard by which utilitarianism sowed its own death - any and all forms of utilitarianism entail serious counter-intuition.

Note that something similar holds for the internal composition of the movement. That is to say, while the movement might outwardly facilitate value pluralism, internally in organisation and composition, it abides by an almost singular logic. That can be extremely alienating for someone who doesn't share that world-view, like myself.</em></p>\n<p>I don't encounter it as sinister in the slightest. I feel respondents are running away with the possible allusions or intended implications of my post. The EA community is seething with a very particular and on the whole homogeneous identity, a caricature of which might be drawn thus: a rigorous concern with instrumental rationality, with conforming available techniques and resources with given ends; an associated, marked favouring of analytically tractable meads/ends; and an unsophisticated intuitionistic or simply assumed utilitarianism, augmented in a complementary naturalistic world-view. </p>\n<p>There is a whole lot to value there, exemplified well enough in the movement's results. I do find two things alienating, however: the rationalization of the whole human experience, such that one is merely a teleological vessel to the satisfaction of the obvious and absolute good of benefits over costs (which for at least the few 'professional' members of the movement I have encountered, sits squarely alongside neoclassical economic orthodoxy); and the failure to ever talk about or admit human values other than the preferred unit of consequence. </p>\n<p>I should stress immediately, contrary to the sentiment of your (generous) reply, these are largely experiences of individuals. I occasionally find that it contaminates analysis itself: such as in inter-generational comparisons (i.e. FHI's straight-faced contemplation of the value of totalitarianism in guarding against xrisk), or tactical questions of how to best disseminate EA (i.e. again, in caricature: 'say and do whatever most favourably brings about the desired reaction'). But for the most part, it does not make donor-relevant analysis problematic for me.</p>\n<p>I want to say two things then: (i) that I find something problematic in an absolutising rationalization without great reflection; with being highly adept in means, without giving pause to properly consider ends. (ii) with the dominance this tendency has internal to the movement. (i) is a question of personal world-view adequacy, (ii) is one of organisational adequacy. Obviously I don't expect those affirming (i) or its cognates to agree, but I do think (ii) has significance regardless of whether one observes or rejects it. Namely, for the idea, suggested in this thread, that the movement can both present itself as only attempting to satisfy an important subset of possible moral values, while being internally monological. You might readily accept this, but it is consequential for the limits of the movement's membership at least.</p>\n<p>*to repeat thrice for want to avoid misunderstanding and too heavy a flurry of down-votes, I readily admit that the study of maximising favoured consequences is of ecumenical interest, and is sufficient in itself to warrant its organisational study.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "mT2DuDLPsN8Tv68DT", "user": {"username": "Geuss"}}, {"_id": "6ScY7n26totEjmXNG", "postedAt": "2014-09-17T00:32:02.192Z", "postId": "4Pek6aKbEoXSZvNFT", "htmlBody": "<p>In modern discourse, varieties of consequentialism and utilitarianism have family resemblance sufficient to warrant their interchange in utterance, in my opinion.

Moreover, if you look at the normative books achieving most (top 15) citations in post-war Anglophone philosophy, utilitarianism is absent: Rawls' A Theory of Justice (26,768), Dworkin's Taking Rights Seriously (7,892), MacIntyre's After Virtue (6,579), Rawls' Political Liberalism (6,352), Nozick's Anarchy, State, and Utopia (6,246). The first possible utilitarian is all the way down at 30, at Parfit's Reasons and Persons, with just 2,972 citations (which no one would ever call utilitarian, and which is only very partially ethically concerned at that). That is to say, liberal egalitarianism (Rawls seconded by Dworkin) is completely dominant, with Aristotelianism (MacIntyre) and libertarianism (Nozick) trailing. Of course, most citations of MacIntyre probably affirm his positive argument of the failure of the Enlightenment project, and reject his substitute reversion to Aristotelianism. In that sense, it might even be a two-horse race (although, again, it's not really a race: liberal egalitarianism boasts over 40,000 citations between the three works above, libertarianism just 6,000). I should also add that the other lead works are not favourable to the whole enterprise of ethics: Wittgenstein, Rorty, Kuhn and so forth.

I think it's important that people who are not utilitarian can enter effective altruist circles and participate in discussions. I think it also might be good for effective altruists to pull back from their utilitarian frame of analysis and take a more global view of how their proposals (e.g. totalitarianism as a reducer of x-risk) might be perceived from a broader value system, if for no reason other than ensuring their research remainsbof wider societal interest.

Why Does Effective Altruism Neglect Ant-Aging?</strong></p>\n<p>Anti-aging doesn't seem very tractable on its face, but neither does existential risk reduction. Despite both being causes within emphasized by rationalists and transhumanists,  anti-aging has been left outside of effective altruism thus far. I believe this is because the rationalist community as a precursor to effective altruism better coordinated their concern over existential risk better than their concern over anti-aging efforts.</p>\n<p>Like, through Less Wrong, and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, (almost) every existential risk reduction organization got in touch with another. This formed a solid voice advocating for this cause when effective altruism started. On the other hand, Aubrey de Grey and his organization, SENS, seem like the only one(s) in contact with effective altruism, while the rest of the major anti-aging advocates run their organizations out of touch with us, and each other.</p>\n<p>Another thing about ant-aging is that while it on its own may seem like a worthy intervention, it often gets lumped with cryonics, and other transhumanist technologies, that seem even less tractable than anti-aging research. That is, those aspects are frequently dismissed by rationalist, let alone effective altruists. So, if the most vocal advocates for anti-aging research only communicate that signal with a bunch of noise, effective altruists may be less likely to consider it.</p>\n<p>This seems like a historical contingency to me, based on how the rationalist community organized itself with some circles but not others. This makes possible but by no means definite that the rationalist community has not emphasized anti-aging enough within effective altruism, relative to existential risk reduction.</p>\n<p><strong>II. Why Does Effective Altruism Neglect (Better) Policy Advocacy?</strong></p>\n<p>This also seems to be due in part to historical contingency. First of all, there is the wariness among the rationalist community that delving into the trenches of politics will be much less tractable than aiding the world through other means. I believe I mildly perceive the same strain of thinking as an undercurrent of utilitarians such as Toby Ord, or Peter Singer. </p>\n<p>Also, Givewell thought it much more difficult to assess policy advocacy when measuring impact qualifications for it was much more difficult. In other words, Givewell wanted to cut their teeth, and gain experience, in an area more measurable than policy advocacy. Before, like other charity evaluators they were giving recommendations to individual donors. Now, with Good Ventures, they're giving recommendations for foundations, with much more money.</p>\n<p>In conversation with my friend Joey Savoie a few weeks ago, we discussed maybe Givewell is exploring policy advocacy through the Open Philanthropy Project now because noticeable gains in policy change can only be affected with large investments, and it's only now with Good Ventures that Givewell has an ally with sufficient weight to get that happening.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "7PmorA6uDxnBKR97e", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "QkSr6AsFXEPm9dYGz", "postedAt": "2014-09-17T04:31:37.459Z", "postId": "4Pek6aKbEoXSZvNFT", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Why Have Effective Altruists Neglected Interfacing With Religion?</strong></p>\n<p>What's great about religion is that it's full of the altruism, but it's unknown how religion considers effectiveness. I by no means mean that religions are inherently opposed to effectiveness, or even indifferent to it. Religion has played a fundamental role in institutionalizing the very idea of charity. Religiously oriented charities individually run the gamut from effective to ineffective, and I believe that's more due to the individual organization rather than the religion in question itself. Indeed, it's the history of trying new charitable interventions inspired by religion that has given humanity a starting place to think about the effectiveness of altruism in the first place.</p>\n<p>Historically, religion has implemented altruism without always thinking in terms of effectiveness, because the body of strategies composing effectiveness as an idea was abstract and unknown.

It seems Ms. Salamon would prefer effective altruism be 'thick' rather than 'thin', although pertaining to lifestyle strategies more than principled commitments.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Geoff Anders of Leverage Research seemed to prefer an approach between those of MacAskill and Salamon, though I found his position somewhat inscrutable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Personally, I agree with Anna Salamon the most, as it seems appropriately conservative, though I'll be excited to see MacAskill, or Anders, proven correct. The plans presented at the effective altruism summit were about what effective altruism might do in the near-term, i.e., next year or two. In the long-term, I believe &quot;slicing effective altruism into competing ways of thick and thin&quot; will be the best approach.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "be78B7Hg2J9zXb2w2", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "EfzKryFXJhbNWBJoi", "postedAt": "2014-09-17T05:03:58.886Z", "postId": "4Pek6aKbEoXSZvNFT", "htmlBody": "<p>Vipul, I believe this discussion will happen at a wider, better scale if its given a post in its own right.

I'm also concerned that whoever bears such power may liable to abusing it. Quieting voices by accusing their owners of being 'radical', or 'crazy' is a stigmatizing and accusatory label. Even if abuse is only perceived rather than real, this could lead to individuals, or organizations, drawing battle lines over who is qualified to represent effective altruism. Accusations of abuses of power can also be stigmatizing, and can be skewed easily.</p>\n<p>Here are my suggestions for avoiding your original worry, Pablo, and preventing (accusations of) abuse of power:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>If we indeed believe that it is how an idea is being represented, rather than the idea, or the representing party, that is inadequate, we can make this explicit, so that critical feedback isn't perceived as a (personal) attack.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If somebody tried establishing a center for effective altruism PR, I expect it would be the CEA, or its new project, Effective Altruism Outreach. In any case, whichever organization stakes that position needs to have lots of integrity. Not only is espousing transparency, impartiality, and integrity the right thing to do, cooperating as such can foster trust within the community that that organization is reliable. So, accusations that such a group is overstepping its unduly censoring someone will be less debilitating, and can be gauged on their merits.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Whatever part of the movement takes the responsibility to manage how ideas are represented should acknowledge their own mistakes, and biases, have some sort of oversight, and welcome feedback from the whole movement on why their actions take place. Ideally, I'd like to see such an organization being as transparent as Givewell. However, I understand if such bureaucracy would be crippling to a lean organization with sparse resources to spend.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Prioritizing outreach activities is a good idea by itself, but I believe another discussion will need to cover how valuable effective altruists believe that is relative to our current endeavors. I respect how William MacAskill, and the Centre for Effective Altruism, have handled media requests and outreach in the last year, and I hope however they're doing it keeps working as they expand their efforts.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If an individual (re)presents effective altruism well, but is celebrated, or better known, for associating with something much more controversial, I'm not confident in how that should be handled. To use an extreme example, I don't want effective altruism to be most associated with baby-eating terrorists. However, if someone is well-known as being of a sexual minority, or a transhumanist, or an atheist, I don't feel comfortable with us telling that person to express that identity less. I might be comfortable with someone very politely asking them to express themselves <em>a bit differently</em>, with less of an edge of fueling outrage. However, that doesn't seem necessary if in reality that identity is benign and non-threatening, as I believe will most likely be the case.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n", "parentCommentId": "3vn4SpEzJWSgnKRfJ", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "XivJaJYLkzMy3madc", "postedAt": "2014-09-17T06:09:40.120Z", "postId": "4Pek6aKbEoXSZvNFT", "htmlBody": "<p>Personally, I believe I <em>know</em> a whole community which <em>collectively</em> knows how to use resources <em>(much) better than average</em>, and at a larger/leveraged scale, if not for the whole world.

That is, humans have at least somewhat of a natural tendency towards privileging their own ideas for doing good as the best. Since effectiveness isn't emphasized in most altruism, I believe most people don't think their own approaches are 'literally the best', so much as naively thinking they're just 'very very good'.</p>\n<p>If one individual is the only one to express their disagreement with some form of charity, especially if it's represented by a big movement, they're likely to be lambasted ad hominem. So, there's a disincentive for publicly criticizing charity, even for correct opinions widely held in secret. </p>\n<p><em>Promoting doing 'the most good' requires courage but has drawbacks.</em></p>\n<p>In an civil and media environment when criticizing charitable endeavors is controversial, claiming to (try to) do the best may be taboo. I believe effective altruists have thought about what to do more than most others and, I don't believe we're missing out on some hidden heuristic for philanthropy that works really well for everyone else. People identify with the good they do, so they may get defensive. When pressed, we admit we don't claim absolute confidence in our evaluations, that we seek to change our own minds, and that we're merely <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2011/11/estimation-is-the-best-we-have/\">doing the best we can</a>.</p>\n<p>Putting up the stronger front of advocacy that is trying to literally be the best comes at the cost of (apparently) having hubris.

However, continually normalizing critical thinking, openness to (self-)criticism, and <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/gq/the_proper_use_of_humility/\">the proper use of humility</a> mitigates this. In particular, being a self-critical movement includes effective altruists criticizing ideas of other effective altruists as they're newly presented. I've observed even on Facebook effective altruists of all stripes are quick to neutralize cocky people, who tend to bring arguments that aren't as well thought-out.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "rEdhGBpmtoH8kQqKa", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "ATkAjgxGvWE7ZAoWh", "postedAt": "2014-09-17T10:32:46.343Z", "postId": "4Pek6aKbEoXSZvNFT", "htmlBody": "<p>To specify what you mean, I believe the important idea is a question: how can we use replaceability to measure the impact (or expected value) of social change? </p>\n<p>I believe traction can be made towards solving this problem, but I still believe it will be difficult. I notice that you use the historical example of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s activism, but you want to measure social impact in the present, or for the future. However, I notice that I can't recall reading about anyone, effective altruists or otherwise, ever measuring the impact of social change in the past. Like, we take Martin Luther King, Jr.'s success for granted, even though we haven't tried quantifying it at all. We could then try comparing King's success to other activist strategies: those which worked well, and others less so. </p>\n<p>In measuring the impact of historical efforts, we are measuring in a field where we have access to all the measurable data. So, that makes studying history good practice grounds for figuring out what to look for in estimating social impact in the future.</p>\n<p>Here's some suggestions for doing that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>One can learn <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/i8n/how_to_measure_anything/\">how to measure anything</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.ampres.com.mx/pdf/How%20to%20Measure%20Anything%20Finding%20the%20Value%20of%20Intangibles%20in%20Business.PDF\">practice for free</a>, which should help in measuring something as abstract as the impact of social change. I believe trying to measure other intangibles as practice a bit will give one experience to gauge how to measure the impact of social change. From there, realizing getting some kind, <em>any kind</em> of metric(s) placed on what you're trying to measure in social change is better than having no metric(s).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>One can also study Givewell's <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/history-of-philanthropy\">History of Philanthropy Project</a> to get a sense of how they determined which historical points were worth considering. Then, you can try replicating it a bit in studying the history of social change. Note that Givewell's project focuses upon the history of philanthropy in the United States, which might be a narrower and simpler section to assess than the history of social change.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In regards to determining where to start with at a point in history, asking some historians, and the community, what heuristics they would use could help. Givewell itself hired some actual historians.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The guide <em>How To Measure Anything</em> may give some ideas, but I believe the metric you'll be developing for social impact will be more similar to metrics used in global studies or reports from the WHO, or other NGOs, or in charity evaluation. Perhaps review the field of sociology for any ideas it has for measuring social change.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is a framework for figuring out how to measure the impact that we must create for ourselves. Frankly, the idea of replaceability, let measurement, in social change might be rare enough that we might be the first ones to put that method together.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "6np9pnqikdQR3KZPM", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "9ivMCudS6mZZ968Aq", "postedAt": "2014-09-17T10:50:17.139Z", "postId": "4Pek6aKbEoXSZvNFT", "htmlBody": "<p>To answer your object-level question, I believe that something resembling the idea of &quot;Replaceability of Social Change&quot; would enter our minds eventually.

Additionally, groups like the Open Philanthropy Project are pushing forward the idea of assessing political change.

The same could be done for large religious charities such as Red Cross, Red Crescent, or World Vision. One problem I foresee is that some religious charities may be more devout, zealous, or dogmatic about the work they're doing.

To encourage greater giving a broad based genuine community needs to be created that makes greater giving normal.   That there is an academic core is great, but that won't be for many people.

My impression is a lot of EAs are like this - they don't think they're in a better position to figure out the most effective ways of doing good than others, but given that most other people aren't thinking about this, they may as well try.</p>\n<p>I'm less sure about (2), and it depends what the comparison is - are we asking, &quot;Is the average person who is attracted to EA more likely to be arrogant than the average person who is interested in altruism in a broader sense?&quot;. It seems plausible that of all the people who are interested in altruism, those who are more arrogant are more likely to be drawn to effective altruism than other forms of altruism. But I'm not sure that EAs are on the whole more arrogant than people who promote other altruistic cause areas - in a way, EAs seem less arrogant to me because they are more willing to accept that they might be wrong, and less dogmatic in asserting that their specific cause is the most important one.</p>\n<p>There's a third question which I think is also important: is EA more likely to be perceived as arrogant from the outside than other similar social movements or specific causes? I think here there is a risk - stating that you are trying to figure out the best thing can certainly <em>sound</em> arrogant to someone else (even though, as I said above, it actually seems less arrogant to me than being dogmatic about a specific cause!) So maybe it's important for us to think about how to present EA in ways that doesn't come across as arrogant. One idea would be to talk more about ourselves as &quot;aspiring&quot; effective altruists that as simply effective altruists - we're not trying to claim that we're better at altruism than everyone else really, but rather that we are trying to figure out what the best way is.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "rEdhGBpmtoH8kQqKa", "user": {"username": "Jess_Whittlestone"}}, {"_id": "wfaYaspLDkaTPkQe6", "postedAt": "2014-09-18T19:38:03.246Z", "postId": "4Pek6aKbEoXSZvNFT", "htmlBody": "<p>My opinion was that anti-aging and existential risk seem roughly equally neglected and roughly equally tractable, but existential risk seems a whole lot more valuable, so hence the focus on that instead.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "igAzDDuyyZXiXdZZz", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hurford"}}, {"_id": "w4KESqkDjKzbquP92", "postedAt": "2014-09-18T19:38:40.319Z", "postId": "4Pek6aKbEoXSZvNFT", "htmlBody": "<p>I thought the EA Facebook group was going to play &quot;LW Discussion&quot; to the EA Forum's &quot;LW Main&quot;.

This would drastically reduce the overall importance of existential risk reduction. One way in which TEV would hold, or an argument for views in that family, comes from considering the set of all possible human minds, and noticing that many considerations, both probabilistic and moral, stop being intuitive when deciding whether to pluck out one of these infinitesimally small entity from non-existence to existence is actually a good deal. No matter what we do, most minds will never exist. </p>\n<p>Depending on how we carve the conceptual distinction that determines a mind, we could get even lower orders of probability of existence for any given mind. Furthermore, if being of a different type (in the philosophical 'type' 'token' distinction) than something that has already existed is not a relevant distinction, the argument gets even easier: for each possible token of mind, that token will most likely never live with overwhelming chance. </p>\n<p>If there are infinitesimally small differences between minds then there are at least Aleph1 non-existent minds, and Aleph2 non-existent mind tokens.</p>\n<p>These infinities seem to point to some sort of asymmetric view, in which there is some form of affiliation with existence that is indeed correlated with being valuable. It may not be as straighforward as &quot;only living minds matter&quot;, or even *The Tricky Expectation View&quot; but something in that vicinity. Some sort of discount rate that is fully justified, even in the face of astronomical waste, moral uncertainty etc. This would be one angle of attack. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "Cdm6SmMGr8dpLvse5", "user": {"username": "Diego_Caleiro"}}, {"_id": "K2Wj4rQjCzS727o4M", "postedAt": "2014-09-19T06:31:43.353Z", "postId": "4Pek6aKbEoXSZvNFT", "htmlBody": "<p>In conversation with Rolandas, we wondered whether there are enough EAs learning programming to justify creating a dedicated Facebook or Google group.

Because if so, it seems to me that spreading effective altruism as an idea throughout such countries by getting donors to support their own country might counteract spreading cosmopolitanism.</p>\n<p>Most Second World nations probably wouldn't have the most effective interventions at helping humans, you're right. But look at India and China, both countries have hundreds of millions in extreme poverty as well as millions of people with money to spend. I would think that having an EA organization in each of those countries that evaluated domestic charities, gave talks at universities, and sought out and promoted people earning to give to the media, would have a huge impact. Development expert Mal Warwick estimates there are 5 million organizations in the world helping the poor, mostly in the poor countries themselves, so the odds of India and China each having extremely effective charities would be very high in my estimation. And that's not to mention that people in those countries can also donate to INGOs with operations in their own country. (I know both these countries already have charity evaluators but I haven't been able to find out whether they are GiveWell or Charity Navigator types. The Indian one has an English website but it is currently down.)</p>\n<p>**I believe the very wealth and prosperity in nations which allows those nations to be more altruistic may be also the same forces which generate consumerist preferences in those nations. So, on a society-wide scale, spreading minimalist values might be on uphill battle. </p>\n<p>I don't think minimalism would be received as weirder than being a serious EtGing, so it doesn't make sense to me to write it off so quickly. There are already minimalist blogs with hundreds of thousands of unique monthly visitors \u2013 maybe if CEA gets in touch with them they will like EA and promote it on their blogs, in their books, and so on. The people reading minimalist books and websites would be more open to EA than the general public, I would presume. Also, an EA could make a minimalist website that focuses on minimalism with the odd mention of EA/EtG so as to get visitors that find the simple life interesting but don't like to be preached to about donating more.</p>\n<p>**Thus, even if this is the case for a large religious charity which holds lots of potential for leveraged impact, it may be impracticable to convince them to change their tactics.</p>\n<p>Institutions in general are very slow to change, especially large ones, but I think that the non-profit sector can only ignore evidence-based interventions and effectiveness evaluation for so long. It's like with the environmental movement. In the 90's, environmentalism wasn't as big, but in the 2000's the public's expectations have changed and now most companies have to at least claim they are sustainable just to stay relevant. </p>\n<p>**To affect religious people, it might take religious effective altruists. </p>\n<p>I think the only way EA will grow among a religion is if people see others in their religion doing it. A trickle will grow into a stream. I don't think EA has any true weaknesses, I really believe that (as a philosophy, not as a movement), so it seems like just a matter of time before religious people start earning to give, donating more based on evidence, etc. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "p2X4hjko9fCtgwnc5", "user": {"username": "Austen_Forrester"}}, {"_id": "Na4z5yEEsFYqkcEj5", "postedAt": "2014-09-19T12:25:43.132Z", "postId": "4Pek6aKbEoXSZvNFT", "htmlBody": "<p>I feel like a lot of potential is lost if we don't encourage asking questions and making smaller contributions (like on fb and the open thread) on the forum.

It seems unlikely that developing nations are the best location for this kind of idea to gain a critical mass of support.

Why Does Effective Altruism Neglect (Better) Policy Advocacy?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not sure that this is necessarily the case among EA orgs with full-time staff.  The Centre for Effective Altruism (in particular the Global Priorities Project, which is our collaboration with FHI), The Open Philanthropy Project and the Cambridge Centre on Existential Risk are putting considerable effort into policy work.  For example, I and others at CEA put the majority of our time over the past week into policy research, and our trustees were at a meeting at No. 10 Downing Street yesterday.  I have written up some of my thoughts on our early policy work at <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/7e/good_policy_ideas_that_wont_happen_yet/\">http://effective-altruism.com/ea/7e/good_policy_ideas_that_wont_happen_yet/</a></p>\n<p>I think that there are a few effects going on here which cause policy to appear under-neglected among the community at large...</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>There is a relatively larger barrier to entry in policy work (compared to e.g. making a donation to a GiveWell recommendation), which means that policy work is often done by people working in this area full-time, or who have past experience in the area.  This may be one of the reasons why the community at large isn't doing more policy analysis.  I think it would be useful if the EA community did do more policy analysis, in particular making recommendations of policies that could feasibly happen (i.e. tweak this thing, not ban agriculture subsidies) and doing analyses of the type I outline in my post above (e.g. what are the benefits, what are the costs, who will be in favour, who will be against, how can we change the policy to make it more feasible while retaining most of the benefits, how would we actually make this change, and who do we ultimately need to convince about this to make it happen, etc.).  I for one would find this useful in informing the work that I do in this area, and if the ideas are good enough they would likely be taken forwards.  </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Policy work is often under-publicised unless there are major breakthroughs.

Essentially, we could build a map with basic facts at first, and add more to it, making it richer, as the data we'd be looking for becomes more accessible. Here's my rationale for what's out:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>hierarchy</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Effective altruist organizations have tended to have small(er) teams of staff, with only one, or two, executives. A link from the map to the staff page of an organization's website would suffice for transparency, since there are so few levels of hierarchy in the first place.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>members</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some effective altruist organizations have a membership base numbering in the hundreds, such as 80,000 Hours, The Life You Can Save, and the Center for Applied Rationality. So, listing all the members would be impractical. Also, I believe it would be too difficult to negotiate getting all the data one might want without betraying the privacy of the users.</p>\n<p>Effective altruism is not nearly centralized enough for an official organization to coordinate this. The work would likely fall on .impact, which is already swamped with projects. The good news is that a one or more eager people is all it takes to get the ball rolling by working on their own projects they propose to .impact. The major investment would be time, and personal effort. It might be more difficult to get large sums of money for making this map, but there are some effective altruists who provide minor funds to individual effective altruist projects.</p>\n<p>To start off with, I believe the map could be broken down into the four categories of organizations I delineated below, and the map could conceptually show relationships between them. For each organization, we would have a link to their mission statement, or about page, a link to their staff page, a blurb about their major accomplishments, and a blurb about their current work.</p>\n<p>Not all effective altruist organizations have optimally organized, or publicly available information about:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>funding</li>\n<li>room for more funding</li>\n<li>potential scale/scope of impact with some general metric, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would like to see effective altruist organizations publish this sort of material, but coordinating them all to do so would be a separate task from getting that information up on the map.</p>\n<p>It's good you asked this question, because it forced me to think about what's feasible, and what's not.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "y3PuN7rSCyAdnxx6Y", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "obi8mF8dWFig8ggWw", "postedAt": "2014-09-21T06:26:54.559Z", "postId": "4Pek6aKbEoXSZvNFT", "htmlBody": "<p>Peter Hurford, and Ozzie Gooen, coordinate .impact, so I believe they might be the best people to ask about an estimate about how many effective altruists are learning programming interactively with others.

For the purposes of answering this question, don't limit yourself to thinking about being a charity angel to only intellectuals, as Robin Hanson primed for discussion in his original post. Please think broadly about what being a charity angel could be for whatever effective altruistic endeavor you might have in mind, and whether it would be worthwhile.</p>\n<p>I believe the most relevant previous thought is one concern raised by Holden Karnofsky on the original post.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The points above are assuming that &quot;charity angel&quot; activity is to be undertaken in a fairly small-scale, irregular way. Visible, regular rewards for good works may work well, especially if they were predictable enough to allow people to borrow the needed resources against the hope of these rewards. Therefore, if you saw an opportunity to promote this idea in a big way and turn it into something visible and regular, I'd be more supportive of that; I think it is a poor idea for scattered individuals trying to accomplish as much good as possible with 3-6 figure donations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Effective altruism doesn't have a great enough stake in any charity market for it to be able to make a signal that wouldn't be drowned out by the noise the rest of any philanthropy charity makes. That is, effective altruism doesn't seem to have enough capital of any sort to incentivize effectiveness in charity on a massive scale, that wouldn't be drowned out by all the other grants, and prizes, out there. Nobody is going to care about the 'effective altruism prize' when attention is being drawn to all the other ones.</p>\n<p>However, existing effective altruist organizations don't necessarily believe that the biggest impact must be made by making the biggest media splash in a non-profit sector. Effective altruist organizations such as 80,000 Hours, the Global Priorities Project, the MIRI, and Leverage Research are trying to produce new research that could be applied, and leveraged, for greater magnitude later. If an organization needs a proposed solution to a problem they're tackling, but cannot figure it out for themselves, and are unable to acquire the talent who could do it for them, perhaps they could offer a prize incentivizing someone to produce responses.</p>\n<p>I know that 80,000 Hours, and the CFAR, each have hundreds of members, and the membership of each of those organizations is poised to grow in the future. Those might be good channels for advertising a charity prize, then, especially because they'll be directly broadcasted to audiences that are already part of effective altruism.</p>\n<p>Any other thoughts on this?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "5NHjhbmA6ncpmYQgn", "postedAt": "2016-12-25T20:36:24.833Z", "postId": "4Pek6aKbEoXSZvNFT", "htmlBody": "<p>I'd like to propose a web application targeted specifically to donors that captures recurring payments for an EA meta-charity and helps them manage the donation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Easily capture monthly, automatic donations based on some simple donor budgeting with a very streamlined, elegant onboarding process</li>\n<li>Funnel these payments to something like the GiveWell fund</li>\n<li><p>Let the donor easily view sum total donations over time, view some simple budgeting, tweak their commitment, manage their payment method, and do tax accounting/reporting.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I think this movement should have a website dedicated solely to onboarding new donors to commit to recurring donations to an EA fund with a user experience that could be comparable to something like Slack. I like the idea of removing the need for the irrational and sporadic decision-making process involved in traditional online giving, and instead deferring to experts and reducing the decision to a single, enlightened commitment. I think the more neutral branding of something like GiveWell should be used.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I am certainly not qualified to create a fund or pick and choose what to give to, so would want to use something like GiveWell (I am also aware of Giving What We Can). My only concern is that GiveWell is relatively narrow in scope so far. I understand this is for good reasons, but opening up to a wider range of causes could lead to massively greater donation volume. The question is whether this increased volume could have a much greater altruistic impact over time, if only because it would warm people up to the idea of committed altruism at a much larger scale. But I am definitely willing to suspend this concern in favor of getting the site implemented.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Abstracting the donation process could be very convenient. I think it is a barrier to ask people to click through and allot funds to multiple orgs via multiple sites and donation processes, and have to gather and organize receipts themselves. I simply think that streamlining all this into a single UX could be a big selling point.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I am myself a web developer, and I think I could build this out fairly quickly, depending on how payments get processed. I want it to be a purely altruistic venture and would need no compensation. I've built up a fairly large fundraising infrastructure startup already and have a fair amount of direct experience in these types of apps (I don't want to list that company here as I don't want to distract the discussion, and I want this project to be purely altruistic, totally disconnected to any startup ventures).</p>\n<p>If there is another project already with these explicit goals, let me know. Otherwise, I'd love to hear any feature requests or concerns around the idea from fellow donors. After some validation, I will go ahead and build an 'MVP' of the website sans payment processing and design, and then will try to get in touch with GiveWell or another metacharity for actually processing the funds and working the branding and copy.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "jayrbolton"}}, {"_id": "CgS5sfn3my8dcL8n2", "postedAt": "2022-06-21T08:11:27.085Z", "postId": "4Pek6aKbEoXSZvNFT", "htmlBody": "<p>Check this out: https://www.eaforchristians.org/</p>", "parentCommentId": "guogtGpGt82FSNNgA", "user": {"username": "technicalities"}}]
