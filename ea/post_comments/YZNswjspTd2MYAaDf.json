Have you done case studies of how people have approached restaurants, developed dishes, managed launch and press? E.g. with the restaurants serving cultivated meat in Singapore. There is almost certainly a handbook on how to get your product into restaurants. I know a bit about getting products into supermarkets.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>East Asians LOVE a food trend. These trends tend to stay within the community though, bubble tea/boba is an exception. But possibly with deliberate marketing there can be some positive impact of targeting Asians in the US?\n(I say this as someone of East Asian ethnicity)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Disagree with this bit -- 'I don\u2019t think cultural appropriation is as big an issue in food as other spaces of society. No one boycotts Thai food for using American chilies, or Mexican food for using European wheat flour tortillas, even though those ingredients originally came from a different culture.'</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>First of all nobody is boycotting these in the US context because they are global South / majority cultures using Western ingredients.</p>\n<p>Second of all, I don't think there is a moral difference between cultural appropriation of food vs. clothes, spiritual practice, language. I think the appropriation of food is less 'condemned' because it's harder for an individual to avoid it if they're eating at restaurants, following recipes written by Americans, etc. And people are less likely to see something as wrong if they are participants.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>The food pics look absolutely delicious and fascinating and I wish I still had some of your tofu in my freezer!</li>\n</ol>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "clairey"}}, {"_id": "phEQpbZB96SKfxLyL", "postedAt": "2022-10-21T01:31:59.027Z", "postId": "YZNswjspTd2MYAaDf", "htmlBody": "<p>I wouldn\u2019t be worried about Chinese Americans being too familiar with rare Chinese Tofu  varieties, simply cause China is a large culturally diverse place  and most Chinese-Americans are from The south eastern Cantonese speaking regions ,</p>\n<p>As an English speaking Vegan on the internet I\u2019ve noticed and increased interest in \u201c tofus\u201d made with other legumes, like peanuts or black beans, I think there is value in having substitutes available for a common allergen, and wonder If you could market \u201c black bean  tofu\u201d at a Mexican restaurant as something new and trendy and that \u201cfits the restaurant\u201d even If it\u2019s still standard firm tofu.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Vgvt"}}, {"_id": "wJBZp3yZfhNEcAE4J", "postedAt": "2022-10-21T05:50:23.136Z", "postId": "YZNswjspTd2MYAaDf", "htmlBody": "<p>Off the top of my head, <a href=\"https://www.jennydorsey.co/\">Jenny Dorsey</a> is a Chinese-American chef who's written several cookbooks and other writings about cooking.
