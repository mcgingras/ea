Their four human capital variables, described in section 4.3.3, seem to be the following: 1. number of people in management roles, 2. number of management roles held by the president, 3. number of prior startups which the founder was president of, 4. number of roles at other companies currently held by president.</p>\n<p>I'm not too surprised that these factors had limited predictive ability, or that their sign was mixed.

In any domain with principal agent problems, you expect the principal to pay the agent a fraction of the output, i.e. for the agent to retain equity. In fact, financial theory suggests that startup founders should take more equity when performance was more dependent on their behavior / skill, and should take less equity when performance is more out of their control.
