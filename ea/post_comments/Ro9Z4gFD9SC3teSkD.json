This is despite the fact that I know many people in the movement who seem like they would be quite good candidates. I\u2019m wondering if this is because the earning-to-give meme has propagated so strongly that everyone decides they would rather earn money and fund someone else working there, and then they don\u2019t apply, leading to a shortage of qualified applicants. At any rate, few enough people have the required skills and attitudes to work at e.g. GiveWell, Giving What We Can or 80,000 Hours that it seems pretty non-replaceable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "John_Maxwell_IV"}}]
