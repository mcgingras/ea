The answers to your question probably differ quite a bit programme to programme. But here are a few thoughts that seemed relevant to me:</p><p>On web:</p><ul><li>Over the past couple of years, the biggest predictor of change in web engagement time appears to be changes in our marketing spending.&nbsp; In 2022 we substantially increased our marketing spend.&nbsp; In 2023 our marketing spend was not dramatically larger than in 2022.&nbsp; This is reflected in the web engagement time metrics.&nbsp; (We are actively investigating the cost-effectiveness of marginal marketing spending, and are not fundraising for marketing as part of this public fundraising round as it is already being covered by Open Philanthropy.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>We have also put more effort into driving off-site engagement time in 2023, e.g. via our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzyEgZwfkKY\"><u>AI video</u></a>, improvements to our newsletter, etc.&nbsp; This is not included in the engagement time metrics in the chart, but we estimate that in 2023 we grew off-site engagement time notably more than we did on-site engagement time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>On podcast:</p><ul><li>The drivers of engagement with the podcast are more mysterious to me, and I have trouble making accurate predictions of future engagement time with the podcast.&nbsp; Viewed on a quarterly basis, growth in the podcast appears to be healthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/3JGLupXPMKuyhcsWn/wh6goeyexqkv0ln0d5cm\"></li></ul><p><br>On advising:</p><ul><li>In 2023 we focused more on growing and systematising headhunting, active outreach and systems, and relatively less on increasing call numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>We didn't make as many calls as we had hoped to, due in part to a manager on the team leaving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>We also put relatively more focus on improving call quality, for example by putting in place feedback systems. This was a focus because we grew the team in 2021 and 2022 and wanted more systems to keep everyone in sync and ensure continued quality.</li></ul><p>On job board:</p><ul><li>We've actually reduced our FTE input into the job board in 2023, but we are still seeing solid quarter-on-quarter growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Additional points:</p><ul><li>Some of our staff growth came from hires to our internal systems team, which should strengthen our capacity over time but won\u2019t result in direct improvements on these metrics.</li><li>We do expect some diminishing returns to staff growth over time.&nbsp; I'll address this in another comment on this thread.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": "HcsuFwjGak32fLKgy", "user": {"username": "Niel_Bowerman"}}, {"_id": "6xyLsLbZmbWiC5Cnm", "postedAt": "2023-12-19T22:16:49.555Z", "postId": "4ebRNGi3aHWnCw5m8", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for engaging with this post! &nbsp; A few thoughts prompted by your comment in case they are helpful:</p><ul><li>80k has been interested in longtermism-related causes for many years, including many years in which we\u2019ve seen a lot of growth.&nbsp; We were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2013/08/how-important-are-future-generations/\"><u>interested in longtermism</u></a> for several years before we received our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/80000-hours-general-support/\"><u>first grant</u></a> from Open Philanthropy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>We believe there\u2019s still a lot of need for talent in the problems areas that we focus on, so we don\u2019t think there\u2019s a strong reason for us to shift our focus on that front \u2014 at least for the time being.&nbsp;</li><li>In evaluating our impact, you should consider whether the causes where we focus seem most pressing to you. If you think <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/#most-pressing-world-problems\">our focus areas</a> are not that pressing, we think it\u2019s reasonable to be less interested in donating to us.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ay42LLjQDjkTpnaMJ/80k-would-be-happy-to-see-more-projects-in-the-careers-space\"><u>We\u2019re happy</u></a> to see others offering alternatives to our career advice \u2014 this kind of competition is healthy and we are keen to encourage it in the ecosystem.</li><li>All that said, we do have a lot of advice to people who are not that interested in longtermism.
