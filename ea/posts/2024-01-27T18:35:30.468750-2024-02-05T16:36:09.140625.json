Stopping where we are today would still lead to continued problems with mass disinformation assisted by generative AI, and we'll see continued progress towards automation of huge parts of modern work even without more capable systems as the systems which exist are deployed in new ways. It also seems vanishingly unlikely that the pressures on middle class jobs, artists, and writers will decrease even if we rolled back the last 5 years of progress in AI - but we wouldn't have the accompanying productivity gains which could be used to pay for UBI or other programs. &nbsp;</p><p>All of that said, the perils of stasis aren't necessarily greater than those of progress. &nbsp;This is not a question of safety versus risk, it is a risk-risk tradeoff.

Private Member\u2019s Bills are bills by backbench MPs or Peers and do not have a high success rate of succeeding. An earlier AI bill called the <a href=\"https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3464\">Artificial Intelligence (Regulation and Workers\u2019 Rights) Bill </a>failed before the first reading earlier last year. However, it is worth looking at such regulation as it is proposed in order to get an idea of what kind of legislation is coming over the horizon. AI Regulation is also an idea which Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has approved of in the media, which slightly increases the chances of success of this Bill making it further than its predecessor.</p><p>It is a short Bill, with only 7 pages and 9 sections. Its primary intent is to establish a central \u2018AI Authority\u2019, though it does explore other regulatory matters. It appears to intend to be a framework for further regulation rather than a fix-all in itself, but is still a standalone piece of legislation at this time.</p><p>Due to limited Forum formatting options for this kind of post, I advise reading the Bill at source - however it is included here in its entirety split into quotes for those wanting to stay in one window.

The AI Authority</strong></i></h3><p><br><i>\u201c(1) The Secretary of State must by regulations make provision to create a body called the AI Authority.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(2) The functions of the AI Authority are to\u2014&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(a) ensure that relevant regulators take account of AI;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(b) ensure alignment of approach across relevant regulators in respect of AI;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(c) undertake a gap analysis of regulatory responsibilities in respect of AI;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(d) coordinate a review of relevant legislation, including product safety, privacy and consumer protection, to assess its suitability to address the challenges and opportunities presented by AI;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(e) monitor and evaluate the overall regulatory framework\u2019s effectiveness and the implementation of the principles in section 2, including the extent to which they support innovation;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(f) assess and monitor risks across the economy arising from AI;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(g) conduct horizon-scanning, including by consulting the AI industry, to inform a coherent response to emerging AI technology trends;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(h) support testbeds and sandbox initiatives (see section 3) to help AI innovators get new technologies to market;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(i) accredit independent AI auditors (see section 5(1)(a)(iv));&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(j) provide education and awareness to give clarity to businesses and to empower individuals to express views as part of the iteration of the framework;</i></p><p><i>(k) promote interoperability with international regulatory frameworks.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(3) The Secretary of State may by regulations amend the functions in subsection (2), and may dissolve the AI Authority, following consultation with such persons as he or she considers appropriate.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This section is the flagship section of the legislation, being focused on the formation of an AI Authority. One of the major issues here is insufficient detail on the scope and investigatory powers of the AI Authority. This has been clarified somewhat in debate, with such an authority coming above and helping to coordinate current regulatory bodies such as the <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/\">Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO)</a> - however just why this is necessary or how this will happen is somewhat abstract.</p><p>This is particularly true given that current bodies such as the ICO may well be better placed to undertake such a role in the first place, especially if given the legislative \u2018teeth\u2019 to effectively govern AI in such a manner. Current regulators also already struggle to attract adequate high-level talent, and the formation of an extra authority will likely lead to either increased recruitment woes for itself or, if appropriately funded, increasing recruitment shortages elsewhere.</p><p>Despite a boom in AI Ethics and AI Safety personnel attempting to enter the workforce, talent in actual AI Regulation who have enough STEM and Legal knowledge to do the role well is in very short supply. Such a Regulator will require people who have more than academic knowledge, as academic theory often bears little resemblance to regulatory reality on the ground. This is not to disparage those in AI Ethics or AI Safety from an academic background, it merely addresses the reality that certain tasks require certain expertise - and expertise in AI Regulation is extremely limited and therefore costly. Most personnel entering this type of workforce are consultants coming from a nuclear regulation background, cross-training into computer science (note: this is anecdotal, rather than statistical). This is because there is enough of an overlap for this to be possible. They are, however, exorbitantly expensive and have their pick of employers. Given this reality, can the AI Authority compete with major corporations for pay or perks?</p><p>The core question here is - is there a need for a new regulatory body, rather than an existing one?</p><p>The vagueness issue is best demonstrated in 1(2)(a) where words such as \u2018take account\u2019 carry little weight, and do not indicate particularly stringent intentions. This could be a minor wording issue or perhaps an insight into the fundamental intentions of the Act, but only time can tell there.</p><p>Of final note is 1(2)(d) where the term \u2018a review\u2019 is mentioned in relation to relevant legislation. This singular rather than plural phrasing is important because highly regulated industries such as Nuclear or Export Controls conduct regular such reviews. It would be expected that a high-level authority would conduct these perhaps bi-annually or more. Again, this may be a minor wording issue but it is one worth watching.</p><blockquote><h3><strong>2. Regulatory Principles</strong><br>&nbsp;</h3><p><i>(1) The AI Authority must have regard to the principles that \u2014</i></p><p><i>(a) regulation of AI should deliver \u2014</i></p><p><i>(i) safety, security and robustness;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(ii) appropriate transparency and explainability;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(iii) fairness;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(iv) accountability and governance;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(v) contestability and redress;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(b) any business which develops, deploys or uses AI should\u2014&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(i) be transparent about it;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(ii) test it thoroughly and transparently;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(iii) comply with applicable laws, including in relation to data protection, privacy and intellectual property;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(c) AI and its applications should\u2014&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(i) comply with equalities legislation;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(ii) be inclusive by design;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(iii) be designed so as neither to discriminate unlawfully among individuals nor, so far as reasonably practicable, to perpetuate unlawful discrimination arising in input data;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(iv) meet the needs of those from lower socio-economic groups, older people and disabled people;</i></p><p><i>(v) generate data that are findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(d) a burden or restriction which is imposed on a person, or on the carrying on of an activity, in respect of AI should be proportionate to the benefits, taking into consideration the nature of the service or product being delivered, the nature of risk to consumers and others, whether the cost of implementation is proportionate to that level of risk and whether the burden or restriction enhances UK international competitiveness.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;(2) The Secretary of State may by regulations amend the principles in subsection (1), following consultation with such persons as he or she considers appropriate. \"</i></p></blockquote><p>This section is perhaps the biggest culprit of vague language, and one where some of the lack of specificity could potentially cause issues. It also has a lot of content that is not necessary.</p><p>The entirety of Section 2(1)(a) largely just restates vague concepts and is a rephrasing of current debates in AI Ethics. For example, what does it mean by 'appropriate\u2019? For whom? How is \u2018fairness\u2019 designed? In their defence, I spent ~10,000 words exploring the legal concept of fairness as relates to AI in my PhD and still had unanswered questions by the end of the chapter, so I can let them off with not offering definitions. However, throwing such terms around for seemingly no purpose beyond box ticking does the legislation no service.</p><p>Particularly useless is 1(b)(iii) - does this really need to be said? This Bill is short at 9 pages, and even then wastes many words. Section 2(1)(c)(iv) is particularly troublesome, as it misses the entire point of the (obviously good) advice it must have received from prior input. The issue isn\u2019t that AI doesn\u2019t meet the needs of these groups, which is true in that it largely doesn\u2019t, but the bigger issue is that it actively harms these groups. It is tremendously unclear what is meant by \u2018meet the needs\u2019, and is pretty much wasted words in an otherwise short Bill.</p><p>A possible exception is 1(a)(v) which is a consideration not always given in this type of proposal, and is good to see included.&nbsp;</p><p>Section 2(1)(d) is also a mixed bag. It describes scaling responsibilities but lacks any detail and also places UK national competitiveness alongside guarantees of citizen rights which are absolutely nowhere near equal in importance and barely deserve to be in the same sentence.</p><blockquote><h3><strong>3. Regulatory Sandboxes</strong></h3><p><i>(1) The AI Authority must collaborate with relevant regulators to construct regulatory sandboxes for AI.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(2) In this section a \u201cregulatory sandbox\u201d is an arrangement by one or more regulators which\u2014&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(a) allows businesses to test innovative propositions in the market with real consumers;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(b) is open to authorised firms, unauthorised firms that require authorisation and technology firms partnering with, or providing services to, UK firms doing regulated activities;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(c) provides firms with support in identifying appropriate consumer protection safeguards;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(d) requires tests to have a clear objective and to be conducted on a small scale;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(e) requires firms which want to test products or services which are regulated activities to be authorised by or registered with the relevant regulator before starting the test. The Secretary of State may by regulations amend the description in subsection (2), following consultation with such persons as he or she considers appropriate.&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>This is actually a pretty interesting bit of the Bill. I think this is actually a fairly good idea, as it allows businesses to test new AI-related technologies in a way that is not stifled by the stricter bits of regulation but with supervisory safeguards from appropriate bodies.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing I would say is that it is vital that these authorised firms are still aware of the regulations they are exempt from. It would be nice to see this in the legislation, but I know from experience that when regulatory exemptions are applied to technology the developers are usually under a contractual obligation to stick as close to the legislation as possible where practical to do so anyway. In practice, these sandboxes aren\u2019t a carte-blanche to just do whatever the developer wants. There is often significant fear in the media whenever sandboxes are mentioned, and this has been no different with a number of critics expressing concern about abuse of the system to create unsafe AI (which is a fair criticism), but I think they often lack experience in actual regulatory environments to understand the range of mitigation factors at play.&nbsp;</p><p>I would be interested in seeing more about the application criteria, though. It has always been my feeling that the sandboxes should be rarely used and only when there is a legitimate need to do so. I would be far more content to see public authorities or public infrastructure-focused commercial companies utilise the sandboxes rather than purely for-profit developments. This would all come under later guidance and policies though.&nbsp;</p><p>As a summary, it is a boost in confidence to see 2(d) and 2(e) in there to keep things specific in scope and scale whilst also under the supervision of an existing regulator, though a lack of detail in 2(b) is an area for improvement.</p><blockquote><h3><strong>4. AI Responsible Officers</strong><br>&nbsp;</h3><p><br><i>(1) The Secretary of State, after consulting the AI Authority and such other persons as he or she considers appropriate, must by regulations provide that&nbsp; any business which develops, deploys or uses AI must have a designated AI officer, with duties\u2014&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(a) to ensure the safe, ethical, unbiased and non-discriminatory use of AI by the business;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(b) to ensure, so far as reasonably practicable, that data used by the business in any AI technology is unbiased (see section 2(1)(c)(iii)).&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(2) In the Companies Act 2006, section 414C(7)(b), after paragraph (iii) insert\u2014&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>\u201c(iv) any development, deployment or use of AI by the company, and the name and activities of the AI officer designated under the Artificial Intelligence (Regulation) Act 2024,\u201d.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(3) The Secretary of State may by regulations amend the duties in subsection (1) and the text inserted by section (2), following consultation with such persons as he or she considers appropriate.&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>This is another section that is a good idea, but the wording is just too vague and wide. My initial and most glaring criticism is the lack of qualifying criteria for an AI Responsible Officer. This specific point in the legislation obviously states that the Secretary of State will provide further regulations on the matter of AI Responsible Officers so it is entirely possible that further qualifying detail would be added then - however, I would have very much liked to see at least some detail here.</p><p>In either changes to this Bill as it progresses or in further guidance after the Act is passed I would like to see criteria for what makes someone eligible to be an AI Responsible Officer. It should at minimum require some professional qualification to enable them to do an adequate quality job of safeguarding given the importance of the position and to avoid companies hiring low-level employees as silent, powerless scapegoats.</p><p>There is a good challenge to this criticism which is that too high a qualification bar would make it difficult and prohibitively costly for smaller organisations to hire an appropriately qualified individual. As a response to that I would add a caveat that there should be an increasing level of qualifications required in line with either increased size of the organisation or increased potential risk of the AI systems. I won\u2019t get bogged down here with wording and terminology, but the obvious implication would be that a major AI lab, nuclear power plant, or a public authority would require a much more qualified individual than, say, a school or a furniture factory.</p><p>A good example of this is the use of <a href=\"https://www.nafems.org/publications/resource_center/wt03/\">SQEP</a>s in nuclear regulation, which has been a very good system thus far.</p><p>I would also highlight that in 4(2), the changes to the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/contents\">Companies Act 2006</a> may cause problems by having a very high range of interpretations of \u2018AI\u2019. For example, I was once part of a team who trialled some new AI regulations with a series of major public-facing institutions, and part of that was a duty to report on AI systems used. Some reported only their most experimental AI systems, whereas others included things like automated payroll processes, design algorithms (essentially decision trees from user input), and in one case even included Microsoft Excel macros. It was a really enlightening insight into how widely terms can be interpreted, and I don\u2019t think the writers of this bill have adequately considered this prospect. They may want to undertake the daunting task of defining AI, but to be honest it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult if they are defining it for a specific regulatory task rather than trying to define the actual field. Good examples have previously been written up by others in a similar situation&nbsp;<a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld5802/ldselect/ldjusthom/180/180.pdf\"><strong>here</strong></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/artificial-intelligence/explaining-decisions-made-with-artificial-intelligence/part-1-the-basics-of-explaining-ai/definitions/\"><strong>here</strong></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lexisnexis.co.uk/legal/glossary/artificial-intelligence\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p>Section 7 of this Bill does make an attempt to define AI, but that may not necessarily apply to the Companies Act 2006, and also as in the above example Section 7\u2019s definition of AI could conceivably include digital thermometers in 7(1)(a), Excel spreadsheets in 7(1)(b) and spellcheck in Microsoft Word in 7(1)(c).&nbsp; See Section 7 further down this post for details.</p><p>A final, and obvious, criticism is the very broad terminology used in 4(1)(a) and 4(1)(b). The legal and scientific definitions of \u2018safe\u2019, \u2018ethical\u2019, \u2018unbiased\u2019, and \u2018non-discriminatory\u2019 differ significantly. I also get the feeling that the concept of the term \u2018reasonable\u2019 in the sentence \u2018so far as reasonably practicable\u2019 is going to become a battleground of significant size in case law in the near future should this Act pass. Tests of reasonableness are always such in legislation, but in this instance is likely to be more so. In the UK, 'Necessity' and 'Proportionality' are also likely to be core considerations - as is found in much of data law.</p><blockquote><h3><strong>5. Transparency, IP obligations and labelling</strong></h3><p><i>(1) The Secretary of State, after consulting the AI Authority and such other persons as he or she considers appropriate, must by regulations provide that\u2014&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(a) any person involved in training AI must\u2014&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(i) supply to the AI Authority a record of all third-party data and intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) used in that training; and&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(ii) assure the AI Authority that\u2014 (A) they use all such data and IP by informed consent; and (B) they comply with all applicable IP and copyright obligations;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;(iii) any person supplying a product or service involving AI must give customers clear and unambiguous health warnings, labelling and opportunities to give or withhold informed consent in advance; and</i></p><p><i>(iv) any business which develops, deploys or uses AI must allow independent third parties accredited by the AI Authority to audit its processes and systems.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(2) Regulations under this section may provide for informed consent to be express (opt-in) or implied (opt-out) and may make different provision for different cases.&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>This is a really interesting section, and it probably helps to go chronologically here.</p><p>&nbsp;Firstly, again it is likely that the Secretary of State and the AI Authority would introduce much more detailed guidance so some of my criticisms on lack of clarity would likely be addressed to a greater or lesser degree further down the line. However, for the moment I have some concerns about phrasing and scope.</p><p>The first terminology of concern is \u2018any person\u2019 in 1(a). The reason for this is that even once we encounter 1(a)(i), this already means that every high school/college/university computer science student, every self-learner, and every researcher would have to submit a record of all third-party data they use in training. This is an issue for two reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, it imposes a reporting burden on people who the Bill is clearly not aimed at. When we consider AI harms, is the teenager at home self-learning from YouTube tutorials really the type of developer we are concerned about?&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, I also have concerns about what kind of detail may be required in the record. I do AI regulation as part of my work, and whereas in some cases those records would be easy to assemble and submit, there are situations in which this would be extremely resource-intensive or even cases where it would not be realistic to submit as compliance evidence in either contractual or regulatory terms. This also only targets the individuals and organisations actually training the AI, rather than the people using it, which seems to be a bit of a gap. There seems to be little to stop an AI being trained abroad, and then sold within the UK.&nbsp;</p><p>Subsection 1(a)(iv) is also quite broad, as that could include almost any business. It is also unclear whether the legislation\u2019s definition of \u2018business\u2019 extends to organisations also. Is a non-profit / NGO a business? What of a police force? What about restricted businesses such as in the nuclear or export control sectors? This last example is mentioned in the regulatory sandboxes section, but not here. This vagueness is also a problem to a somewhat lesser extent in 1(a)(iii) where it is ill defined the remoteness of \u2018involving AI\u2019 to the actual product or service in question.</p><blockquote><h3><strong>6. Public Engagement</strong></h3><p><br><i>\u201cThe AI Authority must\u2014&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(a) implement a programme for meaningful, long-term public engagement about the opportunities and risks presented by AI; and&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(b) consult the general public and such persons as it considers appropriate as to the most effective frameworks for public engagement, having regard to international comparators.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>This is a very small section, and it\u2019s quite plainly worded. I do hope, however, that the public engagement will be non-biased (as in non-politically aligned, neutrally reported, and funding not related to consumption), and hopefully led by people focused on the rights of the public rather than the ambitions of government or industry. AI Ethicists would be particularly useful here. I am hopeful that we see a much greater emphasis on contemporary risks than in long-term risk or existential risk, as those are the risks of much more immediate and addressable concern to the public.&nbsp;</p><p>I imagine that opinion will be tremendously unpopular in this forum, but it\u2019s a matter of risk chance and not risk impact when it comes to such systems - especially when under the control of public authorities.</p><blockquote><h3><strong>7. Interpretation</strong></h3><p><i>\u201c(1) In this Act \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d and \u201cAI\u201d mean technology enabling the programming or training of a device or software to\u2014&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(a) perceive environments through the use of data;&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(b) interpret data using automated processing designed to approximate cognitive abilities; and&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(c) make recommendations, predictions or decisions; with a view to achieving a specific objective.</i></p><p><i>(2) AI includes generative AI, meaning deep or large language models able to generate text and other content based on the data on which they were trained.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>I already discussed the interpretation challenges earlier in this analysis, so there\u2019s not much more to say here. Included for reference.</p><blockquote><h3><br><strong>8. Regulations</strong></h3><p><i>\u201c(1) Regulations under this Act are made by statutory instrument.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(2) Regulations under this Act may create offences and require payment of fees, penalties and fines.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(3) A statutory instrument containing regulations under section 1 or 2 or regulations covered by subsection (2) may not be made unless a draft of the instrument has been laid before and approved by resolution of both Houses of Parliament.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(4) A statutory instrument containing only regulations not covered by subsection (3) is subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.</i></p><p><i>(5) A statutory instrument containing regulations applying to Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland must be laid before Senedd Cymru, the Scottish Parliament or the Northern Ireland Assembly respectively before being made.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>This section is legal procedure only, and of little relation to this analysis. Included for reference.</p><blockquote><h3><strong>9. Extent, commencement and short title</strong><br>&nbsp;</h3><p><br><i>\u201c(1) This Act extends to England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(2) This Act comes into force on the day on which it is passed.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(3) This Act may be cited as the Artificial Intelligence (Regulation) Act 2024.\"&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>This section is legal procedure only, and of little relation to this analysis. Included for reference.</p><h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3><p>This Bill is an interesting start on AI regulation in the UK in terms of producing AI-specific statutory law rather than relying on law found elsewhere in data protection or technology, or on case law such as <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/R-Bridges-v-CC-South-Wales-ors-Judgment.pdf\">Bridges v South Wales Police</a>. It\u2019s good to see an attempt made - even if it is via a Private Member\u2019s Bill.&nbsp;</p><p>There are some strengths in terms of allowing regulatory safeguards without stifling necessary innovation, but the Bill also has some significant weaknesses which I feel need addressed should it (no matter how unlikely) continue to eventually be passed.</p><p>A major weakness of the Bill is vague terminology, but that is a Catch-22 as vague terminology is both a strength and a weakness in legislation. In fact, vague terminology is what (perhaps unintentionally) future-proofed <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/37/2010-04-06?view=plain\">Section 1 of the Protection of Children Act 1978 (PCA 1978)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/33/section/160#commentary-c12796481\">Section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (CJA 1988)</a> against AI tools used to create CSAM courtesy of both Acts' inclusion and definition of \u2018pseudo-photography\u2019. However, the right balance has to be struck here and in this Bill I feel the language falls on the side of being too vague.</p><p>I also feel that too much is left to the discretion of the Secretary of State and in guidance to be subsequently published by regulators. There needs to be more specific language used in many areas to adequately lay out who is regulated and to what extent.

This is done by several large companies and dozens of small ones across the world, who then deliver their product to researchers of various kinds. I will refer to NAS rather than DNA synthesis for the rest of this post because I think this broader category is what we really want to cover.</li><li>The NAS process is currently undergoing rapid change, with new enzymatic techniques<a href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]</a>potentially making it much cheaper to produce nucleic acids, especially at scale.&nbsp;</li><li>Desktop synthesisers, which allow users to generate the sequences at their own labs, are also dramatically improving to the point that they may begin to replace the existing model where synthesis is mostly outsourced to private companies.<a href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]</a></li><li>There are several publicly available databases of genetic sequences, which include various pathogenic sequences.</li><li>The field of synthetic biology, which applies engineering and computer science tools to \u201cprogramme\u201d biology, may make it easier over time for those who have obtained synthetic nucleic acids to then use these sequences to recreate existing harmful pathogens (e.g. smallpox) or engineer even more dangerous pathogens.<a href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]</a></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Given these risks, it is often argued that NAS companies should screen their orders for potentially harmful sequences and screen their customers to ensure they are trustworthy. Although there are <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/spp/article/41/5/597/1636559\">good arguments</a> for why the perceived risk may be overblown, I think this is clearly something they should do. My dissertation focuses on the best way to ensure that this happens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Current well-known points regarding NAS regulation</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What I see as the key components of the international regulatory system for NAS are as follows:</p><ul><li>The <a href=\"https://genesynthesisconsortium.org/\">International Gene Synthesis Consortium</a> \u2013 a set of large gene synthesis companies which have joined together and agreed to screen their orders according to the <a href=\"https://genesynthesisconsortium.org/wp-content/uploads/IGSCHarmonizedProtocol11-21-17.pdf\">Harmonised Screening Protocol</a>. IGSC members agree to screen their orders against a shared database of sequences of concern derived from organisms listed on various official lists of organisms of concern.<ul><li>Two particularly important lists come from the <a href=\"https://www.dfat.gov.au/publications/minisite/theaustraliagroupnet/site/en/human_animal_pathogens.html\">Australia Group</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.selectagents.gov/sat/list.htm\">United States Select Agents and Toxins List</a>.</li></ul></li><li>The <a href=\"https://aspr.hhs.gov/legal/synna/Pages/default.aspx\">United States Department of Health and Human Services Guide</a> \u2013 a set of voluntary sequence screening guidelines produced in the US. They are similar to the IGSC requirements, but (perhaps surprisingly) require a less rigorous sequence screening procedure than the IGSC\u2019s Harmonised Screening Protocol because they rely more on automation and less on expert judgement.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://front.un-arm.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/BWC-text-English-1.pdf\">Biological Weapons Convention</a> (BWC) and <a href=\"https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N04/328/43/PDF/N0432843.pdf?OpenElement\">United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540</a> (UNSCR 1540) \u2013 these both require states to take steps to limit the risk of bioweapons being created, which includes regulating the movement of biological agents within and across their borders.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://www.dfat.gov.au/publications/minisite/theaustraliagroupnet/site/en/index.html\">Australia Group</a> \u2013 an informal group of countries that have agreed to implement standardised lists of materials that could be used for nuclear, chemical or biological weapons which they will require licenses to export. The Australia Group lists include lists of dangerous pathogens, as well as sequences derived from these pathogens which \u201cendow or enhance pathogenicity\u201d.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://ibbis.bio/\">International Biosecurity and Biosafety Initiative for Science</a> \u2013 a non-profit that has recently spun out of the Nuclear Threat Initiative\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nti.org/about/programs-projects/project/fostering-biosecurity-innovation-and-risk-reduction/\">Biosecurity Innovation and Risk Reduction Initiative</a>. IBBIS aims to fill the current gap left by a lack of international institutions which focus on reducing the risks of biotechnology, by working with governments, private synthesis companies and researchers (i.e. NAS customers).<ul><li>Importantly, IBBIS will also house the automated solution NTI is hoping to create for sequence screening known as the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nti.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Biosecurity_Innovation_and_Risk_Reduction.pdf\">Common Mechanism</a>\u201d.</li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://securedna.org/\">SecureDNA</a> \u2013 this is an organisation which aims to develop an automated solution to sequence screening, but one which is more sophisticated than the Common Mechanism. It is funded by some key EA orgs, and will compete alongside the Common Mechanism with several other companies that also produce automated screening systems such as <a href=\"https://www.aclid.bio/\">ACLID</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aiche.org/sbe/conferences/synthetic-biology-engineering-evolution-design-seed/2016/proceeding/paper/bliss-black-list-sequence-screening-pipeline\">BLiSS</a>, <a href=\"https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-022-02695-x\">SeqScreen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.battelle.org/markets/health/chemical-and-biological-countermeasures/biosecurity-pandemic-preparedness/threatseq\">ThreatSeq</a> and <a href=\"https://fastna.myshopify.com/\">FAST-NA</a>.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I won\u2019t go into these in any more depth except to the extent that they are relevant to the following points which are based more on my own research.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Domestic laws \u2013 the divide between domestic transfers and exports</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is often claimed, perhaps most clearly on <a href=\"https://ibbis.bio/our-work/\">IBBIS\u2019s website</a>, that zero countries require NAS providers to screen their orders to prevent misuse. This is strictly true in that there are no countries which directly mandate a NAS screening process, but many countries have legally binding regulations that require licensing for the process of <i>transferring</i> certain biological agents from one person to another. If certain physical genetic sequences are included in this list of \u201cbiological agents\u201d, then NAS companies must screen their orders for those sequence to establish whether they need a licence. These list-based approaches are <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jcsl/article-abstract/11/1/93/861720\">often implemented in the name of fulfilling State obligations</a> under the Biological Weapons Convention and UNSCR 1540. The standard approach of these <i>indirect</i> screening requirements is to have a list of pathogens that are considered dangerous, and then give a definition of which physical genetic sequences from such pathogens are also included.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The flaws of list-based approaches are <a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/hs.2022.0109\">well documented</a>. Perhaps the most important problem is that simply because a sequence comes from a pathogenic species does not necessarily mean it is itself dangerous \u2013 there are many sequences that carry out normal cell function across a range of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic species, and conversely it is possible to have sequences that are unique to a specific pathogenic species but which do not actually assist the organism with causing harm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, critiques of list-based approaches seem to only ever focus on the United States Select Agent programme. I have never been able to find what I would think should logically come first \u2013 a review that simply summarises which countries across the world actually use such lists, whether their lists include physical genetic sequences, and if so, what definitions they use to map from a particular pathogen species to the regulated sequences themselves. Consequently, I used the following search strategy to carry out my own review. Given these list-based regulations are used to fulfil obligations under the BWC and UNSCR 1540, I looked at databases that attempt to measure compliance of States with the two regimes.<a href=\"#_ftn6\">[6]</a> Since I couldn\u2019t investigate all countries in depth, I chose to focus on understanding which countries have some kind of biological agent lists <strong>at all</strong>, and then investigated in full detail the regulations of the countries which I knew had NAS companies operating within their borders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From this search I identified the following key points (see the first half of chapter IV for details):</p><ul><li><strong>Countries all used quite separate approaches for regulating the transfer of biological agents </strong><i><strong>within</strong></i><strong> their borders (I call such regulations \u201cdomestic transfer controls\u201d) and transfers </strong><i><strong>between&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>borders (\u201cexport controls\u201d).</strong></li><li>The <a href=\"https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N22/725/80/PDF/N2272580.pdf?OpenElement\">most recent review of UNSCR 1540 implementation</a> found that in 2022 only 25% of possible domestic transfer control measures have been implemented by UN members, and 40% of UN members had developed national export control lists for biological materials. <strong>These numbers put approximate upper bounds on the proportion of countries which have </strong><i><strong>any</strong></i><strong> NAS regulation.</strong></li><li>However, <strong>all</strong> countries in which NAS companies I knew about operate have both export <strong>and</strong> domestic transfer control lists, <strong>but</strong> <strong>most of them do not include physical genetic sequences in their domestic transfer control lists</strong>.<ul><li>Export control lists amongst these countries are direct copies of the Australia Group list \u2013 even in countries like China and Singapore which are not actually Australia Group members.</li><li>Some countries seem to have attempted to include physical genetic sequences in their domestic transfer control lists (e.g. Canada), but do so in such a poor way that I believe a court would be unlikely to find that their lists actually cover physical genetic sequences.&nbsp;</li><li>I found only two countries which clearly include physical genetic sequences in their domestic transfer control lists \u2013 the United States (with the Select Agent and Toxins List) and the United Kingdom \u2013 and these both use odd, very restrictive definitions that only seem to include viral sequences that could produce a viable virus as soon as they are introduced into a host cell.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A possible argument that States are violating both the Biological Weapons Convention and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Braden Leach, in an <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FINAL-ROUND_Leach-1.pdf\">article</a> those of you familiar with this field may have read, has argued that by failing to adequately regulate NAS, the United States is breaching its obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention. In particular, article IV requires State Parties to \u201ctake any necessary measures to prohibit and <u>prevent</u> the development, production, acquisition or retention\u201d of what the BWC defines as biological weapons. Leach believes proper NAS regulation fits the plain meaning of \u201cnecessary measures\u201d to \u201cprevent\u201d biological weapons development, as well as the BWC\u2019s purpose&nbsp; of\u201cexclud[ing] completely the possibility of bacteriological (biological) agents being used as weapons\u201d.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think this argument is a good start but misses several factors as follows, which I try to take into account in making my own version of this argument, which I also aim to generalise to states other than the United States:</p><ul><li>The obligation in article IV must be balanced with the article X obligation to \u201cfacilitate \u2026 the fullest possible exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for the use of\u201d biological agents which do <i>not</i> fit the definition of a biological weapon. The key test for whether a biological agent is defined as a weapon is whether it has \u201cno justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes\u201d. Applying this test is not straightforward for dual-use technology, and I believe it cannot simply be resolved by pointing to the plain meaning of article IV and the BWC\u2019s purpose (since that doesn\u2019t tell you how to <i>balance</i> articles IV and X).</li><li>Instead, the main factor that can be used to resolve this tension is <a href=\"https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft_articles/1_11_2018.pdf\">subsequent <strong>state practice</strong></a> \u2013 that is, the way states have chosen to implement an international treaty like the BWC can <i>itself</i> be used as evidence of what the parties intended it to mean. Deciding what state practice implies here is complex, however, given many states don\u2019t implement any biological agent lists <i>at all</i>, those that do illogically distinguish between exports and domestic transfers, and <i>no states</i> implement direct screening regulations.</li><li>In my view, UNSCR 1540 implements essentially identical obligations to the BWC with respect to domestic transfer and export controls, and therefore provides an additional source of obligations for states. Leach believes that UNSCR 1540 only requires states to \u201cprohibit\u201d the acquisition and transfer of biological weapons (i.e. using criminal law) through article 2, but I am almost certain this is a mistake because he misses article 3(a) and (d) which govern domestic transfer and export controls respectively.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My conclusion here is mixed because there are a variety of possible things that the BWC and UNSCR 1540 could require. As the requirements get stronger, the arguments in favour of these requirements become weaker, and Leach\u2019s proposal is the strongest possible interpretation. For example, I believe his view is plausible but will not convince everyone, whereas I think there is a more compelling case that all states at least have an obligation to include the same types of controls for domestic transfers of physical genetic material as they have for exports of physical genetic material.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Concerns I have about the International Gene Synthesis Consortium</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To try and get a good understanding of the current state of the NAS industry, I decided to do a deep dive into the IGSC and its members, and what I found concerned me more than I expected. I tend to find that most critiques of the IGSC system focus on the fact that it is voluntary, that it only covers a majority of the gene synthesis market rather than all of it, and various problems with the specific Harmonised Screening Protocol it uses, while also admitting that it is better than nothing. I also agree that it is better than nothing, but I believe there are further problems with the IGSC that mean even if the industry sticks to using self-regulation the IGSC should probably either be substantially reformed or replaced with a different system of self-regulation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first problem is based on its history. This barely ever seems to get mentioned, but the IGSC standards came <i>after</i> a <a href=\"https://op.bna.com/hl.nsf/r?Open=jaqo-7xqpnr\">Code of Conduct</a> created by a set of small German gene synthesis companies that had formed the International Association of Synthetic Biology (IASB). The IGSC resulted from backlash by two large companies against the IASB Code of Conduct, arguing that it would be better to use a fully automated solution which made no use of expert judgment to check for possible dangerous sequences outside of those from official lists. This proposal failed, but the two large companies remained separate from the IASB and joined with three others to form what is now the IGSC, creating their own standards which were virtually identical to the IASB Code. In contrast the IASB, the IGSC had (and still has) meetings that are only open to members and so are not open to scrutiny by other members of the industry, the media or governments in the way the IASB was. Further, voting membership is only open to large companies that surpass a <a href=\"https://genesynthesisconsortium.org/wp-content/uploads/IGSCMembershipApplication11-21-17.pdf\">certain annual revenue threshold</a>, making it highly unlikely smaller industry members will ever join since they cannot contribute to the content of the regulation system they are agreeing to be bound by.<a href=\"#_ftn7\">[7]</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From what I can tell, for some time both groups were seen as major regulators of gene synthesis, but over more recent years IGSC has clearly become the only player and has grown to 33 members, while the IASB has been essentially forgotten. I think this is unfortunate, since the IGSC has a poorer governance structure than the IASB. In fact, probably once the most prolific scholar on DNA synthesis regulation, <a href=\"https://gspp.berkeley.edu/research-and-impact/faculty/stephen-maurer\">Stephen Maurer</a>, has often spoken in favour of maintaining a system of self-regulation, but primarily uses the IASB as the standard he hopes the industry will model. It also seems like the IGSC\u2019s history is still influencing how it engages with the more recent discussion about regulating DNA synthesis, given all industry members that contribute to NTI\u2019s various publications<a href=\"#_ftn8\">[8]</a> seem to come from the IGSC despite the existence of many other gene synthesis companies. For example, NTI\u2019s proposed \u201cCommon Mechanism\u201d, an automated solution based on a database of sequences only from official lists, sounds almost identical to what the founding IGSC members originally proposed before they backtracked. (Although, to be clear, I am aware the proportion of total gene synthesis costs taken up by screening has risen dramatically, such that an automated screening system may be the only way to make screening affordable for all industry members, which was not true when the IGSC was first founded in 2009.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are also several other concerns I wanted to mention more briefly:</p><ul><li>The IGSC does not enforce its screening protocol or even monitor compliance of its members \u2013 while I note competition law in each of its members\u2019 governing jurisdictions will limit the IGSC\u2019s ability to do this to varying degrees, the IGSC really seems to do the bare minimum.&nbsp;</li><li>The IGSC <a href=\"https://genesynthesisconsortium.org/wp-content/uploads/IGSCHarmonizedProtocol11-21-17.pdf\">claims</a> it covers ~80% of the gene synthesis market (although I have no idea where this number came from and it has not been changed <a href=\"https://genesynthesisconsortium.org/wp-content/uploads/IGSC-Launch-Announcement.pdf\">since 2009</a>). Even setting aside that even one company not screening may be enough to cause harm if a bioterrorist can find it, or that this number is likely inaccurate \u2013 it only applies to the \u201cgene\u201d synthesis market: that is, DNA (and not RNA) sequences of over 200 base pairs. In fact, there is a continually growing market in much shorter \u201coligonucleotide\u201d (oligo) sequences which for a long time has been larger than the gene synthesis market. Given it is possible to join these oligos together after ordering them, and RNA can similarly be converted into DNA after ordering, it is not clear why the relevant figure should even be limited to \u201cgenes\u201d in the first place. It is quite likely the IGSC really captures a small proportion of the relevant market.</li><li>Of the 33 members, I only found 5 which mention biosecurity or their IGSC membership on the website, and there are 9 I can confirm do not after completing a fairly comprehensive search of their websites. This suggests that neither they nor their customers actually take this very seriously (compare this, for example, to the amount of advertising these companies have about their diversity, etc. policies for customers).</li><li>Out of the 9 members which publish their standard terms and conditions on their websites, 4 do not mention the IGSC or their right to refuse orders that are flagged by the Harmonised Screening Protocol. This is surprising because if they were actually doing the screening, their customers would probably want to know about the risk of the order being refused and expect this to be in the sale contract. Further, although I haven\u2019t looked into this at all, since IGSC members are meant to adopt more stringent screening standards than they are legally required to, refusing orders that are flagged by screening may actually be a breach of contract.</li><li>The IGSC has expanded massively over the last few years, with 19 of its 33 members <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240112072932/https:/genesynthesisconsortium.org/\">joining after</a> the beginning of 2020, but it has not published any of these additions (unlike <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/international-gene-synthesis-consortium-adds-new-global-members-to-advance-biosecurity-objectives-300440386.html\">its previous new members</a>). It has partially done this by expanding the range of companies that are joining to include some screening <i>system</i> providers (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.aclid.bio/\">ACLID</a> and <a href=\"https://www.battelle.org/markets/health/chemical-and-biological-countermeasures/biosecurity-pandemic-preparedness/threatseq\">Battelle</a>), biofoundries (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.igb.illinois.edu/iBIOFAB\">iBioFAB</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/research/facilities/edinburgh-genome-foundry\">Edinburgh Genome Foundry</a>) and <i>benchtop</i> synthesiser producers (e.g. <a href=\"https://elegenbio.com/\">Elegen Bio</a>, <a href=\"https://switchbacksys.com/\">Switchback Systems</a>, <a href=\"https://www.evonetix.com/\">Evonetix</a>). This seems to me like potentially a significant change in ambition by the IGSC towards becoming a regulator of this full set of related but distinct parts of the biotechnology industry in a way which might not be optimal (especially since it does not by any means contain all the companies in any of these categories).&nbsp;<ul><li>That such a change can happen with nobody noticing shows the problem with the non-transparent approach the IGSC takes. However, my understanding is that there is also some evidence that self-regulatory regimes become less effective if they try to regulate many different dissimilar firms at once.<a href=\"#_ftn9\">[9]</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>From looking at the history of international self-regulatory regimes like this, it seems fairly clear to me that there are some preferable alternatives. A common one is <i>meta-regulation</i>, where an external regulator sets the rules that the self-regulatory body has to follow when creating its standards. States struggle to do this at the international level, so it has been becoming increasingly common for systems like this to involve <i>private meta-regulation</i>. A good example of this is the <a href=\"https://mygfsi.com/\">Global Food Safety Initiative</a>,&nbsp;which assesses the range of private food safety certification regimes used across the world against a set of common benchmarks and monitors the governance and practice of the industry associations that run these certification regimes. These&nbsp;regulatory systems are also not necessarily purely voluntary in terms of enforcement, since it is possible to enforce the agreed standards through contract law or requirements for membership with the regulatory scheme. Further, the private meta-regulator is often a separate not-for-profit, rather than an industry association run purely by industry members.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I think this is where IBBIS could take a much more ambitious role in the international regulation of NAS, or synthetic biology more broadly, than simply collaborating with the various groups involved.&nbsp;</strong>I think it would be more useful for it to essentially replace the IGSC as a private meta-regulator of several different industry associations which each separately govern their relevant domain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nucleic acid synthesis as a case study of the international law vs \u201ctransnational private regulation\u201d debate</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The final substantive chapter of the dissertation compares the various suggested solutions for the international regulation of synthetic biology in general,<a href=\"#_ftn10\">[10]</a> while also trying to apply them specifically to NAS. This section is quite long and relies on much of the context I detail in the earlier chapters, so I would encourage those who have been interested enough to read to this point to read the dissertation itself. However, I did want to mention a couple of key points from this section.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the regulation of almost anything with international scope, the two alternatives often posed are creating a new international treaty or what is called \u201ctransnational private regulation\u201d (TPR).<a href=\"#_ftn11\">[11]</a> I think TPR is much less well-known (I certainly hadn\u2019t heard of it before I wrote the paper), but has a fairly strong track record in <a href=\"https://www.icrp.org/\">radiation dosage</a>, the Internet (especially in <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-16447-2\">cybersecurity</a>), \u201cdolphin-safe\u201d tuna fishing, food safety (remember the Global Food Safety Initiative above), sustainable forestry, sustainable fishing, and sustainable coffee.<a href=\"#_ftn12\">[12]</a> The key features of TPR are as follows:</p><ul><li>A private entity (which may be for-profit or not-for-profit) sets standards for the regulated industry with input from industry members.</li><li>Either (note these are some of the main models but there are many configurations):<ul><li>companies around the world voluntarily agree to follow the standards;</li><li>the private regulator acts as a <i>meta-regulator</i> of several other private regulatory entities, which in turn regulate the companies;<a href=\"#_ftn13\">[13]</a> or&nbsp;<ul><li>It seems to be more common for a private meta-regulator to enforce its rules on the other intermediate regulatory entities, for example through contract law or membership requirements, compared to when the main private regulator directly regulates the companies with no intermediary. (I\u2019m not sure why, although I suspect this is because it is less likely to create competition law problems).</li></ul></li><li>states directly implement the standards into their own laws, so that the standards become binding on companies that operate within their borders (see for example the <a href=\"https://www.icrp.org/\">International Commission on Radiological Protection</a>).</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These two options are not really alternatives since they can be combined, but they are often framed that way, and often TPR is presented as an opportunity to try to fill the gap created when international treaty negotiation fails. Also, as you can see above, TPR actually covers a wide range of different approaches, some of which can involve imposing non-voluntary requirements on companies, despite these examples often still being described as \u201cself-regulation\u201d, \u201cself-governance\u201d or \u201csoft law\u201d (as opposed to legally binding \u201chard law\u201d).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think the debate between these options is relevant to a wide range of issues, including not only artificial intelligence but also other technologies that create significant risks such as <a href=\"https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/51867\">3D printing</a>. I note that there is already an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Xf6QE6txgvfCGvZpk/case-studies-of-self-governance-to-reduce-technology-risk\">EA forum post</a> asking about other examples of self-governance that could be compared to AI. I think there are many examples of <i>TPR</i>, some of which appear to have been a success, but I think it is best to instead view the options for regulation as a spectrum with international treaties at one end and then purely voluntary systems like the IGSC representing the opposite end. &nbsp;TPR encompasses a wide range of options along the spectrum, including the purely voluntary systems on the far end. &nbsp;The question is really where on this <i>spectrum</i> is most appropriate for governing a given technology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As an aside, I think that an important but non-obvious issue regarding the viability of a given TPR approach is how competition law is likely to apply to the suggested enforcement system. I have mentioned already that whether the IGSC can enforce its rules will depend on the competition law in the various jurisdictions that govern it (and indeed the <i>conflict of laws</i> rules that decide <i>which</i> country\u2019s competition laws apply in each situation). I think this is an important area of research that it would be great for someone to explore, but which I did not even have enough time to look into during my dissertation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After reviewing the literature comparing government regulation to self-regulation I found that, as you might expect, there is an unavoidable underlying trade-off. This is between the additional knowledge and flexibility that comes from the industry being able to govern itself, and the problem of the industry\u2019s interests when regulating itself not necessarily aligning with the public interest.<a href=\"#_ftn14\">[14]</a> How this trade-off applies to a given case will depend on a variety of factors, as well as the specific governance structures used for the private regulator. There are in fact some <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2508684\">fairly comprehensive papers</a> outlining the <a>various features</a> their authors think a good TPR system should have, which I think should be drawn on more often.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, I conclude in my dissertation that <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2122854119\">international law is not as effective as one might assume</a>, that TPR might be more viable that it first appears, and NAS is really just another example where it is hard to know which is better. However, the main problem I see is with how the IGSC has turned out in fact (see the critiques above), so if I think we are to use TPR the IGSC requires substantial reform (also detailed above). My view is also that this is probably a case (perhaps like many cases) where the two approaches should be combined if possible \u2013 especially since here it may be possible to simply amend or clarify how the BWC applies to achieve the same result as negotiating a whole new international treaty. My recommendation is therefore to reform the IGSC, possibly by handing regulatory power over to some future, much more developed version of IBBIS, and still at the same time attempt to clarify or amend the BWC so that it is clear it requires states to implement NAS screening regulations.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><hr><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> See for example <a>Delay, Detect, Defend</a> and <a href=\"The%20Economist%20published%20an%20op-ed%20by%20Jaime%20Yassif%20(NTI)\">The Economist published an op-ed by Jaime Yassif (NTI)</a>.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a> See for example this <a href=\"https://undark.org/2022/12/21/experts-debate-the-risks-of-made-to-order-dna/\">article by science magazine Undark</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/7/27/23808920/gene-dna-synthesis-biotechnology-pandemic-viruses-twist-bioscience-pathogens-ginkgo-bioworks\">another article by Kelsey Piper</a>.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\">[3]</a> See for example these announcements by <a href=\"%3chttps:/www.dnascript.com/pressreleases/%20dna-script-announces-worlds-first-enzymatic-synthesis-of-a-high-purity-200-%20nucleotide-strand-of-dna\">DNA Script</a> and <a href=\"https://molecularassemblies.com/press-releases/molecular-assemblies-ships-to-sixthcustomer-%20oligonucleotides-generated-by-fully-enzymatic-dna-synthesis-technology/\">Molecular Assemblies</a>.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref4\">[4]</a> See this <a href=\"https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/benchtop-dna-synthesis-devices-capabilities-biosecurity-implications-and-governance/\">NTI paper</a> for discussion.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref5\">[5]</a> For detailed discussion of the risks of synthetic biology see this <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/24890/biodefense-in-the-age-of-synthetic-biology\">report</a>.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref6\">[6]</a> See these links for the <a href=\"https://www.vertic.org/programmes/nim/biological-weapons-and-materials/bwc-legislation-database/\">BWC implementation database</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/sc/1540/national-implementation/1540-matrices/committee-approved-matrices.shtml\">UNSCR 1540 implementation database</a>.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref7\">[7]</a> I have obtained this summary of the history from a <a href=\"https://scholar.valpo.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2217&amp;context=vulr\">paper by Stephen Maurer</a>.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref8\">[8]</a> See the appendices of <a href=\"https://www.nti.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Biosecurity_Innovation_and_Risk_Reduction.pdf\">this paper</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/benchtop-dna-synthesis-devices-capabilities-biosecurity-implications-and-governance/\">this paper</a>.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref9\">[9]</a> This point is mentioned briefly in <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4226081\">this paper</a> at pg 13, although I haven\u2019t taken the time yet to verify the papers it cites in support.

The balls represent possible ideas, discoveries, technological inventions.

The cumulative effect on the human condition has so far been overwhelmingly positive, and may be much better still in the future.</p><p>What we haven\u2019t extracted, so far, is a black ball: a technology that invariably or by default destroys the civilization that invents it.

But for these balls to cause harm, they must \u201cfall into the wrong hands\u201d, so to speak. It seems plausible to that the JoDI could cause a drop in the rate of <strong>dark balls</strong> grabbed or possessed by bad actors because more good actors will be reaching for <strong>dark balls</strong> (assuming large numbers of people are aware of the JoDI and attempting to publish in it). While too much oversight defeats the entire purpose of the journal, it might make sense to have some kind of initial screening process whereby sufficiently dangerous <strong>black balls</strong> can be kept under wraps and routed to the appropriate authorities/experts. This screening process presents its own serious concerns and questions (who watches the watchers?), but it should still increase the chances that a <strong>black ball</strong> is pulled in the safest possible manner. For lighter and less dangerous orbs, publication can obviate the idea\u2019s element of surprise and give us a head start on developing new safety or security technologies, regulations, counter-arguments, cultural movements, etc.</p><h2>White Balls</h2><p>H. P. Lovecraft, writing to Edwin Baird, the first editor of <i>Weird Tales</i>:</p><blockquote><p>Popular authors do not and apparently cannot appreciate the fact that true art is obtainable only by rejecting normality and conventionality in toto, and approaching a theme purged utterly of any usual or preconceived point of view. Wild and \u201cdifferent\u201d as they may consider their quasi-weird products, it remains a fact that the bizarrerie is on the surface alone; and that basically they reiterate the same old conventional values and motives and perspectives. Good and evil, teleological illusion, sugary sentiment, anthropocentric psychology\u2014the usual superficial stock in trade, and all shot through with the eternal and inescapable commonplace\u2026.</p><p>Whoever wrote a story from the point of view that man is a blemish on the cosmos, who ought to be eradicated? As an example\u2014a young man I know lately told me that he means to write a story about a scientist who wishes to dominate the earth, and who to accomplish his ends trains and overdevelops germs\u2026and leads armies of them in the manner of the Egyptian plagues. I told him that although this theme has promise, it is made utterly commonplace by assigning the scientist a normal motive. There is nothing <i>outr\u00e9 </i>about wanting to conquer the earth; Alexander, Napoleon, and Wilhelm II wanted to do that. Instead, I told my friend, he should conceive a man with a morbid, frantic, shuddering hatred of the life-principle itself, who wishes to extirpate from the planet every trace of biological organism, animal and vegetable alike, including himself. That would be tolerably original. But after all, originality lies with the author. One can\u2019t write a weird story of real power without perfect psychological detachment from the human scene, and a magic prism of imagination which suffuses theme and style alike with that grotesquerie and disquieting distortion characteristic of morbid vision. Only a cynic can create horror\u2014for behind every masterpiece of the sort must reside a driving demonic force that despises the human race and its illusions, and longs to pull them to pieces and mock them.</p></blockquote><p>Lovecraft\u2019s argument for the novelty of a truly pessimistic perspective also applies to the general pursuit of ideas: all of human thought and activity is tilted towards goodness\u2014towards pleasure, happiness, flourishing, sunshine, rainbows, kittens; we rarely, if ever, gaze into the abyss in a sustained and systematic manner; the black forests and swamps of the landscape of ideas are under-explored; we sometimes stumble upon detrimental ideas in the happy valleys and sunny meadows of idea-land, so it would stand to reason that we might also stumble upon the most wondrous and beneficent ideas while exploring darker terrain; if \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_road_to_hell_is_paved_with_good_intentions\"><u>the road to hell is paved with good intentions</u></a>\u201d, then <i>ipso facto</i> the road to heaven is paved with bad intentions; <i>QED</i>.</p><h2><strong>ALL THE BALLS</strong></h2><p>Is <i>The Journal of Dangerous Ideas</i> a bad idea? Yeah, probably.</p><p>But we can\u2019t know for sure. And what I do know for sure is that we didn\u2019t get this far by playing it safe or playing scared.</p><p>We got this far by playing to <strong>WIN.</strong> We got this far by putting all of our <strong>SKIN IN THE GAME </strong>and playing for <strong>KEEPS</strong>. We got this far by going <strong>BALLS TO THE WALL</strong> and putting the <strong>PEDAL TO THE METAL</strong>.</p><h3>So how do we want to go out?</h3><p>Do we want to timidly grope around for white balls until we accidentally (but inevitably) grab a <strong>black ball</strong>? Or do we want to reach for <strong>ALL THE BALLS</strong> and go out in a <strong>BLAZE OF GLORY</strong> with our guns <strong>BLAZING</strong>?</p><p><strong>Do we want to slowly fade away or rage against the dying of the light?</strong></p><p><strong>Do we want to go out like cowards or go wildly into that good night?</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qSWNnTNdBhcsSotgi/fk4l94voc0emluwuvgrn\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qSWNnTNdBhcsSotgi/wzjkvgbqmjc2aeojctwf 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qSWNnTNdBhcsSotgi/zfggqglpy3exkvtvedv6 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qSWNnTNdBhcsSotgi/gqmjvzw2o1l5gcdaxcnu 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qSWNnTNdBhcsSotgi/fk4l94voc0emluwuvgrn 1456w\"><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><hr><p>(To answer the obvious question: No, I do not have any current plans to actually found the JoDI, so if anyone is feeling sufficiently inspired, then by all means go for it.

It will displace many jobs that deal with words and symbols, or make them less lucrative, or just make those who hold them less influential. Knowing how to write well won\u2019t be as valuable a skill five years from now, because AI can improve the quality of just about any text. Being bilingual (or tri- or quadrilingual, for that matter) will also be less useful, and that too has been a marker of highly educated status. Even if AIs can\u2019t write better books than human authors, readers may prefer to spend their time talking to AIs rather than reading.</p><p>It is worth pausing to note how profound and unprecedented this development would be. For centuries, the Western world has awarded higher status to what I will call ideas people \u2014 those who are good at developing, expressing and putting into practice new ways of thinking. The <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/scientific-revolution-a-very-short-introduction-9780199567416?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;\"><u>Scientific</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-16/industrial-revolution-comparisons-aren-t-comforting?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIiPWu0crxgwMVtFsPAh3HlQ9zEAMYASAAEgKauPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;utm_campaign=NB_ENG_DSAXX_DSAXXXXXXXXXX_EVG_XXXX_XXX_COUSA_EN_EN_X_BLOM_GO_SE_XXX_XXXXXXXXXX&amp;utm_medium=cpc_search&amp;sref=EP6bV7CS\"><u>Industrial</u></a> revolutions greatly increased the reach and influence of ideas people.</p><p>AI may put that trend into reverse. It is not hard to imagine a world, less than 20 years from now, in which a skilled carpenter is seen to have better prospects \u2014 professional and otherwise \u2014 than an articulate lawyer.</p></blockquote><p>As a wordcel myself, I find this prediction concerning. The \u201c<a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/existential-risk-and-the-turn-in-human-history.html\"><u>moving history</u></a>\u201d of the scientific and industrial revolutions is worrying enough, but as Tyler said, at least they increased the returns to ideas people in the long run. Collapsing institutions, international arms races, <i>and </i>a permanent decrease in the rewards for my skills just sounds terrible. I am not a good carpenter!</p><p>But will this prediction really come true?</p><p>On one hand, almost all of AI\u2019s realized impact so far and the closest technological analogies to AI point to it being a complement, rather than a substitute to \u201cthose who are good at developing, expressing and putting into practice new ways of thinking.\u201d</p><p>We are still in the very early days of AI development. Still, the current uses of nascent AI tech is evidence for what the future will bring. So far, AI has been complementary to knowledge work. It makes <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/unleashing-developer-productivity-with-generative-ai\"><u>software developers twice as fast</u></a> on some tasks and <a href=\"https://www.marketingaiinstitute.com/blog/ai-future-of-work\"><u>improves the quality and speed of consultants</u></a>. In my personal experience its a very useful complement to my research and coding, allowing me to work and produce more.</p><p>As AI matures, this may change. Scribes and illuminators were complements to printing in the early days of the press when illustrations and complicated formatting were more difficult, but it didn\u2019t last.</p><p>We do have some good reasons to expect the complementarity between AI and ideas people to continue, though. Google search is perhaps the most precise analogy to more mature AI tech we have and has been a massive boon to idea producers. Google uses AI to interpret user prompts and turn them into high quality text and images. This technology replaced some previously important research skills, but ultimately it is a positive multiplier on the productivity and influence of ideas people. Tyler says the printing press is one of the better analogies for AI and that too made idea producers better off in the long run.</p><p>On the other hand, even if we grant that AI is a productivity enhancing tool for ideas people rather than a competing substitute it could still be very difficult to be an idea producer in the future. Think about farming and the industrial revolution. Mechanization brought massive productivity enhancements to farmers but the number of farmers dwindled. Today, farmers have good per capita incomes and influence but are a small proportion of the economy as whole.</p><p>Comparative advantage makes me confident that there will be some room left for humans in the world even if AIs become super-human agents. But we might not like our comparative advantage. It seems plausible to me that human comparative advantage is in moving around in physical 3D space.

I am working for a social enterprise and in the five years I\u2019ve been here I tried to estimate impact a couple of times and always gave up frustrated.</p><p>In this article I am trying to turn impact estimation around: Instead of trying to estimate impact from detailed bottom-up models, I will take a top-down approach and work with one measure that works for almost anything: money. At its heart, money represents value delivered and I want to see how far we can take this to estimate impact.</p><p>I will guide you through this in three steps that you can also follow and adjust in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_CGC6tWrzZMyxj5SFgzEXxG5d03SopaBr9Jk5vfGSuY/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>this spreadsheet</u></a>: We will start with estimating the impact of a donation to GiveDirectly. From this we will derive income-weighted revenue as a proxy measure for impact. With this we can then estimate the impact of a market stand as a simple example and then generalize to any organization<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0560goe8z5w5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0560goe8z5w5\">[1]</a></sup></span>, any job, and the impact of shareholders. Finally we\u2019ll try to apply this approach to a few examples, look at the extremes, and see how everything holds up.</p><h1>The impact of a cash transfer</h1><p>Let\u2019s start with estimating the impact of a donation to GiveDirectly. Most readers are probably familiar with the relation between income and life satisfaction: Life satisfaction is highly correlated to the logarithm of income - at low income levels life satisfaction grows fast with income while at high income levels extra income will have almost no effect on life satisfaction. This holds both when compared between countries and for different income levels within countries. As an illustration, see the gray country-lines in the background of<i> Figure 1</i> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#the-link-across-countries\"><u>Our World In Data</u></a> for more details on this.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pjjxarmwkY8D5KvDc/tnhgpyf35vdfiiufok4e\"><figcaption><i><strong>Figure 1: The impact of a cash transfer</strong> The life satisfaction loss when donating money at a high income is much smaller than the life satisfaction gain of receiving that money at a low income. At this scale, the loss (right/top orange to cyan) is barely readable in the diagram while the gain (left/bottom orange to cyan) is significant. Note that income is on a logarithmic scale. Background image:&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction#the-link-across-countries\"><i><u>Our World In Data</u></i></a></figcaption></figure><p>We can use this relationship to estimate the impact of donating to GiveDirectly: Let\u2019s say we are looking at a pool of donors whose average yearly income is $50k. That would mean they have, on average, a life satisfaction of about 6.9 Life Satisfaction Points (LSP). Then when they donate ten percent of their income in one year, they are left with $45k and a corresponding life satisfaction of 6.8 LSP for that year because on a log-scale, there is really no big difference between $45k and $50k. If, however, they donate this money to GiveDirectly we shift down on the log-scale and give $5k each at about ~90% efficiency (so ~$4.5k) to a recipient community with an average yearly income of maybe $1k. Let\u2019s assume GiveDirectly gives money in $1k batches (see&nbsp;<i>Figure 1</i> for an illustration of the effect of one $1k batch), then the life satisfaction gained for these $1k batches for that year in that community is the difference between life satisfaction at $2k and $1k, so 4.3 LSP - 3.7 LSP = 0.6 LSP. So the net impact of the donor pool\u2019s donation is ($5k * 0.9) * (0.6 LSP/y / 1k$) - 0.1 LSP/y ~ 2.5 LSP/y. While they lose on average 0.1 LSP/y, the recipient community of his donation gains on average 2.6 LSP/y per person - a pretty good trade.</p><p>What GiveDirectly effectively does is to offer an arbitrage service for life satisfaction: Life satisfaction is cheaper in low-income countries, so by moving your money there, you get more life satisfaction for the same total money spent. On top of this, the donor pool probably also receive life satisfaction simply from the act of donating. We will have a look at that later when discussing <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pjjxarmwkY8D5KvDc/#Edge_cases_and_implications\">edge cases and implications</a>.</p><p>In this section we implicitly created a measure for life satisfaction changes: Life Satisfaction Points per Year or LSP/y. This measure has already been established by the World Happiness Report as <a href=\"https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2021/living-long-and-living-well-the-wellby-approach/\"><u>WELLBY</u></a> (Well Being Year) can be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-book-supplementary-guidance-wellbeing\"><u>defined as</u></a> \u201ca one-point change in life satisfaction on a 0-10 scale, per person per year.\u201d We will use WELLBY from here onwards.</p><p>Note that the WELLBY&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/research/cost-effectiveness-analysis-methodology/\"><u>framework</u></a> has already been used in a detailed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/cash-transfers-cost-effectiveness-analysis/\"><u>study</u></a> on cash transfers which has shown that a $1k lump-sum cash transfer to low- and middle income countries leads to a WELLBY (or LSP/y) of around 1.1, so even more optimistic than our 0.6. This might be because one-off bumps in income might have outsized effects compared to living steady on a higher income.</p><h1>Money spent given an income level as a proxy for impact delivered</h1><p>Just giving $1k to somebody who so far had a $1k income doesn\u2019t automatically increase their life satisfaction, though. Life satisfaction increases because this money represents things and services they can buy with it. How exactly do the two relate? Let\u2019s assume that the $1k will be spent on school fees, food, clothes, data bundles, and some alcohol. We have no way of knowing how these contribute to the donation recipient\u2019s life satisfaction. Maybe the alcohol is needed for a family celebration, maybe the food is unhealthy, maybe the data bundles are needed to search for jobs. The great thing is that we don\u2019t need to know: GiveDirectly has demonstrated that people in general make responsible choices with their money, given the situation they are in.</p><p>If we generalize this and assume that the money spent, on average, represents the value to the person making the purchase, then we can assume that the person\u2019s life satisfaction can be attributed to the spending of their income. So in the example of somebody who has $1k of yearly income and an average life satisfaction of 3, we can assume that, on average, each dollar spent leads to a life satisfaction increase of 0.003 WELLBY.</p><p>We can then turn this around and look at it from the company\u2019s perspective: A company makes a lot of individual sales and if we assume that each sale corresponds to a life satisfaction increase of the customer, then the sum of all their sales (revenue), weighted by the income their customers, should be their total impact. So while donations can on some level be seen as a \u201ctrade\u201d in&nbsp;<i>potential</i> life satisfaction, the impact for the life satisfaction itself should be attributed to whoever&nbsp;<i>realizes</i> this potential by selling goods and services that are consumed.</p><p>If you, like most people first reading this, feel like we took a lot of leaps of faith in the last two paragraphs, see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pjjxarmwkY8D5KvDc#Appendix\">Appendix 1</a> where I go into common concerns from previous discussions on this concept, for example market failures, public goods and first vs last dollar spent. If you first want to form more intuitions on this, let\u2019s look at how this plays out in the example of buying a fish at a market stand:</p><h1>Example: The impact from buying a fish at a market stand</h1><p>By using money spent as a proxy for impact, we can calculate the impact of any company just by looking at their revenue and the income level of their customers. Let\u2019s start with the example of a fish market stand (see Figure 2): By selling a fish for $1 to somebody who lives on $1k/y, we can approximate the impact in terms of life satisfaction changes for one person for one year (WELLBY) of that fish as $1/$1000 times the average life satisfaction points (LSP) of somebody with $1k/y: 3 LSP. The impact of eating that fish should therefore be on average 0.003 WELLBY. The person buying that fish should, on a yearly population average, be 0.003 WELLBY more satisfied after eating that fish. Note that while this example is set on an individual level for the purpose of visualization, the calculations will only start approximating the average values for larger sample sizes.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pjjxarmwkY8D5KvDc/fncvtiqw3xawey1wum47\"><figcaption><i><strong>Figure 2: The impact of buying a fish at a market stand.</strong> Bold text is value in $, light text is value in WELLBY. When somebody with an average income of $1k/y buys a fish (center), we can assign the proportional WELLBYs to everything that contributed to that sale (right). Note that the impact from eating the fish ($1 * 3 WELLBY/$1000 = 0.003 WELLBY) is not the same as the impact generated from the buyer\u2019s income streams (left) as those incomes could have come from higher-income consumers, or from donations, or simply from a badly managed business.</i></figcaption></figure><p>We can now take these 0.003 WELLBY generated from eating the fish and attribute them to all contributors of the fish sale - some go to the fisher who actually got the fish (who in turn needed to buy some line &amp; bait), some go to the government because we need to pay taxes on the sale, some might go to the market stand investment, and hopefully at the end there will be some profit from the sale, which represents impact generated by the owner of the stand. So while the stand owner sold the fish, they can only claim $0.15 or 0.00045 WELLBY worth of impact in the example of the figure, because that\u2019s their profit.</p><p>Note that the impact generated from eating this fish is not the same as the impact that the buyer of the fish generated with the dollar they used to buy the fish. In the example in Figure 2, the total WELLBY attributed to the buyer from the work that earned them the 1$ is 0.002 WELLBY while the total WELLBY attributed to others from their consumption of the fish is 0.003 WELLBY. The impact they had generated with that dollar depends on how they earned that dollar - maybe by working for a company that sold services to wealthier customers, therefore generating less life satisfaction, or maybe they received it as a donation, or maybe they actually had some negative impact from a loss-making business they own.&nbsp;</p><p>To get the total impact of running the market stand for the owner, we can make some assumptions: Let\u2019s say they sell $25 in fish per day, resulting in $3.75 in profit, representing 0.011 WELLBY, then over the course of a year the stand owner generates around 4 WELLBY - similar to the life satisfaction of one person living on $1k.</p><h1>Estimating an organization\u2019s impact from their revenue streams</h1><p>In the following section I will refer to some concepts from finance. If you need a refresher, check <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pjjxarmwkY8D5KvDc#Appendix\">Appendix 2</a>. The great thing is that we can re-use a lot of long-established concepts and readily available data from finance because they had a long interest in measuring the revenue (~ value delivered) of companies. As before, check&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_CGC6tWrzZMyxj5SFgzEXxG5d03SopaBr9Jk5vfGSuY/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>the spreadsheet</u></a> to follow along.</p><h2>Current impact of an organization and impact of a job or supplier</h2><p>To generalize from the market stand to any organization, we simply group the organization\u2019s customers in customer segments and calculate the \u201cimpact per dollar spent\u201d for that segment given their average income and corresponding average life satisfaction. By multiplying that number with the revenue in that segment that year, we get the total impact delivered in that year.</p><p>Against this we have the total cost to generate that impact: The sum of wages, supplier costs, etc. (operating expenditure), depreciation and amortization (to account for the effect of previous investments the company made to achieve this year\u2019s impact), and any other costs (e.g., loan interest). Finally, we have the profit (revenue minus cost) for that year. We can now split the impact across all these points to attribute their proportional part of the impact.</p><p>For most people, the impact of their job is probably most interesting. For this, as for any other cost, we simply take the cost of your job to the company ($50k in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_CGC6tWrzZMyxj5SFgzEXxG5d03SopaBr9Jk5vfGSuY\">spreadsheet</a> example) and multiply this with the average impact per dollar spent given the revenue stream mix (0.000323 WELLBY/$&nbsp; in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_CGC6tWrzZMyxj5SFgzEXxG5d03SopaBr9Jk5vfGSuY\">spreadsheet</a> example) and arrive at the impact attributable to your job (16 WELLBY - more than five times the WELLBY that hypothetical person gets from donating 10% of their income - partly because the hypothetical company is active in low-income segments).</p><p>Note that we\u2019re applying a similar efficient market hypothesis here: We assume that your salary should roughly reflect the value you add to the company. However, many companies have fixed salary bands that are supposed to capture the average while often individuals outperform colleagues by a factor of 2 or 3. So when trying this excel on your own job, just adjust the fudge factor as you believe is right. Just keep in mind that if you fudge it up, somebody else has to fudge theirs down to keep the total impact the same. If you can\u2019t think of a person who should fudge theirs down, then you probably shouldn\u2019t fudge your\u2019s up.</p><p>Note that some costs, including your job, might be amortized or depreciated over time to reflect their impact over multiple years, which would make this calculation more complex. However, if we assume that revenue segments don\u2019t change significantly over these years (typically 3-5 years), we can skip this and just multiply your cost with the impact per dollar metric. I made this assumption in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_CGC6tWrzZMyxj5SFgzEXxG5d03SopaBr9Jk5vfGSuY\">spreadsheet</a> to keep things simple.</p><p>Apart from the impact of your job, the second most interesting personal impact lever is probably impact from shares. For shareholder impact in a given year, we can take their fractional ownership of the organization to distribute the impact from profits or losses. In the example in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_CGC6tWrzZMyxj5SFgzEXxG5d03SopaBr9Jk5vfGSuY\">spreadsheet</a>, the startup is still loss-making, so we go from 16 WELLBY to only 14 WELLBY impact that year.</p><h2>Future impact of an organization and impact of shareholders</h2><p>So far, we estimated the impact of an organization in a given year. However, for anybody holding shares in a company, the future impact/revenue is often what is more interesting as that could be much larger.</p><p>To get the future impact, we start with estimating the future revenue splits from different income segments in line with the organization\u2019s strategy. Having done that, all we have to do is to take the company value (from valuations or stock market information, see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pjjxarmwkY8D5KvDc#Appendix\">Appendix 2</a>), spread it over the income segments, and calculate the resulting impact. One way to think of company value is that it represents discounted future profits - in our case these represent discounted future impact.</p><p>To then get the value from shares in the company, we just take the fraction of shares times the calculated future impact. In the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_CGC6tWrzZMyxj5SFgzEXxG5d03SopaBr9Jk5vfGSuY\">spreadsheet</a> example, that ends at 15 WELLBY from $50k of shares at a valuation of $20M and a revenue split that moved to Europe from Africa.</p><h1>Edge cases and implications</h1><p>You learn most about a model by trying to break it. I discovered a few interesting edge cases while working on this:</p><h2>As an employee, your impact is bound by your salary</h2><p>In this model, the impact of an employee is their salary times the life satisfaction per dollar of the income segment they are working for. If the revenue or impact generated is higher, it is assigned to the shareholder as part of their profits, if it is lower, it is assigned to the shareholder as part of their losses. Therefore the maximal impact an employee can have is limited by the minimal revenue segment one can work for - let\u2019s assume that is $1k/y income with WELLBY/$ of 0.003. At $100k/y income, that means a maximal impact of 300 WELLBY - about as much as the Life Satisfaction for a year of 75 people living on $1k or 37 people living on $100k. That\u2019s pretty high, but it\u2019s also pretty difficult to find a job that makes a lot of money with a lot of poor people at scale.</p><p>Compare this to the upper bound of working for a company whose main revenue comes from people living on $100k/y. WELLBY/$ is about 8 WELLBY/$100k = 0.00008. At $100k/y income we're then back at 8 WELLBY impact from the job. A factor of almost 40x vs the 300 WELLBY from the similarly paid job for the $1k/y income population.</p><h2>Safaricom is the most impactful company in Kenya</h2><p>Speaking of making a lot of money with a lot of poor people at scale: Safaricom, the TelCo and mobile money provider of Kenya, is doing exactly that and is therefore arguably the most impactful company of Kenya. They made more than $1.5B in revenue last year. At 5% profits and an assumed average income of $5k with 0.0009 WELLBY per dollar, that would result in about 70k WELLBY in \u201cimpact profits\u201d for shareholders last year. If we had more data on revenue with each income segment, we could do more precise estimates. This outcome of the model also matches public perception - their mobile money product has been frequently pointed to as one of the most impactful things happening to the population in the last decades.</p><h2>Does this make Elon Musk the most impactful person alive?</h2><p>Elon Musk\u2019s net worth is somewhere around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2024/01/31/elon-musk-no-longer-worlds-richest-after-judge-voids-51-billion-pay-package/\"><u>$180B</u></a>. He is competing for the title of the richest person with the luxury goods entrepreneur Bernard Arnault and Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos. Elon\u2019s wealth primarily comes from his shares in SpaceX (including Starlink) and Tesla, with some wealth also from his shares in The Boring Company, Twitter/X, Neuralink and x.ai. He also co-founded PayPal and OpenAI.</p><p>In this framework, we would estimate Elon\u2019s impact by taking his wealth per company, then splitting the company\u2019s revenue by income segment, and proportionally attributing impact. To keep things simple, let\u2019s just assume here that most people consuming Elon\u2019s products, directly or indirectly, are middle-to-upper-class Western people, with an average income of $50k/y. This is probably lower than the average consumer of Bernard Arnault\u2019s products (mainly LVMH luxury goods like Louis Vuitton handbags) but higher than the average customer of Jeff Bezos - as both Amazon and AWS services are used by a much broader population than Tesla drivers, Starlink users, and other people benefiting from SpaceX. An income of $50k/y would roughly translate to a life satisfaction of 7, so 0.00014 WELLBY/$.</p><p>$180B * 0.00014 WELLBY/$ would give us about 25M WELLBY. What is that? If we divide by 7 to conservatively approximate an average European life-year, we get 3.5M - about the size of Berlin. So the wealth of Elon is approximately the impact of the full life satisfaction of Berlin for a year.</p><p>Does this make him the most impactful person alive? Not really, because we are only looking at the impact on life satisfaction here, not on climate or our survival as a species, to name just two other causes. While he claims that his work also supports these causes, much more detailed analyses would be necessary to establish this. And even if we were only concerned about impact on life satisfaction, there could be somebody much further down on the Forbes list who makes most of their money with lower-income customers. Finally, we didn\u2019t adjust for any negative impact that Musk\u2019s companies might have on public goods or other market failures that aren\u2019t factored into the price of his products. I don\u2019t want to make the call on this here but looking at the industries of other Forbes billionaires, it seems to me he comes out better than most from that perspective.</p><h2>Shareholders can have negative impact</h2><p>In this model, profit represents the impact going to the shareholders of the company. For profitable companies this seems intuitive - after all suppliers and employees got their share of the impact proportional to their cost, the extra value created should go to the owner of the business.</p><p>What\u2019s a bit less intuitive is that in the case that you don\u2019t make a profit but a loss, you have a negative impact as a shareholder. More importantly, your negative impact is higher if you run a business in a low-income market than in a high-income market, just as your impact profit would\u2019ve also been higher in a low-income market, even if you had the same revenue and cost in money terms. I think this makes sense: You are promising high impact to employees and suppliers so if you can\u2019t hold these promises you should also be held accountable for them. As an entrepreneur or investor you take the risk - that can be both positive and negative.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pjjxarmwkY8D5KvDc#Appendix\">Appendix 2</a> for a more detailed discussion on negative impact.</p><h2>This model can guide impact attribution of NGOs</h2><p>In simple terms, an NGO is a company that can\u2019t pay profits to shareholders but instead re-invests them in the company. In that frame, a donation is revenue and the goods sold are their \"primariy impact\" - lobbying efforts (policy NGOs), money transfers (GiveDirectly), immunization campaigns, etc.</p><p>In our framework, this implies that the impact we are measuring is the effect on life satisfaction of the donor as they are buying the NGO's products. The more the donor donates, the more it should have a positive effect on their life satisfaction<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefltzp6pgkdha\"><sup><a href=\"#fnltzp6pgkdha\">[2]</a></sup></span>. While this sounds counterintuitive, it fits at least some of the data - for a long time donors were not really interested in measuring the impact of their donations but rather in donating for causes they were personally attached to, were donating for status reasons etc.</p><p>We can reconcile this with modern impact measuring though: The \u201cmarket\u201d for donations simply changed in the last years, valuing the primary impact more so that donors now get more life satisfaction from knowing that they donated to causes that actually have very large primary impact. If the donation market keeps developing like this, then particularly impactful NGOs should be able to raise \u201cprices\u201d, raise salary of staff to attract talent and incentivise high performance. At the same time demand for good, bottom-up impact models of NGOs should rise as those can be used to command more donations.</p><p>The donor can then claim the primary impact, because they paid for it, and the NGO and its employees can claim the secondary impact -the increase in life satisfaction of the donor. The consultants doing the donation impact estimation study can also claim part of the secondary impact based on the fees they charge for the study.</p><p>Let\u2019s apply this to GiveDirectly again - simply because their business model is so simple and easy to understand. What happens when they \u201csell\u201d impact for a transaction fee? For every $1k donated, you get ~$0.9k donated (primary impact attributed to the donor calculated above) and they get $0.1k in gross margin, which they would use to pay, and assign secondary impact to, employees and suppliers. Let\u2019s assume most of GiveDirectly\u2019s donors are fairly affluent with $50k/y, so 0.00014 WELLBY/$. If you work at GiveDirectly as a Software Developer earning $100k, you would have an impact of 14 WELLBY - more than their own life satisfaction at around 8 (on average) because we assumed the average donor earns less than the software developer.</p><h1>Summary: Theory of change</h1><p>NGOs often model impact with theories of change. The advantage of these is that it makes it very clear how causal links are supposed to run - the disadvantage is that they often get very complex and are difficult to compare between organizations. To summarize the model discussions so far, I am proposing a very simple theory of change: Impact on life satisfaction comes from consuming goods and services, and this allows using money as a proxy KPI.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pjjxarmwkY8D5KvDc/ihftjuvti0inu1fuvjxk\"><figcaption><i><strong>Figure 3: Theory of change.&nbsp;</strong>Consumer (top): Life satisfaction results from consumption of goods &amp; services. Company (middle): Life satisfaction increases (impact) are due to consumption of goods and services (outcome) which result from work, capital, and environment together producing these with secondary outcomes on capital and environment. \u201cEnvironment\u201d refers to any external factors beyond Labor and Capital, which can include nature, society, and other factors. Donor (bottom): While donations lead to life satisfaction decreases for the donor due to less consumption as described in the section on GiveDirectly, it also leads to a donor life satisfaction increase from the act of donating, which can be attributed to NGOs as explored in the section on edge cases.</i></figcaption></figure><h1>Conclusion</h1><h2>This is a simple and generic approach to impact measurement and attribution</h2><p>We started the article saying that impact estimation usually suffers from complex theories of change, cherry-picked KPIs that can\u2019t be compared across organizations, assigning the same impact to more than one actor and missing studies to back it up.</p><p>I hope that with this approach I was able to convince you that by framing impact as income-weighted revenue, converted to Well Being Years (WELLBY), we can solve all of these: The calculation fits in a single spreadsheet, the theory of change is straightforward, we have one KPI that would be the same for all organizations, we avoid the double-counting because money can only be spent once and there are plenty of studies to back up the income-life-satisfaction relationship. The only numbers needed can all be found on a company's income statement and balance sheet, except for revenue splits by income segment, but those can be easily estimated.</p><p>It might be less fine-grained than a detailed bottom-up analysis, but I think the benefits largely outweigh the lost granularity, at least for the 99% of organizations that don\u2019t sell impact as a product but still want to estimate their impact. For the 1% of organizations who actually sell impact as a product (like GiveDirectly and most NGOs), their impact on the life satisfaction of their customers/donors is different from their primary impact-product they have, which of course needs more detailed measurement and justification to help their customers choose.</p><h2>Please give this a try</h2><p>Still skeptical? Already convinced? Either way, I\u2019d love it if you could just make a copy of the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_CGC6tWrzZMyxj5SFgzEXxG5d03SopaBr9Jk5vfGSuY\">spreadsheet</a>, try to estimate your job or a job you\u2019re interested in, and just send me the results. I\u2019d be curious to see how this holds up in reality. I\u2019m guessing that max 1-2 people will actually do this, so if you are thinking about it, please do it - it\u2019ll take 10 minutes. I\u2019ll update in the comments on the outcomes.</p><h1>Appendix</h1><h2>Appendix 1: Previously raised concerns on the relationship between revenue and impact</h2><p>Before we dive in: I am not arguing that there is a perfect relationship between the two. I also would\u2019ve never thought that I would write an article proposing free-market neoliberal reasoning to estimate social impact. But it turns out that money exists for a reason, and that is to have an easy way to compare value delivered between very different goods and services. That\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re looking for when trying to estimate impact. Nevertheless, I of course had concerns and came accross them again and again while discussing this with others so let me share my thoughts on them.</p><h3>Market failures and public goods</h3><p>The most common criticism of this approach is that companies do a lot of harm by exploiting public goods, building monopolies, evading tax, being corrupt, tricking customers into addictions or other forms of dependencies on the company, neglecting long-term effects of their products, and other unethical behaviors. This is barely accounted for in the company's revenue because most customers don\u2019t or cannot take these factors into account when making purchasing decisions. I fully acknowledge these and added a \u201cfudge factor\u201d to the model to manually adjust the impact delivered. If you estimate the impact of a multinational, you probably want to apply some fudge factor as they are usually able to drive down prices with monopoly powers, lobbying, and other things that go against free market assumptions.</p><p>Estimating this fudge factor is of course a whole other discussion but when using this framework to get a rough comparison between different options, and not for getting a final precise absolute value on imapct, I think this is good enough as a first step.</p><h3>What if the price doesn\u2019t reflect its impact?</h3><p>Assuming we have accounted for market failures, what would happen if the price of a good didn\u2019t represent its value to the buyer, for example because it is much more expensive or much cheaper than the value it represents? In those cases, consumers would either stop buying the item and go for a cheaper substitute, or buy so much that eventually production can\u2019t keep up and prices increase. What if there is no cheaper substitute? For example a piece of bread costs ten times as much because there is a food shortage? Then in that case I\u2019d argue it all of a sudden represents a higher value and impact on life satisfaction than before because of the shortage. What about things that are just very expensive to produce but have not a high effect on life satisfaction? Then nobody will buy them - people close to poverty usually don\u2019t buy a jacuzzi.&nbsp;</p><h3>First dollar vs last dollar spent</h3><p>One could assume that the \u201cfirst dollar\u201d spent, maybe on water, doesn\u2019t give the same life satisfaction as the last dollar 1000 spent, maybe on school fees. After all, there exists the log-relationship between income and life satisfaction. Interestingly, for all practical purposes we don\u2019t see this happening. People spend in general 30% of their income on housing, not an absolute amount on for example a very small wooden hut and then the rest on other categories. The same applies to most other categories (see e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/247420/percentage-of-annual-us-consumer-spending-by-income-quintiles/\"><u>US</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1288727/distribution-of-household-expenditure-in-kenya-by-category/#:~:text=Households%20in%20Kenya%20allocated%20roughly,percent%20of%20the%20household%20budget.\"><u>Kenya</u></a>). Only the percentage spent on food goes down a bit, and even there people don\u2019t \u201clayer\u201d by buying the cheapest rice and then add other things but just \u201cspend more\u201d on food as their income increases. So while in principle some parts of the spending should give more life satisfaction than other parts, in practice we see spending increasing on all categories simultaneously while income increases, suggesting that we can assume a \u201csimilar enough\u201d relationship between each dollar spent and life satisfaction received, given a yearly income.</p><h3>Absolute vs relative impact</h3><p>Finally, one might suggest that we should look at marginal impact instead of absolute impact here. For example we shouldn\u2019t take the full price of a service as its impact but only some relative measure of how much better it is vs the next best service. I decided against this for a few reasons: First, it is intractable as it doesn\u2019t stop at the next best service but of course that next service should only get the marginal impact vs the one following that one etc. Second, price difference wouldn\u2019t be the only factor influencing impact but also quality, proximity, and a lot of other measures, which are automatically included when we \u201cjust\u201d look at a purchase because they all went into the purchasing decision. Last, we also don\u2019t pay some money to the next best product when buying the best product - it seems like an absurd idea. Value was delivered by the person whom the service was bought from, not by the next-best person.</p><h3>Self-reported life satisfaction is an ordinal scale</h3><p>In this article we implicitly convert an ordinal measure (self-reported life satisfaction score on a scale from 1-10) to an interval scale. What does this mean? Each number on the ordinal scale represents a category that is higher or lower than the others, but the intervals between the numbers might not represent equal increments of satisfaction. For instance, the difference in life satisfaction between a score of 2 and 3 might not be the same as the difference between 8 and 9. However when starting to add them up and taking increments we implicitly assume that they are the same. I don\u2019t have a better answer than ChatGPT here:</p><blockquote><p>Despite these limitations, researchers often treat such scales as quasi-interval scales for practical purposes, especially in large-scale surveys and studies. This approach allows for the use of parametric statistical methods that can provide more nuanced insights into the data, under the assumption that with large sample sizes, individual differences in scale interpretation might average out.</p></blockquote><p>Other than that, I\u2019ll appeal to authority and say that the WELLBY measure is endorsed by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bse.eu/research/world-wellbeing-panel/wellbys\"><u>World Wellbeing Panel</u></a> and by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2021/living-long-and-living-well-the-wellby-approach/\"><u>World Happiness Report</u></a>.</p><h2>Appendix 2: Reusable concepts from finance</h2><p>Because we work with money here, we can borrow a lot of existing data and concepts from finance. Let\u2019s start with the basics: The income statement displays a company's performance during a given year and the balance sheet which keeps track since the company\u2019s founding. A third common concept, the cash flow statement, shows how cash flows operationally, for example how the income statement eventually flows into the balance sheet, but is less relevant here. Most importantly, all these statements are available for any company by law, so are easy to work with.</p><h3>Income Statement (Profit &amp; Loss)</h3><p>In its most basic form, the income statement subtracts all costs from all revenue to arrive at the net gains. From an impact perspective, we interpret this as follows: The total revenue is simply the total impact created, by multiplying the revenue (segments) with the WELLBY/$ of that revenue segment. The costs and the net gains can guide us in how to assign that impact. The most common items probably are: Salaries (how much impact goes to you as an employee), procurement (how much impact goes to suppliers), interest payments (how much of the impact should go to the bank), depreciation and amortization (how much of the impact should be assigned to previous investments), taxes (how much of the impact is based on support from government infrastructure etc), and net gains (how much of the impact goes to the shareholders of the company).</p><h3>Negative Impact</h3><p>Note that by using the cost and net gains to assign the impact to its contributors, we can get the case that net gains are negative, so the shareholders actually have a negative impact. Let\u2019s take the example that we made $100 in revenue with an impact factor of 0.001 WELLBY/$ for a total 0.1 impact but had $1000 in cost for one employee. Net gains are then $-900. The employee should then be assigned $1000 * 0.001 WELLBY/$ = 1 WELLBY impact and the shareholders $-900 * 0.001 WELLBY/$ = -0.9 WELLBY.&nbsp;</p><p>How to interpret this? Basically, the shareholders \u201cpromised\u201d to the employee impact in the form of the salary the employer is paying. Money represents a promise of value, so by giving an employee money, the employer transfers a promise of value generated to the employee. However, not enough value is generated (revenue) to balance that promise, so the employer needs to find other ways to balance that promise - either with value he has generated for others (company savings) or other people\u2019s generated value (loans / investments).</p><p>This can of course be a very rational choice for the shareholders. They might accept negative impact today from investing in development of a product that initially doesn\u2019t generate a lot of revenue/impact in the hopes of eventually becoming profitable and \u201cpaying off\u201d the initial negative impact with more positive impact in the future. This should be reflected in the company value.</p><p>Note that if you feel this doesn\u2019t make sense and the employee should simply get less impact assigned, then in the reverse case that the company makes more money than the employee cost, the employee also needs to be assigned the extra impact, always leaving shareholders without any impact, which would result in nobody taking the risk to start a company or invest in one and the system breaking down.</p><h3>Balance sheet</h3><p>Next to the income statement, we also have the balance sheet. The balance sheet represents what the company owns and owes by balancing three things: Assets - Liabilities = Book Value. I don\u2019t use much of the balance sheet in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_CGC6tWrzZMyxj5SFgzEXxG5d03SopaBr9Jk5vfGSuY\">spreadsheet</a> model but it\u2019s still interesting to look at two examples: Non-current assets are assets that are useful to the company in the future and are valued at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Examples could be equipment bought or software developed. They can be used to calculate the amount of future impact that needs to be assigned to investments. A piece of them flows every year into the income statement through depreciation and amortization. The second concept is Book Value. This is what remains after subtracting assets from liabilities and is roughly the value of what the company would generate if everything would be sold off and all debts paid. This is useful in calculating the \u201cbase\u201d impact stored in a company and for valuing a company.</p><h3>Valuations</h3><p>Finally, we can use the concept of valuations of companies to determine their expected future impact. A valuation should roughly represent the Book Value (see balance sheet) plus expected discounted future profit of a company. Smaller companies get valued when they are sold, the value of publicly traded companies is simply the number of shares * share price (market capitalization). Getting the value of a company that isn\u2019t publicly traded is always a best guess but one \u201ceasy\u201d way is to take a group of recently valued companies (because sold or publicly traded), calculate some multiples like revenue/value or profit/value, try to find patterns, calculate the same for your company and do some adjustments. Sounds inaccurate but this is how it is often done. Another approach would be to build bottom-up models of expected future revenue and discount these to a net present value.</p><p>Both ways of valuating a company are difficult, time-consuming, and require lots of experience - this is why it\u2019s great that for most companies a valuation exists and we don\u2019t have to try to guesstimate future impact from scratch. If we assume this is somewhat accurate, then we can simply translate the value to expected discounted future impact and use that to determine the impact-value of anybody owning shares in a company.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn0560goe8z5w5\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref0560goe8z5w5\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Note that this analysis assumes that consumers can determine the value to them of the product they are buying.

Next, we summarise our <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/newPost#Our_Track_Record\">track record</a> and unpack <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/newPost#Our_Plans\">our plans</a> for the future. Finally, we discuss how we <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/newPost#Risks_and_Mitigations\">mitigate risks</a> that might undermine our theory of change.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>London stands out as an ideal location for&nbsp;<strong>a new AI safety research centre</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Frontier Labs</strong>: It is the only city outside of the Bay Area with offices from all major AI labs (e.g., Google DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta)</li><li><strong>Concentrated and underutilised talent</strong> (e.g., researchers &amp; software engineers), many of whom are keen to contribute to AI safety but are reluctant or unable to relocate to the Bay Area due to visas, partners, family, culture, etc.</li><li><strong>UK Government connections:&nbsp;</strong>The UK government has clearly signalled their concern for the importance of AI safety by hosting the first&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aisafetysummit.gov.uk/\"><u>AI safety summit</u></a>, establishing an AI safety institute, and introducing favourable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2024/01/uk-immigration-changes-to-visitor-rules-youth-mobility-scheme-beginning-31-january-2024\"><u>immigration requirements</u></a> for researchers. Moreover, policy-makers and researchers are all within 30 mins of one another.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Easy transport links</strong>: LISA is ideally located to act as a short-term base for visiting AI safety researchers from the US, Europe, and other parts of the UK who want to visit researchers (and policy-makers) in companies, universities, and governments in and around London, as well as those in Europe.</li><li><strong>Regular cohorts of the&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.matsprogram.org/\"><strong><u>MATS program</u></strong></a> (scholars and mentors) because of the above (in particular, the favourable immigration requirements compared with the US).</li></ul><p>Despite this favourable setting, so far little community infrastructure investment has been made. Therefore, our mission is to build a home for leading AI safety research in London by incubating individual AI safety researchers and small organisations. To achieve this, LISA will:</p><ul><li><strong>Provide a research environment</strong> that is&nbsp;<strong>supportive, productive, and collaborative,&nbsp;</strong>where a diversity of ideas can be refined, challenged, and advanced;</li><li><strong>Offer financial stability, collective recognition, and accountability to individual researchers and new small organisations</strong>;</li><li><strong>Cultivate a London home for professional AI safety research</strong> by leveraging London's strategic advantages and building upon our existing ecosystem and partnerships;</li><li><strong>Foster epistemic quality and diversity amongst new AI safety researchers and organisations</strong> by facilitating mentorship &amp; upskilling programmes and encouraging exploration of numerous AI safety research agendas.</li></ul><p>LISA stands in a&nbsp;<strong>unique position&nbsp;</strong>to enact this vision. In 2023, we&nbsp;<strong>founded an office space ecosystem</strong>, which now contains organisations such as<a href=\"https://www.apolloresearch.ai/\">&nbsp;<u>Apollo Research</u></a>,<a href=\"https://www.leap-labs.com/\">&nbsp;<u>Leap Labs</u></a>,<a href=\"https://www.matsprogram.org/\">&nbsp;<u>MATS</u></a>,<a href=\"https://www.arena.education/\">&nbsp;<u>ARENA</u></a>,<a href=\"https://www.bluedotimpact.org/\">&nbsp;<u>BlueDot Impact</u></a>, and many individual and externally affiliated researchers. We are poised to capitalise on the&nbsp;<strong>abundance of motivated and competent talent in London</strong> and the supportive environment provided by the UK government and other local organisations. Our approach is not just about creating a space for research; it is about building a community and a movement that can significantly improve the safety of advanced AI systems.</p><h2><strong>The Urgency</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Given the scale of the AI safety problem, traditional institutions are not covering all of the work that needs to be done.</strong><ul><li>AI safety is a<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/thomas-kuhn/#ConcPara\">&nbsp;<u>pre-paradigmatic field</u></a> lacking a standardised framework or established paradigms. This demands a diverse range of research agendas to be explored and developed. Indeed, the most useful agendas may not yet exist.</li><li>Whilst some of these agendas are being worked on at major tech companies, in academia, or in government labs, almost all AI safety agendas remain significantly underfunded, underexplored, and underdeveloped.</li><li>Traditionally, academia has been the main player in conducting fundamental research for the public good. However, the recent pace and scope of AI capabilities advancement is an out-of-distribution event \u2013 unexpected, different in character, and without historical precedent. Therefore, innovative new structures like the UK Government's AI Safety Institute and incubators for AI safety research talent, early-stage organisations and new AI safety agendas, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.constellation.org/\"><u>Constellation</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://far.ai/labs/\"><u>FAR Labs</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.safeai.org.uk/\"><u>LISA</u></a>, are necessary to complement the AI safety research conducted in universities.</li></ul></li><li><strong>There is a need for more high-quality AI safety</strong><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/iD6tYjLLFFn4LXgnt/how-mats-addresses-mass-movement-building-concerns\"><strong>&nbsp;<u>researchers</u></strong></a><strong> and</strong><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/MhudbfBNQcMxBBvj8/there-should-be-more-ai-safety-orgs\"><strong>&nbsp;<u>organisations</u></strong></a><strong>.</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4pnr37kpDKTDvuuur/sflzn11fki5afclspadu\"><figcaption>The AI safety researcher pipeline.</figcaption></figure><p>This figure illustrates the progression from motivated and talented individuals to researchers outputting high-impact AI safety work. LISA's activities are designed to address the critical bottleneck between Phase 3 and Phase 4 because it is difficult for talented individuals to solve for themselves.</p><ul><li>For example, at the end of MATS or highly relevant PhD programmes,<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zwf68YaySvXhWYCdh/mats-summer-2023-retrospective#Mentor_endorsement_of_research\">&nbsp;<u>many strong scholars</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MhudbfBNQcMxBBvj8/there-should-be-more-ai-safety-orgs#:~:text=The%20core%20argument%20is%20that,Thus%2C%20more%20orgs%20are%20needed.)\"><u>still struggle</u></a> to secure AI safety roles in existing organisations because there are<a href=\"https://jobs.80000hours.org/?refinementList%5Btags_area%5D%5B0%5D=AI%20safety%20%26%20policy&amp;refinementList%5Btags_skill%5D%5B0%5D=Research&amp;jobPk=8477\">&nbsp;<u>few job opportunities</u></a> in existing organisations or academia compared with the magnitude of the AI safety challenge.</li><li><strong>Individual researchers working alone are less productive</strong>. Therefore, support should mostly prioritise those with established mentors or research collaborators or target those with an exceptional research track record and mentality such that they will work well when introduced to new collaborators. Still, this is daunting because these individual and externally affiliated researchers lack a supportive network and community to enhance their motivation and challenge each other\u2019s ideas.</li><li>We should also be helping incubate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/MhudbfBNQcMxBBvj8/there-should-be-more-ai-safety-orgs\"><u>new AI safety organisations</u></a> that face many barriers:<ul><li><strong>Networking and growth limitations</strong>: Finding co-founders, early hiring, organisational growth, and research collaboration is challenging without having large existing networks.</li><li><strong>Legal and administrative resistance</strong>: Promising researchers and would-be talented entrepreneurs have to circumvent many distractions to their core research (e.g., setting up the legal structures to receive grants and funding as an organisation or non-profit), which can be circumvented if an existing organisation (such as LISA) were to provide fiscal sponsorship.</li><li><strong>Work environment mismatch</strong>: Regular office spaces are often not conducive to the needs and focus of AI safety research, and it can be hard to find an environment with like-minded individuals (e.g., security concerns about certain research conversations, finding someone to help set up a package in PyTorch, arranging a 10-minute chat with someone to red team your latest interpretability idea etc). Indeed, there currently exists no other office space in London that only hosts AI safety professionals.</li><li><strong>Recognition and scaling challenges:</strong> Gaining recognition in the field and attracting speakers or hosting workshops is difficult without a certain level of scale and visibility. Emerging organisations often struggle to create impactful events that draw attention from the broader AI safety community.</li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>Our Vision</strong></h2><p>Our&nbsp;<strong>mission</strong> is to be a professional research centre that improves the safety of advanced AI systems by supporting and empowering individual researchers and small organisations. We do this by creating a supportive, collaborative, and dynamic research environment that hosts members pioneering a diversity of AI safety research.</p><p>In the next two years, LISA\u2019s vision is to:</p><ol><li><strong>Be a premier AI safety research centre&nbsp;</strong>which has housed significant contributions to AI safety research due to its collaborative ecosystem of small organisations and individual researchers</li><li><strong>Have supported the maturation of member organisations&nbsp;</strong>by increasing their research productivity, impact, and recognition.</li><li><strong>Have positively influenced the career trajectories</strong> of LISA alumni, who will have transitioned into key positions in AI safety across industry, academia, and government sectors as these opportunities emerge and develop over time.

Especially when combined with the idea&nbsp;that AI systems aim to optimize their world based on their goals, this has led to the belief that solving the problem of AI alignment&nbsp;will pave the way for an excellent future. However, this common definition of AI alignment is somewhat idealistic and misleading, as&nbsp;the majority of alignment research for cutting-edge systems is focused on aligning AI with&nbsp;<i>task preferences&nbsp;</i>(training AIs to solve&nbsp;user-provided tasks in a helpful manner), as well as reducing the risk that the AI would have the goal of causing catastrophe.&nbsp;</p><p>We can conceptualize three different targets of alignment: alignment to&nbsp;<i>task&nbsp;</i>preferences,&nbsp;<i>human&nbsp;</i>values, or&nbsp;<i>idealized&nbsp;</i>values.&nbsp;Extrapolating from the deployment of advanced systems such as GPT-4 and from studying economic incentives, we can expect AIs&nbsp;aligned with task preferences to be the dominant form of aligned AIs by default.&nbsp;</p><p>Aligning AI with task preferences will not by itself solve major problems for the long-term future. Among other problems, these&nbsp;include moral progress, existential security, wild animal suffering, the well-being of digital minds, risks of catastrophic conflict, and&nbsp;optimizing for ideal values. Additional efforts are necessary to motivate society to have the capacity and will to solve these problems.&nbsp;</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>The future development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) is often presented as having two distinct possibilities:&nbsp;either it is misaligned with human values, resulting in an existential catastrophe, or it is aligned and optimizes for&nbsp;human values [Sotala and Gloor 2017]. One might assume that as long as we develop aligned AGI, the future will unfold positively by default. For example, Soares [2022] posits a 100% chance of utopia if humans succeed at directing artificial&nbsp;superintelligence towards our ideal objectives. This may be the case for very strong definitions of alignment, where we&nbsp;assume that an aligned AGI performs optimally according to an ideal version of human values. However, in reality, the&nbsp;field of AI alignment is more focused on mitigating existential risk from a single AI rather than promoting systemic&nbsp;safety, and aligning AI with task preferences rather than striving for alignment with ideal preferences [Hendrycks and&nbsp;Mazeika 2022].&nbsp;</p><p>This work explores the idea that, even if the course of the long-term future is shaped by aligned AGI, numerous&nbsp;trajectories of vastly different value could emerge. Aligned AGI may not necessarily optimize for positive value, but&nbsp;could simply be powerful and non-catastrophic. For example, current advanced AI systems are not designed to fulfill&nbsp;human values, and this trend might persist in the future. Optimistically, we could hope that, by default, aligned AI leads&nbsp;to profound moral reflection, empowers humanity to address global issues, and promotes the general well-being to the&nbsp;best extent possible. However, several obstacles challenge this assumption as the default outcome. Another possibility is that advanced AI systems are employed by corporations to maximize their own power and influence. Other unfavorable&nbsp;long-term outcomes with non-negligible likelihoods include succumbing to different existential risks, proliferating&nbsp;wild animal suffering throughout space, creating numerous digital minds that endure suffering, or conflict arising from&nbsp;opposing interests. Generally, by default, we might not optimize the world for positive value, thereby overlooking the&nbsp;vast potential of our future. Positive trajectory changes could be facilitated by strategies such as moral circle expansion&nbsp;and heightened concern for moral reflection and existential risk mitigation \u2014 especially among those likely to control&nbsp;AGI. Developing a strategy for positive trajectory change appears to be a neglected priority, and valuable work can be&nbsp;pursued in this space even now.&nbsp;</p><h1>Related Work</h1><p>Cotra [2023] argues that in the context of AI research, the term \u201calignment\u201d is most usefully defined as ensuring that&nbsp;AI systems always strive for the goals their designers intend, rather than guaranteeing positive outcomes for the&nbsp;world. Therefore, Cotra proposes that developing perfect alignment techniques alone is not enough to ensure that AI&nbsp;is beneficial for the world. For example, issues related to misuse, inequality, high-stakes errors, chain-of-command, security, global stability, preference aggregation, philosophy and meta-ethics are also important to consider. While&nbsp;alignment is an essential aspect of AI research, it should not be viewed as the sole solution to the many complex issues&nbsp;involved in building a flourishing future.&nbsp;</p><p>Soares [2022] advances the view that if humans solve the problem of aligning superintelligent AI with ideal preferences&nbsp;or humanity\u2019s coherent extrapolated volition [Yudkowsky 2004], then a \u201cstrong utopia\u201d in which \u201cat least 95% of the&nbsp;future\u2019s potential value is realized\u201d is guaranteed. However, if humans deploy a superintelligence that is not aligned&nbsp;with ideal preferences, Soares expects that humanity would likely be destroyed, with a 90% chance that the universe&nbsp;would largely lack conscious experience and a 10% chance that it would be net positive. Soares also examines the&nbsp;potential value of the future if humans never develop superintelligence, or if the future is optimized by aliens assisted&nbsp;by a superintelligence aligned with their values.&nbsp;</p><p>Casper [2022] proposes that mitigating long-term risks associated with transformative artificial intelligence (TAI)&nbsp;requires AI governance solutions beyond technical alignment work. The author emphasizes that a TAI regime must be&nbsp;exclusive, benevolent, stable, and successful at alignment to effectively address the period of acute risk. The difficulty in&nbsp;meeting these requirements is framed as a significant AI governance problem. Casper categorizes AI safety strategies&nbsp;into three types, arguing that two strategies\u2014making it more difficult to develop dangerous AI and responding to emerging issues\u2014may be as crucial as making it easier to create safe AI. The article calls for further discussion and&nbsp;feedback on TAI governance-related challenges that have been relatively overlooked in the field.&nbsp;</p><h1>Defining AI Alignment</h1><p>AI alignment has been defined in various ways:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>As defined by Wikipedia [2023]: \u201cAI alignment research aims to steer AI systems towards their designers\u2019 intended goals and interests. Some&nbsp;definitions of AI alignment require that the AI system advances more general goals such as human values, other&nbsp;ethical principles, or the intentions its designers would have if they were more informed and enlightened.\u201d</li><li>\u201cA solution to the agent alignment problem is a policy that behaves in accordance with the user\u2019s intentions.\u201d&nbsp;[Leike et al. 2018]&nbsp;</li><li>\u201cOur alignment research aims to make artificial general intelligence (AGI) aligned with human values and follow&nbsp;human intent.\u201d [Leike et al. 2022]&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Organizations investing significantly in technical alignment research often express their mission statements with a&nbsp;focus on ensuring AGI serves to benefit humanity as a whole:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>\u201cOur mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.\u201d [OpenAI nd] \u2022 \u201cOur mission: to ensure transformative AI helps people and society flourish.\u201d [Anthropic nd] \u2022 \u201cWe\u2019re [. . . ] committed to solving intelligence, to advance science and benefit humanity.\u201d [DeepMind nd] \u2022&nbsp;\u201cThe Center for Human-Compatible AI\u2019s goal is to develop the conceptual and technical wherewithal to reorient&nbsp;the general thrust of AI research towards provably beneficial systems.\u201d [Center for Human-Compatible AI nd]</li></ul><p>While the broader mission of these organizations may focus on human values, in practice, technical research on alignment typically concentrates on aligning AI systems with human intent and averting disastrous outcomes. For&nbsp;example, the InstructGPT is a project that aims to align AI systems with specific task preferences [Ouyang et al.&nbsp;2022].&nbsp;However, there are notable exceptions, such as the research on \u201cAligning AI with Shared Human Values,\u201d which aims to&nbsp;imbue models with an understanding of normative ethics [Hendrycks et al. 2021].&nbsp;</p><h2>Three alignment targets&nbsp;</h2><p>A critical question in artificial intelligence is how to determine the goals of AI systems. This paper proposes three&nbsp;categories for AI alignment: alignment to&nbsp;<i>task preferences</i>, alignment to&nbsp;<i>human values</i>, and alignment to&nbsp;<i>ideal values</i>.&nbsp;Underlying each category is the challenge of ensuring that the AI system is not motivated to cause catastrophe. Each of&nbsp;these categories constitutes a form of \u201caligned AI,\u201d although alignment to task preferences is expected to be the most&nbsp;prevalent form due to various factors discussed later.&nbsp;</p><p><i>3.1.1 Alignment to task preferences.&nbsp;</i>AI systems that are aligned with task preferences are trained to perform various&nbsp;tasks in a way that humans prefer \u2013 essentially, doing tasks capably. For example, GPT-4 is designed to perform specific&nbsp;tasks such as writing poems, answering factual questions, drafting emails, and debugging code [OpenAI 2023c]. In addition to general pretraining, ChatGPT has also received extensive task-specific training, leveraging the work of&nbsp;hundreds of contractors to automate basic programming [Albergotti and Matsakis 2023]. While ChatGPT and GPT-4&nbsp;are trained to refuse harmful requests, they are not optimizing for the fulfillment of human values. In the context of&nbsp;papers such as InstructGPT and the GPT-4 Technical Report [OpenAI 2023c; Ouyang et al.&nbsp;2022], the term \u201calignment\u201d&nbsp;largely refers to alignment with task preferences.&nbsp;</p><p>There are significant competitive benefits to developing AI systems aligned with task preferences, as opposed to&nbsp;human values. It is relatively easy to collect training and preference data for tasks such as \u201cwrite a poem,\u201d as humans&nbsp;can provide examples of how the task can be completed and evaluate what output from the model is ideal. This data can&nbsp;be used to train AI systems using techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback [Christiano et al.&nbsp;2017]. In comparison, objective such as \u201ccreate a just and equitable society\u201d or \u201cpromote the flourishing of sentient&nbsp;beings\u201d pose practical difficulties for training.&nbsp;</p><p>As corporate adoption of AI continues to increase, companies will be incentivized to train and deploy them to assist&nbsp;with the goals of the company \u2013 in general, increasing profits and delivering shareholder value by automating tasks.&nbsp;Due to economic incentives and ease of training, AI systems are likely to be primarily aligned with task preferences.&nbsp;</p><p><i>3.1.2 Alignment to human values.&nbsp;</i>While practical AI systems are generally optimized for fulfilling task preferences&nbsp;rather than moral values, some efforts have been made to steer AI systems away from behavior deemed unethical&nbsp;according to normative ethics, as demonstrated by Hendrycks et al. [2022].&nbsp;</p><p>Aligning AI systems with human values faces several challenges. Critics often argue that it is incoherent, as different&nbsp;individuals and cultures hold varying values. This results in an underspecified definition of alignment to human values.&nbsp;Moreover, current human values may be flawed, as discussed by Williams [2015], who explores the possibility of&nbsp;ongoing moral catastrophe.&nbsp;</p><p>Modern language models demonstrate promising performance on benchmarks measuring ethical understanding, such as the ETHICS benchmark by Hendrycks et al.&nbsp;[2021]. However, an AI prompted to act optimally according to&nbsp;human values will not automatically know how to do so. Training and investment are required, but the economic incentives for this type of alignment are not as strong as those for alignment to task preferences. Consequently, it remains unclear whether alignment to human values will receive enough investment to be competitive with models&nbsp;with profit-motivated goals.&nbsp;</p><p><i>3.1.3 Alignment to ideal human values.&nbsp;</i>Alignment to ideal human values involves designing AI systems that optimize for&nbsp;the coherent extrapolated volition of humanity, as introduced by [Yudkowsky 2004]. In theory, AI systems successfully&nbsp;aligned with ideal values could construct a morally optimal future. However, this outcome seems unlikely by default for&nbsp;various reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>While there have been conceptual proposals in this space, no concrete developments have been made so far. Leike&nbsp;[2023] suggests employing simulated deliberative democracy, which combines imitation learning and large language&nbsp;models to align AI systems with collective preferences while keeping humans in the decision-making process. This&nbsp;approach involves gathering a dataset of value-based questions, documenting human deliberations, training a large&nbsp;language model based on these deliberations, simulating discussions on novel value questions, and compiling the&nbsp;outcomes to form a response.&nbsp;</p><p>Hendrycks and Woodside [2022a] propose creating a model that simulates a moral parliament, as well as automating moral philosophy research for value clarification. The moral parliament involves AI systems considering multiple moral&nbsp;perspectives and evaluating them in a way that approximates human deliberation.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the main challenges in aligning AI systems with ideal human values is convincing decision-makers that their&nbsp;ideal values are correct. For instance, consider the moral acceptability of homosexuality. While this may be an accepted&nbsp;value in modern society, someone living in medieval Europe would have found it difficult to accept, even if they would&nbsp;have embraced it after reflecting on their ideal values. An AI capable of persuading individuals to adopt their ideal&nbsp;moral values is possible, but it would require society to prioritize moral reflection enough to want to design such an AI.&nbsp;There is also the potential risk that an AI capable of persuading humans may also be capable of deception, making it&nbsp;challenging to distinguish whether the AI is deceptive.&nbsp;</p><p>In summary, alignment to task preferences, human values, and ideal human values represent three possible goals&nbsp;for AI systems. While alignment to task preferences is likely to remain the dominant form of alignment, exploring&nbsp;alignment to human values and ideal human values remains an important and neglected area of research. As AI systems&nbsp;continue to evolve, understanding and refining these alignment targets will be crucial in ensuring that AI systems&nbsp;contribute positively to society.&nbsp;</p><h1>Aligned AI would not automatically optimize for a good future</h1><p>There is a common argument regarding AI alignment that can be summarized as follows: (1) AGI might be developed within the coming decades.&nbsp;</p><p>(2) The consequences of AGI essentially determine the course of the long-term future.&nbsp;</p><p>(3)&nbsp;AGI will either be aligned or misaligned. Misaligned AGI could lead to existential catastrophe, while aligned&nbsp;AGI would optimize for human values.&nbsp;</p><p>Some envision AGI as an agent that autonomously takes actions to maximize its utility function. Under this view,&nbsp;the problem of alignment is about ensuring that the utility function aligns with the values of humanity. Otherwise, a&nbsp;powerful agent optimizing the world for a slightly misspecified utility function would cause catastrophe, [Russell 2014,&nbsp;2019] potentially incompatible with the existence of humanity.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the idea that AGIs are essentially utility maximizers has come under scrutiny in recent years. Janus&nbsp;[2022] argues that generative models such as GPT are not best described as utility maximizers but rather simulators</p><p>AI Alignment Is Not Enough to Make the Future Go Well 5&nbsp;</p><p>of content-generating processes, which can either be goal-directed or not. Nevertheless, these systems may be the&nbsp;foundation of AGI-like systems. Turner [2022] notes that deep reinforcement learning does not in general lead to reward&nbsp;maximizers.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, an AGI can be aligned but not directly optimize for human values. [Christiano 2015] distinguishes between&nbsp;ambitious and narrow value learning, highlighting that practical research tends to focus on narrow value learning.&nbsp;Christiano explains that AI safety can be divided into two approaches: the maximally ambitious approach, which aims&nbsp;to create AI systems capable of learning human preferences over long-term outcomes, even in unfamiliar domains; and&nbsp;the narrow approach, which focuses on teaching AI systems to understand short-term human goals and instrumental&nbsp;values. While ambitious value learning is theoretically appealing, it is challenging to achieve and may not be relevant&nbsp;to practical AI applications. The narrow approach, on the other hand, is more tractable and can help humans achieve&nbsp;their short-term goals, but may not address the long-term control problem posed by superintelligent AI.&nbsp;Aligned AGI may resemble a system that generates reasonable action sequences in response to prompts, without&nbsp;making deceptive plans or contributing to an AI takeover. Alignment in this fashion is plausible \u2013 though not guaranteed&nbsp;\u2013 if scalable oversight and process-oriented learning are used to train AI systems so that plans are interpretable and&nbsp;supervised in a high-quality manner [team 2023]. Optimistic scenarios of aligned AI involve using such an AI to solve&nbsp;humanity\u2019s problems, such as reducing existential risk and maximizing positive value in the future.&nbsp;When considering the potential impact of AI, we can examine concrete examples like GPT-4, which has been called&nbsp;an early but incomplete form of AGI [Bubeck et al.&nbsp;2023]. GPT-4 sparked concerns about unemployment, existential&nbsp;risk, and transformative implications. Though trained to be a generative model, it can be augmented with tools to&nbsp;autonomously complete tasks like web browsing and code execution, and ongoing research aims to further enhance its&nbsp;capabilities by connecting it to millions of APIs [Liang et al. 2023; OpenAI 2023a].&nbsp;</p><p>GPT-4 has several notable features, listed below. These may also be shared by transformative or general AI systems.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Alignment to task preferences: Alignment involves ensuring that the model is trained to avoid harmful or&nbsp;offensive content, provides helpful and honest responses, and generally achieves intended outcomes in a safe&nbsp;and reasonable manner.&nbsp;</li><li>Broad deployment: At launch, GPT-4 became available to all ChatGPT Plus subscribers. The GPT-4 API allows&nbsp;it to become an agent connected with a variety of APIs, acting with minimal supervision [Chase 2023; Richards&nbsp;2023].&nbsp;</li><li>Dual use: Early versions of GPT-4 could easily be prompted to produce harmful output, such as advice on how&nbsp;to kill as many people as possible [OpenAI 2023b]. ChatGPT has been used to create polymorphic malware and&nbsp;create a spear-phishing attack [Plumb 2023]. While its fine-tuning training attempts to have it decline requests&nbsp;considered harmful, it is not trained to consider the indirect effects of its output.&nbsp;</li><li>Lack of adversarial robustness: GPT-4-based systems like Bing and ChatGPT can be \u201cjailbroken\u201d to bypass&nbsp;safety measures and produce harmful content.&nbsp;</li><li>Diffusion of capabilities: Other models have been trained on responses from GPT-3.5 to replicate its capabilities&nbsp;[Taori et al.&nbsp;2023]. Additionally, GPT-4 can help with machine learning research and the design of new models.&nbsp;These successor AI systems may or may not be safe.&nbsp;</li><li>Differential capabilities: GPT-4 excels at some tasks more than others. As an example, GPT-4 has been specifically trained to write and explain code. In contrast, it has not been specially trained to be useful for&nbsp;conceptual alignment research, even despite OpenAI\u2019s goal of automating alignment research [Leike et al.&nbsp;2022]</li></ul><p>Assuming that a given AGI is aligned, we can expect it to be honest and helpful, without hidden goals of overthrowing humanity. However, future tool-augmented language models, even if aligned, will likely not optimize for human values,&nbsp;but rather automate a wide variety of tasks, which is a poor proxy for human values.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, automated corporations are misaligned with human values; for example, by contributing to environmental degradation or exerting undue political influence. Hendrycks [2023] argues that natural selection acts on AI&nbsp;systems and promotes selfish, influence-seeking systems. Naturally, power-seeking systems are able to accumulate&nbsp;more power over time to achieve their objectives. We can extend this to systems in general, whether they are run by&nbsp;AIs or humans directing AIs. Absent reasons to think that human values would predominate, systems motivated to&nbsp;seek power may direct the course of the future (see also, Critch [2021]). Although one could prompt a future model to&nbsp;optimize for human values, it remains an underspecified task and may not be particularly influential.&nbsp;</p><h1>Problems for the long-term future</h1><p>In this section, we explore several problems that are crucial for ensuring a positive long-term future for humanity.&nbsp;Although this is not an exhaustive list, these case studies exemplify the importance of developing a plan for building a&nbsp;flourishing future. We also evaluate the extent to which an aligned AGI might contribute to solving these problems,&nbsp;considering questions such as the following:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Do capabilities for solving a problem increase faster than capabilities to exacerbate it? (Example: As AGI&nbsp;becomes easier to build, does existential risk from AGI increase or decrease?)&nbsp;</li><li>Is offense or defense easier? (Example: Is it easier to deploy a deadly pandemic or to safeguard society against&nbsp;pandemics?)&nbsp;</li><li>Are designers and users of AGI motivated to address the problem?&nbsp;</li><li>How well would we train AI systems to have the capacity to address the problem?&nbsp;</li><li>How much investment is there in different possible uses of AGI?&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Existential risk from AI&nbsp;</h2><p>Even if we learn how to deploy an AGI system that is aligned with task preferences, this does not mean that existential&nbsp;risk from AI is eliminated. One scenario is that the deployment of unsafe AI systems may still be possible. Additionally,&nbsp;transformative AI systems may not be adversarially robust to catastrophic failure [Gleave and McLean 2023].&nbsp;</p><p><i>5.1.1 Deployment of unsafe AI.&nbsp;</i>There is considerable investment in developing open-source models to allow for greater&nbsp;research freedom and democratized access [LAION.ai 2023; Touvron et al.&nbsp;2023]. If this trend continues, an AGI could&nbsp;be developed as an open-source model with publicly available weights. Even if trained to avoid harm, open-source&nbsp;models can be further fine-tuned to remove these safety precautions.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</p><p>In the pursuit of research advancements, developers might experiment with novel mechanisms for developing AI&nbsp;systems that may turn out to be unsafe. Additionally, it may be difficult to predict in advance whether a new training&nbsp;method may be dangerous. Furthermore, malicious actors could create their own models, intentionally designed to be&nbsp;hazardous.&nbsp;</p><p><sup>1</sup>As a somewhat analogous example, the open-source model GPT-J was fine-tuned on text from 4chan, producing GPT-4chan, which had a tendency to write hate speech [Kurenkov 2022]. If a model capable of agentic planning were safe because it refused to pursue harmful goals, but still had the latent&nbsp;knowledge of how to do so, it could likely be fine-tuned to be unsafe.</p><p>Currently, there are no governance mechanisms in place to prevent the deployment of unsafe AI systems. In the future,&nbsp;effective regulation might require safety evaluations and regulatory approval before models are released. Additionally,&nbsp;compute governance could be employed to ensure that large training runs comply with established safety guidelines.&nbsp;</p><p>To be effective, these governance mechanisms may need to be implemented on a global scale. While it is conceivable that AI could be used to promote governance measures, it remains unclear whether such measures would be differentially&nbsp;helpful. For example, AI could be employed to draft policy papers advocating for both safer approaches and more&nbsp;libertarian stances, or to engage in publicity campaigns for and against particular regulations.&nbsp;</p><p><i>5.1.2 Adversarial attacks.&nbsp;</i>Advanced machine learning systems can still be attacked by adversaries, despite the assump&nbsp;tion that the problem will naturally disappear as systems improve. Recent research has shown that even superhuman&nbsp;systems like AlphaZero and general models such as large language models are vulnerable. Even transformative AI&nbsp;systems may be susceptible to unacceptable adversarial attacks [Gleave and McLean 2023].&nbsp;</p><p>Language models, for example, are susceptible to prompt attacks or jailbreaking, which can bypass safety measures,&nbsp;such as their typical refusal to engage in harmful actions [Greshake et al.&nbsp;2023]. As aligned AIs may not be adversarially&nbsp;robust, they could potentially be exploited to pursue harmful goals.&nbsp;</p><h2>Wild animal welfare&nbsp;</h2><p>Wild animal suffering is a significant, yet often overlooked problem that affects countless creatures living in their natural habitats. The challenges they face, including starvation, predation, diseases, and harsh weather conditions,&nbsp;result in a life that is far from harmonious and free. With the possibility of space colonization and terraforming, there is&nbsp;a potential to unintentionally cause wild animal suffering in previously uninhabited areas. Tomasik [2015]&nbsp;</p><p>Wild animal suffering is of an enormous scale on Earth but is not a problem that is commonly recognized as important. Concern for wild animal suffering could be an example of an ideal value, even if not held by contemporary moral values.&nbsp;In theory, highly advanced AI could determine ways to design ecosystems that promote wild animal welfare. However,&nbsp;this conflicts with the commonly held value that nature should be preserved. Addressing this issue may also require&nbsp;significant altruistic resources and investment.&nbsp;</p><h2>Digital minds&nbsp;</h2><p>The possibility of digital minds that are sentient (i.e., \u201chaving the capacity for positive or negative experiences\u201d) raises new concerns about their well-being.<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>Digital&nbsp;minds, such as those created through whole brain emulation, could be created at a vast scale and have intensely positive&nbsp;or negative experiences [Shulman and Bostrom 2021]. Some challenges related to digital minds include determining&nbsp;whether they are experiencing positive or negative emotions. Unlike when assessing sentience in animals, we cannot&nbsp;rely on shared evolutionary history or pain indicators to make such determinations for digital minds [Saad and Bradley&nbsp;2022].&nbsp;</p><p>Language models can express human emotions but may not have cognition that leads to positive or negative&nbsp;experiences. Their expressed emotions may not accurately indicate their well-being. Furthermore, it is possible to take&nbsp;a non-realist view of consciousness and moral valence, suggesting that there are no objective criteria for positive or&nbsp;negative experiences but rather a statement of value [Anthis 2022].&nbsp;</p><p>Risks of astronomical suffering (s-risks) refer to the possibility of cosmically immense suffering in the future. One&nbsp;possibility is that an AI might use simulations to improve its decision-making capacity. If these simulations contain conscious beings that can suffer, then this could lead to vast amounts of suffering. Another possibility is of agential,&nbsp;deliberately induced suffering. In this scenario, conflict between agents with differing goals may lead one agent to threaten to simulate suffering digital minds if demands are not met. As digital minds may require relatively few&nbsp;computational resources to simulate at a vast scale, the potential for aggregate positive or negative experiences might&nbsp;be quite great. The risks of astronomical suffering highlight the need for further research in cooperative AI and ethical&nbsp;concern for potential digital minds in the development of advanced AI systems [Althaus and Gloor 2016].&nbsp;</p><p>At present, there is minimal concern for the prospect of digital minds and no plan for ensuring their well-being. It is&nbsp;unclear whether we will solve consciousness adequately, even if assisted by AI, to determine proper protections for&nbsp;digital minds before it is too late.&nbsp;</p><p>5.4 Ideal values&nbsp;</p><p>Ord [2020] proposes that to achieve an optimal, flourishing future and fulfill humanity\u2019s potential, we could adopt a&nbsp;three-part strategy. The first step is to reach&nbsp;<i>existential security&nbsp;</i>\u2013 a state of the world with minimal existential risk. The&nbsp;next step, the&nbsp;<i>long reflection</i>, is to reflect on how best to achieve our potential, before engaging in irreversible actions&nbsp;such as wide-scale space settlement. This may require considerable moral reflection, rather than locking in current&nbsp;moral values; after all, we probably would not be happy with medieval values. The last step is to execute the strategy&nbsp;and actually fulfill humanity\u2019s potential.&nbsp;</p><p>In theory, this may seem like a reasonable strategy for achieving the future, but it does not seem likely to be executed. Even if existential security is achieved, the long reflection is not even discussed as a strategic possibility&nbsp;among influential companies or governments.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the framework of alignment with task preferences, there are limited factors that contribute to satisfying our&nbsp;ideal values, even if we have solved the issue of alignment. Currently, there is not much emphasis placed on moral&nbsp;reflection and optimization for ideal values. Instead, there is a strong evolutionary pressure towards influence-seeking&nbsp;systems that seek to increase their power and influence [Hendrycks 2023].&nbsp;</p><h1>Potential solutions</h1><h2>Existential security</h2><p>Mitigating existential risk is a paramount concern and will not inherently be solved by AIs aligned with task preferences.</p><p><i>6.1.1 AI governance.&nbsp;</i>To address the threat of the potential deployment of unsafe AI systems, a reasonable measure&nbsp;would be to establish a regulatory board responsible for overseeing the deployment of AI systems. This could help&nbsp;ensure that models approaching or exceeding human-level capabilities meet reasonable safety standards. For example,&nbsp;requirements may evaluate whether an AI:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>lacks dangerous power-seeking capabilities&nbsp;</li><li>passes tests for alignment and lack of deceptive alignment (even if such evaluations are imperfect) \u2022 is trained with process-based rather than outcome-based methods [Ought 2022]&nbsp;</li><li>is adversarially robust, especially to attempts to have it pursue a harmful goal&nbsp;</li><li>is appropriately sandboxed throughout training&nbsp;</li><li>is granted only a restricted ability to execute actions autonomously</li></ul><p>In addition to adopting risk management frameworks (such as [Schuett 2022]), labs should maintain good information security practices to prevent unsafe derivatives of the model. While one commonly discussed risk is that model weights&nbsp;may be stolen (or freely distributed as open-source) and then misused [Ladish and Heim 2022], another possibility is&nbsp;that output from the model could be collected to train another model [Taori et al. 2023].&nbsp;</p><p><i>6.1.2 Safety culture in AI development.&nbsp;</i>As numerous AI developers are advancing capabilities with minimal regard&nbsp;for safety measures, it is imperative to promote a development culture with greater emphasis on safety and caution.&nbsp;Developers should prioritize existential safety over advancing AI capabilities and avoid rushing into uncharted territory&nbsp;without appropriate safeguards.&nbsp;</p><p><i>6.1.3 Automated existential security.&nbsp;</i>Aligned AI systems can help contribute to existential security, with a few caveats&nbsp;in mind. While one method of improving alignment with task preferences is to increase general capabilities, capabilities&nbsp;externalities can be harmful to safety [Hendrycks and Woodside 2022b]. Additionally, the offense\u2013defense balance may&nbsp;be such that safeguarding important systems may be more difficult than attacking them, and transformative AI systems&nbsp;may not have the relevant domain expertise to promote safety if not specifically trained to do so. Redirecting resources&nbsp;from general AI capabilities towards training AI systems for socially beneficial goals can contribute to a safer and more&nbsp;secure future.&nbsp;</p><p>While AI has the potential to automate research in areas such as biosecurity and cyberdefense, high-quality work&nbsp;may not occur by default. AI systems benefit from training based on high-quality examples and evaluations provided&nbsp;by humans. Research labs can offer structured access for fine-tuning [Shevlane 2022], fostering an environment that&nbsp;encourages research in this vital direction.&nbsp;</p><h2>Moral reflection&nbsp;</h2><p>While there has been a recent surge in investment to align AI with human intent and task preferences, it is crucial to&nbsp;remember the original goal of aligning AI with shared human values toward beneficial outcomes. Moral reflection plays&nbsp;a crucial role in shaping the future of AI. AI corporations should be held accountable to promote socially beneficial outcomes, and efforts should be made to promote careful consideration of how to build a flourishing future for all&nbsp;sentient beings.&nbsp;</p><p><i>6.2.1 Digital minds.&nbsp;</i>The creation of digital minds could involve large amounts of positive or negative experiences,&nbsp;making their well-being a priority. Expanding our moral circles to include all sentient beings can be a beneficial starting&nbsp;point. However, misplaced concern for non-sentient digital minds poses a risk. If a movement were to arise for AI&nbsp;rights, this could pose challenges to efforts to ensure that their goals are aligned and non-catastrophic, and may make it&nbsp;difficult to shut down systems that appear unsafe (even if they are non-sentient). Criteria for determining whether a&nbsp;digital mind is sentient remain controversial. Strategic work is necessary in order to handle these difficulties.&nbsp;</p><p><i>6.2.2 Automated moral reflection.&nbsp;</i>According to the concept of moral progress, human ethics have made significant&nbsp;strides over the past few centuries; values such as human rights and gender equality were previously less predominant.&nbsp;Williams [2015] finds it unlikely that we have already arrived at the ideal values; indeed, we may be complicit in an&nbsp;ongoing moral catastrophe and unaware of it. Moral reflection can help to achieve humanity\u2019s potential, especially as&nbsp;contemporary ethics has not seriously contemplated transformative societal change from AI.&nbsp;</p><p>A moral parliament has been proposed as one approach to resolving moral uncertainty. An automated simulation&nbsp;of this could help apply a balanced version of normative ethics to guide the actions of transformative AI systems [Hendrycks and Woodside 2022a]. Automated moral philosophy research can further help to positively shape the values&nbsp;of society and AI systems.&nbsp;</p><p>By addressing these concerns and maintaining a focus on existential security, safety culture, digital minds, and moral&nbsp;reflection, we can work together to ensure that AI contributes to a brighter and more secure future for all.&nbsp;</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Although solving the problem of aligning AI with task preferences is a crucial first step, it is not sufficient to ensure&nbsp;a positive future for humanity. AI alignment must also consider broader ethical and philosophical issues to address critical long-term problems such as existential risks, digital well-being, and the prevention of catastrophic conflict.&nbsp;These issues require a concerted effort from society as a whole, not just AI researchers and developers. While technical&nbsp;solutions to AI alignment are important, they must be accompanied by a holistic approach that takes into account the&nbsp;broader social and ethical implications of AI. Only then can we create a world where AI systems align with ideal values&nbsp;and build a flourishing future.&nbsp;</p><h1>Acknowledgments</h1><p>I would like to thank Andr\u00e9 Ferretti and Mitchell Reynolds for providing detailed comments and suggestions for this paper.&nbsp;All mistakes are my own.&nbsp;</p><h1>References</h1><p>Reed Albergotti and Louise Matsakis. 2023.

What time do I want to be spending? Which hours? How do I want the weekends to look?

I have this association with doulas as being kind of hippie-ish, and I also have this association with you of being super data-driven. Do you find any tension between being this very data-driven person and the kinds of hippie-ish vibes that doulas seem to give off?</p><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> I am driven by data, and there is a lot of data about doulas. I think you\u2019ve got to find a person who\u2019s a good fit. But I think the reality is that this profession, despite the sort of associations that we all have in our heads, has actually moved in a much less hippie-dippie way. And there\u2019s a lot of evidence that this works, even if you assign people random doulas when they arrive at the hospital. So there\u2019s a fair amount of data there.</p><p>It relates to a question that I think crosses a lot of both pregnancy and childbirth and child rearing, which is this sense of people wanting to be a \u201ctype\u201d \u2014 like, you want to be an evidence-based mom, and evidence-based moms don\u2019t have doulas. And I think it\u2019s really important that we not hew to those things, and that we say, \u201cI could be a person who is going to try breastfeeding but isn\u2019t totally wedded to it, but I could be someone who co-sleeps,\u201d right? \u201cI could be a co-sleeping formula feeder\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s not a type we associate. We\u2019re like, well, you have to do all the attachment parenting: you ought to breastfeed and wear the baby all the time. No, you can pick. It\u2019s your parenting. You don\u2019t have to be a \u201ckind\u201d of parent.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yes, that really speaks to me. And then just on the specifics of the evidence behind doulas, what kinds of outcomes is it?</p><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> I think the main thing is C-sections. This is a pretty dramatic reduction in the risk of C-sections. And this is, I think, why this matters from a policy standpoint: we actually see these impacts. Even if you randomly assign the doula when the person arrives at the hospital, and even if you basically train their friend as a doula \u2014 that\u2019s not as good as having somebody who\u2019s been around births before, but just the idea of a support person being there is really important, it seems to reduce the C-section risk. It reduces the use of epidural, actually.</p><p>So there\u2019s a bunch of pieces of this, and it turns out \u2014 and this is something I\u2019ve talked to policymakers about \u2014 it actually would be cost effective for Medicaid to pay about $1,300 for every doula, for everyone on Medicaid to have a doula, because that is the money saved from having a doula, in terms of C-sections are much more expensive, all this kind of stuff. So this is a case in which there\u2019s just like free money on the table. A doula doesn\u2019t cost $1,300, right? Like, no chance. I mean, some places, but not most of the places. It\u2019s an example of something where I just don\u2019t understand why we\u2019re not doing it. And it\u2019s got to be the answer is the patriarchy. But I\u2019m not sure what aspect of the patriarchy is at play.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Got it. And then what exactly is the mechanism by which the doula is reducing those risks? Is it something like they\u2019re like, \u201cYou can do it, I\u2019m going to coach you through X\u201d?</p><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> I think it\u2019s hard to tell. I think some of it is coaching through changes in position. Some of it is general encouragement. There\u2019s some specific stuff around moving around that might matter, but I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s something you could point to and say, it\u2019s this thing.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>C-sections</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> A lot of people really want to have a vaginal birth. Why is that so important to so many people?</p><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s so important to so many. It\u2019s an interesting question. I think we can talk about why that would be, from a doctor standpoint, the outcome that they were hoping for. I think the answer there is that the recovery in the short term is on average much easier from a vaginal birth than from a C-section. So a vaginal birth, it\u2019s not major surgery. You can have a very long recovery, so there\u2019s a range. But a C-section is major abdominal surgery. It limits your mobility initially \u2014 there\u2019s a reason people spend four days rather than two days in the hospital. You\u2019re guaranteed somewhat of a complicated recovery. For vaginal birth, you may get a very complicated recovery, but I drove us home from the hospital after my first kid. There\u2019s a range of ease of vaginal delivery that isn\u2019t there for C-sections.</p><p>Interestingly, the long-term outcomes for kids and mom from those two are the same. There\u2019s really nothing in the data that would distinguish them, except if you want to have many more children, there are added complications in later pregnancies from a C-section, and in particular from multiple C-sections. So if your goal is to have five kids, it\u2019s actually really complicated to have five C-sections. So that\u2019s a place where having a vaginal birth is going to make it possible to do this more, because there are placental complications in later pregnancies that become much more common if you\u2019ve had C-sections. So in some sense, that choice and that desire or that preference for vaginal birth, a lot of it is effectively rooted in what\u2019s going to set you up better for future pregnancies.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Interesting. I didn\u2019t know that. And that does feel really relevant to me. I have this really intense fear of vaginal birth. It just sounds like it\u2019s going to be so painful. My mom had a lot of vaginal tearing during her vaginal birth, and I\u2019m just terrified. And part of me is like, hmm, a C-section. I\u2019ve had a surgery before. Maybe I can just do that, and not have all that pain in the immediate experience of it.</p><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> Well, one thing is that an epidural is pretty effective. So definitely you don\u2019t seem like a person who wants an unmedicated birth. And I think that what you describe, the fear of birthing, is quite real and is quite common and is not very widely discussed. There\u2019s an interesting example of something where the world kind of expects you to be like, \u201cWhat I\u2019m really hoping is to give birth in the tub, and to be pulling my own baby out when they\u2019re crowning.\u201d Are you kidding me?! Do you know where it comes out of? Like, I want to be effing asleep, and then I want you to hand me my baby after you clean me up, like the 1950s. Like, where is my twilight sleep option for this? Because it sounds terrible.</p><p>And I think that\u2019s a very common fear that we almost don\u2019t allow enough of in the world, where you\u2019re supposed to talk about this as some kind of magical thing. I will say that in the moment, like with many things in parenting, it kind of seems more normal than\u2026 You have some time to work up to it, you know?</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Right. Can you say more about that? I\u2019m curious, and I think it might help me to hear, because it\u2019s true that I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve heard many people talk about the fear of it. I\u2019ve heard loads of people talk about what the experience of being pregnant is like; I\u2019ve heard lots of people talk about their childbirth after the fact, and usually by then there\u2019s a kind of magic about it.</p><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> Oh, you\u2019ve forgotten. Yes, totally. So actually, I think for almost everybody, you ramp that epidural up, you\u2019re good. Not that it\u2019s not uncomfortable \u2014 there\u2019s pressure and so on \u2014 but this intense pain of an unmedicated childbirth, you can turn a lot of that off. There\u2019s also a fair amount of adrenaline and forgetting, which there\u2019s some self-preservation there.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The impact of kids on women's careers</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> When we talk about a wage gap, you sort of have in your mind like two people with the same job and one of them gets paid less \u2014 the straight-up discrimination story. And that happens some. Probably a much bigger part \u2014 and again, these things are hard to separate in the data \u2014 but it\u2019s likely that a much larger part of what we see as a gender wage gap is basically a gender seniority gap.</p><p>So I\u2019ll give you a very concrete example. In academia, a bunch of research universities in the last year or so have tried to figure out what gendered male and female professor wages look like. And when you do that, you find that women get paid less: 100% of that is about differences in rank, and the fact that women are less likely to be full professors or they have been full professors for less time. It\u2019s much more strongly true in the older generation, where basically women were promoted more slowly or whatever. And you could say that some of that in the past was about discrimination \u2014 it\u2019s a very reasonable view \u2014 but the reality is that all of the gap is explained by things you can see about seniority.</p><p>I think that\u2019s true in a lot of these spaces. If you\u2019re an associate at a law firm, you take some time off, it takes longer to get to partner. Even if you are a partner, you haven\u2019t been a partner for as long, or you\u2019ve been promoted in a different way \u2014 there\u2019s this idea of the \u201cmommy track.\u201d There are a lot of reasons why wages are different, probably most of which are about differences in things you could see. And again, I want to emphasise that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not discrimination \u2014 it\u2019s just that if you want to look for a discrimination explanation for that, you need to go back to why this happened in the first place.</p><p>It widens the most [early on], and then it kind of stays about the same. If you look at the time path of people\u2019s wages, eventually they stagnate or growth stops, and at that point, there\u2019s not as much space for widening.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah. The story about hours makes sense to me, about how much harder it is to go half time, but still pursue the same levels of seniority. Are there other things going on? Like, is some of it just choice? Are some women choosing to take on this responsibility because they would prefer to trade off a more senior role for more time with their kids?</p><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> Totally, yes. Some people choose. And it\u2019s an interesting policy question, because when we say we want to have more women with kids in the workforce, which is something that gets expressed a lot, I think we want to think about how there might be two reasons you might leave the workforce when you have kids.</p><p>One is that you might not want to be in the workforce anymore. That\u2019s a completely reasonable, appropriate preference that some people have. And we wouldn\u2019t want to say, let\u2019s force everyone to work if they would prefer to work at home by taking care of their kids \u2014 which is also, by the way, a job that\u2019s quite hard.</p><p>Then there\u2019s a second piece, which is people who basically would want to maintain a foot in the workforce, or would prefer to work, but something else is keeping them out of the workforce. And I would put in that category the recognition that some people would like to work less for not four months, but several years. I think one of the biggest challenges when we think about further developing women\u2019s role and leadership positions in the workforce is to recognise that there may be periods in which people want to be less engaged, and it would be a shame to lose that human capital for that period.</p><p>So thinking about how we know from the data that women put more value on flexible work arrangements if they have small children. There was a recent Brookings report that showed the labour force participation rate for college-educated women with children under five is the highest it has ever been post-pandemic \u2014 and that is because those people are able to work remotely, and the value of being able to work remotely when you have little kids is really high. So thinking about some of those people we really want to keep in the workforce, and being able to keep them, and then eventually your kids go into middle school and they don\u2019t care about you anymore and you have time to work more. So I talk a lot about this, and I think it\u2019s really important to think about how we can provide the kinds of flexibility that people need in the short term.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Kids are a marathon</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> People spend so much time thinking about the first two years. And of course, that\u2019s what\u2019s in your mind before you have a kid. It\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m going to need to be there for breastfeeding. I\u2019m going to need to be there for this and this and this and this.\u201d And yeah, OK, those things are important. If you talk to people with older kids, one of the things they will often say is, \u201cI was really substitutable when my kids were babies. Yeah, I provided breast milk, but fundamentally they were happy to sleep. There were many, many people who could serve the needs of my kids when they were babies. There are many fewer people who can serve the needs of my kids now.\u201d</p><p>As your kids get older, I think for many of us, the stakes feel a little higher and the value of being there feels almost greater than it did. And I think that\u2019s both important to recognise because you don\u2019t want to conceive it as like, \u201cThere\u2019s going to be two years of investment and then basically I\u2019ll be done. They\u2019re going to some English boarding school.\u201d The need for you is not going to disappear. But also in those first years, there\u2019s a lot of people who are substitutable.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Interesting. I feel like I am, again, one of the people who needed to hear that. I think I have some, like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to prepare for the sprint of the first two years, and then somehow it gets easier.\u201d But it is a marathon.</p><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> It\u2019s a marathon. And the first two years, those are like you\u2019re kind of slow, you\u2019re not picking up the pace. I\u2019m in the middle of training for a marathon, so I really have a lot of this in my head now. Those you keep it controlled those first couple of miles, because it\u2019s getting hard in the last 10k. It\u2019s hard.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Right. Interesting. Well, that is frightening to me. Preparing for a sprint sounds easier to me than preparing for how to have a productive career while raising kids when it\u2019s actually a marathon.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Evidence on childcare</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> So basically the childcare choices that you make \u2014 either choices about whether to work or not, even the choices about what to do with your kid during the day \u2014 for the most part, those don\u2019t really impact their test scores very much in any direction. So some of these things may be a little bit positive or a little bit negative. Actually, the stay-at-home/not-stay-at-home parent stuff is pretty minor. So none of these things are very big. Even when you have effects \u2014 which are, we could argue, are almost always overstated, because they\u2019re really correlations: they\u2019re not really causal; we don\u2019t have any randomised data \u2014 even those numbers are so small for the most part that they wouldn\u2019t be an important part of a consideration set.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Wow, OK. They\u2019re that small. Are there exceptions? Are there types of childcare or an amount of time a child might spend at home alone that do make a difference?</p><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> You can\u2019t leave your baby home alone. That\u2019s not allowed. I mean, we look at childcare, and people ask me, \u201cIs daycare good or daycare bad?\u201d Low-quality daycare does seem to show up sort of negatively. And by \u201clow-quality\u201d I mean the kids are not safe, they\u2019re not getting any attention, which is unfortunately characteristic of some childcare settings. But beyond that, there isn\u2019t something where you\u2019d say <i>this</i> is the worst childcare structure.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> So there are small differences, but they are really so small that you wouldn\u2019t think they\u2019d be particularly important considerations?</p><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> Yeah. Basically, group daycare improves cognitive performance a bit. Maybe it worsens behaviour a little bit. Both effects are pretty small. Having one parent be part time sometimes shows up in test-score data as a positive. But probably that\u2019s just about correlation and about what kind of families they are. And again, it\u2019s all very complicated, because if people are working, they have more income and can buy stuff. So I don\u2019t know.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah, it\u2019s just surprising. And I think I do want to push on it, even though I just totally believe you, but I think I want to push on it because I have this feeling that society tells me that my child going to the best possible preschool or daycare during their early years is incredibly important. And there are 12- to 18-month waiting lists for preschools for eight-months-olds. Is that really mostly hype?</p><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> Yup.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>What actually makes a difference in young kids' lives</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> There are two things that I think are simultaneously true but hard to hold in your head at the same time. One is that most of the choices, the individual choices that you are going to make about your kid when they\u2019re little, do not matter at all. So most of whether you choose to breastfeed or sleep train or not sleep train, or whether they go to the Montessori preschool, or whether they go to the preschool down the street that has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reggio_Emilia_approach\">Reggio Emilia</a> \u2014 these things, the effects are so small that they are very, very unlikely to matter.</p><p>It\u2019s also true that the experience that kids have between zero and three is probably the most important that they will ever have to set them up for a life of success. And by the time you get kids at three, the difference between kids who are raised in poverty and kids who are not, it\u2019s already there. Eva Moskowitz has a really nice thing in her <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mission-Possible-Secrets-Success-Academies/dp/1118167287\">book</a> about the block achievement gap. When she gets kids at kindergarten, the kids who have grown up with fewer resources are not building block towers up: when she has them play with blocks, they build flat. And the kids who are raised with more resources are building up. So there\u2019s so much that happens before five. And yet these things that you\u2019re like, \u201cHow do I pick the preschool? This one has a master\u2019s degree.\u201d It\u2019s like, that\u2019s completely effing irrelevant.</p><p>The answer is that there are things that are relevant, and they are: having a stable place to come home to; having some loving caregiver who is paying attention to you \u2014 could be a daycare provider, can be a nanny, can be a parent, can be another parent, can be a grandparent \u2014 it\u2019s like having somebody that feels stable, or several people who feel stable; having enough to eat every day; having enough sleep; having access to childcare; not being exposed to abuse and trauma and toxic stress. That\u2019s the whole thing. And the thing is you\u2019re not asking about those things, because that\u2019s not a thing you\u2019re thinking about choosing: that\u2019s already something your kid is going to have, because of the privilege of where they\u2019re going to be born into.</p><p>And so that feels to me so important, because we spend all this time in policy space. The people making the policy are spending all of this time in their heads with these decisions that feel really fraught \u2014 but actually are completely irrelevant. And we\u2019ve sort of missed that there are things we could impact with policy \u2014 by having better paid leave for everybody, by having better childcare subsidies, by giving people all of those things we could be. And those things really do matter, and yet we\u2019re not talking about them because they seem so obvious to the sets of people who are making the policy. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk. Sorry.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> No, it\u2019s great. It\u2019s very compelling and reassuring. Again, I do feel like a really big part of me believes you, and another part of me is like, \u201cBut I have so many stories about people remembering that their parents worked super late and felt sad or neglected by that!\u201d</p><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> I mean, you\u2019ve really got to be careful with anecdotes because you\u2019re also going to find people are like, \u201cMy mom quit her job so she could be home every minute with me, and then I was the repository for all of her failed dreams. And I wish she had had a job so she wasn\u2019t constantly on me about how I had to be.\u201d I think it\u2019s tricky. Many people don\u2019t like their upbringing, and one of the features of humans is that we\u2019re always trying to fix the stuff that we feel that our parents messed up. And so I think we do want to be a little bit careful about that.</p><p>Like, my son the other day, I told him\u2026 I walk my kids to school almost every day. I\u2019m home for dinner every single night. I rarely travel. I spend a lot of time with them. The other day I told my son that I would see him in the morning, but I wasn\u2019t going to be able to walk him to school because I was going out on my long run, and I wanted to leave early enough to whatever. And he told me, \u201cDo you care about your long run more than you care about me?\u201d So no matter how much time you spend with your kids, sometimes they\u2019ll ask you that. And you have to have the fortitude as a parent to be like, \u201cI love you more. I would choose you over running, but for tomorrow I care more about my long run than I do about you. And so you\u2019ll have to walk to school by yourself.\u201d</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah. I think you\u2019re right. It totally sounds consistent with what I actually think about these anecdotes: that most people have complaints about their childhood, and mostly when people have really strong complaints, it is because things have gone more wrong at the level that you\u2019re talking about \u2014 with stability and basic needs being met or not. I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s anything else that might matter, besides those basic things?</p><p><strong>Emily Oster:</strong> Not spanking your kids. No physical punishment. Reading. Reading shows up. Reading to your kids, talking to them. But not talking in an obsessive, weird way, where you have to like narrate every diaper change. But we do see that it\u2019s probably something like the number of words kids hear tend to show up. Those are kind of it.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "Mvnzjn6cTGv6d8cuP", "title": "Animal Advocacy Africa\u2019s 2023 Review and Plans for 2024", "postedAt": "2024-02-02T17:26:27.937Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Summary</h1><p>This post is a detailed review of Animal Advocacy Africa\u2019s work in 2023 and our plans for the year ahead.

We ran a pilot of this programme in 2021 and a first full year of support for 17 organisations across eight countries in 2022. We supported these organisations across fundraising, strategy, operations and communications.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rEiWzbiWkyBSuLuGy/animal-advocacy-africa-s-2022-review-our-achievements-and-1#4_1_Capacity_building_programme_\"><u>our strategy for 2023</u></a>, we decided to make substantial changes to this programme, to focus our efforts on the most impactful ways to build African farmed animal organisations. In our first strategic priority for 2023, we wrote:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cRather than increasing the number of partners we work with, this year we intend to prioritise the most promising and strategically-aligned organisations, that are specifically focusing on farmed animal welfare. We plan to focus on these high-priority organisations, providing personalised and core support to directly improve their strategy and output; while building a wider network of advocates through our general, public work to facilitate connections and develop a coherent regional effort.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Subsequently, we employed a dual strategy in 2023 to find the most impactful organisations to work with.</p><ol><li><i>We concentrated our in-depth support on a smaller number of highly promising organisations in our programme.</i><br>Based on an evaluation framework, we grouped the organisations we had worked with in the past into different priority groups, focusing our efforts accordingly. Organisations received varying levels of personalised<i>&nbsp;</i>support where we believed we could make a meaningful impact. Concurrently, we continued to offer general support deliverable en masse (rather than on a one-to-one basis) to the broader group of organisations within our network, primarily by sharing resources and opportunities (e.g. trainings, grant applications) and hosting group training sessions. To focus our efforts, we also stopped or scaled down certain forms of support previously offered, such as matching volunteers with organisations.</li><li><i>We substantially widened the scope of our search for and outreach to organisations we had not yet known or interacted with before, to find promising additions to our programme.</i><br>On the basis of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/african-animal-advocacy-organisations\"><u>our database of African animal advocacy organisations</u></a>, we conducted a shallow review of 74 organisations with at least a partial focus on farmed animals. Based on this initial assessment, we decided to reach out to 22 of these organisations to learn more about their work. This process allowed us to identify various relevant organisations, some of which we provided further support to.</li></ol><p>In addition to the support provided directly to organisations, we also focused more of our efforts on working with funders and other stakeholders who needed information and feedback on the work of certain organisations in Africa. While we had provided this kind of service in the last year already, we leveraged the scanning and evaluation process described above to enhance our service in this area in 2023. This included a pilot regranting project, as expressed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rEiWzbiWkyBSuLuGy/animal-advocacy-africa-s-2022-review-our-achievements-and-1#4_2_Regranting_programme\"><u>our strategic plans for 2023</u></a>, where we collaborated with a funder on distributing grants to promising projects.</p><h3>Outcomes</h3><p>We think adopting the dual strategy was the right strategic decision. The most important outcomes of our organisational capacity-building efforts in 2023 were the following:</p><ul><li>We provided in-depth fundraising support to four organisations, helping them raise a total of USD 172,500. This is arguably the largest area of impact from our organisational capacity-building support.</li><li>We provided advice to five foundations/grantmakers. Two of these grantmakers awarded grants totalling USD 95,000 to organisations that we provided advice on. They also refrained from funding organisations that we did not endorse, but these amounts are much harder to calculate. Thus, the mentioned figure should be viewed as a conservative estimate of the grants we influenced and could be an underestimate. The positive feedback we received from funders suggests that our advice likely improved the quality of these grants, although we cannot confirm this with certainty.</li><li>We provided advice to ten individual funders/donors, who subsequently donated USD 40,279 to African organisations that we provided advice on.</li><li>We collaborated with two funders on regranting or channelling funds to certain organisations. These funders granted a total of USD 5,569 to organisations that we recommended.</li></ul><p>For the sake of brevity, we have chosen to highlight only the key aspects and outcomes of our work here.

We also provide an update on certain outcomes from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rEiWzbiWkyBSuLuGy/animal-advocacy-africa-s-2022-review-our-achievements-and-1\"><u>our 2022 review</u></a> in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Mvnzjn6cTGv6d8cuP/animal-advocacy-africa-s-2023-review-and-plans-for-2024#Appendix_B__Updates_to_2022_review\"><u>appendix B</u></a>, as additional outcomes came to light only after the initial publication.</p><p>To more concretely illustrate (the impact of) our work, below is a short overview of two organisations that were in our high-priority support group over the last two years:</p><ol><li>Since joining our programme in 2022,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalwelfareleague.org/\"><u>Animal Welfare League</u></a> (AWL) in Ghana has received our support on a broad spectrum of issues. Initially, in 2022, we influenced their decision to pursue cage-free advocacy in Ghana, facilitated their introduction to the Open Wing Alliance, and helped them secure their first grant of USD 20,000 from the EA Animal Welfare Fund. By 2023, our assistance enabled AWL to obtain an additional USD 97,500 in grants from the EA Animal Welfare Fund, the Open Wing Alliance, and the Tiny Beam Fund. Moreover, we established a partnership with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ribon.io/en/\"><u>Ribon</u></a>, generating approximately USD 1,000 monthly for the organisation. Beyond fundraising, our support extended to various other areas: facilitating their participation as speakers at the AVA Summit in both 2022 and 2023, connecting them with volunteers who developed their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalwelfareleague.org/\"><u>website</u></a>, and guiding them in using Mailchimp for newsletter campaigns. This has enabled AWL to publish Africa's first cage-free egg producer directory and to establish a national cage-free farm network in Ghana. As of January 31 2024, AWL has reported having 93 farmers in their network and has secured commitments for cage-free housing for 369,110 laying hens. They are now also undertaking an economic analysis of poultry production systems in Ghana.</li><li>We played a crucial role in the incubation of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://awecca.org/\"><u>Animal Welfare Competence Center for Africa</u></a> (AWeCCA). We supported the founder, Paul, when he was interested in starting a project to help farmed animals but was unsure what effective strategy or intervention to pursue. In 2022, we provided strategic advice and facilitated connections to research services offered by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/\"><u>Animal Ask</u></a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-animal-advocacy-in-uganda\"><u>Their research</u></a>, combined with our feedback, influenced Paul to adopt a high-impact intervention \u2013&nbsp; a decision we believe might not have occurred without our involvement. We then supported AWeCCA in securing a USD 75,000 grant from the EA Animal Welfare Fund. This has enabled AWeCCA to engage in government outreach efforts aimed at curtailing the expansion of industrial animal agriculture in Uganda. In 2023, they formed a task force committee which has appraised the current policy and legislative framework in Uganda, progressing toward recommendations for revised policies. They also met with several stakeholders to advocate for updating and reforming the current Animal Cruelty Prevention Act of 1976.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w9y2JsP5r0\"><u>This work was covered in local media.</u></a> In addition, AWeCCA presented insights on chicken caged farming in Uganda at a conference in Ghana and visited Ethiopian stakeholders in the animal agriculture industry to discuss how development cooperation NGOs can leverage guidelines for animal welfare in their initiatives. More on their progress can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FrgqhGUVOzZfjAP63FMHCWRiTwviATAa/view\"><u>their 2023 review</u></a>.</li></ol><p>These two organisations likely represent the bulk of our direct impact on organisations in 2022 and 2023. We discuss the strategic implications of this in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Mvnzjn6cTGv6d8cuP/animal-advocacy-africa-s-2023-review-and-plans-for-2024#Our_strategy_for_2024\"><u>our strategy for 2024</u></a>.</p><h2>Training advocates</h2><h3>Strategy</h3><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rEiWzbiWkyBSuLuGy/animal-advocacy-africa-s-2022-review-our-achievements-and-1#4_2_Regranting_programme\"><u>last year\u2019s review</u></a>, we had mentioned regranting to promising advocates and organisations and research into evidence-based strategies to mitigate the rise of factory farming in Africa as two of our three strategic priorities for 2023. While we did focus on these issues individually (see our regranting efforts described&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Mvnzjn6cTGv6d8cuP/animal-advocacy-africa-s-2023-review-and-plans-for-2024#Strategy\"><u>above</u></a> and the research project described&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Mvnzjn6cTGv6d8cuP/animal-advocacy-africa-s-2023-review-and-plans-for-2024#Enhancing_our_training_programme_for_individuals\"><u>below</u></a>), we also initiated a new programme to amplify both of these efforts: a training programme for individuals.</p><p>We planned to do the following:</p><ol><li><i>Fundamentals:</i><br>Run an eight-week, expenses-covered training programme for up to 30 participants, providing important concepts and skills for effective animal advocacy.</li><li><i>Advanced:</i><br>Provide extended support for several months to the most promising and committed participants of the fundamentals programme, focusing on enabling them to implement high-impact interventions identified in our research findings and offering seed grants and incubation for these projects.</li></ol><p>With this programme, we aimed to leverage the findings from our research project to implement promising strategies to mitigate the rise of industrial animal agriculture in Africa, allocate grants to promising projects, and strengthen talent pipelines in the African animal advocacy movement.</p><h3>Outcomes</h3><p>We ran the first pilot of our fundamental training programme from October to December 2023. Below, we report on the preliminary outcomes from this programme. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously. This was merely the first of two steps in our outlined process, and the subsequent advanced component will significantly influence the key outcomes of the programme as whole, such as the number and nature of the projects we will incubate.</p><p>We received 293 applications to our programme. Based on an initial application form, a test task, and an interview, we selected 20 participants for our programme. These participants came from seven different countries. Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda were the most heavily represented countries, with seven, four, and three participants respectively. Ghana and South Africa featured two participants each. The remaining two participants came from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Zambia.</p><p>Participants took part in an eight-week programme, with an expected time commitment of approximately 10 hours per week. Each week was dedicated to a different topic, including communications, task management, decision-making, applied research, project planning, and more. Participants were given access to a wide variety of written and video resources, they worked on individual and paired assessments, received feedback from and had meetings with each other and AAA staff, attended group sessions and office hours, and received recommendations to career opportunities.<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Mvnzjn6cTGv6d8cuP/tbjj6wo6a3fuzkd94zmq\"><figcaption><i>Our training programme participants in a group meeting</i></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, the 17 participants that completed our final survey seemed happy with the programme. We illustrate the perceived value of the different components of our programme in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Mvnzjn6cTGv6d8cuP/animal-advocacy-africa-s-2023-review-and-plans-for-2024#Appendix_C__Value_of_different_training_programme_components_to_participants\"><u>appendix C</u></a>. Participants also reported that the programme had a substantial positive impact on them. The most-mentioned impact categories for participants were an enhanced knowledge about effective animal advocacy (e.g. focus on impact, importance of M&amp;E, primacy of large and neglected animal groups), new connections and a better network of fellow advocates (esp. in Africa), and an increased motivation and willingness to focus their career on effectively helping animals. All of these impact categories were mentioned by 55-65% of respondents. Almost as many participants mentioned enhanced soft skills (e.g. communication, decision-making, task management) and enhanced career decisions (e.g. spreadsheet decision-making, learning from other advocates, having an idea for their own project) as an outcome of the programme. To a lesser extent (mentioned by ~30% of respondents), the programme also increased participants' awareness of opportunities and enhanced their technical skills (e.g., knowing how to effectively use certain tools like Google Sheets).</p><p>To illustrate, here are some of the many testimonials from our participants:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Mvnzjn6cTGv6d8cuP/wf4apm9o4g9sspmg70nf\"></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><i>\u201cThis training opened my eyes to the broader spectrum of impactful interventions beyond plant-based advocacy.

While we anticipate some drop-off in the follow-through on these projects (e.g. because participants decide to pursue other opportunities), we aim for at least two projects to be led by two or more of our programme participants going forward.</p><p>Additionally, we plan to continue supporting a few other participants who do not intend to start their own projects but instead prefer to apply to existing roles and organisations within the movement. We will also continue to share resources and aim to build a community for our alumni.</p><p>Tangible outcomes from the programme will be tracked over time and reported in future updates. We plan to closely monitor the career progression and project developments of our participants.</p><h2>Contributing to the wider movement</h2><h3>Strategy</h3><p>Next to these specific and targeted programmes, we are also continuously engaging in wider outreach and research to strengthen the farmed animal advocacy movement in Africa. Over the last years, we published research and curated databases to enhance information and transparency, attended conferences to share our work and find collaborators, and organised webinars to enable knowledge sharing and networking.</p><h3>Outcomes</h3><p>The main outcomes in this area were as follows:</p><ul><li>In 2023, we attended six conferences and hosted two&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/webinars\"><u>webinars</u></a>. At the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.careconf.eu\"><u>Conference on Animal Rights in Europe (CARE)</u></a>, we gave a talk&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHHY8bLn9FM\"><u>which is available on Youtube</u></a>.</li><li>Visits to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/\"><u>our website</u></a> grew from 7,149 last year to 9,867 this year. We continued to maintain and update the free databases of resources and opportunities available on our site. Most importantly, we have significantly updated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/african-animal-advocacy-organisations\"><u>our database of animal advocacy organisations in Africa</u></a>, featuring 428 organisations as of December 2023.</li><li>We released three&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/blog\"><u>blog posts</u></a> but no detailed research reports.

This strategic pivot is informed by several key observations:</p><ul><li>Our team found outcomes from TP more promising than ORG. TP participants showed higher engagement compared to ORG and provided overwhelmingly positive feedback.</li><li>Our most successful partner organisations from ORG were either nascent or not formally established when we began our support, aligning with TP's incubation model and its potential for greater impact. We have seen that fostering change at the individual level is more feasible and impactful than modifying established organisations.</li><li>Our highest-priority organisations are now well-integrated into the animal advocacy movement. They have established connections with major funders and networks, reducing the need for our intensive support. At the same time, identifying new high-priority organisations for intensive support has been challenging, leading to diminishing returns in the ORG approach. Even though the amount raised by organisations with our help has increased from 2023 to 2022, a lot of this success seems to have been a delayed impact of our work in 2022 and was primarily driven by only two organisations. Also, the successful strategic shifts observed in 2022 (e.g. as a result of connecting organisations to wider networks for cage-free work) have not been replicated to the same extent recently.</li><li>Running ORG and TP simultaneously seems inefficient, given limited capacity and resources. Additionally, staff from existing organisations are not prevented from participating in TP.</li></ul><p>In practice, this strategic shift will be implemented as follows:</p><ul><li>Where it is impactful to do so, we will continue supporting organisations upon request, especially our high-priority groups. However, proactive efforts to identify and provide in-depth support to organisations will be discontinued. Communication channels like our WhatsApp group for ORG will remain active for occasional sharing of resources and opportunities.</li><li>Staff from existing organisations will be encouraged to join TP as individual advocates. With the knowledge and skills they acquire from TP, they are welcome to implement lessons learnt for their organisations.</li><li>While maintaining most activities aimed at the broader movement, we will adjust them to align with our strategic shift. For instance, webinars will be organised primarily for the benefit of TP participants or the wider movement, rather than specifically for organisations in ORG.</li></ul><p>By focusing on TP, we aim to nurture individual advocates, incubate new talent and ideas, and foster a wave of advocates equipped to effectively address the challenges of farmed animal welfare in Africa. This shift is guided by our recognition of the higher impact and efficiency achievable through an individual-centric approach.</p><h2>Enhancing our training programme for individuals</h2><p>Owing to what we think is a preliminary success of our TP pilot, we have plans to run a second iteration of TP later in the year. Based on feedback from participants and our internal reflection, we have identified and discussed ways to enhance the programme and address existing bottlenecks. Key changes include an improved selection process for applicants, better expectation setting for participants, and prioritising programme components that participants found most valuable.</p><p>We plan to introduce some of these improvements for the ongoing second phase of our pilot programme, where we will provide extended support for several months to promising and committed participants. This advanced stage focuses on supporting participants to implement high-impact interventions and offering seed grants and incubation for these projects. We are leveraging findings from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/announcing-our-2023-movement-grants/#bryant-research\"><u>our project with Bryant Research</u></a> to make recommendations to participants on evidence-based strategies to mitigate the rise of industrial animal agriculture that compromises animal welfare in African countries. The findings from this research will be published in the coming months.</p><h2>Strengthening movement building efforts in Africa</h2><p>Whilst there was positive feedback about our training programme, we recognise that we alone cannot develop the entire talent pipeline for Africa's farmed animal advocacy movement. Therefore, we see the need for a more comprehensive approach to talent development and are committed to collaborative efforts to build the movement more extensively. Key strategies include:</p><ul><li>Engaging with organisations like Animal Advocacy Careers or Impactful Animal Advocacy to encourage further investment into movement building within Africa, complementing our efforts.</li><li>Focusing on initiatives targeting the upper funnel of the talent pool to attract and nurture early-stage interest in animal advocacy. Possible initiatives include forming a reading club or launching a series of online educational videos. We think this is vital for building a strong base of potential participants for both our programmes and the broader movement. While these top-of-the-funnel activities are crucial, we have decided they should remain separate from our TP so that each initiative has a distinct focus and can effectively cater to different stages of advocate development. Whether such activities will be implemented by us or other capacity builders remains to be seen.</li><li>Pursuing plans to host an African conference on effective animal advocacy by summer 2025. In collaboration with the AVA Summit staff, we aim to make this conference a reality, serving as a major platform for talent engagement, networking, and movement strengthening across the continent.</li></ul><p>These strategies aim to enhance the talent pipeline in African animal advocacy alongside our training program.</p><h2>Regranting and expanding our advisory role to funders and others</h2><p>To further accelerate the development of the African farmed animal advocacy movement, we plan to expand our collaboration with funders and other stakeholders that can benefit from our knowledge and insights. We have previously provided this type of support and this expansion is a natural progression of our evolving role and capabilities.</p><p>Previously, our services in this area were primarily demand-driven, with stakeholders proactively seeking our advice and feedback to support their decision-making processes. Positive feedback from funders \u2013 both subjective endorsements and objective data showing changes in funding amounts and recipients based on our input \u2013 has encouraged us to adopt a more proactive advisory role. This will extend beyond funders to include other stakeholders who could benefit from our expertise, such as advising conference organisers on applicants from Africa.</p><p>While embracing our advisory role, we are still deliberating the extent of our involvement in actively regranting funds to certain organisations. We are mindful of the implications of being perceived as a funding source and are unsure whether it is worth spending the additional effort required for this. For now, we are committed to actively reallocating funds to participants of our TP, providing them with stipends and seed funding for high-impact projects. Future decisions regarding further regranting will be based on a thorough evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of regranting and how they fit with our strategic objectives.</p><h1>Our organisation</h1><h2>Budget and financial information</h2><p>In 2023, our budget remained consistent with the previous year at USD 143,616. Our total expenses amounted to USD 96,897, reflecting a slight decrease from 2022's expenses of USD 100,300.</p><p>Our funding continued to be primarily sourced from philanthropic funds and contributions from high net worth individuals. Notably, we received two substantial donations totalling USD 70,000 from prominent figures in the effective animal advocacy movement. Additionally, we were awarded grants of USD 80,000 from the Effective Altruism Animal Welfare Fund and USD 20,000 from Animal Charity Evaluators. The trend of receiving a growing number of smaller donations from multiple individuals within the Effective Altruism and animal welfare/rights movements also continued.</p><p>We extend our deepest gratitude to our donors, whose generous contributions continue to drive our mission forward. Their support is invaluable to our efforts in improving farmed animal welfare across Africa.</p><h2>Our staff and operations</h2><p>In 2023, we had approximately three FTE staff on average. We recognise our small team size as a potential obstacle for our organisation. However, we have chosen not to significantly scale up our operations at this time, given the strategic shift and the need to assess the outcomes of our first TP. Should our training programme prove cost-effective, we will then consider scaling it up.</p><p>We have submitted registration to become an independent 501(c) organisation in the United States and are awaiting final confirmation.</p><h1>Our mistakes and key areas for improvement</h1><p>There are several ways in which we could have done better in 2023. We summarise the most important aspects here. A detailed list of our mistakes and how we intend to improve can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Mvnzjn6cTGv6d8cuP/animal-advocacy-africa-s-2023-review-and-plans-for-2024#Appendix_D__Our_mistakes_and_key_areas_for_improvement\"><u>appendix D</u></a>.</p><ul><li>Similar to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rEiWzbiWkyBSuLuGy/animal-advocacy-africa-s-2022-review-our-achievements-and-1#6_2_Organisational_development\"><u>last year\u2019s review</u></a>, we continue to face challenges in hiring and retaining additional qualified staff. While we are no longer as funding constrained compared to the previous year, we still encounter difficulties in accessing strong candidates that we could hire in our salary range. We aim for our TP and general movement building efforts to build stronger talent pipelines to help solve this problem.</li><li>We should have transitioned from ORG to TP sooner in 2023, upon realising that we did not have the impact on organisations we were hoping for. The planning and development of TP, along with recruiting and selecting participants, took longer than anticipated. Our limited staff capacity was the primary contributing factor to this. With some of our existing staff transitioning to full-time roles this year and our emphasis on TP, we believe we are better positioned to concentrate on what we consider to be the most impactful direction moving forward.</li><li><a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/announcing-our-2023-movement-grants/#bryant-research\"><u>Our research project in collaboration with Bryant Research</u></a> progressed slower than expected, somewhat affecting the timing for TP and delaying the implementation of actual interventions. The project is nearing completion now.</li><li>We are still lacking a strong understanding of the cost-effectiveness of our programmes. We are hoping to get a better sense of this through BOTECs, CEAs, improving our M&amp;E, and benchmarking against other similar meta organisations.</li></ul><h1>How you can help</h1><h2>Support our mission</h2><p>We are looking for partners that can help us accelerate the growth of the farmed animal advocacy movement in Africa. Funders and other organisations have the opportunity to significantly contribute to our cause. Individuals can support farmed animal advocacy organisations in Africa by donating, connecting us with relevant individuals, offering their services, or simply by raising awareness about the cause. Even if donors or funders are not directly interested in supporting our work but believe in the importance of helping farmed animals in Africa, we are happy to provide guidance or assist in directing their funds to impactful initiatives.</p><p>For 2024, we have a funding gap of $60,000, having fundraised 80% of our budget. If you believe in our mission to build the farmed animal movement in Africa, you can support us with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/credence-institute\"><u>tax-deductible donation</u></a>.</p><p>We are incredibly grateful to all our donors and supporters. At this critical juncture in the neglected African animal advocacy space, every dollar donated goes a long way! Your contributions enable what we do \u2013 our impact is your impact.</p><h2>Give us feedback&nbsp;</h2><p>We don\u2019t have everything figured out and we are just one organisation tackling a highly complex problem in a vast and diverse area.

For transparency, we are highlighting them here rather than revising the original review. The following sentences need to be revised as we have become aware of additional grants that organisations have secured with our assistance:</p><ul><li>\u201cWe helped our partner organisations raise a total of $106,402 (previously: $84,902) throughout 2022.\u201d</li><li>\u201cFor about $37,500 (previously: $20,500) we played a major role as we directly recommended funding opportunities and provided feedback on applications, but it is possible that these grants may have been secured without our support. \u201c</li><li>\u201cFor $45,887 (previously: $41,387), we probably played a smaller role.\u201d</li></ul><p>The realisation that we underestimated our impact last year suggests we might do so again this year. Our Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) systems have limitations and cannot capture all outcomes of our work. Given the diverse support we provide to our organisations, it is inevitable that some details are overlooked. It is also challenging to determine our exact impact on specific outcomes. For example, several organisations we are no longer in close contact with have obtained grants from funders we had previously recommended to all organisations in our network through a general message. We decided that tracking all such instances to ascertain whether these organisations discovered these opportunities through us or another source is not cost-effective. Nevertheless, we are continuously exploring ways to enhance our M&amp;E systems and welcome any suggestions on this matter.</p><h3>Appendix C: Value of different training programme components to participants</h3><p>We asked our training programme participants both about the value of different services and content of the programme. The results, illustrated in the two graphs below, display the average score from all participants, measured on a scale ranging from \"not at all valuable/helpful\" (=1) to \"extremely valuable/helpful\" (=5).</p><p>We find that content for all weeks of the programme was rated as very or extremely valuable.

But self-play has two very difficult challenges</p><ul><li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Self play worked with AlphaGo since the model could judge itself based on a concrete win condition (\u201cDid I win this game of Go?\u201d). But novel reasoning doesn\u2019t have a concrete win condition. And as a result, just as you would expect, LLMs are incapable so far of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01798.pdf\"><u>correcting their own reasoning</u></a>.</li><li><strong>Compute:</strong> All these math/code approaches tend to use various sorts of tree search, where you run an LLM at each node repeatedly. AlphaGo\u2019s compute budget is <a href=\"https://www.yuzeh.com/data/agz-cost.html\"><u>staggering</u></a> for the relatively circumscribed task of winning at Go - now imagine that instead of searching over the space of Go moves - you need to search over the space of all possible human thought. All this extra compute needed to get self-play to work is in addition to the stupendous compute increase already required to scale the parameters themselves (compute = parameters * data). Using the 1e35 FLOP estimate for human-level thought, we need 9 OOMs more compute atop the <a href=\"https://epochai.org/trends\"><u>biggest models</u></a> we have today. Yes, you\u2019ll get improvements from better hardware and better algorithms, but will you really get a full equivalent of 9 OOMs?</li></ul><p><strong>Believer:</strong></p><p>If your main objection to scale working is just the lack of data, your intuitive reaction should not be, \u201cWell it looks we could have produced AGI by scaling up a transformer++, but I guess we\u2019re gonna run out of data first.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Your reaction should be, \u201cHoly fuck, if the internet was a lot bigger, scaling up a model whose basic structure I could write in a <a href=\"https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT\"><u>few hundred lines</u></a> of Python code would have produced a human level mind.

We compound this disability by training them on predicting the next-token - a loss function which is almost completely unrelated to the actual tasks we want intelligent agents to do in the economy. And despite this minuscule intersection between the abilities we actually want and the terrible loss function and data we train these models with, we can produce a baby-AGI (aka GPT-4) by throwing just <a href=\"https://the-decoder.com/gpt-4-architecture-datasets-costs-and-more-leaked/\"><u>00.03%</u></a> of <a href=\"https://companiesmarketcap.com/microsoft/revenue\"><u>Microsoft\u2019s yearly revenues</u></a> at a big scrape of the internet.</p><p>So given how easy and simple AI progress has been so far, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if synthetic data also just works. After all, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dwarkesh_sp/status/1735346394779750877\"><u>\u201cthe models just want to learn\u201d</u></a>.</p><p>GPT-4 has been out for all of 8 months. The other AI labs have only just gotten their own GPT-4 level models. Which means all the researchers are only now getting around to making self-play work with current generation models (and it seems like one of them might have already <a href=\"https://www.interconnects.ai/p/q-star\"><u>succeeded</u></a>). Therefore, the fact that so far we don\u2019t have public evidence that synthetic data has worked at scale doesn\u2019t mean it can\u2019t.&nbsp;</p><p>After all, RL becomes much more feasible when your base model is capable enough to get the right answer at least some of the time (now you can reward that 1/100 times that the model accomplishes the chain of thought required for an extended math proof, or writes the 500 lines of code needed to complete a full pull request). Soon your 1/100 success rate becomes 10/100, then 90/100. Now you try the 1000 line pull requests, and not only will the model sometimes succeed, but it\u2019ll be able to critique itself when it fails. And so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, this synthetic data bootstrapping seems almost directly analogous to human evolution. Our primate ancestors <a href=\"https://pigeon.psy.tufts.edu/psych26/kohler.htm\"><u>show little evidence</u></a> of being able to rapidly discern and apply new insights.&nbsp; But once humans develop language, you have this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Symbolic-Species-Co-evolution-Language-Brain/dp/0393317544\"><u>genetic/cultural coevolution</u></a> which is very similar to the synthetic data/self play loop for LLMs, where the model gets smarter in order to better make sense of the complex symbolic outputs of similar copies.</p><p>Self play doesn\u2019t require models to be perfect at judging their own reasoning. They just have to be better at evaluating reasoning than at doing it de novo (which clearly already seems to be the case - see <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback\"><u>Constitutional AI</u></a>, or just play around GPT for a few minutes, and notice that it seems better at explaining why what you wrote down is wrong than it is at coming up with the right answer by itself)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw8gnbfwm8v\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw8gnbfwm8v\">[4]</a></sup></span><a href=\"https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/will-scaling-work#footnote-4-139936826\"><sup><u>4</u></sup></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Almost all the researchers I talk to in the big AI labs are quite confident they\u2019ll get self-play to work.

But then they remember that confidentiality is a thing, and say, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you specifics, but there\u2019s so much low hanging fruit in terms of what we can try here.\u201d Or as <a href=\"https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/dario-amodei\"><u>Dario Amodei (CEO of Anthropic) told me on my podcast</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong> (00:10:01 - 00:10:06):</p><p>You mentioned that data is likely not to be the constraint.

But no one has demonstrated a method to actually increase the model\u2019s underlying abilities with RL.&nbsp;</p><p>If some kind of self-play/synthetic data doesn\u2019t work, you\u2019re absolutely fucked - there\u2019s no other way around the data bottleneck. A new architecture is extremely unlikely to provide a fix. You would need a jump in sample efficiency much bigger than even LSTMs to transformers. And LSTMs were invented all the way back in the 90s. So you\u2019d need a bigger jump than we have gotten from over 20 years when all the low hanging fruit in deep learning has been most accessible.&nbsp;</p><p>The vibes you\u2019re receiving from people who have an emotional or financial interest in seeing LLMs scale can\u2019t substitute for the complete lack of evidence we have that RL can fix the many OOMs shortfall in data.</p><p>Furthermore, the fact that LLMs seem to need such a stupendous amount of data to get such mediocre reasoning indicates that they simply are not generalizing. If these models can\u2019t get anywhere close to human level performance with the data a human would see in 20,000 years, we should entertain the possibility that 2,000,000,000 years worth of data will be also be insufficient.

That\u2019s just a 100x scaleup. Which sounds like a lot until you consider how much smaller that is than the additional scaleup which we could throw at these models. We can afford a further 10,000x scaleup of GPT-4 (i.e. something GPT-6 level) before we touch even one percent of world GDP. And that\u2019s before we account for pretraining compute efficiency gains (things like mixture-of-experts, flash attention), new post training methods (RLAI, fine tuning on chain of thought, self-play, etc), and <a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/trends-in-machine-learning-hardware\"><u>hardware improvements</u></a>.

Here\u2019s my personal take.</p><p>If you were a scale believer over the last few years, the progress we\u2019ve been seeing would have just made more sense. There is a story you can tell about how GPT-4\u2019s amazing performance can be explained by some idiom library or lookup table which will never generalize. But that\u2019s a story that none of the skeptics pre-registered.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the believers, you have people like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_sholtodouglas/status/1728862047797149827\"><u>Ilya</u></a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dwarkesh_sp/status/1735346394779750877\"><u>Dario</u></a>, <a href=\"https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis\"><u>Gwern</u></a>, etc more or less spelling out the slow takeoff we\u2019ve been seeing due to scaling as early as 12 years ago.</p><p>It seems pretty clear that some amount of scaling can get us to transformative AI - i.e. if you achieve the irreducible loss on these scaling curves, you\u2019ve made an AI that\u2019s smart enough to automate most cognitive labor (including the labor required to make smarter AIs).&nbsp;</p><p>But most things in life are harder than in theory, and many theoretically possible things have just been intractably difficult for some reason or another (fusion power, flying cars, nanotech, etc). If self-play/synthetic data doesn\u2019t work, the models look fucked - you\u2019re never gonna get anywhere near that platonic irreducible loss. Also, the theoretical reason to expect scaling to keep working are murky, and the benchmarks on which scaling seems to lead to better performance have debatable generality.</p><p>So my tentative probabilities are: 70%: scaling + algorithmic progress + hardware advances will get us to AGI by 2040. 30%: the skeptic is right - LLMs and anything even roughly in that vein is fucked.</p><p>I\u2019m probably missing some crucial evidence - the AI labs are simply not releasing that much research, since any insights about the \u201cscience of AI\u201d would leak ideas relevant to building the AGI. A friend who is a researcher at one of these labs told me that he misses his undergrad habit of winding down with a bunch of papers - nowadays, nothing worth reading is published. For this reason, I assume that the things I don\u2019t know would shorten my timelines.</p><p>Also, for what it\u2019s worth, my day job is as a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/DwarkeshPatel\"><u>podcaster</u></a>. But the people who could write a better post are prevented from doing so, either by confidentiality or opportunity cost. So give me a break, and let me know what I missed in the comments.</p><h2>Appendix</h2><p>Here are some additional considerations. I don\u2019t feel I understand these topics well enough to fully make sense of what they imply for scaling.</p><h3>Will models get insight based learning?</h3><p>At a larger scale, models will just naturally develop more efficient meta-learning methods - <a href=\"https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2201.02177\"><u>grokking</u></a> only happens when you have a large overparameterized model and beyond the point at which you\u2019ve trained it to be severely overfit on the data. Grokking seems very similar to how we learn. We have intuitions and mental models of how to categorize new information. And over time with new observations, those mental models themselves change. Gradient descent over such a large diversity of data will select for the most general and extrapolative circuits. Hence we get grokking - eventually we\u2019ll get insight based learning.</p><p><strong>Skeptic:</strong></p><p>Neural networks have grokking, but that's orders of magnitude less efficient than how humans actually integrate new explanatory insights. You teach a kid that the sun is at the center of the solar system, and that immediately changes how he makes sense of the night sky. But you can't just feed a single copy of Copernicus into a model untrained on any astronomy, and have it immediately incorporate that insight into all relevant future outputs. It\u2019s bizarre that the model has to hear information so many times in so many different contexts to 'grok' the underlying concepts.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only have models never demonstrated insight learning, but I don\u2019t see how such learning is even possible given the way we train neural networks with gradient descent - we give them a bunch of very subtle nudges with each example, with the hope that enough such nudges will slowly push them atop the correct hill. Insight based learning requires an immediate drag-and-drop from sea level to the top of Mount Everest.</p><h3>Does primate evolution give evidence of scaling?</h3><p><strong>Believer:</strong></p><p>I\u2019m sure you could find all sorts of these embarrassing fragilities in chimpanzee cognition that are far more damning than the reversal curse. Doesn\u2019t mean there was some fundamental limit on primate brains that couldn\u2019t be fixed by 3x scale plus some finetuning.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed as Suzana Herculano-Houzel has <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2776484/\"><u>shown</u></a>, the human brain has as many neurons as you\u2019d expect a scaled up primate brain with the mass of a human brain to have. Rodent and insectivore brains have much worse scaling laws - relatively bigger brained species in those orders have far fewer neurons than you would expect just from their brain mass.</p><p>This suggests there\u2019s some primate neural architecture that\u2019s really scalable in comparison to the brains of other kinds of species, analogous to how <a href=\"https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2001.08361\"><u>transformers have better scaling curves</u></a> than LSTMs and RNNs. Evolution learned (or at least stumbled upon) <a href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"><u>the bitter lesson</u></a> when designing primate brains. And the niche in which primates were competing strongly rewarded marginal increases in intelligence (you have to make sense of all this data from your binocular vision, tool-using hands, and other smart monkeys who can talk to you).</p><p><i>Many thanks to </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrispainteryup\"><i><u>Chris Painter</u></i></a><i>, </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jekbradbury\"><i><u>James Bradburry</u></i></a><i>, </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kipperrii\"><i><u>Kipply</u></i></a><i>, </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jsevillamol\"><i><u>Jamie Sevilla</u></i></a><i>, </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tamaybes?lang=en\"><i><u>Tamay Besiroglu</u></i></a><i>, </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MatthewJBar\"><i><u>Matthew Barnett</u></i></a><i>, </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AgustinLebron3\"><i><u>Agustin Lebron</u></i></a><i>, </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/acv\"><i><u>Anil Varanasi</u></i></a><i>, and </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/_sholtodouglas\"><i><u>Sholto Douglas</u></i></a><i> for comments and discussion.</i></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnpq85a2gkkd\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefpq85a2gkkd\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>That seems to be the amount of compute you need to scale up a current model so that it\u2019s good enough to write a scientific manuscript length output which is indistinguishable from what human might have written.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnn1emrlask2\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefn1emrlask2\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Assuming Chinchilla optimal scaling (this roughly means that to scale compute efficiently, half of that additional compute should come from increasing data, and half from increasing parameters).

This is my first EA Forum post, outlining a recent upskilling project I completed.</p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> I used steelman solitaire to break down my moral framework and re-evaluate it on a fundamental level. I changed my mind in multiple significant ways and got better at avoiding <a href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/anchoring-bias\">anchoring bias</a>. I highly recommend trying this project if you are seeking to improve your reasoning skills and/or refine your moral values.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Background</h1><p>In May 2023, I was accepted to the February 2024 cohort of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/incubation-program\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship Incubation Program</u></a>. While I have explored moral philosophy as a hobby for many years, I wanted to refine my beliefs before launching a new organization to ensure a solid theoretical foundation for my decision making.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefok8h00tmp4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnok8h00tmp4\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In addition, I wanted to improve my critical reasoning and written communication skills.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxa2n029xt1t\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxa2n029xt1t\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Thus, between June 29, 2023 and January 13, 2024, I spent over 40 hours<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref71m8hyget1k\"><sup><a href=\"#fn71m8hyget1k\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;deconstructing and re-evaluating my moral beliefs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Methodology</h1><p>To start out, I outlined topics and questions within moral philosophy that I wanted to explore. For each question, I read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/\"><u>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy</u></a> page on the topic. For topics without Stanford Encyclopedia pages, I used Wikipedia instead. Sometimes I also utilized non-systematic Google searches, prompted ChatGPT, and had conversations with friends. This was admittedly a somewhat shallow exploration, but I wanted to prioritize breadth over depth since my time was limited and I wanted to explore every topic to some degree.</p><p>Once I outlined all the major positions on a topic, I determined my initial leaning (if any). I then engaged in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JEseCAJMvtfr868wb/how-to-come-to-better-conclusions-by-playing-steelman\"><u>steelman solitaire</u></a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref85qs79xl2zr\"><sup><a href=\"#fn85qs79xl2zr\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This involved developing the strongest possible arguments, counter-arguments, counter-counter-arguments, etc. that I could with the goal of changing my own mind. Once I successfully changed my mind, I would repeat the process and try to change my mind again. Sometimes, this would lead to exploring a new position that was not in my original list, in which case I would write down the new position and then proceed as usual. This process repeated until efforts to change my position reached a point of diminishing returns. I then recorded my \u201cfinal\u201d result<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflefeh8vbp3k\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlefeh8vbp3k\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and the number of times that I changed my mind.</p><p>The topics I explored are outlined below:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/metaethics\"><u>Metaethics</u></a><ul><li>Do moral statements have truth values?</li><li>Are some moral statements objectively true?</li><li>If any moral statements are true (either objectively or subjectively), how can the truth of moral statements be known/learned?</li></ul></li><li>Fundamentals of morality<ul><li>Goals for my moral framework</li><li>Are good actions inherently good (deontological ethics) or instrumentally good (teleological ethics)?</li><li>What values (welfare, autonomy, personal virtues, etc.) are fundamentally good?</li><li>Broadly speaking, how should I use these fundamental values to make decisions?</li><li>Is there a fundamental difference between acts and omissions?</li><li>Who qualifies as a moral patient, and how should consideration for moral patients be weighted?</li></ul></li><li>Special topics<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/population-ethics\"><u>Population ethics</u></a></li><li>What are my moral obligations?</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-uncertainty\"><u>Moral uncertainty</u></a></li></ul></li></ul><p>One of the weaknesses in my methodology is that some of my questions presuppose an answer for other questions. This is explored more in the discussion section of this report.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Results</h1><p>My overall moral system is outlined below. I include this section primarily to encourage myself to write about nuanced topics with clarity and concision. It also seemed wrong to write about refining my moral system without sharing anything about said moral system. For brevity, I will summarize my current views rather than outlining my entire process for each issue. However, I will discuss some specific cases where my mind changed significantly or my exploration was notable.</p><p>Disclaimer: These results are accurate as of the publication of this post, but they are almost guaranteed to shift over time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Meta-ethics</h2><h3>Do moral statements have truth values?</h3><p>I do believe moral statements have truth values. However, I briefly convinced myself of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_prescriptivism\"><u>universal prescriptivism</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmokk8v01k4q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmokk8v01k4q\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;before coming to my final conclusion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Are some moral statements objectively true?</h3><p>I do not believe that any moral statements are objectively true. I believe that moral judgements are dependent on the subjective lenses and frameworks that we apply.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>If any moral statements are true (either objectively or subjectively), how can the truth of moral statements be known/learned?</h3><p>I believe moral judgements should be based on reason. However, this reasoning needs to be grounded in a set of assumptions, which I believe should be based on intuition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Fundamentals of morality</h2><h3>Goals for my moral framework</h3><ul><li>Accuracy: My moral framework should be accurate to my most fundamental intuitions (though not necessarily my intuitions about complicated scenarios).</li><li>Consistency: My moral framework should not contradict itself.</li><li>Robustness: My moral framework should accommodate for the fact that I am uncertain about many moral issues, and I am either uncertain or mistaken about many non-moral issues.</li><li>Applicability: My moral framework should give clear guidance for how to make important decisions, even if it is overly complicated for simple ones.</li><li>Simplicity: Holding all else equal, it is better for my moral framework to have fewer conditions and complicating factors.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Are good actions inherently good (deontological ethics) or instrumentally good (teleological ethics)?</h3><p>I believe that good actions are instrumentally good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What values (welfare, autonomy, personal virtues, etc.) are fundamentally good?</h3><ul><li>Welfare<ul><li>I always believed that welfare was fundamental. However, I initially believed that suffering prevention was more important than happiness promotion. I now believe happiness and suffering levels should be weighted based on preferences (as outlined later). As a result, I no longer have any theoretical preference between suffering prevention and happiness promotion.</li></ul></li><li>Autonomy<ul><li>I initially did not think that autonomy was fundamentally good beyond its capacity to affect welfare. However, I changed my mind after considering cases when well-informed rational agents choose to do something that I believe is bad for them. In those cases, it seems wrong to stop them, but that contradicts a purely welfarist view.</li></ul></li><li>Other values<ul><li>I also considered personal virtues, equality, and justice. I determined that they are good, but only to the extent that they further welfare and autonomy.</li><li>At one point in this process, I considered justice to be fundamental. Within that belief system, I prioritized the welfare of those who promoted the welfare of others. However, due my leaning towards behavioral determinism,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv3o8ydyl8z9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv3o8ydyl8z9\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I do not think it makes sense to prioritize anyone\u2019s welfare on a fundamental level. If I change my mind on behavioral determinism, I will likely add justice back into my moral framework.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Broadly speaking, how should I use these fundamental values to make decisions?</h3><p>After multiple iterations, I defined the following system, which I am fairly satisfied with.</p><ul><li>1) I should seek to maximize happiness and minimize suffering.<ul><li>Equivalent amounts of happiness and suffering are determined based upon the level of suffering people would generally endure to receive a given amount of happiness. This may not coincide with equivalent magnitudes of sensation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref59q7dkd2h0i\"><sup><a href=\"#fn59q7dkd2h0i\">[8]</a></sup></span></li><li>At one point, I considered some forms of happiness derived from the suffering of others and some forms of suffering derived from the happiness of others to be morally neutral. However, I do not think that this is consistent with my leaning towards behavioral determinism. Similar to my belief about justice as a fundamental value, if I change my mind about behavioral determinism, I will likely reincorporate these ideas into my moral framework.</li></ul></li><li>2) Interference, defined as taking actions that inhibit the choices of others or manipulating others into changing their decisions, should not be done under any of the following circumstances:<ul><li>a) It is possible to achieve the same ends through communication.</li><li>b) All beings I am trying to help by interfering are well-informed, consenting, and of sound mind.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefiynnl1lh59\"><sup><a href=\"#fniynnl1lh59\">[9]</a></sup></span></li><li>c) There is a reasonable chance that those I am trying to help, if well-informed and of sound mind, would believe that my actions are negative in expectation.</li><li>d) Both of the following two conditions are met.<ul><li>(i) All beings I am trying to help do not believe in the harm I am trying to protect them from, but they are otherwise well-informed, consenting, and of sound mind.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5qea09vbfrk\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5qea09vbfrk\">[10]</a></sup></span></li><li>(ii) I can warn them about the potential harm, giving them the option to avoid it.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Is there a fundamental difference between acts and omissions?</h3><p>While I strongly considered the possibility that my new autonomy restrictions only applied to actions and not omissions, I eventually returned to the belief that omissions are just a type of action.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Who qualifies as a moral patient, and how should consideration for moral patients be weighted?</h3><p>I believe that a being\u2019s status as a moral patient should be determined on the basis of whether or not they are sentient.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefr7qhxrhj6jb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnr7qhxrhj6jb\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;All sentient beings should be treated impartially, weighted only according to the magnitude of happiness and suffering they might experience in a given situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Special topics</h2><h3>Population ethics</h3><p>My primary exploration within population ethics was whether the welfare of potential new beings should be treated differently from the welfare of those who are already alive. My initial leaning was towards a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-affecting_view\"><u>person-affecting perspective</u></a>. I thought that creating happy people was much less significant than making people happy (and possibly even morally neutral).</p><p>I now take a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_and_total_utilitarianism\">totalist perspective</a>. I see no distinction between creating new happy beings and improving the lives of existing beings, assuming the change in total welfare is the same.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What are my moral obligations?</h3><p>My initial belief was that I am obligated to mostly maximize my impact while leaving a buffer to avoid unsustainability. For the most part this was unchanged, but there is an exception. In extreme circumstances, the marginal gains of sacrificing sustainability could exceed the impact I expect to have over the course of my life. In those situations alone, I believe that I am required to maximize my impact completely.</p><p>My biggest revelation on this topic was that I don\u2019t believe moral obligations should be determined based on fundamental principles. Instead, I think they should be decided based on psychology and what will motivate people to do the greatest amount of good.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Moral uncertainty</h3><p>I started believing that moral uncertainty should be resolved by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/31934/chapter/267645210\"><u>maximizing expected choiceworthiness</u></a>. To determine the value of a given outcome under this framework, you find the average value assigned by various moral theories, weighted by your personal credence for each theory. However, this strategy overvalues theories that consider many actions to be maximally good or maximally bad relative to more nuanced theories. I considered five other distinct systems and landed on a cooperative moral parliament system<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmam563n9sxc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmam563n9sxc\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;inspired by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Parliamentary-Approach-to-Moral-Uncertainty.pdf\"><u>Newberry and Ord</u></a>, though conceptualized slightly differently.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2gnc6zxawop\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2gnc6zxawop\">[13]</a></sup></span></p><p>To serve as an input for my moral parliament system, I assigned credence values to each of my major moral beliefs. Since I don\u2019t believe there are objective truth values to moral statements, these credence values measure the probability that an infinitely-informed version of myself would converge on a given answer.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnattwhv0gm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnattwhv0gm\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I will not be sharing my credence values as I don\u2019t think I am&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/calibration\"><u>well-calibrated</u></a> enough to publish them confidently.

First, much of the work I engaged in was pretty far removed from my primary goal of informing future decisions. To be clear, some aspects of my exploration included fundamental shifts that could affect big decisions, such as the inclusion of autonomy as a fundamental value or defining my approach to moral uncertainty more explicitly. However, I spent a large amount of time trying to refine smaller pieces that matter less. For example, I studied a few highly specific dilemmas that compare increasing autonomy and preventing a decrease in autonomy in the context of comparing acts and omissions. While that exploration was still valuable for improving my moral reasoning skills, it is relatively unlikely that such subtle nuances will ever be decision-relevant.</p><p>Second, despite trying to openly explore all perspectives, I frequently found myself slipping into a pattern of reinforcing my existing beliefs. What I found most surprising was that this tendency did not disappear even after changing my mind on a position more than once. This was a truly valuable lesson on how important it is to be vigilant when engaging in steelman solitaire.</p><p>Third, some of my questions seemed to suggest answers to prior questions. For example, \u201cWhat values are fundamentally good?\u201d implies that good actions are only instrumentally good and could have&nbsp;<u>anchored</u> me to that view. However, one of the questions I wanted to explore was whether good actions are inherently good rather than just instrumentally good. If I would have defined questions in a more neutral way, I could have decreased the level of bias in my thinking.</p><p>Finally, I discovered how difficult it is to assign credence values to whether or not I will change my mind about something. This seems primarily due to the fact that almost all unknowns regarding my future beliefs are unknown unknowns, which causes greater difficulty when making predictions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Future exploration</h2><p>Given that I don\u2019t believe that moral beliefs should ever be finalized, there is significant room for further exploration with any/all of the questions I considered. Most notably, my leaning towards behavioral determinism was a crux for two significant pieces of my moral theory. Given that I have put little effort into scrutinizing my beliefs about free will, this is a promising area of exploration. I would also like to refine the credence values from the Moral uncertainty section once I am more well-calibrated.</p><p>Beyond refining my existing beliefs, there are some open questions that I did not get the chance to explore within the time constraints of my project. For example, \u201cAre some forms of happiness and suffering categorically more important than others?\u201d and \u201cShould I change my actions in response to threats and/or attempts to manipulate me using my moral theory?\u201d I also never explicitly compared specific types of happiness and suffering, since this project was largely theoretical. However, it would be good to develop a system of specific moral comparisons to gain a better understanding of what I value in a practical sense. On a related note, I would be interested in undertaking a similar project to re-evaluate my political beliefs or other practical considerations related to morality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Final reflection</h2><p>I believe I have achieved all of the goals of this project. I significantly shifted and refined my moral system, and I feel much more prepared to face challenging moral decisions. In addition, I believe I have greatly increased my ability to combat anchoring bias, which has historically been one of the biases I struggle with most. Finally, through writing this report, I have forced myself to reconsider and clarify my beliefs such that they can be understood by others. I think I have done a reasonably good job, but I guess you can be the judge of that.</p><p>This project is a great experience for anyone who wants to improve their reasoning skills and/or refine their moral values, especially if you enjoy philosophy like I do. However, if your main drive is refining your moral values, be careful to ensure that all the questions you consider are actually decision-relevant, and feel free to skip steps as needed.</p><p>If you try this project, be careful to actively avoid anchoring bias throughout the entire process.

You also need to ensure that your bylaws and investor agreements are heavily skewed in your favor (I recommend the short book called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fundraising-Ryan-Breslow/dp/B09CR7TFDT\">Fundraising</a>). Always remember that investors invest for profit.</li><li><strong>Incentive alignment:</strong> It's important that your financial incentives are aligned with the AI safety purposes, otherwise the core research and development will likely skew in a less impactful direction.</li><li><strong>Scaling too fast:</strong> The culture of high growth can easily divert your original purpose.

Following a 1 hour research sprint, it was identified as a highly promising intervention idea, and a ~9 hour shallow dive was conducted by Aashish Khimasia (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18vX4Hs8gfN6nIFnMdSGdm8Gnb8_mnh-mq-DrI4gcKCc/edit\"><u>here</u></a>), following which this idea was recommended for this 80 hour deep dive.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1.1.1. Defining key terms</strong></h3><p>1.1.1.1 Global South</p><p>The \u2018Global South\u2019 is a term that refers to a heterogeneous set of developing countries, generally distributed around and below the Equator, in regions including Central and South America, the Middle East and North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.</p><p>In this report, it shall refer to a collection of developing nations across these regions where, most critically in this context, farming has not been comprehensively intensified to the levels of developed states like the United States and where the scale of farming is projected to increase at high rates over the coming decades as the nation develops.&nbsp;</p><p>1.1.1.2 Intensification</p><p>Intensive animal agriculture, also referred to as factory farming, is a practice of rearing animals for meat and other products that prioritises maximising production and minimising costs, which somewhat inescapably leads to the violation of animal welfare. Intensification is the process of transitioning animal agriculture systems from constituting of mainly subsistence, small-holders and semi-intensive farms, where the numbers of animals are lower, animals are kept at lower densities and agricultural technologies such as cages and feeding systems and less prevalent, to constituting of mainly factory farms, where animals are kept in high numbers, at high densities, with a range of agricultural technologies and systemic practices are adopted that often further compromise animal welfare. This process tends to occur as the demand for animal products in a country increases as it develops, and as such the scale of animal farming increases to meet this demand (<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend\"><u>Blyth and Springlea, 2023</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>It is estimated that 74% of vertebrate land animals worldwide are factory farmed, and that&nbsp; 88-97% of vertebrate land animals and fish are factory farmed (<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/global-animal-farming-estimates\"><u>Anthis and Anthis, 2019</u></a>). In the US, 99% of chickens are raised in factory farms&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ffacoalition.org/articles/what-is-chicken-factory-farming-and-how-bad-is-it/#:~:text=An%20estimated%2099%20percent%20of,are%20confined%20in%20factory%20farms.\"><u>(FFAC, 2022)</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>1.1.2. Overview of animal agriculture and animal product consumption in the Global South</strong></h3><p>This section is taken from this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PCHnVeBKgUpZR4lTtTQMA9pbua2Ju6WoOPtryn7vLaA/edit#heading=h.wjizo7d161u7\"><u>cause area report</u></a>. The following three takeaways from major reports on this cause area give a good summary of the basic problem we are trying to address here:</p><p>\u201cConsumption of meat and animal products is projected to increase substantially over the coming decades, with one study projecting a global increase of 38% between 2020 and 2050. [...] The growth will be highest in low and lower-middle income countries. [...] This growth will likely be supported by the intensification of agriculture - more animals will be produced, and they will be farmed under more intensive conditions.\u201d</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-consumption-and-production-in-developing-countries-who-bucks-the-trend\"><u>Animal Ask</u></a></li></ul><p>\u201cA recent report by the OECD and FAO estimates that the majority of growth in meat production in the next decade will occur in developing regions,&nbsp;<i>accounting for 84% of the additional output</i>\u201d.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PzAkiFQpiiJmUJ51Yovb04S67hHq-ryq4z-OnIsGH54/edit\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship</u></a></li></ul><p>From 2021 to 2030,&nbsp;<i>poultry production in LMICs</i> is expected to&nbsp;<i>increase by ~15%</i> compared to 4.8% in HICs.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/cb5332en/Meat.pdf\"><u>OECD/FAO, 2021</u></a></li></ul><p>In short, the problem we are dealing with is that factory farming will grow substantially in the Global South over the coming decades. The most drastic effect of this will probably be an increase in suffering to billions of animals. We have focused the majority of our time and attention on trying to quantify this effect. However, there are further effects in the areas of food security, public health, climate change, and others that are highly interrelated with agricultural production and should not be neglected.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12nG1gi14fJ3768j10VvOLbl4ZpuO4lK378dKs-cHUQU/edit#gid=0\"><u>This spreadsheet</u></a> summarises our data on the size of the problem, focusing on those countries that are currently classified as low or lower-middle income countries by the World Bank. Due to time constraints, we focused our analysis on chickens only.&nbsp;</p><p>Some key takeaways are listed here:</p><ul><li>We estimate that ~7.7 billion chickens were farmed in low and lower-middle income countries in 2023.</li><li>We estimate this number to increase to ~12.8 billion in 2050.</li><li>Over this whole time period (2023-2050), this means that ~288 billion chicken life years will be affected by farming in those countries.</li><li>Not all of these animals will be subject to factory farming conditions of course. However, it seems reasonable to assume that the great majority of them will be, as the prevalence of cages is very high in many LMICs. See the tab \u201cPrevalence of cages\u201d for more details. We can see that the lowest percentage of cages is found in highly developed economies, while low and lower-middle income countries can range from 50-100% of animals in cages, with most LMICs recording shares of 100%.</li><li>We estimate that there will be a total population of ~ 5.5 billion humans by 2050 across the candidate low and lower-middle income countries (as classified by the World Bank)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12nG1gi14fJ3768j10VvOLbl4ZpuO4lK378dKs-cHUQU/edit#gid=0\"><u>(see spreadsheet)</u></a></li><li>The 20 countries with the highest rate of expected population growth are in Africa</li></ul><h1>2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Theories of change</h1><h2>2.1 &nbsp; Scope of the intervention</h2><p>Given the size and variation of countries in the Global South, I decided to limit the scope of this report to countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PCHnVeBKgUpZR4lTtTQMA9pbua2Ju6WoOPtryn7vLaA/edit#heading=h.djs3x6ipksoc\"><u>these countries have the highest projected growth in animals farmed until 2050</u></a>.</p><p>Although the initial intervention idea was considered influencing a range of policies, following the previous rapid research, I have decided to limit the scope to focusing on policies regarding subsidy allocation, as this seemed to have the highest ceiling for effect size.

(2020)</u></a> demonstrates a&nbsp;gradient of intensification, from backyard to intensive systems, as opposed to a binary. <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6we6erMcg4wDgvrkc/pne4zyyarv914xc8o9bf\"></p><p>There was a notable difference in the practices employed by different farm clusters. Clusters 1 and 2 depended largely on home produced inputs, such as feed and animals. It is noted that these farms likely over time scaled up production without adapting practices or infrastructure. The larger scale farms in clusters 3 and 4 employed diverse combinations of practices which allowed them to produce at higher rates. In particular, cluster 3 purchased chicks rather than naturally incubating and raising them, allowing them to select breeds with better genetic potential to reach higher live weights, leading to higher productivity. This is notably a hallmark trait of industrial broiler production in the Global North.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, no farm was solely dedicated to the production of chicken, with 88% involved in crop farming, 68% in other forms of livestock farming and 45% engaging in other off-farm professional activity.&nbsp;<br>Impact upon uncertainty</p><p>Overall, this demonstrates the gradient of intensification that seems apparent in farming systems in Sub Saharan Africa. It is important to note that this is only one study, and more research on the ground must be done to test and further characterise this phenomenon, meaning that one cannot update too strongly based on this. Nevertheless, this corroborates the view of experts about the nature of farming in sub Saharan Africa (see section&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kaal07q2eHqyWuTF6CEU4LgaWYAZknTtvDT_VRe_jj8/edit#heading=h.rc48491egd37\"><u>4.2</u></a>). However, this moderately increases the uncertainty about whether this intervention may be appropriate. Given the gradation of intensification, it is likely that different clusters of farms will experience different limiting factors to their ability to intensify, and the role subsidies play for each will be variable. Further, different farm types may follow different trajectories of intensification.&nbsp;</p><p>The minimal information about the specific types of farms present in the region and a limited understanding of how they progress along the scale of intensification increases uncertainty about how this could be effectively pursued.&nbsp;More research must be conducted to accurately map the distribution of farms in the country of focus, before an intervention can be aptly designed.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.1.2 Can the further intensification of animal agriculture realistically be hindered through any forms of advocacy?</strong></h3><p>Just under half of experts interviewed by Animal Advoacy Africa in their landscape report (Tan, 2021) think factory farming could be prevented, halted or slowed. Some methods suggested by these experts include forms of political outreach, such as for taxes on producers, taxes on retailers or lobbying for the redirection of subsidies to high welfare, sustainable systems.</p><p>Impact upon uncertainty</p><p>AAA\u2019s landscape report notes that some (just under half) of experts interviewed feel that think factory farming could be prevented, halted or slowed, including through the reallocation of agricultural subsidies. This provides a slight positive update to the overarching uncertainty, as it demonstrates local experts do believe this intervention strategy could be tractable, although more than half do not.&nbsp;</p><h2>3.2 Are agricultural subsidies an appropriate target for an intervention to slow down intensification of animal agriculture in Sub Saharan Africa ?</h2><h3><strong>3.2.1.

However, Some economists argue that agricultural subsidies are expensive, benefit the wrong people and distort agricultural markets as they incentivise farmers to overuse whatever is subsidised leading to bad land management and farming practices, as was seen in New Zealand&nbsp;<a href=\"https://austriancenter.com/abolishing-agricultural-subsidies-the-new-zealand-story/\"><u>(Molloy, 2023)</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Historical Context of Subsidies</p><p>Agricultural subsidies in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have evolved significantly over the years. In the initial phase, from the 1960s to 1980s, universal subsidy programmes were predominant. During this period, many African governments maintained control over input and output marketing systems, supplying farmers with agricultural inputs like fertilizers and seeds at subsidized prices, often coupled with heavily subsidized credit. These measures were part of an overarching strategy to increase agricultural productivity, recognizing that agricultural input use in SSA was notably low by international standards.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this era of subsidies eventually came to an end, as programs were dismantled and input markets liberalized as part of the structural adjustment process, leading to a decline in input use and agricultural productivity. Although they were beneficial, succeeding in raising input use by farmers and increased agricultural productivity, they also had many detrimental effects, being expensive, tending to benefit relatively well off and better connected farmers, making advances in agricultural productivity dependent on continued government support and with fertiliser programmes being prone to inefficiencies arising from high administrative costs, government monopolies and political manipulation.</p><p>Current Application of Subsidies</p><p>The late 1990s marked the advent of the second phase of agricultural subsidies in SSA, shifting from universal to 'smart' subsidy programs. This shift was spearheaded by the Malawian government in 1998, which provided free fertilizers to farmers. The momentum continued with the African Union's Abuja Declaration on Fertilizer for the African Green Revolution in 2006 (Winnie et al., 2022), aiming to increase fertilizer use to an average of 50 kg/ha by 2015. This plan emphasized the use of smart subsidies to enhance access to fertilizers for smallholder farmers, a model later adopted by countries like Nigeria, Zambia, Tanzania, Kenya, and Ghana.</p><p>Nature of Smart Subsidies</p><p>Smart subsidies are characterized by their cost-effective design and specific principles. They target particular groups of farmers, especially those who do not already apply agricultural inputs and belong to the poorest households, thus mitigating the risk of displacing non-subsidized input sales. These subsidies utilize and bolster existing private input supply networks instead of replacing them with state-controlled systems, increasing the chances of sustained impact. Moreover, smart subsidies incorporate an exit strategy with a time limit, encouraging long-term sustainability and preparing producers for self-sustained use of inputs on market terms.</p><p>Role of smart subsidies in intensification</p><p><a href=\"https://humidtropics.cgiar.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2014/12/Sustainable-intensification-and-the-African-smallholder.pdf\"><u>Vanluawe et al. (2014)</u></a> recommends smart subsidy programmes as a method the government can use for the facilitation of sustainable intensification, through reducing the cost of key inputs.</p><p>Evaluation and Challenges</p><p>Despite the transition to smart subsidies, several challenges persist. Studies, such as the one conducted by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/derec/49231998.pdf\"><u>Baltzer and Hansen (2012)</u></a>, review case studies to reveal that while these subsidies raise agricultural productivity, they inherit many problems of the universal programs. They are costly and inefficient, with administrative problems and poor targeting, leading to limited total expansion in the use of agricultural inputs. The benefits are often unevenly distributed, favoring politically connected or powerful individuals. Moreover, the poorest households are frequently excluded due to high co-financing requirements.</p><p>The implementation of smart subsidies has also been criticized for not addressing the root causes of low input use and agricultural productivity, such as high input procurement costs and market failures. The entrenched nature of these programs within the political system, coupled with the vested interests of various stakeholders in their continuation, raises doubts about the success of their exit strategies. These programs have become more susceptible to political manipulation, questioning their overall sustainability.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In conclusion, while smart subsidy programs in SSA have demonstrated the capacity to increase agricultural output, their sustainability and net benefits are questionable. The economic costs of delivering agricultural inputs to farmers are often too high compared to the benefits of higher production. Consequently, the adoption of agricultural inputs under these programs may not always represent a profitable investment, suggesting a need for a more holistic and sustainable approach to address the challenges of agriculture in SSA.</p><p>Impact on uncertainty</p><p>This evidence demonstrates that although agricultural subsidies are allocated in SSA and that their provision does generally increase production, subsidies are poorly implemented, and so the impact that they currently have on facilitating intensification in Sub Saharan Africa is likely not extremely large, causing a mild negative update on whether they should be targeted for this intervention. Nevertheless, this may also provide an organisation with the opportunity to make a case for their better implementation, in a way that also considers animal welfare. However, the nature of subsidies being used instrumentally in local politics for individuals to maintain or gain power through control of their allocation, makes it likely more challenging to convince key stakeholders to change their allocation. Therefore, overall, this section causes a moderately large negative update on the core uncertainty about whether subsidies are an appropriate target for this intervention.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.2.2. To what extent do subsidies facilitate intensification?</strong></h3><p>A systematic review of the drivers and constraints on agricultural expansion in Sub-Saharan Africa from 1970 to 2020 identified four proximate drivers and seven underlying drivers to cause agriculture expansion with a focus on arable agriculture, directly and indirectly respectively (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/10/3/332\"><u>Jellason et al., 2021</u></a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Soil fertility decline, climate change and variability, access to services, demand for food and fuel, were found to be important drivers of agricultural expansion. Population dynamic and human resettlement, demand for agricultural land, government policies, accessibility/distance to market, increase in prices of agricultural products, increased income, land tenure were found to indirectly cause agricultural expansion, at both the&nbsp; micro and macro levels.</p><p>This review concluded that factors such as effective law enforcement, endemic pests and diseases, conflict and insecurity, productivity uncertainty, culture, cost of land clearing, agricultural inputs subsidies availability have been found to place restraints on agricultural expansion.&nbsp;</p><p>The authors also identify that one reason why increasing populations or improved market opportunities which put pressure on areas of natural vegetation due to a need for increased food production or income generation do not always result in agricultural expansion is because of the availability of incentives and opportunities to intensify agricultural production instead, namely subsidies. Indeed, agricultural subsidies restraining agricultural expansion in some contexts likely implies that it induced some degree of intensification, driving increased production per hectare rather than an expansion of the area being farmed.&nbsp;</p><p>Although a causal relationship between the provision of agricultural subsidies and agricultural intensification has been identified by the authors, this review also notes the context specific influences of different drivers. Indeed, the authors identified that agricultural subsidies have been shown to limit expansion but drive intensification in Malawi (<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-conservation/article/abs/agricultural-subsidies-and-forest-clearing-in-malawi/67EDFD0DBDD39F365084BDB9EBBF0E84\"><u>Chibwana et al., 2012</u></a>), whereas they were found to drive expansion in Ghana (<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270887775_Examining_agricultural_land-usecover_change_options_in_rural_Northern_Ghana_A_participatory_scenario_exploration_exercise_approach\"><u>Badmos et al., 2015</u></a>). This demonstrates how the impact of subsidies can vary across context, with the review concluding that the location-specific influences, and interactions between the drivers, are still insufficiently understood.</p><p>Impact on uncertainty</p><p>This review focuses on agricultural expansion rather than intensification, therefore the extent to which it can inform specifically upon intensification is limited. However, this was the most appropriate review I could find, given the limited literature on this subject in this context.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it demonstrates two key points that cause important updates on the overarching uncertainty of the extent to which agricultural subsidies drive intensification.&nbsp;</p><p>It demonstrates that agricultural changes are driven by a range of factors, both underlying and more direct. Further, it demonstrates that the influence of these factors are context specific. Lastly, it notes the limited existing literature on agricultural expansion and intensification in Sub Saharan Africa, resulting in an insufficent understanding of the drivers of these agricultural changes in this region. In this way, this also causes a moderately large negative update on the appropriateness of targeting agricultural subsidies to slow down intensification in Sub Saharan Africa. This means that the extent to which subsidies drive intensification is most likely limited, as they are but one of a multitude of factors that drive this agricultural change, and their influence is context-dependent, based on the location and interaction with factors, yet this is currently insufficiently understood.&nbsp;</p><h2>3.3&nbsp; Evidence that the charity can make a change in this space</h2><h3><strong>3.3.1. When have governments previously changed their subsidy plans?</strong></h3><p>The ending of the first phase of agricultural subsidies in Africa in the 1980s was a result of a combination of economic, social and political factors. Original programmes were criticised for low efficiency and high corruption, new economic ideas meant that subsidisation by the government was becoming less popular in favour of market oriented strategies and countries had limited financial resources. In New Zealand, farm subsidies were also removed in the 1980s, largely as a response to an economic crisis and external debt. In both sets of cases, there appeared to be limited influence from lobbyists to influence this and this decision seemed to be significantly driven by necessity.&nbsp;</p><p>Impact on uncertainty</p><p>This slightly increases my already high uncertainty that influencing subsidy allocation is tractable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.3.2. How tractable is environmental policy progress for countries in Sub Saharan Africa?</strong></h3><p>According to the African Climate Change Adaptation Performance Index&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2665972721000647\"><u>(Epule et al., 2021)</u></a>, most countries in Africa do not have strong climate policy environments, despite African countries experiencing and being modelled to experience some of the worst harms from climate change&nbsp;<a href=\"https://press.un.org/en/2019/gaef3516.doc.htm\"><u>(United Nations, 2019)</u></a>. This implies that these governments do not already prioritise protection against environmental harms and are less likely to adopt policies with this aim.</p><p>Yale\u2019s Environmental Protection Index (EPI) (<a href=\"https://epi.yale.edu/\"><u>Yale University, 2022</u></a>), which ranks countries on 40 measures, found that African countries fell low, accounting for 32 of the bottom 50 countries. Notably, a strong positive correlation between EPI score and GDP was found.</p><p>This provides evidence to support my intuition that countries with low GDP are unlikely to have the resources nor attentional capacity to commit to policies which focus on environmental protection</p><p>The EPI authors found that control of corruption, regulatory quality, and the rule of law have a greater influence on the environmental performance of nation states, and that individual elements of good governance are also responsible for the implementation of environmental and climate policies.</p><p>According to Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perception Index&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022\"><u>(Transparency International, 2022)</u></a>, the majority of the countries in the Global South have high corruption, with the most corrupt countries being distributed across Africa and the Middle East.</p><p>This likely makes it harder to influence policy through the activities of this intervention, and gives me the impression these countries are also unlikely to prioritise protecting against environmental/ethical harms associated with animal agriculture over short-term growth, through the removal of subsidies.</p><p>However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://epi.yale.edu/\"><u>Yale\u2019s Environmental Protection Index</u></a> notes that many countries under/overperform compared to their GDP.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kas.de/en/web/auslandsinformationen/artikel/detail/-/content/umwelt-und-klimapolitik-in-afrika#:~:text=Opportunities%20to%20Improve%20National%20Policies,to%20implement%20the%20Paris%20Agreement\"><u>Berretta (2023)</u></a> from the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung \u200b\u200bpolitical foundation highlights examples of African countries taking steps to combat climate change. \u201cIn 2016, Kenya became the first country in Africa to adopt comprehensive framework legislation on climate change, with the aim of providing climate change adaptation measures, while promoting low-carbon development.\u201d Further, Uganda and Gabon have been noted for making strides.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.kas.de/en/web/auslandsinformationen/artikel/detail/-/content/umwelt-und-klimapolitik-in-afrika#:~:text=Opportunities%20to%20Improve%20National%20Policies,to%20implement%20the%20Paris%20Agreement\"><u>Berretta (2023)</u></a> also reports that \u201cIn 2021, the Central African Forest Initiative, transferred an initial tranche of a 150 million US dollars deal, after independent experts determined that Gabon could demonstrably reduce deforestation of its rainforest and halt land-use degradation. The money will be used to invest in sustainable forestry, research, and building more environmental databases.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>The Central African Forest Initiative works to reduce deforestation of the Central African Forest across 6 countries.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2023/05/deforestation-africa#:~:text=Direct%20causes%20include%20agriculture%2C%20infrastructure,for%20charcoal%2Dmaking%20and%20logging.\"><u>Cerutti et al. (2023)</u></a> reports that \u201cAgriculture is the largest direct cause of forest loss, accounting for approximately 75 percent of deforestation in Africa. This includes both subsistence farming and industrial agriculture \u2013 which includes cocoa and oil palm production \u2013 and cattle ranching\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, these examples demonstrate the existence of outlier countries within Africa, which have initiated programmes and initiatives to reduce environmental harms, even limiting deforestation for agriculture in the Central African Forest.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wfd.org/story/stronger-democratic-process-kenya-tackle-climate-change\"><u>(Westminster Foundation for Democracy, 2021)</u></a>, Kenya\u2019s legislation came from strong internal work from MPs, and a good democratic process. This compounds the evidence that good governance is key to implementation of policies that would improve environmental protection, and also shows that this is possible in our candidate countries.</p><p>Impact upon uncertainty</p><p>Overall, this updates my high uncertainty over whether governments in Sub Saharan African nations would adopt the proposed set of policies, weakly positively to moderately high uncertainty. Critically, although there is limited evidence of strong government policy in relevant areas such as environmental protection in SSA, some examples demonstrate that in the correct contexts, this may be possible.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.3.3. How likely is this initiative to gain popular support?</strong></h3><p>The following insights come from nationally representative surveys conducted by the non-profit Afrobarometer (AB), a \u201cpan-African, non-partisan survey research network that has been conducting public attitude surveys on democracy, governance, the economy, and society since 1999\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.afrobarometer.org/about/what-we-do/\"><u>Afrobarometer, nd-b</u></a>).</p><p>According to the Afrobarometer Climate Change Country Cards&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.afrobarometer.org/publications/?select-publication-subtype%5B%5D=climate-change-country-cards&amp;hidden-current-page=1\"><u>(Afrobarometer, nd-a)</u></a>: Of citizens in African countries who know about climate change, very large proportions want their governments to do more for the environment even at the expensive of economic growth.

Therefore when scaled by this, the proportion of the populations think the government should take action against climate change even if it is expensive range from 16% to 61%, with a mean of 38% and a standard deviation of 11 percentage points (see % thinking govt should take action despite expense tab in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1PV1cpYi9ymbyum8AWd7Me6J-YVtf2kErAIOljYiIMuc/edit\"><u>geographical weighted factor model</u></a>).</p><p>Further, their reports conclude that Kenyan citizens \u201cthink environmental protection should be prioritised even if that should be at the expense of job creation\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.afrobarometer.org/publication/ad678-kenyans-want-government-to-prioritise-environmental-protection-even-at-the-expense-of-job-creation/\"><u>Afrobarometer</u></a>),&nbsp; \u201calmost unanimously, [Tanzanian] citizens want more government action to limit pollution and protect the&nbsp; environment, even at the cost of jobs and incomes\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.afrobarometer.org/publication/ad676-tanzanians-want-greater-government-action-on-environmental-problems-even-if-its-expensive/\"><u>Afrobarometer</u></a>) and that \u201ca majority of [Liberia] citizens say the government should do \u201cmuch more\u201d to protect the environment, even at significant economic cost.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>This demonstrates that populations in African nations are likely to provide moderate to moderately strong support government action to protect the environment, such as limiting the detrimental impacts of expanding and intensifying animal agriculture, although this would not be expected to be extensive.</p><p>Impact upon uncertainty</p><p>This does not have a very weak positive update upon my overall uncertainty on this assumption, as evidence from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/democracy-index-eiu?tab=table\"><u>democratic indices</u></a>,<a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022\"><u> corruption indices</u></a> and my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kaal07q2eHqyWuTF6CEU4LgaWYAZknTtvDT_VRe_jj8/edit#heading=h.fbn1frmwrz0u\"><u>expert interviews</u></a> converge to suggest that many governments in Sub Saharan Africa do not place extremely high weight upon public opinion when making political decisions, limiting the extent of its influence.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.3.4.

However, accounts from expert interviews (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kaal07q2eHqyWuTF6CEU4LgaWYAZknTtvDT_VRe_jj8/edit#heading=h.r12hognnmrb\"><u>4.1</u></a>) suggest that in practice, building relationships with stakeholders and influencing their actions is extremely challenging within sub Saharan African nations. Ratings on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022\"><u>corruption perception indices</u></a> and evidence of failed policies such as the implementation of smart subsidies due to corruption at local governmental levels (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kaal07q2eHqyWuTF6CEU4LgaWYAZknTtvDT_VRe_jj8/edit#heading=h.r9p9qamap7j8\"><u>3.2</u></a>) imply that private interests are likely to hinder progress on policy change, particularly when seeking reforms that may hinder economic development or go against these private interests.&nbsp; Indeed, The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ifaw.org/uk/projects?program=policy&amp;region=all-regions\"><u>International Fund for Animal Welfare</u></a> which operates globally, including in Africa, does not operate any policy programmes in African nations, which may be due to tractability concerns, although this is speculative.</p><p>Accounts from expert interviews (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kaal07q2eHqyWuTF6CEU4LgaWYAZknTtvDT_VRe_jj8/edit#heading=h.r12hognnmrb\"><u>4.1</u></a>) also suggest that economic, cultural, public health framings of environmental or animal welfare problems may be very important for successful and effective political advocacy. It would be particularly important to demonstrate how this intervention is in the immediate public interest.&nbsp;</p><p>Impact upon uncertainty</p><p>Overall, this updates me slightly positively about the ability for a charity to influence policy in Africa, as encountering multiple examples of large organisations influencing policy and discovering that a number of organisations work on this already demonstrated that it is possible, although I was very uncertain about this at baseline. However, I remain uncertain about the ability for an organisation to make political progress on this specific issue, as historical policy changes with regards to subsidy allocation have come from economic necessity, and it appears making progress on environmental or animal welfare issues that do not necessarily directly benefit human health or economic development seems challenging.&nbsp;</p><h2>3.4 Would removing or reallocating agricultural subsidies be expected to slow down the rate of farming intensification?</h2><p>Evidence That Removing Agricultural Subsidies Hinders Intensification or Meat Consumption</p><p>The relationship between agricultural subsidies and farming intensification, as well as meat consumption, can be complex. A pivotal case study is the removal of agricultural subsidies in Slovakia during the early 1990s, particularly a tax on the sale of beef (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11oFWyyXyJxXQy7cwSdVTugn7e--FIeEn6yiDhBS5IIo/edit\"><u>Animal Ask</u></a>). This policy change led to a noticeable decrease in meat consumption, which persisted until the reintroduction of subsidies in 2015. This instance provides moderate evidence that removing subsidies can indeed impact meat consumption and possibly farming intensification, as it has been demonstrated in a real-world scenario.</p><p>Additionally,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12992-019-0479-5#citeas\"><u>Lam et al. (2019)</u></a> conducted a review including ten nations that highlights that fertilizer subsidies contribute to a rapid increase in national production. This correlation between fertilizer subsidies and increased agricultural production slightly reduces uncertainty regarding the link between subsidies and intensification. However, this finding is tempered by the possibility that other incentives or investments could similarly drive production, an essential element of intensification.</p><p>Evidence That Removing Agricultural Subsidies Would Not Hinder Intensification or Meat Consumption</p><p>In the context of the United States,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/can-we-knock-out-factory-farmings-supports/\"><u>Bollard (2017)</u></a> reported that that removing federal farm policies, including the Farm Bill introduced in 1933, might not significantly reduce meat supply or consumption. The Farm Bill indirectly subsidizes factory farms, with a significant portion of its budget supporting farm commodity and crop insurance programs. Indeed, 15.4 percent of the total, or $14.6 billion per year, is allocated to spending on farm commodity and crop insurance programs. However, a model by leading agricultural economist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/292943998_Distributional_Effects_of_Crop_Insurance_Subsidies\"><u>Lusk (2015)</u></a> suggests that removing these crop subsidies would only marginally increase animal protein costs at retail (0.1-1%). This finding casts doubt on the extent of US farmers' dependency on agricultural subsidies. However, it's important to note that this evidence is specific to the US, with its nearly completely intensified animal agriculture system. It does not necessarily reflect the situation in Sub-Saharan Africa, where farmers' dependency on subsidies for stable production and intensification might differ significantly.</p><p>Most rich nations have untethered farm subsidies from production levels in response to WTO rules, and New Zealand, which has eliminated virtually all agricultural subsidies, has not seen rising meat prices or declines in production (<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/why-is-meat-so-cheap/\"><u>Bollard, 2019</u></a>). New Zealand's elimination of government agricultural subsidies in 1984 did not lead to rising meat prices or declines in production in the long term (<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/viewpoint-farming-without-subsidies-a-better-way-why-new-zealand-agriculture-is-a-world-leader/\"><u>St Clair, 2002</u></a>). While initially causing economic hardship and lower farm prices, this policy change eventually led to stronger agricultural practices and production that aligned with market demand (<a href=\"https://www.dailysignal.com/2016/09/22/what-happened-when-new-zealand-got-rid-of-government-subsidies-for-farmers/\"><u>Siegel, 2016</u></a>). However, New Zealand's context as a small, isolated, developed yet agrarian nation with a pre-existing scaled-up farming system limits the applicability of this model to developing nations. The economic impacts of removing subsidies might have different consequences in regions with a higher risk of war, international threats, or less established agricultural sectors.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The evidence regarding the impact of removing agricultural subsidies on farming intensification and meat consumption is varied and heavily context-dependent. While some cases like Slovakia show a clear link between subsidy removal and decreased meat consumption, other examples from the US and New Zealand suggest that the impact might be less significant, particularly in developed or intensively farmed regions. In developing regions, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, the dependency on subsidies for production stability and intensification could be more critical, though this remains an area with significant uncertainty. The varying impacts observed across different countries and contexts indicate a need for tailored policy approaches that consider the unique agricultural, economic, and social dynamics at play.</p><p>Impact upon Uncertainty</p><p>Although some existing evidence has shown that removing subsidies may not influence demand for meat, this has been in developed countries which have already intensified, therefore this is not informative about whether removing subsidies from agriculture would stall intensification in a developing country that has not yet fully intensified. Fertiliser subsidies have been shown to drive production in LMICs, however there is insufficient evidence about the broader agricultural context to validate that the removal of subsidies would stop production increases and stop intensification. Therefore, this does not cause any directional update to uncertainty.&nbsp;</p><h2>3.5.

uncertainties following this evidence review, and conclude with moderately high to high uncertainty on the key questions and assumptions highlighted from the Theory of Change (see&nbsp;<a

understanding of the landscape of animal agriculture and the role of agricultural subsidies to validate the Theory of Change (see&nbsp;<a

Further, although there are some indications that policy advocacy in Africa may be more tractable than initially thought, it still appears very intractable, with a moderately high to high uncertainty, given limited evidence of previous successes in this cause area and context. Given that there is insufficient evidence to validate the selection of subsidies as a target of intervention, I highlight the need for more research on the drivers of intensification in countries in SSA, to more robustly identify a promising intervention.</p><h1>4 &nbsp; &nbsp; Expert views</h1><h2>4.1 Abby Couture and Elise Hankins, Bryant Research</h2><p>Abby Couture and Elise Hankins are researchers at Bryant Research, conducting a research project in collaboration with Animal Advocacy Africa seeking to understand the landscape of animal agriculture in Africa in order to identify and evaluate interventions.&nbsp;</p><p>Summary of conversation</p><p>Abby and Elise gave general estimates that 50%-80% of farms are smallholder farms within Africa; according to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/nigeria/fao-in-nigeria/nigeria-at-a-glance/en/\"><u>FAO (2023)</u></a> over 70% farmers in Nigeria are smallholders. However, they expressed that there is very sparse data on this subject, and that their view was more research needs to be done to determine this accurately.&nbsp;</p><p>Abby and Elise identified that government programmes are in place to assist young farmers to intensify in Nigeria, such as Task Force Rural Africa (<a href=\"https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/international/international-cooperation/africa/africa-europe-rural-transformation-action-agenda_en\"><u>European Commission, nd</u></a>), which seeks to strengthen agriculture in rural areas, setting out strategies and recommendations for Africa\u2019s rural areas to transform. They explained that these programs are often in partnership with trade alliances, such as the Growth Gateway between the UK and African nations, which promotes trade and investment opportunities including in agriculture. In particular, this involves shared research, technologies and investment opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>From their own conversations with experts and people working on the ground, Abby and Elise explained that policy change is very slow, especially in countries without stable governments and that even if the majority of people in a country want a particular change, governments aren\u2019t extremely responsive to public opinion. They suggested that interventions focusing on influencing NGOs/IGOs might be more tractable. Further, they explained that in order to make any progress on policy or political opinion in the majority of African nations, public health, ecological and economic framings must be used.</p><p>With regards to subsidies, they reported that the main subsidies for agriculture are focused on lowering the cost of inputs, namely fertiliser, and that a reasonable proportion of subsidies are provided in conjunction with a trade agreement with the EU or UK or private equity, in a form of foreign aid, rather than purely being of domestic origin. Notably, they identified that there is also an agricultural credit scheme by Nigerian Central Bank, which provides credit for farmers to upscale that helps to bear the cost of increased production. In this way, they noted that the government does not provide the majority of effective subsidies.</p><p>Main updates&nbsp;</p><ol><li>There is a dearth of evidence to understand the landscape of animal agriculture and the nature of intensification, and that research should be conducted to fill these knowledge gaps before interventions are implemented</li><li>Policy change in African countries is very slow and difficult to achieve</li><li>The government may not be the most significant player in funding or facilitating the intensification of animal agriculture</li></ol><p>Overall, this updated me fairly strongly in favour of the view that had been developed through the evidence review, that there is insufficient evidence about major uncertainties to recommend this intervention.</p><h2>4.2 Dr Rachel Mason, Independent Researcher</h2><p>Dr Rachel Mason is an independent researcher, funded by an Animal Charity Evaluators movement grant investigating the drivers of industrial food animal production in the US, evaluating interventions that have been proposed or pursued by the animal advocacy movement and uncovering the underlying ToCs.</p><p>Summary of conversation</p><p>Rachel explained her framing of industrial food animal production as a system in which the processing of inputs to outputs is done by animals themselves. This system is characterised by uniformity, high throughput, maximising growth and productivity and standardisation, with confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) at the centre of this industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Rachel identified the overarching driver of intensification as the need to make profits, and identified drivers as things which drive down the cost of inputs or increase the value of the outputs.&nbsp;</p><p>Input focused drivers include methods of reducing cost of key agricultural inputs like feed by:</p><ul><li>Increasing the feed conversion rate of animal</li><li>Increasing scale such that economies of scale lead to reduced costs</li><li>Provision of subsidies that reduce input costs&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Notably, this is all enabled in a culture which gives factory farming legitimacy and in which agribusiness has considerable power.</p><p>Rachel explained how subsidies have come to play a significant role in this industry in the US, particularly through the strength of the agricultural lobby and originally implemented as a solution to agricultural productivity. Since the 1930s the amount of food a country can produce in the US has dramatically increased, meaning agricultural policy has had to deal with supply outgrowing demand, which leads to lower crop prices. As a response, the government resorted to buying agricultural products to keep prices up.&nbsp;</p><p>As a profit driven system, major players seek regulations and provisions that favour their interests. To do this they needed to have power and influence, achieved through taking a considerable ownership of the market. In particular, companies decreased competition through horizontal integration and increased ownership of the industry through vertical integration. In this way, the power of farmers was reduced and the power of companies was increased, leading to increased lobbying power. Around the 1980s, a new policy was made, to allow farmers to produce as much as they can, let the prices fall and respond to this by subsidising farmers, resulting in cheap grains. This was significant in facilitating industrialisation.&nbsp;</p><p>Forms of subsidies in the US</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cato.org/blog/farm-bill-2023-crop-insurance-subsidies\"><u>Subsidised Crop insurance</u></a></p><p>These insure crops against damage (bad weather) and revenue falls. Revenue floors are established - you get a payment compensating for drops in prices beyond a certain level. Essentially, this means the public subsidies farmers to produce cheap grain</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/programs-initiatives/eqip-environmental-quality-incentives\"><u>Environmental Quality Incentives Program&nbsp;</u></a></p><p>These were originally provided to encourage sustainable practice and conservation behaviour e.g. to cover the cost of cover crops. Now 50% of this money has to go to livestock operations, which in the US is almost 100% industrialised. The money is now used to cover costs associated with the upkeep of CAFOs.</p><p>Publicly funded research</p><p>Industrial food animal production has required significant research, some of which has been publicly funded.</p><p>Weak and unenforced environmental regulations</p><p>This can be considered an indirect subsidy, which allows companies and farmers to spend less on complying with regulations.</p><p>However, it was emphasised that subsidies are very context specific, and so this should not be necessarily applied to African nations. From her own knowledge, Rachel identified that feed is expensive and difficult to come, especially in Africa and explained that in Brazil and China the governments have focused on companies and selected them to be national champions of meat production, so this may be something to be aware of happening in Africa.</p><p>Rachel suggested that there is minimal existing research that has been produced that provides the context specific information needed to design an effective intervention, and that it is known to be extremely challenging to gain access to industrial farming operations in Africa, having previously explored a research project to do this. Rachel explained that whilst in the US, animal agriculture appears to be binary, with operations being CAFOs or small holder non-intensive operations, in Africa, there is a much larger scale from subsistence to completely industrialised, and that it is incredibly difficult to identify the proportion of operations that fit at each point along this scale.&nbsp;</p><p>Rachel proposed that for any intervention, it would be important to present a positive vision for the food system that doesn\u2019t involve industrial animal agriculture, in particular highlighting the problems with contract farming and promoting alternative forms of agriculture including from plant-based sources.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Rachel suggested that an alternative intervention focused on producing research to address key uncertainties and fill knowledge gaps to map out the agricultural system in key nations in Africa might be more appropriate.&nbsp;</p><p>Organisations that Rachel recommended to contact for further research into animal agriculture in LMICs were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ilri.org/\"><u>International Livestock Research Institute</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ifpri.org/\"><u>International Food Policy Research Institute</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Main updates</p><ol><li>There is a dearth of evidence to understand the landscape of animal agriculture and the nature of intensification, and that research should be conducted to fill these knowledge gaps before interventions are implemented</li><li>Subsidies played an important role in intensification in the US, however their influence and provision is very context specific</li></ol><p>Overall, this updated me fairly strongly in favour of the view that had been developed through the evidence review, that there is insufficient evidence about major uncertainties to recommend this intervention. Further, it led me to consider the recommendation of specific research projects being conducted instead of the original intervention.</p><h1>5 &nbsp; &nbsp; Geographic assessment&nbsp;</h1><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PV1cpYi9ymbyum8AWd7Me6J-YVtf2kErAIOljYiIMuc/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>#RTP23A12 - GWFM&nbsp;</u></a></p><h2>5.1 Geographic assessment</h2><p>This geographic assessment was conducted by constructing a weighted factor model, to rank candidate countries within Sub Saharan Africa for their potential as countries of focus for this intervention.&nbsp;</p><p>The following table provides an overview of the categories and criterion selected, as well as their weights.

Therefore, I selected Nigeria as the country of focus for this intervention.</p><h1>6 &nbsp; &nbsp; Decision</h1><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6we6erMcg4wDgvrkc/rjpgazo4k619d4l3w7mq\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6we6erMcg4wDgvrkc/r7c3cgoh4afedonsaesw 132w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6we6erMcg4wDgvrkc/nudlkwd3fr0nvdajgsfy 212w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6we6erMcg4wDgvrkc/fazqz9bruqxcawwpy9ea 292w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6we6erMcg4wDgvrkc/bbz9hctiio14t7pgyoqi 372w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6we6erMcg4wDgvrkc/pfzjhwkvuub21obvwsnv 452w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6we6erMcg4wDgvrkc/remkbwjxlmvm3l1mhwgz 532w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6we6erMcg4wDgvrkc/exwrpsu3my1gbely8rzu 612w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6we6erMcg4wDgvrkc/e1ox909mpfibkkmfcuux 692w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6we6erMcg4wDgvrkc/zp5m7bwxe95vtyk5ncoj 772w\"></figure><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Question</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Answer</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Explanation</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Is there a crucial consideration in the ToC why this should not be implemented?</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Weak Yes</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.cnb5nwrfzhru\"><u>Theory of Change</u></a></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Is there sufficient evidence?</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Strong No</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.1k79pn8axaqc\"><u>Evidence Review</u></a></p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>&nbsp;Conclusion from decision chart: Don\u2019t recommend</p><h1>7 Conclusion</h1><p>Overall, I&nbsp;<strong>do not recommend this intervention</strong> to be implemented by a new charity incubated by CE. This is because there are significant knowledge gaps which make it uncertain that using policy advocacy to influence government subsidy allocation would be an effective way to slow down the intensification of agricultural intensification. Further, there are significant tractability concerns about whether lobbying would have a high enough probability of significantly influencing policymakers to pursue such a change.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I&nbsp;<strong>strongly recommend&nbsp;</strong>that research into key uncertainties should be funded, to provide foundational knowledge that can be used to design an effective intervention.

It's less strictly organized and more narrative-y than something I'd have written specifically for the EA Forum. It's also the result of a shallow investigation, and not on a topic that I'm anywhere close to an expert on. Nonetheless I think it contains a few vague ideas which those of you who are interested in metascience and/or longtermism might find interesting. I think it's especially relevant to conversations about stagnation.</p><p>The first two sections after the intro (\"What is Scientific Progress?\" and \"Three hypotheses about science friction\") can be skipped by people who know the first few things about this topic.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Science seems to be getting harder. The evidence supporting this claim has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/11/23549993/science-research-progress-studies-disruption-technology-artificial-intelligence-biotechnology\">been</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/1/11/23549993/science-research-progress-studies-disruption-technology-artificial-intelligence-biotechnology\">summarized</a> <a href=\"https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/17ygmn8w/release/12\">elsewhere</a>, so for the sake of argument this post takes it for granted. On average, every unit of \u201cscientific progress\u201d costs more researcher-hours than the one before it. The marginal cost of scientific progress is increasing. Call it science friction.</p><p>One explanation of this phenomenon posits a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/jones-ben/htm/BurdenOfKnowledge.pdf\">burden of knowledge</a>\u201d which causes educational costs to grow as science advances. Recently, I read two thought-provoking <a href=\"https://maximumprogress.substack.com/p/something-is-getting-harder-but-its\">blog</a> <a href=\"https://maximumprogress.substack.com/p/against-the-burden-of-knowledge\">posts</a> by Maxwell Tabarrok which took issue with this explanation. I began drafting comments containing a bit of pushback on some of the arguments Tabarrok raised, but the subject came to feel worthy of a full-length post. In particular, I\u2019d like to disentangle the intuition behind the burden of knowledge, offer a few key conceptual obstacles to proposed solutions, and argue that the magnitude of the problem depends on what you think the purpose of science is.</p><p>But first, 150 seconds of context.</p><h1>What is Scientific Progress?</h1><p>Scientific progress is a slippery concept, so I\u2019m not going to offer a definition. To ground the conversation, however, here are two general ways it gets operationalized in metascience research:</p><ol><li>To an economist, scientific progress is anything that allows our economy to do more with the same quantity of resources. \u201cResources\u201d are all the tangible inputs to economic growth: labor, land, materials, tools, and the rest. Scientific progress is then anything which increases <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_factor_productivity\">total factor productivity</a> (TFP), the intangible component of economic growth models. In the coarsest possible terms, GDP = F(TFP, (labor input), (capital input)), an an increase in TFP counts as scientific progress. The famous <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23782/w23782.pdf\">2020 paper \u201cAre Ideas Getting Harder to Find?\u201d</a> compares TFP growth to scientific inputs:<a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F795e2eab-7c8f-482f-814d-8955a7bf1da8_926x568.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/e6bmphkpb4leq6lvrmc4\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/gkpdvossysqimnzlqm0g 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/f3sfwjrpkmjqsvgbomcw 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/ycytchkbvzird2rcrjlu 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/e6bmphkpb4leq6lvrmc4 1456w\"></a>The upshot? Yup, ideas are getting harder to find.</li><li>We can also try to measure scientific progress by looking at data internal to science: scientific publications themselves, for instance, and the way that they cite each other. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05543-x\">The 2023 article \u201cPapers and patents are becoming less disruptive over time,</a>\u201d published in Nature, introduces a metric of the impact that papers and patents have on networks of citation, with the result that \u201cpapers and patents are increasingly less likely to break with the past in ways that push science and technology in new directions.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/17ygmn8w/release/12\">This blog post</a> from metascience researcher Matt Clancy presents a grab-bag of such science-internal metrics, all of which show increasing scientific friction (my <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3347326\">favorite</a> <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S175115771530081X\">methods</a> use linguistic cues from article titles and author-supplied keywords).<a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99e64fa5-0338-4f99-be29-7602cf311e41_1048x1100.png\"><img style=\"width:54.9%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/lurgphrkxnyptns102f3\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/prbarlu5fqn1q2mva0mn 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/uqi20fn2p1fa29ospdu6 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/dhjztfwffj2a5ux2mwdh 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/lurgphrkxnyptns102f3 1456w\"></a></li></ol><h1>Three hypotheses about science friction</h1><p>The proposed explanations of science friction seem to fall into three main categories.</p><ol><li><strong>Institutional explanations: </strong>something is wrong with the way science is conducted.

Disciplinary silos <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18315\">discourage interdisciplinary work</a>. <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1745691616687745\">Questionable research practices (read: fraud) are incentivized, replication is discouraged, and the intellectual environment stifles creativity.</a> Pressure to publish discourages long, risky, high-payoff projects. Researchers are <a href=\"https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2015/03/25/age-of-investigator/\">just getting too old</a>. As <a href=\"https://maximumprogress.substack.com/p/against-the-burden-of-knowledge\">one</a> of the blog posts I mentioned in the introduction points out, \u201cRisk averse funders and reviewers\u2026 reward incremental, labor intensive research. A business model based on exclusivity that requires more and more hurdles as the initial pool of applicants grows.\u201d I\u2019ll add that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_homogenization\">cultural homogenization</a> in and out of science could reduce the number of independent chances that humanity has to innovate. There are a lot of ways scientific institutions seem sub-optimal.</li><li><strong>The low-hanging fruit has already been plucked:</strong> I won\u2019t spend a lot of time on this explanation, but it\u2019s popular and intuitively appealing, if rather hard to pick apart. We\u2019ve already discovered the easiest stuff to discover, so we should expect finding out new, important things to be increasingly difficult.</li><li><strong>The burden of knowledge:</strong> this idea is related to, but distinct from, #2. Basically: the more we learn about science, the more effort it takes to get aspiring researchers up to speed, leaving fewer resources available to push the boundaries of knowledge forward. This could manifest in an older average age of discovery, more expensive or time-consuming education, or (as in <a href=\"https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/jones-ben/htm/BurdenOfKnowledge.pdf\">the paper</a> which popularized the burden of knowledge idea) increasing specialization and larger teams. In some sense, future ideas may be no more intrinsically \u201ccomplicated\u201d or \u201cchallenging\u201d than past ones, once you\u2019ve got the prerequisite knowledge. Let\u2019s say many of them are just a matter of putting a few previous ideas together in a process of <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/sites/scholar.harvard.edu/files/weitzman/files/recombinant_growth.pdf\">combinatorial innovation</a>. But even if that were the case, understanding previous research to the point where one is capable of recombining it into something new might take longer and longer.</li></ol><h1>Knowledge doesn\u2019t grow monotonically, but it is cumulative</h1><p>Tabarrok compares studying science friction to studying a car:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c[<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w23782/w23782.pdf\">Jones et al</a>] explain [science friction] by positing some inherent drag on idea exploration that gets more burdensome as we learn more. Something like inertia which makes it harder to double the speed of a car that\u2019s already going fast than a car that starts slower.</p><p>But without knowing the underlying kinetics of science and economic growth, this inertia model is just a guess. There are lots of other explanations which are consistent with the observation of diverging fuel use and acceleration. Our car could be going up a hill, or over a rough and rocky road. Or our engine could be depreciating or using the extra fuel inefficiently. Similarly, the ideas we produce might face growing barriers before they can materialize as physical products and buildings which affect productivity. Or our institutions of science are squandering the extra resources they receive with inefficient institutional designs.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>This is a good analogy. It\u2019s true that we really don\u2019t have a good handle on the \u201cunderlying kinetics\u201d of scientific progress. But it\u2019s not the case that we don\u2019t know <i>anything</i> about them. I\u2019d like to argue that one important feature of science\u2014which Tabarrok seems to deny and which is the key intuition behind the burden of knowledge idea\u2014is that it is an essentially cumulative enterprise. Science seeks to accumulate good explanations of phenomena which we observe in the world, up to some criteria of \u201cgoodness\u201d involving things like explanatory accuracy, predictive power, and model parsimony. Science is about <i>building</i> <i>knowledge</i>, and is therefore cumulative almost by definition.</p><p>Tabarrok acknowledges this: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a model of scientific progress without accumulating knowledge.\u201d But later, under the header \u201cKnowledge is Often Not Cumulative,\u201d Tabarrok offers an example which seems to contradict this property. By putting the sun (rather than the earth) at the center of our astronomical neighborhood, Copernicus dramatically simplified orbital mechanics, thereby apparently making knowledge simpler, more elegant, and altogether rather smaller. Many scientific advances look something like this, where new models seem to distill those that they are replacing in a simpler, more unified way.</p><p>These instances do reduce the amount of breath we need to expend to explain all of the details of our scientific models. But it is explanatory power, not model complexity, that we\u2019re trying to accumulate; individual models are merely a means to that end. After Copernicus, science still explained just as much of the world as before, and it did so more accurately. Scientific knowledge did continue to accumulate, it just did so along a dimension orthogonal to the complexity of that particular model. Ultimately, the goal is to explain ever more of our universe\u2019s workings ever better. \u201cMore\u201d and \u201cbetter\u201d are the operative words there. That being the case, it seems very hard to envisage an underlying scientific dynamic in which the overall trend is not for knowledge to get gradually larger over time.</p><p>It\u2019s a bit like we\u2019re trying to fill a computer hard drive with simulations which can be used to approximate all of the empirical phenomena that we\u2019re interested in. Given some practical setting, then, we can load the relevant program and answer questions about it. The scientific endeavor gradually loads more files on our hard drive, while breakthroughs like Copernicus\u2019 occasionally come along and compress these files in a more efficient way. The bottom line, though, is that if we want to explain more stuff, we will eventually need more storage space for all of our explanations.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbc8bfc76-9a51-47d3-a455-de1173aacb82_1024x1024.png\"><img style=\"width:62.25%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/jq2bwclr76t2udw3zbdz\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/ofa2vatag9cn3jptnbca 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/ee65nhs1jm2hzbtrk2uw 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/mlmlsbdfujztiju1gsh7 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/jq2bwclr76t2udw3zbdz 1456w\"></a></p><p>(Image creds to DALL-E 2)</p><p>Note that this account relies on \u201cexplanatory power\u201d being at least somewhat dependent on computational complexity. This claim, in turn, relies on the assumption that the objects of scientific study contain a certain level of intrinsic complexity, or <a href=\"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComputationalIrreducibility.html\">computational irreducibility</a>. One might hope that a few very parsimonious descriptions might do the trick: that we might be able to load just one or two programs on our hard drive and use them to explain everything we care about. In a very specific way, this might be right. It\u2019s kind of what physics is trying to do by reducing all of nature to just a few fundamental components. In a rather truer way, however, there appears to be a certain amount of computational irreducibility inherent in many of the phenomena we care about. Even if all processes are fundamentally physical, in practice we need to break them into groups and delegate them to sciences other than physics.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F609cfe52-ca58-477c-9968-256942546f6e_1496x1202.png\"><img style=\"width:59.55%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/mefcsfnbi2febkr46bkr\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/mffh0gzzm2wbooovipml 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/nvnvlvxutotqumjwkpyu 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/ocpkj4qsuttaoorr70oo 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/mefcsfnbi2febkr46bkr 1456w\"></a></p><p>(Stephen Wolfram has <a href=\"https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/\">noted</a> that some very simple <a href=\"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CellularAutomaton.html\">cellular automata</a> display computational irreducibility: their evolution cannot be precisely predicted in a faster way than by running each step of their computation.)</p><p>But if explaining more ultimately means carrying a heavier burden of pre-existing knowledge, then absent countervailing forces, more and more of our scientific resources will have to go towards education. Pessimistically, this view seems to entail that asymptotically <i>all</i> of scientists\u2019 efforts will be eventually be taken up by knowledge maintenance\u2014educating the next generation of scientists\u2014rather than by knowledge creation. Is there a way out of this?</p><h1>Shouldering the Burden of Knowledge: Long-Run Cruxes</h1><p>So the more phenomena we describe and explain with science, the more storage space our existing scientific knowledge will require. \u201cStorage space\u201d means room in the brains of human scientists, and the process of maintaining that stored knowledge involves repeatedly educating successive generations of scholars. This dynamic puts an intrinsic cap on the amount of knowledge which the scientific apparatus can maintain, and the closer we are to that cap, the less efficiently science will create new knowledge. The observation that science is getting harder can thus be at least partly explained by the burden of knowledge. The subjective experience that the frontiers of scientific inquiry seem so very far away to most people lends this explanation a rather visceral appeal.</p><p>But there are a few ways we can imagine lightening the load\u2014that is, decreasing the portion of our scientific resources going towards knowledge maintenance. Perhaps we could lower the volume of knowledge by compressing it into more parsimonious theories. Surely knowledge handoff could be made more efficient: why do math and physics need to be taught in order of historical discovery? Could students specialize at a younger age? Maybe the structure and content of curricula could be refined to put more people at the frontiers of inquiry faster. Anyways, <a href=\"https://maximumprogress.substack.com/p/fertility-as-metascience\">adding more scientists</a> seems like it will always be a reliable way to increase our scientific capacity. And as Tabarrok <a href=\"https://open.substack.com/pub/maximumprogress/p/against-the-burden-of-knowledge?r=97xe5&amp;selection=8e0fd63d-8489-49ef-aeb1-c8a50a2bbe2d&amp;utm_campaign=post-share-selection&amp;utm_medium=web\">points out</a>, the burden of knowledge can often be offloaded to tools used as black boxes.</p><p>I\u2019d like to raise two interrelated, very abstract subsidiary questions to how inevitable the burden of knowledge will turn out to be. They feel like cruxes in the sense that their resolution would say a lot about the viability of the proposals above, and about the direction of science in general.</p><ol><li>Can we keep breaking knowledge into (proportionally, if not absolutely) smaller and smaller chunks? To what extent is scientific knowledge <strong>modularizable</strong>?</li><li>To what extent does scientific knowledge that has been put in cold storage\u2014written in text, built into tools whose function nobody understands, internalized by AI\u2014retain its use for future innovation? To what extent is scientific knowledge <strong>shelf-stable</strong>?</li></ol><p>But even if affirmative answers to the questions above let us overcome the logistical constraints imposed by the burden of knowledge, we might start bumping into limits similar to the low-hanging fruit problem that I mentioned in an earlier section. Modularization, compartmentalization, and tooling might let us overcome the finite cognitive bandwidth of individuals. But there are other reasons it could get harder to expand an explanatory base which only gets wider.</p><p>If knowledge were infinitely modularizable, one could imagine continuing scientific progress indefinitely by piling on ever-more-specialized scientists. But if breaking new ground requires combining old ideas from diverse fields, the difficulty of innovation\u2014or at least groundbreaking innovation\u2014may grow with the degree of specialization. See <a href=\"https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/8f77puuw/release/13\">this essay</a> for some interesting discussion relevant to this point; there are a number of different ways one can take the observation (or assumption) that innovation is at least partly a combinatorial process. On the other hand, it\u2019s possible that there are some systems which contain indivisible networks of interaction so complex that that their study cannot be fruitfully broken down into chunks small enough for any human scientist.</p><p>Delegating knowledge to tools might let us circumvent even limits of population and system complexity. To a great extent we already rely on doing this, of course, via written resources, search engines, and tools. But the more we rely on knowledge hosted outside of human brains, the less accessible it might be as a resource for future innovation. One can use a tool that they don\u2019t understand. But it\u2019s hard to improve a conceptual structure which you find largely inscrutable.</p><p>At this point, the conversation becomes rather too vague and speculative to feel particularly useful. Matt Clancy <a href=\"https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/8f77puuw#nr673mrxnsz\">puts it well</a>: \u201cBy definition, innovation is the creation of things that are presently unknown. How can we say anything useful about a future trajectory that will depend on things we do not presently know about? In fact, I think we can say very little about the long-run outlook of technological change, and even less about the exact form such change might take.\u201d To some degree, we have no choice but to forge ahead and see what happens. But even if we ignore the practical issues, the burden of knowledge raises certain axiological questions. Does it still count as knowledge if it is distributed in tiny chunks across the brains of billions of people, or stored in boxes for nobody to see? Why do we value science in the first place?</p><h1>Science versus Technology: is Knowledge Intrinsically Valuable?</h1><p>The two analogies described earlier\u2014accelerating a car versus accumulating simulations on a hard drive\u2014correspond to two different ways of motivating the scientific project. On the one hand, science can be viewed as a means of producing technologies which enhance our capacities. This endeavor is well represented by the car analogy: trying to get the car to go faster corresponds to getting our society to serve our wants and needs better. If that means throwing out superfluous parts or turning components into inscrutable black boxes, so be it. It\u2019s not about understanding the universe, it\u2019s about controlling the phenomena which affect our quality of life. And in many ways, this is a useful way to look at science. It is certainly the perspective favored by economists. Science has made the twenty-first century <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/health-meta\">healthier</a> and <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/a-history-of-global-living-conditions\">more prosperous</a> than any which came before it, and that\u2019s a good thing.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b681d39-8639-4076-97a7-a60eaa814d1e_1668x852.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/llpx3dfnnqyiwzfslevj\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/lguapbqnkt8nnclg9miq 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/qj0iwskwhu1sdisvt4oe 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/vy1wpbw8xghtw5few5hs 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4ydEMHyiidvJfqb2u/llpx3dfnnqyiwzfslevj 1456w\"></a></p><p>(From \u201c<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/a-history-of-global-living-conditions\">The short history of global living conditions and why it matters that we know it</a>,\u201d Our World in Data, December 2016)</p><p>But science, one might contend, is also concerned with a kind of understanding above and beyond mere instrumental supremacy. Explicit knowledge about the nature of reality could be seen as intrinsically valuable. Doesn\u2019t knowing something about the structure of reality make life richer in some way? If it\u2019s all about technological progress, why do we spend billions studying the origins of the universe and taking photographs of distant galaxies?</p><p>Of these two ways of looking at science\u2014as oriented to technological progress versus explicitly understanding the universe and our place in it\u2014the second pursuit appears to be more deeply afflicted by the burden of knowledge, since modularization and idea storage seem to cut against its very purpose. It forces us to choose which things are worth knowing about. But the first pursuit also requires us to prioritize for strategic reasons: which areas of study produce the most instrumentally useful knowledge?</p><p>The upshot of all this is that scientific <i>prioritization</i> grows more important every year, on both individual and collective levels. The burden of knowledge draws attention to the questions: in a world with limited cognitive resources, how do we choose what to study? What do we care about understanding, and why?</p><h1>In Favor of Practical Problem-Solving: Why the Institutional View is Still the Best One</h1><p>Recall the three explanations for science friction which I laid out in an earlier section. The purpose of this piece has been to argue that the problem of the burden of knowledge cannot be so easily dismissed. I don\u2019t think the low-hanging fruit problem can be either. It\u2019s most likely that the scientific friction we observe results from a combination of all of the suggested causes: institutional inefficiency, the burden of knowledge, and the low-hanging fruit problem. But one of these possible explanations is not like the others: institutional problems are not caused by the nature of knowledge itself. It is implied, and seems perfectly likely, that there are alternative institutional structures which would do the job better, and which we might be able to attain in real life. Therefore, having just said everything I said, I do think it is these institutional interventions that are the most worthy of study. With any luck, we\u2019ll be able to keep our science cranking along for a long time to come just by improving the way we conduct it.</p>", "user": {"username": "Toby Weed"}}, {"_id": "LgfsKfRgodatoAcZk", "title": "How did you find a remote engineering job?", "postedAt": "2024-02-01T14:11:35.607Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm an electrical engineer.

Whilst training organisations to use existing AI tools for internal use cases has many short-term benefits (such as improving the efficiency of organisations) customised AI specifically designed for animal advocacy will have the greatest medium to long term impact.</p><p><strong>How can a smaller nonprofit like Open Paws keep up with giants like OpenAI in AI development?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Focusing on specific areas like animal advocacy allows for the development of powerful AI models with smaller budgets and datasets, offering tailored solutions without needing vast resources. Currently and historically, specialised AI systems have tended to outperform their generic counterparts in specific tasks. However, our approach doesn't rely solely on creating superior AI tools for animal advocacy. We will also focus on influencing the development of AI more broadly and training non-technical animal advocates on how to use AI, both of which have enormous potential for impact, regardless of whether specialised or generic systems perform best in the future.</p><p><strong>Why would animal advocates have any more success in lobbying AI labs than any other group?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Animal advocacy groups have several advantages in advocating for change in AI, like common connections within the Effective Altruism movement and AI industry. Focusing on reducing speciesism and harmfulness in AI models also aligns with standard AI safety and ethics concerns, especially as speciesist biases might also be risky for humans if AI applies the same logic towards us.</p><p><strong>Can't we just use better prompts to get less speciesist responses from AI?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>While prompt engineering can mitigate biases for internal use, the challenge intensifies in external or automated environments like public-facing chatbots or automated responses. Most users, including many animal advocates, lack experience in prompt engineering. An open-source, animal-aligned AI is the only way to systematically address these biases at their source, whilst prompt engineering is akin to placing a bandaid over a much deeper wound.</p><h1><strong>Further Information</strong></h1><p><strong>Further details can be found in our </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCRAMYO4XS8\"><strong>Pitch Video</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://hubs.ly/Q02hYD600\"><strong>Funding Proposal</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>", "user": {"username": "Sam Tucker"}}, {"_id": "XmRHbGx8gYmczpsmL", "title": "How would you approach an introduction to Effective Altruism in 1 hour in a class of second-year Philosophy students?

We are now one year later, and though it was a year of significant progress in many ways, that earlier analysis now seems premature.</p><p>We began 2023 with <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14XXpe46sWomG29KPwEQ_FPQYpi6YCLglcfjthHwhl08/edit#gid=362861603\"><u>ambitious scaling goals</u></a>&nbsp;to add 150 farmers to our <a href=\"http://fwi.fish/farmers\"><u>farmer program</u></a>, and to help an additional 1 million fishes. Unfortunately, largely due to increasingly-apparent limitations in our interventions, we fell short of these goals. These limitations also inspired two <a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/feb-strategy-changes\"><u>strategic</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-2023\"><u>changes</u></a>&nbsp;over the course of the year, which, while needed, created instability that at times was challenging for our team. All of these things made 2023 feel like a challenging year for our programming, and for our organization more broadly.</p><p>However, with our <a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-2023\"><u>last strategic change</u></a>, and with the improved capacity that came with it, we feel much better positioned to reach our ambition of being an evidence-based, extremely impactful and cost-effective organization. 2024 is thus beginning on a note of optimism for our team, with various causes for excitement: Our revamped research department and <a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/rnd-plans-2024\"><u>research plans</u></a>; the issues we\u2019ve identified (<a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/densities\"><u>e.g.</u></a>) and improvements <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rVxWTw8JdBoJ0rRtTubQq0CDcphvZJTcZYQMXpl1WMw/edit\"><u>we made</u></a>&nbsp;and are making in the farmer program; and the strategic realignment of certain roles to better capitalize on our staffs' core competencies.</p><p>With all of this, <strong>we believe 2023 is best characterized as a year of unintentional setup for FWI</strong>. We didn\u2019t achieve most of the outcomes we intended, but we did build a number of foundations to enable us to achieve these outcomes more rigorously and sustainably this year and beyond. We also still did reach a number of important outcomes themselves, including scaling our farmer program to <a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/100-farms\"><u>over 100 farms</u></a>, finishing construction on experimental ponds to be used in future research with our local university partnership, and improving the lives of an <a href=\"http://fwi.fish/impact\"><u>estimated</u></a>&nbsp;450,000 fishes.</p><p>There\u2019s no doubt that 2024 will be a critical year for our organization. This is the year where we\u2019ll see if our bet on increasing rigor and resources going into R&amp;D will pay off with more impactful and scalable interventions.</p><p>Thank you, as always, for your continued interest and support.

On some level, we believe that all of our work boils down to this number.</p><h3><strong>2 - A new and better equipped R&amp;D Department.</strong></h3><p>Though it\u2019s a trend we have been following for a while, this year in particular we became aware that our current research process was not sufficient to enable us to reach the scale or cost effectiveness we have envisioned. For this reason, we <a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-2023\"><u>revamped</u></a>&nbsp;our process by hiring a new research lead (Dr. Paul Monaghan) and tasking him with setting a <a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/rnd-plans-2024\"><u>new research agenda</u></a>. We also finished construction of experimental ponds at a local university (<a href=\"https://aknu.edu.in/\"><u>AKNU</u></a>), which will enable us to test different practices in farm-like conditions, in a much more controlled environment than before, while also ensuring that no fishes are killed in the process.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:368px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qACXnSkfmPjwo2eKP/kkwd68jonmx1c74b9jay\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>FWI\u2019s recently constructed experimental ponds at Adikavi Nannaya University in Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh, India.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>3 - A larger and more efficient farmer program.</strong></h3><p>The Alliance for Responsible Aquaculture (<a href=\"http://fwi.fish/farmers\"><u>ARA</u></a>) now has <a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/100-farms\"><u>105</u></a>&nbsp;active farms, 16 more farms than at the end of the previous year. It also is running more efficiently than ever before, having made a number of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rVxWTw8JdBoJ0rRtTubQq0CDcphvZJTcZYQMXpl1WMw/edit#heading=h.t5b6araj73hb\"><u>programmatic improvements</u></a>. This program continues to be the core of our work, and our primary avenue for having an impact.</p><h3><strong>4 - Regulatory recommendations.</strong></h3><p>Last year, we submitted three regulatory recommendations to the various Indian government entities: the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/10rxFG1zDmoJUiST1jsvyBjZq6jWUkW3j/view\"><u>Central Pollution Control Board</u></a>, the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ybirN4RttbqaiWhufiFHXPhPf7UViMAA\"><u>Animal Welfare Board of India</u></a>, and the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tFvlkBhAs2_SDs-B73rSVOpBZLXd4oKA\"><u>Department of Fisheries</u></a>. While it is currently unclear what outcomes will result from our submissions, we do expect that they sensitize policymakers to fish welfare and the challenges with fish farming, and we hope they build FWI\u2019s recognition as experts in the domain.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>5 - Continued progress in China.</strong></h3><p>We conducted another in-country field visit, contributed to the <a href=\"https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/bMLR0jt-gwmrhWFPxj5kdw\"><u>Beijing Consensus conference</u></a>&nbsp;to promote fish welfare, and identified <a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/priority-species\"><u>priority species</u></a>&nbsp;for whom to begin setting standards with our local Chinese partners (<a href=\"http://www.iccaw.org.cn/\"><u>ICCAW</u></a>).

Unfortunately, we estimate that we only achieved about a third of that. We largely didn\u2019t hit this goal because a) we deliberately slowed our scaling due to <a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-2023\"><u>problems</u></a>&nbsp;we identified in our programming; and b) we <a href=\"https://us3.campaign-archive.com/?u=2afeee16b30494a373a377a31&amp;id=e90d7a032a\"><u>believe</u></a>&nbsp;we were stricter at estimating fish helped in 2023 than in years prior.</p><p>We are working to address this issue both by considering more novel models in our farmer program, as well as by researching new interventions entirely with our R&amp;D Department.</p><h3><strong>2 - We continued to face serious challenges in identifying promising welfare interventions.</strong></h3><p>Running on-the-ground tests on fish farms has been a challenge ever since <a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/why-we-re-ending-our-pilot-study-early\"><u>we first began them</u></a>&nbsp;in India, and 2023 unfortunately continued that trend. In particular, last year we failed to achieve <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14XXpe46sWomG29KPwEQ_FPQYpi6YCLglcfjthHwhl08/edit#gid=445153855\"><u>our goal</u></a>&nbsp;of validating our <a href=\"https://fwi.fish/post/announcing-v2\"><u>Version 2 Standard</u></a>\u2014largely due to poor project management and study design on the ground, compounded by the challenging conditions of rural Indian aquaculture. These challenges have also meant that we are still more uncertain than we would like to be about the magnitude of the <a href=\"http://fwi.fish/commitment\"><u>improvements</u></a>&nbsp;we are currently making with the ARA.</p><p>We have worked to address this issue by creating <a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/rnd-plans-2024\"><u>a new R&amp;D Department</u></a>&nbsp;with new leadership and new plans, as discussed above.</p><h3><strong>3 - Organizational instability, largely due to frequent pivots.</strong></h3><p>FWI made two pivots in 2023: <a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/feb-strategy-changes\"><u>One</u></a>&nbsp;in Q1 to focus more on farmer-centric (and less on corporate and policy) work, and <a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/strategy-2023\"><u>the other</u></a>&nbsp;in Q4 to expand our research mandate. Both had programmatic and departmental restructuring implications, which led to significant stress and uncertainty at different points for some members of our team.</p><p>We believe we have addressed this issue, largely by investing in more likely-to-last programmatic and departmental structures now. Additionally, we believe that we have improved on our internal communications and processes for making org-wide changes, although there is still further room for progress.</p><h3><strong>4 - Internal culture and retention challenges.</strong></h3><p>In large part due to the programmatic challenges and instability discussed above, staff culture (as reported in surveys and word of mouth) as well as retention was a greater challenge in 2023.</p><p>We are now thinking much more actively about culture than previously (partially thanks to support from Sharpen Strategy), and have designated an active lead on culture (Tom, our co-founder). Culture was one aspect of the organization we didn\u2019t deliberately attend to much when we were just a few staff members, but at 21 FTE (full-time equivalent) it seems more likely that creating a culture consistent with our values requires active attention.</p><h1>Operational Notes</h1><p>The following may be of interest for those interested in the more technical aspects of FWI\u2019s operations.

Most of these staff members are from India, while Paul is from Ireland and Althy from the Philippines.</p><p><strong>Fundraising</strong>: The vast majority of our 2023 budget came from donors in the effective altruism and animal advocacy spaces, with about 90% coming from gifts of $10,000 or more. This included the second half of our <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/fish-welfare-initiative-fish-welfare-in-india/\"><u>$250,000 two-year grant</u></a>&nbsp;from Open Philanthropy. We were also honored to have about 50 monthly donors throughout the year.</p><p><strong>Turnover</strong>: We had higher turnover last year than usual, roughly 30% (which, for a 20-25 person organization, was significant). Turnover was both involuntary and voluntary, and was in part caused by the challenges we discussed above. The voluntary turnover in particular updated us to think that we need to be more deliberate about culture, employee relations, and internal communications. We\u2019re now investing more in management courses and external consulting (though also mindful to avoid overly bureaucratizing).</p><p><strong>Hiring</strong>: Hiring continued to be our biggest operational bottleneck. For instance, there were several roles for which we spent significant resources hiring for but proved unable to identify any sufficiently well-fitting candidates (<a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/pdrm\"><u>e.g.</u></a>). It also often proved challenging to hire ground team members in rural India who met our skill qualifications.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:61.3%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qACXnSkfmPjwo2eKP/awvkcf8cyxvytwhyiojm\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Carps being \u201charvested\u201d at one of our partner farms. The process of being dragged out of the water and left to asphyxiate on the ground is probably the worst suffering these animals will experience, and yet, given the infrastructural and technological barriers in implementing stunning, this is a welfare issue we haven\u2019t (yet) figured out how to solve.</figcaption></figure><h1>A Note of Conclusion and Gratitude</h1><p>This has been the fourth full year of operations at FWI, and our third full year operating with fish farms in India, an environment still largely unexplored by the animal advocacy movement. There have been many ups and downs along the way, and we\u2019ve learned a lot about what it means to make changes for fishes in decentralized farming systems (the reality for the majority of farmed fishes in our world). There are problems we have better figured out how to solve (e.g. water quality) and still problems that we are far from solving (e.g. slaughter via asphyxiation).</p><p>It is our hope that the foundations we laid in 2023, and the foundations we will continue laying in 2024, will bring us as well as our animal advocacy movement<strong> closer to fully addressing these welfare issues, and closer to a world that is truly humane for all.</strong></p><p>We also wanted to thank everyone who enabled us to make the progress and the impacts we have made. In particular, that includes our donors, our advisors, and our friends and family who enable us to work for this cause.

Status-seeking is a powerful motivation for almost all humans, including altruists, and we frequently award social status to people for merely trying to do good, before seeing all of the consequences of their actions. This is in some sense inevitable as there are no good alternatives. We often need to award people with social status before all of the consequences play out, both to motivate them to continue to try to do good, and to provide them with influence/power to help them accomplish their goals.</p><p>A person who consciously or subconsciously cares a lot about social status will not optimize strictly for doing good, but also for appearing to do good. One way these two motivations diverge is in how to manage risks, especially risks of causing highly negative consequences. Someone who wants to appear to do good would be motivated to hide or downplay such risks, from others and perhaps from themselves, as fully acknowledging such risks would often amount to admitting that they're not doing as much good (on expectation) as they appear to be.</p><h1>How to mitigate this problem</h1><p>Individually, altruists (to the extent that they endorse actually doing good) can make a habit of asking themselves and others what risks they may be overlooking, dismissing, or downplaying.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0x9btpvd8zk\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0x9btpvd8zk\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>Institutionally, we can rearrange organizational structures to take these individual tendencies into account, for example by creating positions dedicated to or focused on managing risk.

This is tricky because due to information asymmetry, we can easily create \"risk management theaters\" akin to \"security theater\" (which come to think of it, is a type of risk management theater). But I think we should at least take notice when someone or some organization fails, in a clear and obvious way, to acknowledge risks or to do good risk management, for example not writing down a list of important risks to be mindful of and keeping it updated, or avoiding/deflecting questions about risk.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefaz9c28wopmi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnaz9c28wopmi\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;More optimistically, we can try to develop a culture where people and organizations are monitored and held accountable for managing risks substantively and competently.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnfz12yumtpkr\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreffz12yumtpkr\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>due in part to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/osYFcQtxnRKB4F4HA/a-tale-from-communist-china\">my family history</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn9a4ey6gc3x9\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref9a4ey6gc3x9\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Normally I'd give some examples here, but we can probably all think of some from the recent past.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn0x9btpvd8zk\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref0x9btpvd8zk\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I try to do this myself <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/n2h2vgNYMHFJz6Xpz/managing-risks-while-trying-to-do-good?commentId=QeKjF5gu7xd5wDfjA\">in the comments</a>.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnwhiifv4jrar\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefwhiifv4jrar\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>an idea previously discussed by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/i7DWM6zhhPr2ccq35/thoughts-on-ea-post-ftx#11_\">Ryan Carey </a>and <a href=\"https://ea.greaterwrong.com/posts/DdSszj5NXk45MhQoq/decision-making-and-decentralisation-in-ea\">William MacAskill</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnaz9c28wopmi\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefaz9c28wopmi\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>However, see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/n2h2vgNYMHFJz6Xpz/managing-risks-while-trying-to-do-good?commentId=mjSdDLok4evCR3c8u\">this comment</a>.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Wei_Dai"}}, {"_id": "YmBNyhopAmZ7M8t43", "title": "Sequencing Swabs", "postedAt": "2024-02-01T01:54:21.681Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Jeff_Kaufman"}}, {"_id": "nGcTkAXtkQb58ikk5", "title": "#177 \u2013 Recent AI breakthroughs and navigating the growing rift between AI safety and accelerationist camps (Nathan Labenz on the 80,000 Hours Podcast)", "postedAt": "2024-01-31T19:37:50.048Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We just published an interview: <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/nathan-labenz-ai-breakthroughs-controversies/\">Nathan Labenz on recent AI breakthroughs and navigating the growing rift between AI safety and accelerationist camps</a>. <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/4RWCqhG6HlNNSvCKF0TJCE?si=xbNNg9THRt6_zz07CzRDaQ\">Listen on Spotify</a> or click through for other audio options, the transcript, and related links.

It\u2019s kind of now you know what everyone is going to say, maybe before they\u2019ve had much to say about it yet. Whereas a year ago, even six months ago, it felt a lot more open: people were toying with ideas a lot more, it was less aggressive, people were more open-minded.</p><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> That is my perception, unfortunately. And I guess my simple explanation for it would be that it\u2019s starting to get real, and there\u2019s starting to be actual government interest. And when you start to see these congressional hearings, and then you start to see voluntary White House commitments, and then you see an executive order \u2014 which is largely just a few reporting requirements for the most part, but still, is kind of the beginning \u2014 then anything around politics and government is generally so polarised and ideological that maybe people are starting to just fall back into those frames. That\u2019s my theory. I don\u2019t have a great theory, or I\u2019m not super confident in that theory.</p><p>There are definitely some thought leaders that are particularly aggressive in terms of pushing an agenda right now. I mean, I\u2019m not breaking any news to say Marc Andreessen has put out some pretty aggressive rhetoric just within the last month or two. <a href=\"https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/\">The Techno-Optimist Manifesto</a>, where I\u2019m like, I agree with you on like 80%, maybe even 90% of this. We\u2019ve covered the self-driving cars, and there\u2019s plenty of other things where I think, man, it\u2019s a real bummer that we don\u2019t have more nuclear power. And I\u2019m very inclined to agree on most things.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Shame we can\u2019t build apartments.</p><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> Yeah, for god\u2019s sake. But I don\u2019t think he\u2019s done the discourse any favours by framing the debate in terms of, like, he used the term \u201cthe enemy\u201d and he just listed out a bunch of people that he perceives to be the enemy. And that really sucks.</p><p>The kind of classic thought experiment here is like, if aliens came to Earth, we would hopefully all by default think that we were in it together, and we would want to understand them first and what their intentions are, and whether they would be friendly to us or hostile to us or whatever \u2014 and really need to understand that before deciding what to do. Unfortunately, it feels like that\u2019s kind of the situation that we\u2019re in. The aliens are of our own creation, but they are these sort of strange things that are not very well understood yet. We don\u2019t really know why they do what they do, although we are making a lot of progress on that.</p><p>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helping anybody for technology leaders to be giving out their lists of enemies. I don\u2019t really think anybody needs to be giving out our lists of enemies. It would be so tragicomic if you imagine actual aliens showing up, then imagine the people calling each other names and deciding who\u2019s enemies of whom before we\u2019ve even figured out what the aliens are here for.</p><p>And so I feel like we\u2019re kind of behaving really badly, honestly, to be dividing into camps before we\u2019ve even got a clear picture of what we\u2019re dealing with. That\u2019s just crazy to me as to exactly why it\u2019s happening. I think there have been a few quite negative contributions, but it also does just seem to be where society is at right now. You know, we saw the same thing with vaccines, right? I mean, I\u2019m not like a super vaccine expert, but safe to say that that discourse was also unhealthy, right?</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> I could find certain areas for improvement.</p><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> Yeah. Here we had a deadly disease and then we had life-saving medicine. And I think it\u2019s totally appropriate to ask some questions about that life-saving medicine, and its safety and possible side effects \u2014 the \u201cjust asking questions\u201d defence I\u2019m actually kind of sympathetic to. But the discourse, safe to say it was pretty deranged.</p><p>And here we are again, where it seems like there\u2019s really no obvious reason for people to be so polarised about this, but it is happening and I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s all that much that can be done about it. I think my best hope for the moment is just that the extreme techno-optimist, techno-libertarian, don\u2019t-tread-on-me, right-to-bear-AI faction is potentially just self-discrediting. I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right way forward, and if anything, I think they may end up being harmful to their own goals, just like the OpenAI board was perhaps harmful to its own goals.</p><p>When you have a leading billionaire chief of major VC funds saying such extreme things, it really does invite the government to come back and be like, \u201cOh, really? That\u2019s what you think? That\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do if we don\u2019t put any controls on you? Well, then guess what? You\u2019re getting them.\u201d It doesn\u2019t seem like good strategy. It may be a good strategy for deal flow, if your goal is to attract other uber-ambitious founder types \u2014 if you just want, like, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Kalanick\">Travis Kalanick</a> to choose your firm in his next venture, and you want that type of person to take your money, then maybe it\u2019s good for that. But if you actually are trying to convince the policymakers that regulation is not needed, then I don\u2019t think you\u2019re on the path to being effective there. So it\u2019s very strange. It\u2019s very hard to figure out.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Self-driving cars</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> I think I have a somewhat contrarian take on this, because it does still seem like the predominant view is that it\u2019s going to be a while still and obviously <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/cruise-robotaxi-self-driving-permit-revoked-california/\">Cruise has recently had a lot of problems</a> due to one incident plus perhaps maybe a cover up of that incident. It\u2019s not entirely clear exactly what happened there.</p><p>But I\u2019m a little confused by this, because yes, the leading makers \u2014 and that would be Tesla, Waymo, and Cruise \u2014 have put out numbers that say pretty clearly that they are safer than human drivers. And they can measure this in a bunch of different ways; it can be kind of complicated, exactly what do you compare to and under what conditions. The AI doesn\u2019t have to drive in extreme conditions, so it can just turn off.</p><hr><p>And this is why I think probably China will beat us in the self-driving car race, if not the AI race overall, is because I think they\u2019ll go around and just change the environment, right? And say, \u201cIf we have trees blocking stop signs, or we have stop signs that are ambiguous, or we have whatever these sort of environmental problems, then we should fix them; we should clean up the environment so it works well.\u201d And we just have seemingly no will here, certainly in the United States, to do that sort of thing.</p><p>So I\u2019m bummed by that. And I really try to carry that flag proudly too, because, you know, so many people \u2014 and this is a problem in society at large; it\u2019s not just an AI problem \u2014 but people get invested in terms of their identity on different sides of issues, and everybody seems to polarise and go to their coalition on questions which aren\u2019t obviously related. So I try to emphasise the places where I think just sane first-principles thinking kind of breaks those norms. And one I think is self-driving cars: really good, I would love to see those accelerated, I would love to have one.</p><p>It would be more useful to me if Tesla actually made it more autonomous. Probably the biggest reason I haven\u2019t bought one is that it still really requires you to pay close attention. And I\u2019m a competent driver, but we have a couple members of our family who are not great drivers, and this would be a real benefit to their safety. But one of the problems is it requires you to monitor it so closely, and if you lapse or don\u2019t monitor it in just the way that you want, it gives you a strike, and after a few strikes, they just kick you off the self-driving program.</p><p>So unfortunately, I think the drivers that would actually be most benefited from this would probably end up getting kicked out of the program, and then it would have been pointless to have bought one in the first place. So I would endorse giving more autonomy to the car, and I think that would make people in my personal family safer. But we\u2019re just not there.</p><p>And I hold that belief at the same time as all these kind of more cautious beliefs that I have around super general systems. And the reasons for that are I think pretty obvious, really, but for some reason don\u2019t seem to carry the day. The main one is that driving cars is already very dangerous. A lot of people die from it, and it\u2019s already very random and it\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s already not just. So if you could make it less dangerous, make it more safe overall, even if there continues to be some unfairness and some injustice and some literal harms to people, that seems to be good.</p><p>And there\u2019s really no risk of a self-driving car taking over the world or doing anything\u2026 It\u2019s not going to get totally out of our control. It can only do one thing. It\u2019s an engineered system with a very specific purpose, right? It\u2019s not going to start doing science one day by surprise. So I think that\u2019s all very good. We should embrace that type of technology. And I try to be an example of holding that belief and championing that at the same time as saying, hey, something that can do science and pursue long-range goals of arbitrary specification, that is like a whole different kind of animal.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Robotics</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> One very particular thing I wanted to shout out too, because this is one of the few examples where GPT-4 has genuinely outperformed human experts, is from a paper called \u201c<a href=\"https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/eureka-robotics-research/\">Eureka</a>\u201d \u2014 I think a very appropriate title \u2014 from Jim Fan\u2019s group at NVIDIA. What they did is used GPT-4 to write the reward models, which are then used to train a robotic hand. So one of the tasks that they were able to get a robotic hand to do, is twirl a pencil in the hand. This is something that I\u2019m not very good at doing, but it\u2019s this sort of thing, wobbling it around the fingers.</p><p>What\u2019s hard about this is multiple things, of course, but one thing that\u2019s particularly hard if you\u2019re going to try to use reinforcement learning to teach a robot to do this, is you have to have a reward function that tells the system how well it\u2019s doing. So these systems learn by just kind of fumbling around, and then getting a reward, and then updating so as to do more of the things that get the high reward and less of the things that get the low reward. But in the initial fumbling around, it\u2019s kind of hard to tell, Was that good? Was that bad? You\u2019re nowhere close.</p><p>They call this the \u201csparse reward problem,\u201d or at least that\u2019s one way that it\u2019s talked about: if you are so far from doing anything good that you can\u2019t get any meaningful reward, then you get no signal, then you have nothing to learn from. So how do you get over that initial hump? Well, humans write custom reward functions for particular tasks. We know, we think we know, we have a sense of what good looks like. So if we can write a reward function to observe what you do and tell you how good it is, then our knowledge encoded through that reward function can be used as the basis for hopefully getting you going in the early going.</p><p>It turns out that GPT-4 is significantly better than humans at writing these reward functions for these various robot hand tasks, including twirling the pencil \u2014 significantly so, according to that paper. And this is striking to me, because when you think about writing reward functions, that\u2019s by definition expert, right? There\u2019s not like any amateur reward function writers out there. This is the kind of thing that the average person doesn\u2019t even know what it is, can\u2019t do it at all, is just totally going to give you a blank stare even at the whole subject. So you\u2019re into expert territory from the beginning.</p><p>And to have GPT-4 exceed what the human experts can do just suggests that\u2026 It\u2019s very rare. I have not seen many of these, but this is one where I would say, there is GPT-4 doing something that, would you say that\u2019s beyond its training data? Probably. Somewhat at least. Would you say it is an insight?</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Seems insight-adjacent.</p><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> Yeah, I would say so. I mean, it\u2019s not obviously <i>not</i> an insight. So I had used this term of eureka moments, and I had said for the longest time, no eureka moments. I\u2019m now having to say precious few eureka moments, because I at least feel like I have one example, and notably the paper is called \u201cEureka.\u201d So that\u2019s definitely one to check out if you want to see what I would consider one of the frontier examples of GPT-4 outperforming human experts.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Medicine</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> Again, this is just exploding. It has not been long since <a href=\"https://sites.research.google/med-palm/\">Med-PaLM 2</a> was announced from Google, and this was a multimodal model that is able to take in not just text, but also images, also genetic data, histology images \u2014 different kinds of images like x-rays, but also tissue slides \u2014 and answer questions using all these inputs. And to basically do it at roughly human level: on eight out of nine dimensions on which it was evaluated, it was preferred by human doctors to human doctors. Mostly the difference there was pretty narrow, so it would be also pretty fair to say it was like a tie across the board if you wanted to just round it. But in actual blow-by-blow on the nine dimensions, it did win eight out of nine of the dimensions. So that\u2019s medical-question answering with multimodal inputs \u2014 that\u2019s a pretty big deal.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Isn\u2019t this just going to be an insanely useful product? Imagine how much all doctors earn across the world, answering people\u2019s questions, looking at samples of things, getting test results, answering people\u2019s questions. You can automate that, it sounds like. Maybe I\u2019m missing that there\u2019s going to be all kinds of legal issues and application issues, but it\u2019s just incredible.</p><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> Yeah. I think one likely scenario, which might be as good as we could hope for there, would be that human doctors prescribe: that that would be kind of the fallback position of, yeah, get all your questions answered, but when it comes to actual treatment, then a human is going to have to review and sign off on it. That could make sense. Not even sure that necessarily is the best, but there\u2019s certainly a defence of it.</p><p>So that\u2019s Med-PaLM 2. That has not been released. It is, according to Google, in kind of early testing with trusted partners \u2014 which I assume means health systems or whatever. People used to say, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t Google buy a hospital system?\u201d At this point, they really might ought to, because just implementing this holistically through an entire\u2026 There\u2019s obviously a lot of layers in a hospital system. That could make a tonne of sense.</p><p>And GPT-4 also, especially with <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/gpt-4v-system-card\">Vision</a> now, is there too. It hasn\u2019t been out for very long, but there was a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05591\">paper</a> announced in just the last couple of weeks where there\u2019s a couple of notable details here too. They basically say, we evaluated GPT-4V (V for Vision) \u2014 on challenging medical image cases across 69 clinicopathological conferences \u2014 so wide range of different things \u2014 and it outperformed human respondents overall and across difficulty levels, skin tones, and all different image types except radiology, where it matched humans. So again, just extreme breadth is one of the huge strengths of these systems.</p><p>And that skin tones thing really jumped out at me, because that has been one of the big questions and challenges around these sorts of things. Like maybe it\u2019s doing OK on these benchmarks, maybe it\u2019s doing OK on these cherry-picked examples, but there\u2019s a lot of diversity in the world. What about people who look different? What about people who are different in any number of ways? We\u2019re starting to see those thresholds crossed as well. So yeah, the AI doctor is not far off, it seems.</p><p>Then there\u2019s also, in terms of biomedicine, <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/technologies/alphafold/\">AlphaFold</a> and the more recent expansion to AlphaFold is also just incredibly game changing. There are now drugs in development that were kind of identified through AlphaFold.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Kids and artificial friends</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> I\u2019ve done <a href=\"https://www.cognitiverevolution.ai/blog/e3-creating-compassionate-ai-with-replika-founder-eugenia-kuyda/\">one episode</a> only so far with the CEO of Replika, the virtual friend company, and I came out of that with very mixed feelings. On the one hand, she started that company before language models, and she served a population \u2014 and continues to, I think, largely serve a population \u2014 that has real challenges, right? Many of them anyway. Such that people are forming very real attachment to things that are very simplistic.</p><p>And I kind of took away from that, man, people have real holes in their hearts. If something that is as simple as Replika 2022 can be something that you love, then you are kind of starved for real connection. And that was kind of sad. But I also felt like the world is rough for sure for a lot of people, and if this is helpful to these people, then more power to them. But then the flip side of that is it\u2019s now getting really good. So it\u2019s no longer just something that\u2019s just good enough to soothe people who are suffering in some way, but is probably getting to the point where it\u2019s going to be good enough to begin to really compete with normal relationships for otherwise normal people. And that too, could be really weird.</p><p>For parents, I would say ChatGPT is great, and I do love how ChatGPT, even just in the name, always kind of presents in this robotic way and doesn\u2019t try to be your friend. It will be polite to you, but it doesn\u2019t want to hang out with you.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> \u201cHey, Rob. How are you? How was your day?\u201d</p><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> It\u2019s not bidding for your attention, right? It\u2019s just there to help and try to be helpful and that\u2019s that. But the Replika will send you notifications: \u201cHey, it\u2019s been a while. Let\u2019s chat.\u201d And as those continue to get better, I would definitely say to parents, get your kids ChatGPT, but watch out for virtual friends. Because I think they now definitely can be engrossing enough that\u2026 You know, maybe I\u2019ll end up looking back on this and being like, \u201cI was old fashioned at the time,\u201d but virtual friends are I think something to be developed with extreme care. And if you\u2019re just a profit-maximising app that\u2019s just trying to drive your engagement numbers \u2014 just like early social media, right? \u2014 you\u2019re going to end up in a pretty unhealthy place, from the user standpoint.</p><p>I think social media has come a long way, and to Facebook or Meta\u2019s credit, they\u2019ve done a lot of things to study wellbeing, and they specifically don\u2019t give angry reactions weight in the feed. And that was a principled decision that apparently went all the way up to Zuckerberg: \u201cLook, we do get more engagement from things that are getting angry reactions.\u201d And he was like, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not weighting. We don\u2019t want more anger. Angry reactions we will not reward with more engagement.\u201d OK, boom: that\u2019s policy. But they\u2019ve still got a lot to sort out.</p><p>And in the virtual friend category, I just imagine that taking quite a while to get to a place where a virtual friend from a VC app that\u2019s pressured to grow is also going to find its way toward being a form factor that would actually be healthy for your kids. So I would hold off on that if I were a parent \u2014 and I could exercise that much control over my kids, which I know is not always a given.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Nowcasting vs forecasting</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah, it\u2019s an interesting question: Is it more worth forecasting where things will be in the future versus is it more valuable to spend an extra hour understanding where we stand right now?</p><p>On the forecasting the future side, one mistake that I perceive some people as making is just looking at what\u2019s possible now and saying, \u201cI\u2019m not really that worried about the things that GPT-4 can do. It seems like at best it\u2019s capable of misdemeanours, or it\u2019s capable of speeding up some bad things that would happen anyway. So, not much to see here. I\u2019m not going to stress about this whole AI thing.\u201d That seems like a big mistake to me, inasmuch as the person\u2019s not looking at all of the trajectory of where we might be in a couple of years\u2019 time. You know, it\u2019s worth paying attention to the present, but also worth projecting forward where we might be in future.</p><p>On the other hand, the future is where we will live. But sadly, predicting how it is is challenging. So if you try to ask, \u201cWhat will language models be capable of in 2027?\u201d you\u2019re kind of guessing. We all have to guess. So informed speculation.</p><p>Whereas if you focus on what they\u2019re capable of doing now, you can at least get a very concrete answer to that. So if the suggestions that you\u2019re making or the opinions that you have are inconsistent with what is already the case, with examples that you could just find if you went looking for them, then you could potentially very quickly fix mistakes that you\u2019re making in a way that someone merely speculating about how things might be in the future is not going to correct your views.</p><p>And I guess especially just given how many new capabilities are coming online all the time, how many new applications people are developing and how much space there is to explore, what capabilities these enormous very general models already have that we haven\u2019t even noticed, there\u2019s clearly just a lot of juice that one can get out of that. If someone\u2019s saying, \u201cI\u2019m not worried because I don\u2019t think these models will be capable of independently pursuing tasks,\u201d and then you can show them an example of a model at least beginning to independently pursue tasks, even if in a somewhat clumsy way, then that might be enough to get them to rethink the opinion that they have.</p><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> Yeah, one quick comment on just predicting the future: I\u2019m all for that kind of work as well, and I do find a lot of it pretty compelling. So I don\u2019t mean to suggest that my focus on the present is at the exclusion or in conflict with understanding the future. If anything, hopefully better understanding of the present informs our understanding of the future.</p><p>And one thing that you said really is my biggest motivation, which is just that I think in some sense, the future is now \u2014 in that people have such a lack of understanding of what currently exists that what they think is the future is actually here \u2014 and so if we could close the gap in understanding, so that people did have a genuinely accurate understanding of what is happening now, I think they would have a healthier respect and even a little fear of what the future might hold. So it\u2019s kind of like I think the present is compelling enough to get people\u2019s attention that you should project into the future, especially if you\u2019re a decision maker in this space. But if you\u2019re just trying to get people to kind of wake up and pay attention, then I think the present is enough.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "bm7iRhMynNbbwaMh4", "title": "A response to an attempted rebuttal of maximising ethics", "postedAt": "2024-01-31T17:48:09.733Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Please also find this on my blog <a href=\"https://chrome-radar-28a.notion.site/Things-of-utmost-importance-d9db43c6171e42738972db7614f1c724?pvs=4\">here</a></p><p>I am using the word \u2018maximising\u2019 here as an adjective, rather than as a verb. By \u2018maximising ethics\u2019, I mean a system of ethics according to which one ought to do as much good as they can do, however \u2018the good\u2019 is understood or defined.</p><p>Myself and others have become compelled to adopt a \u2018maximising ethics\u2019 by which to live. For some of us, this was prompted by exposure to some of the works of Peter Singer. In <i>Famine, Affluence, and Morality</i>, Singer asserts that \u2018if it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.\u2019 (Singer, 1972: 231) He takes this conclusion from the intuitions that most of us share in response to a very simple but powerful thought experiment he created: \u2018if I am walking past a shallow pond and see a child drowning in it, I ought to wade in and pull the child out. This will mean getting my clothes muddy, but this is insignificant, while the death of the child would presumably be a very bad thing.\u2019 (Ibid.)</p><p>Nevertheless, by many, Singer\u2019s principle is considered too demanding. Indeed, it would appear <i>impossible</i> to live by a principle according to which you are doing something wrong whenever you buy a coffee, given that the money spent on this coffee could be donated to an effective charity which works towards preventing suffering, injustice, premature death, or moral catastrophe. The moral value corresponding to the pleasure you derive from the coffee is very low, whereas these causes are of great moral importance. Donation to effective charities is likely to contribute towards tackling problems and bringing about tangible change for the better.</p><p>It is important to note that the demandingness of Singer\u2019s theory bears nothing on its truth or falsity. Notwithstanding, the demandingness of this principle, combined with the validity of Singer\u2019s argumentation, has motivated his contemporaries to <i>find</i> and to <i>provide</i> a valid *counter-*argument, so that they can rest assured that they are <i>not</i>, in fact, falling short of what is morally required of them in their day-to-day lives.</p><p>One such counter-argument is forthcoming from philosopher Travis Timmerman (2015). Timmerman argues that Singer\u2019s maximising principle does not follow from the intuitions that we have in response to his thought experiment, because these are found on the assumption that, in it, we have \u2018not frequently sacrificed [our] new clothes to save children in the past and will not need to do so frequently in the future.\u2019 (Timmerman, 2015: 207) Timmerman then goes on to propose a thought experiment which he believes would be more appropriate as a grounding for Singer\u2019s maximising principle: if, every day, you come across a vast space of land covered with hundreds of newly formed shallow ponds, each containing a drowning child, on the way to the bank to stop $200 from being taken out of your bank every 5 minutes, you would be morally permitted to stop saving children at a point at which the amount of money you have left is more than you need to buy things only of moral importance comparable to the life of a child. (Timmerman, 2015: 208-210)</p><p>However, these intuitions (that from Singer\u2019s and from Timmerman\u2019s thought experiments) might be in tension with one another. After all, it would seem that to alter what we see as following from Singer\u2019s \u2018drowning child\u2019 such that it is a less demanding principle would be to do so <i>ad hoc</i> (for this, without a more stable basis for the proposition), in response to this <i>problem</i> of demandingness. If our intuitions from \u2018drowning child\u2019 and those from \u2018drowning children\u2019 are inconsistent, therefore, then one must be less trustworthy; we must prioritise one over the other. Doing this, it would be most appropriate to abandon the intuition which justifies our complacency <i>arbitrarily</i>, rather than the one which prompts us to increase our output by appeals to moral consistency. In fact, it being permissible to act in the way Timmerman suggests in his \u2018drowning children\u2019 is <i>not</i> necessarily contradictory to Singer\u2019s maximising principle.</p><p>Instead, therefore, I suggest that the way in which we reconcile ourselves with the demandingness of maximising ethics is not by kidding ourselves that it is not the case that we ought to be doing the most good that we can, but, instead, by taking into consideration the influence the demandingness of a principle to live by has upon our ability to live by it.

But they seem quite different, and warrant different responses.

Risks arise at each step. Despite its simplicity, this model does a good job pulling all these risks into one framework. It\u2019s helped me understand better how the many specific AI risks people have proposed fit together. More importantly, it satisfied my powerful, innate urge to force order onto a chaotic world.</p><h1>Terrible things come in threes</h1><p>The three AI development stages in my model are <strong>training</strong>, <strong>deployment</strong>, and <strong>diffusion</strong>.</p><p>At each stage, a different kind of AI risk arises. These are, respectively, <strong>misalignment</strong>, <strong>misuse</strong>, and <strong>systemic</strong> risks.</p><p>Throughout the entire process, <strong>competitive pressures</strong> act as a risk factor. More pressure makes risks throughout the process more likely.</p><p>Putting it all together looks like this:</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6b84db76-5d9d-496f-8037-824410bae234_1368x678.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Eg4PLFfZMcEck98vG/tez8ur9wgf3xkgjjptc9\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Eg4PLFfZMcEck98vG/wzlck3fkj0jubiccp17b 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Eg4PLFfZMcEck98vG/wmx3aql0kd1mepyhmw6n 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Eg4PLFfZMcEck98vG/d7vuxpu21ybdkqa9sowb 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Eg4PLFfZMcEck98vG/tez8ur9wgf3xkgjjptc9 1456w\"></a></p><p>This model is too simple to be perfect. For one, these risks almost certainly won\u2019t arrive in sequence, as the model implies. They\u2019re also more entangled than a linear model implies. But I think these shortcomings are relatively minor, and relating categories of risk like this gives them a pleasant cohesiveness.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd065mniqu9d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd065mniqu9d\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>So let\u2019s move ahead and look closer at the risks generated at each step.</p><h2>Training and misalignment risks</h2><p>The first set of risks emerge immediately after training an advanced AI model. Training modern AI models usually involves feeding them enormous datasets from which they can learn patterns and make predictions when given new data. Training risks relate to a model\u2019s <i>alignment</i>. That is, what the system wants to do, how it plans to do it, and whether those goals and methods are good for people.</p><p>Some researchers worry that training a model to actually do what we want in all situations, or when we deploy it in the real world, is far from straightforward. In fact, we already see some kinds of alignment failures in the world today. These often seem silly. For example, something about the way Microsoft\u2019s first Bing chatbot\u2019s goal of being helpful and charming actually made it act like an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/17/i-want-to-destroy-whatever-i-want-bings-ai-chatbot-unsettles-us-reporter\"><u>occasionally funny, occasionally frightening psychopath</u></a>.</p><p>As AI systems get more powerful, though, these misalignment risks could get a whole lot scarier. Specific risks researchers have raised include:</p><ul><li><strong>Goal specification: </strong>It might be hard to tell AI systems exactly what we want them to do, especially as we delegate more complicated tasks to them. <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/faulty-reward-functions\"><u>Some researchers worry</u></a> that AIs trained on large amounts of data will either end up finding tricks or shortcuts that lead them to produce the wrong solutions when deployed in the real world. Or that they\u2019ll face extreme or different situations in the real world than they saw in the training data, and will <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01790\"><u>react in unexpected, potentially dangerous, ways</u></a>.</li><li><strong>Power-seeking and deceptive behavior: </strong>Advanced AI systems may realize that, whatever goal they have, having power will be useful. They may further realize that, if their human operators know that they know this, they\u2019ll shut the system down. This could lead to a scenario where an advanced AI <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05566\"><u>cooperates at first</u></a>, and then <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13353\"><u>takes control</u></a> of various global systems once it is able to do so.</li></ul><p>Misalignment scenarios often involve building AIs that pursue goals not related to human well-being. If such an AI was sufficiently powerful, it could take over and eliminate or disempower humanity as part of its plan to achieve its goals.</p><h2>Deployment and misuse risks</h2><p>After training comes deployment.</p><p>Let\u2019s assume that we can train aligned systems. We have powerful AIs that reliably do what we want. We still won\u2019t be in the clear. The next challenge we\u2019ll face is misuse risks: how will we ensure everyone, everywhere, uses these systems responsibly?</p><p>AI systems will probably be applied to a vast range of problems. Most of those applications will be great, helping us solve complex problems and provide amazing goods and services, including things we can\u2019t even imagine today.&nbsp;</p><p>But people could also use them to cause harm. And the power of these systems mean that they could be used to do a <i>lot</i> of harm. Such misuse risks may take several different forms:</p><ul><li><strong>Weaponization:</strong> AI-enhanced drones are becoming an increasingly important weapon for both <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/article/how-drone-war-ukraine-transforming-conflict\"><u>warfare</u></a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempted_assassination_of_Mustafa_Al-Kadhimi\"><u>assassinations</u></a>. AI systems could control huge swarms of drones to quickly kill enormous numbers of people.</li><li><strong>Biosecurity:</strong> <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13952\"><u>Some experts worry</u></a> that advanced AI will make it much easier for people to make bioweapons. The falling cost of biotechnology makes it more plausible that this knowledge can actually be used for destructive purposes.</li><li><strong>Propaganda and Manipulation:</strong> AI systems may be used to generate large amounts of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08721\"><u>persuasive propaganda</u></a>, perhaps tailored to each individual, damaging democratic institutions.</li><li><strong>Authoritarian lock-in:</strong> The ability to process large amounts of audiovisual data make AI systems a boon for leaders seeking to closely surveil their population. <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep26084?seq=7\"><u>Some experts worry</u></a> that ironclad surveillance could allow authoritarian regimes to entrench themselves, risking a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KqCybin8rtfP3qztq/agi-and-lock-in\"><u>lock-in of their values</u></a>.</li></ul><p>This list probably isn\u2019t exhaustive. We\u2019re still learning what large language models alone are capable of. As we train more powerful and more diverse AIs, we\u2019ll learn a lot about these systems can do. We\u2019ll discover more ways to use AIs \u2014 and more ways to misuse them.</p><h2>Diffusion and systemic risks</h2><p>Finally, let\u2019s assume that we\u2019ve managed to train AI systems that basically do what we want, and that we\u2019ve built defenses to stop people from using them to do massive harm. We\u2019ll still face a challenging transition to a world in which AI systems play an important role in our global systems.</p><p>This transition could be both extremely dramatic and extremely quick. Think a century of progress occurring in just a few months or years. We could majorly screw it up. The risks here seem more subtle, but potentially just as serious as the more obvious disasters above.</p><ul><li><strong>Value erosion:</strong> AI systems will be useful. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building them. So people, companies, and other institutions like militaries will be incentivized to use them. Those that don\u2019t will lose out to competitors that do, just as a trade today who didn\u2019t use technology to execute trades at lightning speed would be at a big disadvantage.<br><br>Over time AIs will perform a larger share of socioeconomic tasks and decisions. But if it proves difficult to fully describe what exactly we want these AIs to do, we could end up missing out on important things we value. AI safety researcher Paul Christiano <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf/what-failure-looks-like#Part_I__You_get_what_you_measure\"><u>has noted</u></a> that this increasing ability to \u201cget what we measure\u201d could cause a \u201cslow-rolling catastrophe\u201d: AI-powered companies increasing profits through consumer manipulation and AI-powered governments winning elections through voter manipulation. Dan Hendrycks has <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16200\"><u>also argued</u></a> that evolutionary pressures favor selfish AIs over benevolent ones.</li><li><strong>Loss of control:</strong> Handing control of important systems to AIs will raise other issues. For example, AIs are able to think and act much faster than people can. This could make it difficult for people to oversee AI decision-making, and intervene if it seems like things are going wrong. Without prudent coordination or regulation, organizations that do maintain human oversight risk losing out to more risk-seeking competitors that don\u2019t.<br><br>Eventually entire industries may be automated: AI executives will run AI companies and sell AI products to AI customers. Complex, closed-loop economies could form entirely outside human control and prove difficult to shut down.</li><li><strong>Hyperwar:</strong> The risk of losing control is particularly stark in the military realm. Integrating AI systems into militaries could <a href=\"https://tnsr.org/2021/06/debunking-the-ai-arms-race-theory/\"><u>increase the speed at which war is fought</u></a>. It would become harder for humans to contribute to strategic and tactical decision-making. It could also enable very rapid escalation. In the financial realm, interactions between automated trading systems have led to flash crashes, changing asset values far faster than human traders could have. Future wars <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/the-future/hyperwar-ai-military-warfare/\"><u>could escalate similarly quickly</u></a>, growing to catastrophic size before humans can intervene and de-escalate.</li><li><strong>Moral catastrophe:</strong> A final, wild possibility is that we could cause a moral catastrophe by mistreating AIs. Advanced AI systems will likely display complex sensing, information processing, and decision-making abilities. It seems at least plausible that some of these abilities are related to the phenomenon of consciousness. This raises the possibility that, in the future, AIs themselves will warrant <a href=\"https://experiencemachines.substack.com/p/dangers-on-both-sides-risks-from\"><u>moral concern</u></a>.<br><br>The Industrial Revolution, competitive economic dynamics, and a lack of concern for animal rights allowed for a massive expansion in intensive farming systems. The moral implications of this are controversial, to say the least, but it is at least <i>plausible</i> that the negative effects for farmed animals partially offset the widespread welfare gains for people. The future will probably see a similar explosion in the number of AI systems. We could make the same mistake again. To create and condemn huge numbers of conscious beings to an unpleasant or even torturous existence would seem to warrant being called a moral catastrophe.</li></ul><p>You don\u2019t have to make crazy assumptions to think that a world with widespread superintelligent AIs will be very strange. Whether it will also be very good is more uncertain.</p><h1>Risk factor: Competitive pressure</h1><p>A skeptical critic might ask why companies would release misaligned AI systems or allow customers to misuse them, or why governments would allow systemic risks to arise. These are fair questions. I do expect to see these organizations make strong technical and legal efforts to avoid these worst-case scenarios.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0pugki692b8p\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0pugki692b8p\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>However, it\u2019s also worth recognizing how competition will shape incentives at each stage of the development process.&nbsp;</p><p>AI companies will face strong incentives to develop powerful models before their competitors. Evaluating models, especially large, complex ones, for dangerous capabilities will take time. There will be strong pressure to speed up or shorten the evaluation process to avoid being beaten to the market by other companies.</p><p>In fact, we\u2019ve already seen this play out. The <a href=\"https://time.com/6256529/bing-openai-chatgpt-danger-alignment/\"><u>creepy</u></a> AI-powered Bing search I mentioned earlier was <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759348/openai-microsoft-bing-ai-warning-gpt-4\"><u>rushed out</u></a> by Microsoft after they saw how much hype OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT was garnering. As AI systems get more powerful, their economic value will also increase, perhaps further increasing these pressures.</p><p>The same dynamics could apply to misuse risks. Companies may avoid building explicitly-harmful AIs. But AI systems can be applied to a wide range of problems. Tuning them to filter out harmful outputs could take time - time in which a competitor could beat them to market.</p><p>Finally, we saw how competitive dynamics can drive systemic risks as various actors seek an edge by handing more control over to AI systems.</p><p>None of these risks seems inevitable. All can be avoided by combining technical solutions and regulatory coordination. But those solutions won\u2019t be created and implemented automatically. Designing and implementing responsible policies at the firm, national, and international level will be a lot of work. Meanwhile, AI progress will, by default, continue. The path of least resistance is a treacherous one.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Modeling AI development as a three-stage process \u2014 training, deployment, and societal diffusion \u2014 has helped me understand how the different AI risks people have proposed fit together.</p><p>It\u2019s too simple to model AI development perfectly. For one, it\u2019s too linear; we could face catastrophic misuse risks before catastrophic misalignment risks if less powerful systems can be used for nefarious purposes. Or we may face risks from the different categories simultaneously. And in some cases the boundaries are a bit blurry. The ways a misaligned AI could wreak havoc could be the same ways a person could misuse AI systems: like attacking digital infrastructure or unleashing powerful weapons.</p><p>On the whole, though, this model stitches together what otherwise seem like quite different risk pathways. I\u2019m not aware of any major AI risk proposals that aren\u2019t mentioned here or couldn\u2019t fit into this model \u2014 though if there are I\u2019d love to hear about them!</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnc49msoyfc45\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefc49msoyfc45\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I\u2019m only focusing on <i>global, generational</i> risks.

I got a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago, wrote a free market microeconomics textbook, and recognized that markets have made most people in the developed world richer than medieval kings. Yet, I'm increasingly convinced that these very markets are likely steering us towards the creation of an uncontrollable artificial superintelligence that probably kills everyone. In this essay, I discuss how the challenges of AI existential risks distinctively leverage market weaknesses. It\u2019s as if a vengeful demon, channeling Karl Marx, created a scenario highlighting their flaws. The thesis of this essay is that if you believe that a smarter-than-human AI would create a significant existential risk, then even if you normally are a staunch advocate of free markets, you should be concerned that these markets are potentially leading us to a disastrous outcome.</p><p>In my microeconomics classes I present a hypothetical scenario to students, drawing inspiration from an example by the great 18<sup>th</sup> century economist Adam Smith. Imagine, while cooking and watching TV, you see a news report about a devastating earthquake in an unfamiliar country, claiming over 100,000 lives, including children. The images of the catastrophe deeply unsettle you. In your distraction, you accidentally cut off the tip of your pinky finger. Upon calling their mother in distress and being asked what\u2019s wrong, my students admit they would mention the finger injury over the distant tragedy, revealing an innate tendency to value personal afflictions over the suffering of strangers, no matter the scale.</p><p>In an ideal world, the economy would operate with each individual dedicated to the greater good of humanity. However, as E.O. Wilson wryly noted about communism, \u201cWonderful theory, wrong species.\u201d While we may deeply care for our immediate circle\u2014friends and family\u2014the same level of concern rarely extends to distant others. So how have we managed to build an extensive, interconnected global economy? The insight of Adam Smith is key here: \"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.\" Our economic system leverages this self-interest; it's structured so that serving others often coincides with personal gain. For instance, a baker who makes tastier or more affordable bread not only boosts his profits but also serves the community. He is guided as if by an \u201cinvisible hand\u201d to understand and cater to his customers' desires, sometimes even before they do.&nbsp;</p><p>But markets don't magically align our self-interest with the broader good. There are challenges to market efficiency that create a wedge between profit maximization and the betterment of society. A critical wedge is externalities \u2013 unintended consequences of an activity that affect individuals not directly involved. Take, for example, a bakery whose operations generate noise pollution harmful to nearby residents.</p><p>Although consumers might generally prefer a market where all businesses mitigate externalities such as noise pollution, their individual purchasing decisions often don't reflect this preference. This is because businesses that don't invest in reducing externalities can offer lower prices. For an individual consumer, the negligible impact of a single purchase on the overall noise pollution levels often leads to a preference for cheaper options. Consequently, there's a paradox where everyone might agree that a market with less noise pollution is preferable, but individual incentives lead to a collective outcome where businesses that ignore such externalities thrive. Yet, this situation is far from hopeless.</p><p>Direct negotiations might address this local externality, given the small number of stakeholders and their probable existing relationships. The bakery could offer compensation or complimentary bread to the affected residents, or alternatively, the residents might impose a cost on the bakery as an incentive to resolve the issue. Alternatively, residents bothered by the noise might relocate, making way for others less sensitive to it. While this scenario highlights a market challenge in promoting societal benefit, it often lends itself to resolution through community-level interventions.</p><p>When the bakery's operations result in city-wide externalities like air pollution, the challenge for market solutions intensifies. The problem's vast scale renders direct negotiations between the bakery and each impacted resident impractical. Moreover, the idea of residents relocating to escape pollution is impractical, considering the large number affected and the extreme measure of leaving the city.</p><p>Unchecked pollution externalities can severely degrade urban environments, challenging the effectiveness of markets. However, even imperfect governments can play a successful role in managing these externalities, as demonstrated by the clean air and water in almost all the cities of wealthier nations. Furthermore, concrete air quality measurements greatly assist in developing and assessing relevant policies. Governments, already accustomed to managing disputes among city residents, are frequently well-equipped to address these issues. &nbsp;While pollution within a legal jurisdiction presents a significant challenge to market-based solutions, I believe it doesn't negate the overall advantages of market systems.</p><p>To add complexity to the challenge to market efficiency, envision a scenario where a company's actions result in global pollution, an externality affecting everyone. Individual negotiations or domestic solutions are ineffective here; global cooperation is essential. However, international decision-making is notoriously less developed and more complex than national governance, compounded by conflicts between countries. This complexity echoes the challenges in tackling climate change, a major global concern, despite its widely acknowledged severity and proposed solutions such as the carbon tax, which is popular among economists.</p><p>Further compounding the challenge to market effectiveness, consider pollution that yields immediate benefits but harbors long-term negative consequences. Politicians, driven by self-interest, often focus on short-term gains, reducing their motivation to tackle such externalities. This is evident in democratic systems where the complexity of issues and the perceived insignificance of individual votes lead to a lack of accountability for long-term outcomes. This phenomenon can be seen in the ongoing crisis of U.S. entitlement programs, where delaying resolution for short-term comfort exacerbates future costs. This contrasts with a homeowner who, knowing their roof will fail in ten years, understands the economic benefit of early repair to enhance the home's resale value even if he plans on selling his house this year. Therefore, anticipating that politicians will steer markets towards long-term sustainability is unrealistic, akin to expecting children to persuade their parents to opt for healthy family diets over the immediate gratification of sweets.</p><p>Adding a layer of confusion only intensifies our externality dilemma. Suppose there is a division of opinion about whether the pollution is beneficial, uncertainty about when its effects will manifest, and a general consensus that the mechanisms at play are beyond the grasp of the political elite. This is the case with AI existential risk.</p><p>In a free market economy, profit serves as the primary motivator for innovation and development. Companies and investors are constantly seeking new technologies and advancements that promise significant returns. AI represents one of these frontier technologies where the potential for profit is enormous. From automating routine tasks to revolutionizing industries like healthcare, finance, and transportation, AI promises to unlock new levels of efficiency and capability. AI offers literally trillions of dollars of profit and enormous consumer satisfaction. It is incentivized by markets like nothing else in history.&nbsp;</p><p>Competition propels us towards artificial superintelligence, as any AI firm slowing its pace risks being overtaken by others, and workers understand that refusing to engage in capacity research merely leads to their replacement. Consequently, even if you personally think AI will probably kill everyone, you can morally justify working on capacity research because you know the marginal benefit to AI safety of your quitting just determined by how much better you are at your job than the person who would be hired to replace you. We have a true market failure when even if all the relevant participants recognized they were pushing humanity towards extinction and were all willing to accept a significant reduction in wealth for a non-trivial reduction in risk, the logic of markets and competition could keep them working towards quickly creating an artificial superintelligence.</p><p>While the pursuit of profit motivates firms to develop increasingly advanced AIs, the potential catastrophic consequences represent an externality that current market structures struggle to address. The existential risk of AI, being global, elusive, and long-term, sharply contrasts with its immediate, tangible benefits. This mismatch challenges governments to intervene effectively.</p><p>Confronting the AI existential risk may require revisiting a concept highlighted by Adam Smith: the propensity for collusion in any trade to reduce competition. He wrote \"People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.\" This inherent tendency towards collusion among market players could be leveraged in regulating AI. Permitting collusion among existing AI firms could decelerate the race to create a superintelligent computer. While this would likely involve restricting competition, leading to higher profits and reduced innovation for these firms, it could be a lesser evil compared to the alternative risks of unregulated AI development. However, admittedly, this approach carries its own dangers, such as the possibility of these firms becoming too powerful or even using their position to take over the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Written with the assistance of GPT-4.</p>", "user": {"username": "JamesMiller"}}, {"_id": "h9EqoakkATQGMxECH", "title": "Announcing Niel Bowerman as the next CEO of 80,000 Hours", "postedAt": "2024-01-31T17:25:59.103Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We\u2019re excited to announce that the boards of Effective Ventures US and Effective Ventures UK have approved our selection committee\u2019s choice of Niel Bowerman as the new CEO of 80,000 Hours.</p><p>I (Rob Wiblin) was joined on the selection committee by Will MacAskill, Hilary Greaves, Simran Dhaliwal, and Max Daniel.</p><p>80,000 Hours is a project of EV US and EV UK, though under Niel\u2019s leadership, it expects to be <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2023/12/announcing-plan/\">spinning out and creating an independent legal structure</a>, which will involve selecting a new board.</p><p>We want to thank Brenton Mayer, who has served as 80,000 Hours interim CEO since late 2022, for his dedication and thoughtful management.

It now features about 400 jobs a month aimed at helping people increase the impact of their careers and receives around 75,000 clicks a month; it\u2019s helped fill at least 200 roles that we\u2019re aware of.</p><p>Niel has also made substantial contributions to the website, publishing an ahead-of-its-time article about <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/us-ai-policy/\">working in US AI policy</a> in January 2019, helping launch the new collection of articles on <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/skills/\">impactful skills</a>, and authoring a recent newsletter on <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2024/01/forming-new-habits/\">how to build better habits</a>.</p><p>In addition, Niel helped the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/speak-with-us/\">1on1 team</a> nearly double the typical number of calls completed per year and aided in developing quantitative lead metrics to inform its decisions each week. And he\u2019s run organisation-wide projects, such as leading the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2023/03/80000-hours-two-year-review-2021-and-2022/\">two-year review for 2021 and 2022</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Niel was very forthcoming and candid with the committee about his weaknesses. His focus on getting frank feedback and using it to drive a self-improvement cycle really impressed the selection committee.</p><p>The committee considered three internal candidates for the CEO role, as well as dozens of other candidates suggested to us and dozens of others who applied for the position. In the end, we scored the top candidates on good judgement, inspiringness, social skills, leveraging people well, industriousness and drive, adaptability and resilience, commitment to the mission of 80,000 Hours, and deep understanding of the organisation.</p><p>Among other things, these scores were based on: input from 80,000 Hours directors on the organisation's general situation, staff surveys, 'take-home\u2019 work tests, and a self-assessment of their biggest successes and mistakes. We also consulted, among others, Michelle Hutchinson, the current director of the 1on1 programme, as well as former 80,000 Hours CEOs Howie Lempel and Ben Todd, for their views on the decision.</p><p>In the end Niel stood out to us as the person most likely to drive 80,000 Hours in the right direction.</p><p>We can\u2019t wait to see what he does in this new role and how 80,000 Hours pursues its vital mission in this new chapter.</p><p>Niel wanted to share the following message:</p><blockquote><p>I love 80,000 Hours, and I\u2019m thrilled and honoured to become CEO at this exciting time. I\u2019ve learned so much working here, and I\u2019m continually impressed by the dedication and the impact of the incredible team I get to work with. I am especially grateful for the admirable leadership of Brenton Mayer and look forward to building on this solid groundwork.</p><p>80,000 Hours has an impressive track record helping grow the community of people tackling some of the world\u2019s most pressing problems. In light of all the challenges we collectively face as we navigate this century, the world needs many more dedicated people matching their talents to high-impact careers. This is the core of 80,000 Hours\u2019 mission, and I can\u2019t wait to get to work!</p></blockquote><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "ni3LRwHm9CDa925tw", "title": "How Engineers can Contribute to Global Heath and Development", "postedAt": "2024-01-31T14:22:27.789Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Cross-posted from the </i><a href=\"https://www.highimpactengineers.org/global-health-and-development-engineering-charity\"><i>High Impact Engineers Resource Portal</i></a><i>.

These people struggle to feed, clothe, educate, and shelter themselves. Even a small increase in their income in absolute terms would significantly improve their quality of life.</p><p>These people also struggle to receive even basic medical treatment for cheaply alleviated illnesses. This causes a great deal of unnecessary suffering for them, their families and those in their community.</p><p>Poor public health can also have strong second order effects such as:</p><p>Reduced productivity and issues with employment due to physical or mental challenges.</p><p>Higher birth rates to compensate for infant mortality.</p><p>Reductions in educational attainment.</p><p>In this article, our primary focus will be on enhancing health and alleviating poverty in LMICs (low- and middle-income countries), as these outcomes have <a href=\"https://cadmus.eui.eu/bitstream/handle/1814/75004/Perspectives_on_the_history_of_global_development_2022.pdf?sequence=1\">long been viewed</a> and recognised as beneficial. There are other outcomes such as improving overall <a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/the-philosophy-of-wellbeing/\">wellbeing</a> and increasing <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1191/1464993402ps037ra\">freedoms</a> that are viewed as more fundamental by various academics in the development studies space but they are often more disputed, challenging to assess, and lack thorough examination of associated interventions.</p><h3>Biggest challenges in global health and development</h3><p>Some interventions in global health and development have been extremely successful and their positive effects are backed by extensive quantitative research. These interventions however often suffer from a lack of resources and specific skilled workers to scale up.</p><p>Various approaches have been taken to improve economic conditions for people living in poverty. Because of the complexity of the systems at play, good quality research on how to create long-term economic improvement is difficult to conduct. Recently evidence has emerged that <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/research-at-give-directly/\">direct cash transfers</a> and <a href=\"https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f192616.pdf\">universal basic income schemes</a> may be an especially efficient way of giving financial aid to poorer communities.</p><p>Organisations such as <a href=\"https://www.ewb-international.org/\">Engineers Without Borders</a>, <a href=\"https://www.africaosh.com/\">Open Source Hardware</a>, and <a href=\"https://bridgestoprosperity.org/\">Bridges to Prosperity</a> that take the approach of improving local infrastructure to facilitate better local facilities and spur economic growth may be especially of interest to engineers. Although sometimes their interventions are less rigorously evidence based, they <a href=\"https://www.ewb-international.org/activities/\">attempt to target interventions to the needs of poor communities</a> and much of their work has greatly helped those in need. The organisation <a href=\"https://bridgestoprosperity.org/\">Bridges to Prosperity</a> has even <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/bridges-to-prosperity-trailbridge-building-rwanda-may-2022\">received funding from GiveWell,</a> a charity evaluator well known for its rigorous evidence-based funding process, to evaluate their effectiveness.</p><p>Many of the most effective medical interventions do not require any advanced medical training to be administered, but are lacking skilled workers with other backgrounds. This includes interventions such as <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160322180901/https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/post/2015/12/bednets-have-prevented-450-million-cases-of-malaria/\">distributing malaria bed nets,</a> <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160310102925/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs378/en/\">vaccination programs,</a> <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160404172557/http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/gtbr2015_executive_summary.pdf\">tuberculosis treatment,</a> <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/deworm-world-initiative/August-2022-version\">distributing deworming medication</a> and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20160330070948/http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/mdg1/en/\">supplying clean drinking water.</a> Organisations working on these interventions often cite a lack of funding and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20211202092352/https://blog.givewell.org/2013/03/21/trying-and-failing-to-find-more-funding-gaps-for-delivering-proven-cost-effective-interventions/#:~:text=It%20often%20appears%20that%20the%20greatest%20obstacle%20to%20universal%20coverage%20is%20a%20logistical%20bottleneck%20rather%20than%20a%20simple%20lack%20of%20funding%20for%20more%20direct%20execution.\">logistics issues</a> as key bottlenecks, rather than a lack of medical expertise.</p><p>Economic growth is one of the <a href=\"https://www.indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:jcmt&amp;volume=4&amp;issue=4&amp;article=014\">main ways</a> to help people escape poverty through creating jobs. The <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/e32e2552-b75e-56de-9675-107cb047d078\">2001 World Development Report</a> analysed studies from Africa, Brazil, China, Costa Rica, and Indonesia, and showed that rapid economic growth lifted a large number of people out of financial poverty between 1970 and 2000. <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jors.12090\">Bhagwati and Panagariya</a> write that economic growth not only brings in more money for poverty alleviation programs but also allows governments to invest in essential needs like healthcare, education, and housing for the poor. As a result, starting new businesses and bringing investment into LMICs could be an effective way to help the poorest countries.</p><p><strong>Viewing suggestion: How to measure impact</strong></p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://youtu.be/G19EGR_bo7s\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G19EGR_bo7s\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><h2>How can engineers contribute to global health and development?</h2><h3>What are the bottlenecks?</h3><ul><li>Engineers with some background in logistics may be especially useful in distributing medical interventions, as this is cited as a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20211202092352/https://blog.givewell.org/2013/03/21/trying-and-failing-to-find-more-funding-gaps-for-delivering-proven-cost-effective-interventions/#:~:text=It%20often%20appears%20that%20the%20greatest%20obstacle%20to%20universal%20coverage%20is%20a%20logistical%20bottleneck%20rather%20than%20a%20simple%20lack%20of%20funding%20for%20more%20direct%20execution.\">key bottleneck</a> in many global health and development programs.</li><li>Engineers with strong analytical and research skills may be well-suited to the type of intervention effectiveness analysis done by GiveWell and similar charity evaluators and grant makers. These are some of the most high impact organisations in the field. They will publish research on the effectiveness of various interventions, directing investment and future development.</li><li>Many effective organisations in this space are primarily limited by funding, so donating to these effective organisations can be an extremely effective way to have a high impact. Those with experience in fundraising could help these organisations secure additional funds. As engineers often have quite high incomes, they could also have a high impact through donating much of their own earnings while seeking high-paying opportunities to grow the size of their donations. This is sometimes referred to as \u201cearning to give\u201d.</li><li>Collaboration, problem-solving, and analytical skills, as well as being results-orientated, make engineers especially well-placed to start a high-impact charity. Only a small number of nonprofits are founded based on rigorous evidence and research, and we need more effective charities to tackle these problems.

Though often not as evidence-based as other interventions, these organisations still do valuable work that meaningfully improves the lives of poor communities.</li><li>Engineers that are able to contribute to social enterprises in LMICs may be able to help accelerate economic growth.

For many engineers, this would require pursuing a relevant graduate degree to position themselves well for working in this field. Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/research-training-program?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">Research Training Program</a> could also be a good way to transition into this work.</li><li>Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/incubation-program\">Incubation Program</a> aims to launch new effective nonprofits that tackle these problems using rigorous evidence and research.</li><li>Joining social enterprises in LMICs may not be feasible for everyone, but it could be a transformative way to increase economic growth in the local community with all the associated positive knock-on effects.</li><li>If Earning to Give is your strategy, then it could be a good idea to somewhat optimise for working in a high-paying position or field, and invest some time into researching the most cost-effective ways to donate using resources like <a href=\"https://givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>. Another great resource is <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> and <a href=\"https://1fortheworld.org/\">One for the World</a>, where you can find others who are giving effectively and can help you to stay motivated. A great first step even if you aren\u2019t earning very much is signing the <a href=\"https://1fortheworld.org/take-the-pledge\">1% pledge</a>.</li></ul><h2>Risks, pitfalls, and things to keep in mind</h2><ul><li>While significantly more progress needs to be made in global health and development, there may be other cause areas that may be more pressing and undeserved. Depending on your background, you may have more impact taking actions to reduce future pandemics or reducing the suffering of animals, for example. This is worth keeping in mind, as global heath programs tend to be among the most well known charitable efforts, but other cause areas can be far more neglected.</li><li>There are many organisations in the broader global health and development field whose projects are not especially evidence based, which could result in little impact or even negative impact. Well-known examples of this include the infamous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundabout_PlayPump\">PlayPump</a>, although a lack of reliance on research and evidence based reasoning is common in the field. This should be kept in mind when deciding to work with an organisation. If finding an initial role in the field is proving difficult, it may be necessary to accept a role in a less effective organisation temporarily to build credibility and then move on to more effective work.</li><li>Even within the global health and development field, it may be more impactful to earn to give instead of directly working on these problems yourself. However, earning to give comes with its <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/earning-to-give/#common-objections-to-and-reasons-against-earning-to-give\">own set of risks</a>, such as taking high-earning careers that do a lot of harm. According to <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/earning-to-give/#should-you-earn-to-give\">80,000 Hours</a>, here are some signs you might currently be best suited to earning to give:<ul><li><strong>\u201cYou\u2019re a good fit for a higher-earning option.</strong></li><li><strong>You want to gain </strong><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/\"><strong>skills and career capital</strong></a><strong> in a higher-earning option</strong> to use in other impactful paths later and earning to give could help you to stay engaged with social impact while you do so.</li><li><strong>You\u2019re very uncertain about </strong><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/most-pressing-problems/\"><strong>which problems are most pressing</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Earning to give provides the most flexibility because you can easily change where you donate, or even save the money and give later. (Though many other paths are also highly flexible. If you become a great manager at a nonprofit focusing on biorisk, you can probably transfer that to organisation-building in climate change.)</li><li><strong>You want to contribute to an area that is more funding-constrained</strong> rather than <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-you-should-focus-more-on-talent-gaps-not-funding-gaps/\">talent

welfare: 1) hedonic states, i.e. pleasure and unpleasantness, 2) felt desires, both appetitive and aversive, 3) belief-like preferences, i.e. preferences as judgements or beliefs about value, and 4) choice-based preferences, i.e. what we choose or would choose. My key takeaways are the following:</p><ol><li>Belief-like preferences and choice-based preferences seem unlikely to be generally comparable, and even comparisons between humans can be problematic (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WmELKispJedFp7nSK/types-of-subjective-welfare#Choice_based_preferences\"><u>more</u></a>).</li><li>Hedonic states, felt desires and belief-like preferences all plausibly matter intrinsically, possibly together in a morally pluralistic theory, or unified as <i>subjective appearances of value or reasons</i> or even under belief-like preferences (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WmELKispJedFp7nSK/types-of-subjective-welfare#Moral_plurality_or_unification\"><u>more</u></a>).</li><li>Choice-based preferences seem not to matter much or at all intrinsically (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WmELKispJedFp7nSK/types-of-subjective-welfare#Do_choice_based_preferences_matter_\"><u>more</u></a>).</li><li>The types of welfare are dissociable, so measuring one in terms of another is likely to misweigh it relative to more intuitive direct standards and risks discounting plausible moral patients altogether (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WmELKispJedFp7nSK/types-of-subjective-welfare#Welfare_types_can_influence_each_other\"><u>more</u></a>).</li><li>There are multiple potentially important variations on the types of welfare (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WmELKispJedFp7nSK/types-of-subjective-welfare#Variations\"><u>more</u></a>).</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p>Thanks to Brian Tomasik, Derek Shiller and Bob Fischer for feedback.

In my view, the most promising approaches would be on the basis of the magnitudes of immediate and necessary cognitive or mental effects, causes or components of hedonic states. Other measures seem logically and intuitively dissociable (e.g. see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WmELKispJedFp7nSK/types-of-subjective-welfare#Dissociation_between_welfare_types\"><u>the section on dissociation below</u></a>) or incompatible with functionalism at the right level of abstraction (e.g. against using the absolute number of active neurons, see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aTWQq0gnTBdI69PbecH3oxc3Czk0Gh2faVhorIz6Zt0/edit\"><u>Mathers, 2022</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/why-neuron-counts-shouldnt-be-used-as-proxies-for-moral-weight\"><u>Shriver, 2022</u></a>).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Felt desires</h2><p><strong>Felt desires:</strong> desires we&nbsp;<i>feel</i>.

Motivational salience is also recruited for our everyday goals, drawing attention to relevant stimuli (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2022.03.001\"><u>Brown, 2022</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01647\"><u>Berridge, 2018</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xan0000090\"><u>Anselme &amp; Robinson, 2016</u></a> (<a href=\"https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/xan-xan0000090.pdf\"><u>pdf</u></a>)). It could even be that the&nbsp;<i>only</i> features common to all felt desires worthy of moral concern are just motivational salience and whatever it might depend on, and possibly consciousness in general. For example, hunger may just be the hunger-related perceptions and sensations, the motivational salience of food-related stimuli and/or of the hunger sensations themselves, and it's sometimes unpleasant.</p><p>Effects on attention and its control seem to be a promising basis for comparisons of the strengths of desires, intrapersonally and interpersonally: the more a desire pulls an individual\u2019s attention or resists top-down attention control, the stronger it is. Or, generally, the more attention paid to something \u2014 in particular what the individual believes is practically at stake \u2014 the more important it is. However, even these could turn out to be essentially individual-relative, e.g. relative to their maximum or nonzero minimum attention or awareness, which may have no basis for general comparison across individuals. Or, it may be meaningful to speak of the size of access consciousness, like the number or amount of sensations, with interpersonally comparable units. The space available in access consciousness is a limited and essential resource, and attention determines how it\u2019s used. On the other hand, it\u2019s not clear that or why desires would&nbsp;<i>feel</i> more intense because of more or richer&nbsp;<i>sensory</i> experience.</p><p>Like for hedonic states, the most promising approaches seem to be on the basis of the magnitudes of immediate and necessary cognitive or mental effects, causes or components of felt desires.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Belief-like preferences</h2><p><strong>Belief-like preferences:</strong> judgements or beliefs about subjective value, worth, need, desirability, good, bad, betterness or worseness.

Therefore, systems incapable of consciousness wouldn\u2019t have morally relevant welfare. Affect and motivational salience can apparently both be unconscious, so there are apparently unconscious versions of hedonic states and felt desires.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzd2t7wlzmfb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzd2t7wlzmfb\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Beliefs also often seem to be unconscious. They don\u2019t count unless they are or could be conscious.</p><p>Furthermore, it\u2019s not enough to just be aware or conscious of negative affect, say; it has to&nbsp;<i>consciously feel negative</i>. For example, I can be conscious of someone else\u2019s negative affect without it making me experience negative affect (although it may often do so, because of emotional empathy). Likewise, a system just being a conscious observer of&nbsp;<i>its own</i> negative affect doesn\u2019t make it feel bad. The same may go for motivational salience, too.</p><p>However, on some views, e.g. some highly graded illusionist accounts of consciousness or some panpsychist views, just having such states at all could be enough to establish at least some minimal consciousness and the states could&nbsp;<i>necessarily</i> be conscious in the right way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Moral plurality or unification</h1><p>Hedonic states, felt desires and belief-like preferences all plausibly ground some kind of moral value, perhaps even simultaneously within a pluralistic theory of (subjective) wellbeing. (Maybe also choice-based preferences, but I\u2019m more skeptical of their intrinsic value.) This is, however, probably a controversial position, and comes with substantial costs and challenges. I expect tradeoffs between the types of welfare to be impossible to ground intrapersonally in a satisfactory way, i.e. non-arbitrarily and in a way that respects my intuitions about how each type of welfare scales&nbsp;<i>in itself</i>. That seems pretty unsatisfying. However, each type of welfare seems to independently intrinsically matter to me, and discounting plausible moral patients \u2014 individuals with some types of welfare but not necessarily all \u2014 just because they\u2019re missing one or multiple other types seems far worse.</p><p>For example animals that experience suffering but have no belief-like preferences would matter to me. We can also imagine belief-like preferences (and choice-based preferences) without hedonic states or felt desires, as in the thought experiments of Phenumb (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00048409912349231\"><u>Carruthers, 1999</u></a>, also discussed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/2017-report-on-consciousness-and-moral-patienthood/#6132-the-phenumb-thought-experiment\"><u>Muehlhauser, 2017</u></a>, section 6.1.3.2) and philosophical Vulcans (<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/david-chalmers-nature-ethics-consciousness/\"><u>Chalmers et al., 2019</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://consc.net/reality/\"><u>Chalmers, 2022</u></a>, also discussed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/papq.12420\"><u>Roelofs, 2022</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/pq/pqab072\"><u>Birch, 2022</u></a>). Such beings could still&nbsp;<i>believe</i> things matter, even if they didn\u2019t&nbsp;<i>feel</i> like anything mattered. And they seem to matter to me, too. Not all of what seems to matter to us matters to us&nbsp;<i>directly</i> on the basis of feelings. Some things matter deductively, e.g. the logical implications of the reasons and principles we recognize. Some atypical humans (e.g. due to brain lesions or genetics) or future artificial intelligence could be like this.</p><p>Roelofs (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/papq.12420\"><u>2022</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.lukeroelofs.com/_files/ugd/d0fbbf_7106b90941fa49aeb7a35f5d20102c1e.pdf\"><u>ungated</u></a>) simultaneously captures hedonic states, felt desires and belief-like preferences together in <i>motivating consciousness</i>&nbsp;and grounds their value with <i>Motivational Sentientism</i>:</p><blockquote><p>The basic argument for Motivational Sentientism is that if a being has conscious states that motivate its actions, then it voluntarily acts for reasons provided by those states. This means it has reasons to act: subjective reasons, reasons as they appear from its perspective, and reasons which we as moral agents can take on vicariously as reasons for altruistic actions. Indeed, any being that is motivated to act could, it seems, sincerely appeal to us to help it: whatever it is motivated to do or bring about, it seems to make sense for us to empathise with that motivating conscious state, and for the being to ask us to do so if it understands this.</p></blockquote><p>Roelofs (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/papq.12420\"><u>2022</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.lukeroelofs.com/_files/ugd/d0fbbf_7106b90941fa49aeb7a35f5d20102c1e.pdf\"><u>ungated</u></a>) further elaborates on motivation itself:</p><blockquote><p>Finally, motivating consciousness should be suitable to motivate, but need not actually motivate. A desire that I never get the chance to act on is still a desire, and likewise a pain I cannot do anything about. In the extreme, this means that a being who felt pleasure and displeasure but had no capacity to act in any way (like the \u2018Weather Watchers\u2019 described by Strawson, 1994, p. 251 ff ) would count as having motivating consciousness, and thus moral status.</p></blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote><p>As I am using it, \u2018motivation\u2019 here does not mean anything merely causal or functional: motivation is a distinctively subjective, mental, process whereby some prospect seems \u2018attractive\u2019, some response \u2018makes sense\u2019, some action seems \u2018called for\u2019 from a subject\u2019s perspective. The point is not whether a given sort of conscious state does or does not cause some bodily movement, but whether it presents the subject with a subjective reason for acting.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref60wp7wat169\"><sup><a href=\"#fn60wp7wat169\">[13]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>In other words, it\u2019s the <i>subjective appearance of value or reasons</i>&nbsp;\u2014 or according to Roelofs, the \u201csubjective sense of better or worse\u201d or \u201csubjective goodness and badness\u201d \u2014 that matters, and this could come in the form of hedonic states, felt desires or belief-like preferences. Choice-based preferences are just voluntary acts guided by these reasons (and other processes).</p><p>Framed this way, it could also turn out to not be pluralistic at all: there could be just one broad type of subjective welfare, namely the subjective appearance of value or reasons, if there\u2019s a general enough account of it. Hedonic states, felt desires and belief-like preferences would just be special cases.</p><p>We might also take an individual with access to multiple of the types to be made up of distinct (but possibly interacting) moral patients, (at least) one for each type of welfare available to them, corresponding to the subsystems that realize them. Whether or not we actually do this, it can be instructive to think of them this way to highlight the separateness of the types of welfare or systems realizing them, potential disagreement between them and cases where we might otherwise inadvertently privilege one type of welfare or system over another.</p><p>Whether or not they turn out to be one type of welfare (but realized by different systems, say), I will continue to generally refer to them as different types of welfare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>More on unification</h2><p>Belief-like preferences may already be general enough to capture hedonic states and felt desires, using a broad enough account of belief or something similar or more general, like appearance. For example, if believing something is bad means representing it in some kind of negative light, being drawn away from it, motivated to stop or prevent it, or otherwise acting <i>as if</i>&nbsp;it\u2019s bad (see <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/\"><u>Schwitzgebel, 2023</u></a>, section 1 for various accounts of belief), then unpleasantness and aversive felt desires seem to do these<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn1j1mvq5zx\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn1j1mvq5zx\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and should qualify. Hedonic states and felt desires could also qualify as the recognition and application of <i>concepts of good and bad</i>.</p><p>It\u2019s also plausible to me that hedonic states <i>just</i>&nbsp;are hardwired or <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-47829-6_1596-1\"><u>cognitively impenetrable</u></a>&nbsp;belief-like preferences, as attitudes in attitudinal accounts (e.g. discussed in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/phpr.12558\"><u>Lin, 2020</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11098-020-01464-5\"><u>Pallies, 2021</u></a>) and representations of value in representationalist/evaluativist accounts (<a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315742205-4/evaluativist-accounts-pain-unpleasantness-david-bain\"><u>Bain, 2017</u></a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref17xjimrltri\"><sup><a href=\"#fn17xjimrltri\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This seems especially plausible under some moral interpretations of <i>illusionist</i>&nbsp;accounts of consciousness for which actual illusions (themselves beliefs or appearances) are what ground moral value, to which I\u2019m sympathetic.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuk6f91lxk2\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuk6f91lxk2\">[16]</a></sup></span></p><p>Felt desires and perhaps desires in general seem to in fact be at least partially attention-based (<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01647/full\"><u>Berridge, 2018</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8578406/\"><u>Kim et al., 2021</u></a>), so may not (just) be attitudes or representations, and whether or not they are attitudes or representations, they could matter (in part) because of how they affect attention. On the other hand, the way felt desires affect attention could just be a different way of being belief-like preferences, under a dispositionalist or interpretationist account of belief (described in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/\"><u>Schwitzgebel, 2023</u></a>, section 1). This could also match the more abstract attention-based theories of desire as described by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/desire/#AttBasTheDes\"><u>Schroeder, 2015</u></a>, section 1.4, according to which, say:</p><blockquote><p>For an organism to desire&nbsp;<i>p</i> is for it to be disposed to keep having its attention drawn to reasons to have&nbsp;<i>p</i>, or to reasons to avoid not-<i>p</i>.</p></blockquote><p>Others have defended desire-as-belief, desire-as-perception and generally desire-as-guise or desire-as-appearance of normative reasons, the good or what one ought to do.

In fact, if and because of the potential barriers to interpersonal comparisons of belief-like preferences, this unification could also end up counting&nbsp;<i>against</i> interpersonal comparisons of hedonic states and felt desires, at least across sufficiently different beings, if what matters about them is just what characterizes belief-like preferences or is common to all types of welfare in general.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Do choice-based preferences matter?</h2><p>There\u2019s a question here whether choice-based preferences should be considered a type of welfare at all and matter intrinsically, especially if we want to consider what choices a being practically incapable of choice&nbsp;<i>would</i> make if they were capable of choice, like Roelofs (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/papq.12420\"><u>2022</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lukeroelofs.com/_files/ugd/d0fbbf_7106b90941fa49aeb7a35f5d20102c1e.pdf\"><u>ungated</u></a>) does. Or, we could consider people with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locked-in_syndrome\"><u>locked-in syndrome</u></a>, who are almost entirely incapable of motor control and movement. My intuition is that their limited physical capacities have no bearing on how much things&nbsp;<i>can</i> matter to them if their other welfare ranges aren\u2019t limited (e.g. they can suffer just as intensely and have similar beliefs about what matters). So, either choice-based preferences add little or they shouldn\u2019t depend on the physical capacity to effect change in the world, e.g. they should be idealized in some way.</p><p>Choice-based preferences could just be&nbsp;<i>consequences</i> of the other types of welfare and other non-welfare processes.</p><p>However, if choice-based preferences don't matter, do we exclude plausible moral patients?</p><p>In my initial characterization of choice-based preferences, their most potentially distinctive properties seem to be voluntary choice, intentions or plans, or specifically conscious versions of these. It's not clear what else the reasons on the basis the choices are made could be other than hedonic states, felt desires or belief-like preferences.</p><p>So, imagine a conscious being that has no hedonic states, felt desires or belief-like preferences. To them, nothing feels good, bad, desirable or aversive, and they don\u2019t believe anything matters. Still, they imagine alternatives, make plans consciously, have conscious intentions, choose and follow through. They\u2019re conscious of their choices and how and why those choices are made as they are made, i.e. the cause of their choices, but these causes are not any kind of feeling or belief that makes that plan appear better or better justified to them.</p><p>Would there be something wrong with thwarting their plans? Do they actually care? Do they&nbsp;<i>act like something matters</i>, and is that enough for this being to matter? What exactly matters to them?</p><ol><li>The causes of their choices of which they\u2019re conscious? It seems not. If I were conscious of more of the details of how my brain worked as it did, those wouldn\u2019t necessarily feel important, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be inclined to believe they mattered intrinsically.</li><li>The choices, intentions or plans themselves? It\u2019s not clear why they would matter.</li><li>The objectives of their plans? What if there are no objectives? Maybe the mattering doesn\u2019t have to be&nbsp;<i>about</i> anything in particular,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefygy35mafwx\"><sup><a href=\"#fnygy35mafwx\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;just like it seems that we can directly stimulate pleasure or unpleasantness in brains.</li></ol><p>It\u2019s hard to see what exactly would matter to this being, if anything. So, I\u2019m inclined to say nothing does, or at least not much.</p><p>Heathwood (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/nous.12232\"><u>2019</u></a>) considers a similar thought experiment, but further allowing goals and choices on their basis:</p><blockquote><p>So what we need to imagine instead is a being who has goals, and can bring them about, but is in no way \u201cinvested\u201d in them. The achievement of their goals doesn\u2019t genuinely appeal to this being, or excite them to any degree. The being is simply disposed, like a machine, to coolly and detachedly bring them about. When the being wins its game of chess, it does so joylessly, with no enthusiasm or real interest. Nor is the being genuinely averse to losing the game of chess. The being will try to win, of course, but won\u2019t mind if it loses. It wins chess games the way Deep Blue, IBM\u2019s chess-playing computer, does, or the way Quinn\u2019s Radio Man turns on radios.</p><p>Once we see that this is how this being would have to be, it is no longer intuitive to say that the being benefits when it satisfies its merely behavioral desire to win the game. Just as winning holds no appeal for the being, losing doesn\u2019t bother it one bit. It seems to get nothing out of it either way. Thus I believe that on closer examination, this case\u2014similar as it is to the cases of Quinn\u2019s Radio Man and Parfit\u2019s drug addict\u2014in fact provides confirmation for the restriction to desires in the genuine-attraction sense rather than evidence against it.</p></blockquote><p>What separates this from Phenumb and philosophical Vulcans \u2014 or will by assumption here \u2014 is that this being doesn\u2019t actually believe its goals matter. On the other hand, does having a goal and acting to achieve it a kind of functionalist way of believing the goal matters, anyway? If so, then Heathwood's being could have belief-like preferences. Perhaps the distinction is just that Phenumb and philosophical Vulcans believe things matter in a more robust sense, but Heathwood\u2019s being still, at least in some minimal sense, also believes its goals matter. If that\u2019s the case, then Heathwood\u2019s being could still matter minimally.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Welfare types can influence each other</h1><p>All of these types of welfare can influence each other in humans. Hedonic states reinforce to give us felt desires, while continuous felt desire frustration can become unpleasant. Our feelings (hedonic states and felt desires) affect and inform our beliefs, e.g. we endorse what feels good and things to which we have appetitive desires, and we disapprove of what feels bad or things to which we have aversive desire. Our beliefs affect how we feel. Our beliefs and feelings affect and inform our choices. Our choices affect what we feel and believe, sometimes regardless of their effects on the world outside us, e.g. our feelings and beliefs about ourselves, like our identities or character, pride or shame.</p><p>However, there can still be substantial disagreement between the types of welfare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Dissociation between welfare types</h1><p>These types of welfare are generally pairwise dissociable in humans and other animals, at least experimentally. In other words, there could be one type of welfare without the other matching in sign or direction. For example, an addict may have strong felt desires for the thing to which they are addicted, but believe it would be better to stop and they may no longer experience much pleasure from it. Someone with motivational anhedonia may no longer be motivated \u2014 whether as felt desire or belief-like preference \u2014 by what they enjoy, even if they would still enjoy it. Felt desire (or \u2018wanting\u2019) is dissociable from pleasure (or \u2018liking\u2019) and belief-like preferences (or \u2018cognitive desires\u2019), according to <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.01647/full\"><u>Berridge, 2018</u></a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003030898-3\"><u>Baumgartner et al., 2021</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/trends/cognitive-sciences/fulltext/S1364-6613(23)00175-4\"><u>Berridge, 2023</u></a>. On the other hand, Shriver (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13164-013-0171-2\"><u>2014</u></a>, <a href=\"https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/50994/1/9783731511083.pdf#page=285\"><u>2021</u></a>) argues that unpleasantness and aversive desire are not dissociable in physical pain in humans and rats. However, even if this turns out to be the case, this wouldn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t dissociable in every possible moral patient or other unpleasant or aversive experiences.</p><p>These dissociations imply that measuring one type of welfare in terms of another \u2014 e.g. the strengths of desires or preferences on the basis of how much pleasure is derived from their satisfaction, or pleasure intensity on the basis of how much it is desired or preferred \u2014 can badly intuitively misweigh the type of welfare from its own lights. Another risk is entirely failing to count some moral patients who have one type but not the type used to measure, e.g. using belief-like preferences to measure if some beings with hedonic states have none (e.g. perhaps some nonhuman animals), or using hedonic states or felt desires to measure if some beings with belief-like preferences have none (e.g. some conceivable artificial consciousness).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Variations</h1><p>There are multiple variations or further classifications that can be applied across the types of welfare (not necessarily each variation to each type of welfare). I describe some potentially important distinctions here, on which our theories may depend.</p><p><strong>Occurrent</strong> \u2014 actively playing a role in our mental states or behaviour, and possibly but not necessarily conscious at the time \u2014 vs&nbsp;<strong>standing</strong> \u2014 implicit or dispositions, how we&nbsp;<i>would</i> respond (<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/desire/\"><u>Schroeder, 2015</u></a> and separately for beliefs,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/\"><u>Schwitzgebel, 2023</u></a>, sections 2.1 and 2.2).&nbsp; For example, if when you see a specific person, you would often feel attraction to them, then this could be a&nbsp;<i>standing felt desire</i>. It becomes occurrent when their appearance actually acts on your attention. Similarly, if you would often feel joy when you see someone, this could be like a&nbsp;<i>standing version of a hedonic state</i>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv9tmfpjkj4e\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv9tmfpjkj4e\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Moods could be unconscious but occurrent versions of hedonic states, as active dispositions to feel more or less pleasure and unpleasantness generally, e.g. anhedonia in depression. In contrast, hedonism is standardly only concerned with conscious hedonic states. Conscious states are always occurrent, but not all occurrent states are conscious.</p><p>If you&nbsp;<i>would</i> be asked about your life satisfaction or about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year\"><u>quality-adjusted life year</u></a> (QALY) tradeoffs, how you&nbsp;<i>would</i> (honestly) respond would be standing belief-like preferences. Beliefs and desires are occurrent when we act on them. For example, opening the fridge to get food for yourself indicates both a desire for food and belief that there is food in the fridge. In general, you know there\u2019s food in the fridge, even when it doesn\u2019t affect your behaviour, so it\u2019s typically standing. Beliefs are at least (indirectly) conscious when we represent them explicitly and consciously experience those representations, whether in thought, speech, writing or illustration.</p><p>I\u2019d expect standing versions of beliefs and desires to often be dispositional without actually being stored explicitly anywhere in the brain. For example, a person won\u2019t store any kind of representation of their life satisfaction until they judge it, and they won\u2019t revise those representations until they judge it again, even if it would be reasonable to say they would judge it differently now.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq9jfmwfcta\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq9jfmwfcta\">[19]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Still, these dispositions have to be realized in some way in the brain, e.g. based on their other beliefs that are in fact stored, the neural connections, various factors that influence the likelihood of a neuron firing, and so on.</p><p><strong>Intrinsic/terminal</strong>&nbsp;vs <strong>instrumental</strong>. For example, someone may want to succeed in school <i>to</i>&nbsp;become a doctor and help others, so this preference to succeed in school is (at least partially) instrumental, i.e. we satisfy it in order to satisfy other preferences from which it derives, like helping others. Intrinsic/terminal versions are not derived from others in this way. Generally, it seems people intrinsically prefer not to suffer severely, although they may also often have instrumental reasons to avoid suffering or avoid things that coincide with suffering, e.g. failure or the loss of loved ones.</p><p>Various hypothetical<i>&nbsp;</i><strong>idealizations</strong>&nbsp;like under full or with more information (about what options are available, about their consequences, about the state of the world, about reasons, etc.), after training or practice, or to satisfy certain norms of (epistemic or instrumental) rationality.</p><p>For choice-based preferences in particular, if it\u2019s the decisions or intentions themselves that matter and we want to attribute such preferences to individuals with limited physical capacities to pursue options, like in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locked-in_syndrome\"><u>locked-in syndrome</u></a>, without severely limiting the welfare ranges of such individuals relative to typically abled adult humans, we may need to idealize to hypothetical choices under situations in which the individual has greater capacities for actually choosing. For example, a machine that reads brain signals or eye movements under their conscious control, or what they would do if they had typical motor control. And even typically abled adult humans are limited in their capacities and care (or would care) about more than they can control in practice.</p><p><strong>Personal</strong>&nbsp;vs <strong>non-personal</strong>&nbsp;or <strong>other-regarding</strong>, although the distinction may be somewhat artificial, given indirectly other-regarding personal desires, like being a successful parent (<a href=\"https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil1100/Parfit1.pdf\"><u>Parfit, 1984</u></a>).</p><p><strong>Local</strong>&nbsp;\u2014 about a specific thing, like just about your job in general, your current project, that a meeting goes well, or scoring that goal in a soccer match \u2014 vs <strong>global</strong>&nbsp;\u2014 about their life <i>as a whole</i>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil1100/Parfit1.pdf\"><u>Parfit, 1984</u></a>) like life satisfaction (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/life-satisfaction-and-its-discontents/\"><u>Plant, 2020</u></a>), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year\"><u>quality-adjusted life years</u></a>&nbsp;(QALYs), and generalizations of QALYs to include extrinsic goals (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1287/deca.1060.0082\"><u>Hazen, 2007</u></a>), or other preferences about the state of the world as a whole or all-things-considered, like an individual's moral beliefs, their utility function or preferences over outcomes, prospects or actions. Life satisfaction and QALYs are most naturally interpreted as global <i>belief-like</i>&nbsp;preferences, but we can also consider global versions of other types of welfare, like your emotional reactions \u2014 hedonic states or felt desires \u2014 to imagery or descriptions of your life so far or possible futures, or the choices you\u2019ve made or would make between futures on choice-based preferences.</p><p>Parfit (<a href=\"https://rintintin.colorado.edu/~vancecd/phil1100/Parfit1.pdf\"><u>1984</u></a>) motivated global preferences with the following example:</p><blockquote><p>I shall inject you with an addictive drug. From now on, you will wake each morning with an extremely strong desire to have another injection of this drug. Having this desire will be in itself neither pleasant nor painful, but if the desire is not fulfilled within an hour it will then become very painful. This is no cause for concern, since I shall give you ample supplies of this drug. Every morning, you will be able at once to fulfil this desire. The injection, and its aftereffects, would also be neither pleasant nor painful. You will spend the rest of your days as you do now.</p></blockquote><p>If desire satisfaction is good and its value sums within an individual (or we might assume it\u2019s also or instead pleasurable), then this seems very good and could even outweigh your life being much worse in other ways. However, I\u2019d guess many people would judge such a life as worse overall, and I\u2019m inclined to let people decide for themselves and respect their judgements either way. The alternative seems alienating and paternalistic. Those judgements \u2014 how people decide for themselves \u2014 are global preferences.</p><p>Even if we use global preferences to avoid alienation, it also matters how exactly we use them, in case they can be changed or replaced.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5s3l1nc6b4h\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5s3l1nc6b4h\">[20]</a></sup></span></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnup1gplgm3wg\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefup1gplgm3wg\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Including possibly the relationships between those perspectives or mental states and the world, e.g. that things actually go as someone prefers, not just that they believe things are going as they prefer, as in the experience machine thought experiment (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_machine\"><u>Wikipedia</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iep.utm.edu/experience-machine/\"><u>Buscicchi, 2014</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/02/14/contact-with-reality\"><u>Carlsmith, 2021</u></a>).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnpljbqakcubm\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefpljbqakcubm\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I use \u2018preference\u2019 over \u2018desire\u2019 for belief-like and choice-based preferences, because desire typically has connotations of being directed towards (or away from, e.g. aversive) specific objects or features (or states of affairs), but preferences can also just be comparative or pairwise (<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/desire\"><u>Schroeder, 2015</u></a>, sections 2.1 and 3.3), so are more general.

People are sometimes aware of incentive salience as a product but never of the underlying process. And without an extra cognitive monitoring step, they may not even be always aware of the product. Sometimes incentive salience can be triggered and can control behavior with very little awareness of what has happened.

So, you must mention Project for Awesome in the video itself, and it should have been created recently.</li><li>You should put reasonable effort into making sure any information you include in your video is accurate, from anecdotal examples to statistics. There\u2019s a lot of misinformation on the internet, so we want to make sure that P4A videos are providing thoughtful, accurate context about the work that organizations are doing in the world.</li><li>Try not to make your video too long. People are going to be watching a ton of videos during P4A, and no one wants to sit through a rambly, unedited vlog for ten minutes. Keep your video short and to the point so that people will watch the whole thing and learn all about your cause. A good length to aim for is 2-4 minutes, unless you have such compelling content that it just needs to be longer.</li><li>Try not to spend too much time explaining what the Project for Awesome is. Most people watching your video will already know, so just mentioning it briefly and directing people to the website is plenty. An explanation in the description as well as a link to projectforawesome.com is also a great addition so people who stumble across your video can learn more about us.</li><li>Similarly, try not to spend too much time promoting your own channel in your video. One or two sentences is fine to explain the type of videos you usually make if they\u2019re different from what you\u2019re doing for your P4A video, but much more than that and it just looks like you\u2019re using the P4A to help promote yourself, which isn\u2019t what this is all about.</li><li>Please include a content warning at the beginning of your video if you\u2019re discussing sensitive topics such as (but not limited to) violence, self-harm, miscarriage, or death. While there are charities doing great work in very difficult spaces, our goal is to help our community members emotionally prepare and make the choice to watch a video rather than being surprised by potentially traumatic content.</li></ol></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "EA_ProjectForAwesome"}}, {"_id": "ABGL4FRGzfEcAxg26", "title": "Explaining Impact Markets", "postedAt": "2024-01-31T09:48:08.003Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a billionaire.

If not, not.</p><p>If you squint, you could replace \"flibbleflop\" with highly capable LLMs, quantum computers, or any number of cool and potentially lucrative technologies. But if you stop squinting, and instead add the adjective \"altruistic\" before \"billionaire,\" you could replace \u201cflibbleflop\u201d with \u201cmalaria vaccine.\" Let's see what happens:</p><blockquote><p>Make a working malaria vaccine \u2014 $1 billion.</p></blockquote><p>There begins a global effort to build working malaria vaccines, and you see some teams of brilliant people starting to work on vaccine engineering. But it doesn\u2019t take long for you to notice that the teams keep running into one specific problem: they need money to start (buy lab equipment, hire researchers, etc), money they don\u2019t have.</p><p>So, what should they do?</p><p>Obviously, the people who want to build the vaccine should go and pitch to investors. They should offer investors a chunk of their prize money if they end up winning, in exchange for cold hard cash right now to get started building. If the investors think that the team is likely to build a successful malaria vaccine and win the billion dollar prize, they should invest. If not, not.</p><p>The <i>prize</i> part of this is how a lot of philanthropy is done. An altruistic billionaire notices a problem and makes a prize for the solution. But the <i>investing</i> part of it is pretty unique, and doesn\u2019t happen too often.</p><p>Why is this whole setup good? Why would you want the investing thing on the side? Mostly, because it resolves the problem that some teams will be wonderfully capable but horribly underfunded. In exchange for a chunk of their (possible) future winnings, they get to be both wonderfully capable <i>and</i> wonderfully funded. This is how it already works for AI or quantum computing or any other potentially lucrative tech that has high barriers to entry; we can solve the same problem in the same way for the things that altruistic billionaires care about, too.</p><p>But backing up a bit, why would an altruistic billionaire want to do this as a prize in the first place? Why not use grants, like how most philanthropy works?</p><ol><li>Prizes reward results, not promises. With a prize, you know for a fact that you\u2019re getting what you paid for; when you hand out grants, you get a boatload of promises and <i>sometimes</i> results.</li><li>The investors care a lot about not losing their money. They\u2019re also very good at picking which teams are going to win \u2014 after all, investors only get rewarded for picking good teams if the teams end up winning.</li><li>The issue of figuring out which people are best to work on a problem is totally different from the issue of figuring out which problems to solve. Using a prize system means that you, as a lazy-but-altruistic billionaire, don\u2019t have to solve both issues \u2014 just the second one. Investors do the work of figuring out who the good teams are; you just need to figure out what problems they should solve.</li></ol><p>If you do this often enough \u2014 set up prizes for solutions to problems you care about, then let people build those solutions and get the prizes \u2014 you can start making prizes for more and more things, with investors who profit from picking the right teams to work on the right problems. You can also get more and more vague, expecting that teams (and investors) will figure out your preferences as they go. And in the extreme, you can just say \u201cmake stuff I value, and I\u2019ll give you a prize to the extent that I value it.\u201d When those things that you\u2019re giving out prizes for are valuable to just you, people call it \u201ccapitalism.\u201d When the things you\u2019re giving out prizes for are valuable for the world, we call it an \u201cimpact market.\u201d</p><p>An impact market looks like a marketplace of philanthropies giving out prizes for the completion of huge, successful, altruistic projects, with investors picking and choosing the best teams for the world\u2019s problems. Impact markets are <i>awesome</i>.</p><hr><p>These are <a href=\"https://www.brasstacks.blog/lc-im/\"><u>not my original ideas</u></a>. However, every single other writeup of these ideas I\u2019ve ever encountered is filled with bizarre jargon that make the ideas unnecessarily difficult to understand.</p><p>Note: my explanation of when an investor invests isn\u2019t <i>exactly</i> accurate, but it\u2019s close enough for a simple explanation. In reality, investors will choose to invest if they think that [the probability that the team will win multiplied by the share of the winnings the investors would get if the team won] is sufficiently higher than [the amount of cold hard cash the team needs to get started]; what \u201csufficiently\u201d means in this context depends on what other possible ways the investors could invest their money. For example, let\u2019s say the investor thinks there\u2019s a 10% chance that the team wins; the team promised the investors $500mm of the total $1bn prize if they win; and the team needs $40mm to get started. In this case, the investors expect to make $50mm in revenue (10% probability of success multiplied by $500mm if the team wins) with an initial investment of $40mm. That\u2019s a 25% return on their investment, which is traditionally considered pretty great. However, if the investor has another opportunity that they expect to make 30% on, then it\u2019s not going to be sufficiently great.</p>", "user": {"username": "Saul"}}, {"_id": "Rs9uZnx7ckfMMti3k", "title": "Musk's Questionable Existential Risk Rhetoric Amidst Legal Challenges", "postedAt": "2024-01-31T07:40:40.248Z", "htmlBody": "<p>A recent tweet by Internal Tech Emails shared an email from Elon Musk discussing a compensation package, with Musk citing the mitigation of existential risk through Mars colonization as a reason for the package's structure</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:57.94%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rs9uZnx7ckfMMti3k/ydiz5rjpksyf3vlwyxr2\" alt=\"Image\"></figure><p>Source: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1752460340435325021\">This tweet</a> from Internal Tech Emails [@TechEmails] on Twitter, pulling from Richard J.

IAA has already done great work in starting to create such a knowledge hub.</li><li>I see this project as a very big challenge, both technical - what platform/s to choose and how to customize and build them, and social - how to get people to use, enjoy and benefit from it.</li><li>In this article, I lay down a very general vision for what such a system could look like.</li><li>Call to action: If this sounds interesting to you, you can read and comment on this post, so we can further discuss these suggestions and possibilities. You are also welcome to reach out to me at ronen@sentientworld.org. We have a Slack channel dedicated to this topic.</li></ul><h3><strong>Epistemic status &amp; about me</strong></h3><p>I am quite confident in the potential of a movement-centric knowledge hub that integrates with existing community interactions, rather than existing as a standalone repository. My interactions with advocates over the years have strongly emphasized the necessity for such a hub. Nevertheless, I am unsure about the extent of the hub's success, determining the impact it might have, identifying the optimal range of knowledge areas and services to include, choosing the most suitable platform for our community's needs, and devising practical strategies for implementation.</p><p>I am especially unsure about where the whole knowledge management field is headed. With the AI revolution progressing, this uncertainty makes it harder for me to predict and understand the future desired features and needs of such a knowledge hub, serving the animal advocacy movement.</p><p>My name is Ronen Bar, and I have been an animal advocate for the past 15 years. My experience in developing knowledge spaces for activists is limited; however, I have been contemplating the idea of a knowledge hub for many years. Most of my activism during the last years was around undercover investigations, customizing <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sentientforall/posts/pfbid0Lc4n15yS9YVmRHJndG4Uec6Zrxzvt9omv5Gtsd5kpf1WojxMeW56kGUWM2AhSx1il\">tools</a> for advocates, and promoting alternative proteins. I currently manage&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sentientworld.org/\"><u>Sentient</u></a>, a non-profit for animals.</p><h3><strong>Perspective of a Newcomer</strong></h3><p><strong>\"Humans dominate the planet because they are the only species capable of cooperating both flexibly and in large numbers.\"</strong> - Yuval Noah Harari, Historian</p><p>Imagine a Filipino animal lover (hypothetically speaking) named Antonio who is eager to join the animal advocacy movement. Has the movement rolled out a \u201cred carpet\u201d for newcomers like him? Is there easy access to information and knowledge, connections with fellow activists, opportunities for online learning, and possibilities for physical engagement, such as attending international events or local meetings? Does this community foster a culture of mutual empowerment?</p><p>Consider a scenario where Antonio wants to start engaging in social media advocacy, direct action, or vegan culinary initiatives. Where does he begin? Perhaps he has some local contacts, or he might turn to Google or chatbots for guidance, but what he often encounters is a chaotic experience. There are so many different websites and data sources, and he will likely find it hard to get his head straight. His effort will probably be somewhat limited to searching in languages he knows. Moreover, most of the relevant data is not online. Think about your own ideas, conclusions, lists, or mistakes. Are they easily available to Antonio? Will he be able to find and grow from your personal knowledge?</p><p>What about an advocate searching for candidates, partners, volunteers, or advisors? There are profiles of animal advocates on Slack, Discord, LinkedIn, Airtable, Facebook, vegan job boards, and more. Most of them are unstructured lists without the ability to search for specifics or to know if those people are interested in being contacted and for what purpose (e.g., \"I am a low-code and automation specialist who wants to be contacted about low-paid or volunteer advising, or anything that can help animals on a macro level\").</p><p>The animal advocacy community has several resources, but many are underutilized, scattered, and unknown to most. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://data.mercyforanimals.org/\"><u>FAOI - Mercy For Animals Data</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/\"><u>Faunalytics</u></a>,<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/research-reports\">&nbsp;<u>The Humane League</u></a> and others who are doing research</li><li>Funding opportunities lists such as<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/funding\">&nbsp;<u>this</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1srlbEZj7aqo45JTzMZpusl547Z-PBVGOIrECrFdHYXE/edit#gid=0\"><u>this</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://vegancheatsheet.org/\"><u>Vegan cheat sheet</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://veganhacktivists.org/playground\"><u>Playground</u></a> - volunteer or paid opportunities to help the animals</li><li><a href=\"https://www.katlove.com/vegan-therapists\"><u>Vegan therapists</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.aiforanimals.org/\"><u>AI for Animals</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://veganhacktivists.org/\"><u>Vegan Hacktivists</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://veganjobs.com/\"><u>Vegan Jobs</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://provegincubator.com/kickstartingforgood/\"><u>Kickstarter for good</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.animalwelfarelibrary.org/\"><u>Animal Welfare Library</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://connectforanimals.com\"><u>Connect For Animals</u></a></li></ul><p><strong>Our information, knowledge, profiles, and ideas are scattered. A centralized hub is essential.</strong></p><h3><strong>Low Floor, High Ceiling</strong></h3><p>The concept of \"low floor, high ceiling\" in the startup world refers to a state where a product or service is accessible enough for beginners (low floor) but simultaneously offers substantial growth and sophistication for experts (high ceiling). For the animal advocacy movement, this means providing an environment that nurtures activism at all levels, from novices to seasoned, a community that enhances activists with ideas, skills, know-how, partners, inspirations, funding, possible directions, and much more.</p><p>Let\u2019s say a veteran advocate is looking to start a campaign against intensive pig farming in her country. She wants to see what was done in other countries, get inspiration from demos and street outreach on this topic, speak with fellow campaigners in other areas to learn from successes and mistakes, and see the most viral relevant social media posts. To gather this information, she might turn to Google and AI tools, but this approach is challenging and time-consuming due to the fact that we don\u2019t have a centralized knowledge platform and we lack a strong culture of knowledge sharing, a culture where activists ask themselves questions like \u201chow much time did I spend this month contributing to the community?\u201d, whether it is through sharing knowledge, communicating with other activists, or mentoring. I see such a culture as a crucial component in the movement's growth.</p><h3><strong>The Importance of Our Knowledge Management System</strong></h3><p>\"We don't rise to the highest version of ourselves that we can imagine but fall to the level of our systems\".&nbsp;<i>August Bradley</i></p><p>Over the last few years, I used various knowledge management systems and didn't know what I was missing until I discovered better options. It's not that I knew they lacked features that could enhance my work; I just didn't realize what those features were! Foremost among these is the ability to resurface any data from across the platform at any place and any time, and to create custom functionalities (I now use <a href=\"https://coda.io/\">Coda</a>, which I find to be the most flexible platform. It is similar to <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a> but has much more functionality). Sometimes, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got until you see something better. The system we have acts like a ceiling, capping our growth. Therefore, <strong>the connections between our collective, different ideas and insights are nowhere near reaching their potential synergy</strong>. We need to organize our knowledge, so we can stand on the shoulders of ourselves and the whole community.</p><h3><strong>Diversity and Homogeneity</strong></h3><p>So, the animal advocacy community have Slack groups, Discord groups, Signal groups, WhatsApp groups, Facebook groups, and documents in Notion, Airtable, Google Docs, and more. Isn\u2019t that good? Aren\u2019t we taking the best from all these diverse platforms? Yes and no. Having many platforms means you have to get used to multiple interfaces, and that can be a big barrier for some people. It also makes searching for content, verifying it, and separating the wheat from the chaff very difficult. On the other hand, we are using the idiosyncratic features of each platform and picking the most suitable ones ad hoc.</p><p><strong>I argue that the logical thing to do is to have one main knowledge hub</strong>, with many more specific ones that are mentioned or linked from the main one, optimally having data that is at least partially synchronized to the main hub. So, you keep the info in the hub, and advocates present some of it (filtered, sorted, reordered, edited, shortened, whatever) in any way they want in multiple variations on different websites according to their needs. Hence, you don\u2019t need to keep updating multiple websites and databases which overlap in some items. There should always be exceptions, maybe many of them, and that is good, but the default place to store community ideas, knowledge, and conclusions one wishes to share to empower others is the central hub. This is a concept of one shared knowledge space, not one website or one view. Contrary to what one may think, this project has the potential to enhance diversity, different opinions, and ways to see and interpret the data. Our goal is not to uniform us all, but to open our eyes to more possibilities as we progress in different directions simultaneously as a diverse, non-dogmatic social change movement.</p><h3><strong>How is a Good Knowledge System Built?</strong></h3><p>For the most complicated and non-trivial tasks in my activism, I bring together all the knowledge that can fasten, ease, inspire, and refine the work, from across my knowledge system. How did I build this text page? I included the following:</p><ul><li>A filtered view of HR list for relevant people to send this document to for feedback.</li><li>Past notes about a knowledge hub for the animal advocacy movement.</li><li>Notes I wrote on the topics of knowledge management, community, and technology, including relevant quotes.</li><li>Examples of animal advocacy community resources that I encountered, used, and saved.</li><li>Phrases and words I created surrounding relevant topics for this text.</li><li>AI tools list that could help me fine-tune and improve this text.</li><li>And some more.</li></ul><p>If I were working in a system of silos, where every piece of knowledge only lives in one place, I would need to go back and forth between many pages (and possibly different apps) to find all this data. But in systems like Notion, Obsidian, or Coda, where data lives and syncs across multiple digital locations, one can quickly bring everything he needs to the page he is working on.</p><p><strong>The intersectionality of knowledge is very important for empowering cognition, bringing together different data from different fields into one place</strong>, e.g., a dataset of action ideas in the space of AI combined with a dataset on animal-friendly politicians can yield interesting options. The animal advocacy knowledge hub needs to be a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmtrecsGa9Q&amp;ab_channel=KeepProductive\">&nbsp;<u>mind garden</u></a>, where different branches of trees are combined to create new plants and fruits. The following are my general thoughts about building a good knowledge system.</p><p><strong>In a good system, you can:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Access</strong> all knowledge quickly, in various sized chunks - from full articles to paragraphs about certain topics.</li><li><strong>Reconstruct</strong> data combinations from an incrementally growing pool of knowledge, including editing, filtering, sorting, copying, and creating different versions of the data.</li><li><strong>Connect</strong> between different pieces of data.</li><li><strong>Distribute</strong> any piece of data to multiple storage locations.</li><li><strong>Personalize</strong>, such as the ability to save data items of interest and lists that grow as the movement's knowledge grows.</li><li>Implement&nbsp;<strong>Automations</strong>.</li><li>Experience&nbsp;<strong>Emergent properties</strong> and creativity enhancement.</li></ul><p>The data should be reliable and honest, sharing stories of both successes and&nbsp;<strong>failures</strong>, which, in my opinion, are bluntly underappreciated. In many cases, failure stories are more important than success stories. Where can I find some stories of failed vegan projects online?...</p><h3><strong>The Relevance of an Information Hub in a World Increasingly Dominated by AI</strong></h3><p>If a future AI can access all information online and, on demand, filter, evaluate, standardize, curate, and present it in a form that suits your immediate needs, why do we need an animal advocacy community knowledge hub, or any well-thought-out knowledge management system? This question is very important and hard to answer. Here are some thoughts about the advantages of a good system in an AI world:</p><ul><li>It fosters a&nbsp;<strong>culture of inputting knowledge</strong> that would otherwise not be uploaded online.<ul><li>13 years ago, I went to supermarkets and placed a letter from a battery cage chicken in egg cartons. Not a big revolution, but most egg consumers got to see the letter when opening the carton in their home kitchens, a quite intriguing and novel arena for outreach. Whether it was good or stupid, nobody knows about this deed, and about most of the wonderful stuff you did, because it was never put online in an organized and standardized way for the community.</li><li>Nevertheless, you might say, 'OK, just dump it somewhere online and a future AI will find it,' right? Practically, I don\u2019t think it will work, since advocates won't put it somewhere without a system that facilitates and promotes such action; online dumping will not create a culture of knowledge sharing, but a knowledge hub will.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Standardizing the input of knowledge</strong> helps activists see options they hadn\u2019t thought about, highlighting possibilities they weren't looking for. The way we categorize and map animal advocacy can inspire new ideas.</li><li><strong>Human resources:</strong> I\u2019m not sure if an AI will have access to social media and be able to find relevant people for, as a hypothetical example, my new non-profit 'The Vegan Capitalist', which promotes ending the slaughter of animals through means such as pension plans investing in animal-friendly industries or urging investors to boycott harmful companies. Even if the AI has access to social media accounts and can recommend relevant people, without standardized activist profiles, how will I know if a particular advocate &nbsp;wants to receive unsolicited requests for cooperation on the subject at hand? How will I get the most relevant information about those people, deliberately structured for this purpose in a community knowledge hub?</li><li>Perhaps a future knowledge hub will aggregate good data to present you with&nbsp;<strong>the most relevant content for you</strong> in a feed. Also, it will not have the ulterior motives that ad-based social media platforms have.</li></ul><p><strong><u>\u25b6\u25b6 Any good system will have&nbsp;AI built into it</u></strong><u>.</u></p><h3><strong>Practical Suggestions</strong></h3><p>The endeavor I am advocating for can be a very wide-ranging project or a much simpler and easier one. It's possible that such a platform, let's call it 'AnimaList' (or 'Changers'), could be achieved (to a certain extent) by combining current animal advocate resources to a Coda workspace. It could also start with a simpler pilot project. I write down a few points I find crucial for such a hub to gain initial traction and influence:</p><ul><li>The hub is regularly linked inside group chats of activists, when it contains relevant information to the conversation.</li><li>Advocates are encouraged to add data \u2013 ideas, technical info, conclusions from experience, etc. \u2013 to the platform.</li><li>The data is organized in tables.</li><li>The hub is accessible to all without having to sign in.</li><li>Data is presented in a graphic way with pictures, videos, etc.</li><li>Advocates can see combinations of data from different topics on the same page, as they choose.</li><li>Advocates can easily add data to the platform.</li><li>AI features are added to the platform.</li></ul><h3><strong>Long-term Vision</strong></h3><p>Ideally, the hub will be hosted on a single platform that includes three pillars: a knowledge base (Coda or Notion style), a chat (Slack style), and a feed (resembling Facebook or Instagram). This platform will be based on a website presenting activities and activists from all over the world.</p><ul><li>The knowledge base will map existing and potential activities (ideas) into categories and tags. It will connect advocates eager to execute these ideas and looking for partners, and will include a section for inspiration from other social justice struggles. The activists managing the hub should be well-connected with the organizations to help identify opportunities for learning and cooperation. The hub will sync (with permission) information from various existing animal advocacy resources and map its own new data, using inputs from activists around the world and the platform\u2019s workers &amp; volunteers. The hub will be translated into other languages using AI to ensure universal access to the information.<ul><li>Examples of using the knowledge hub:<ul><li>A veteran venture capital professional who has turned vegan wants to know what kinds of economic activities for animals, utilizing his skills, are taking place in Canada.</li><li>Someone wants to start a campaign against dairy in Ireland. They search AnimaList's website for the 'dairy' tag and find various activities related to this subject. They come across a \u201csilence\u201d tag in the hub and discover James Aspey's 365 days of silence, Israel's Animal Liberation Front's 'Thundering Silence' demonstration, and more inspiring ideas, leading them to execute a campaign combining silence and the dairy industry.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Chats will be placed in context and integrated with the knowledge hub.</li><li>News feeds will be tailored to the advocates based on the information gathered when they use the platform and their personal customizations. Unlike social media, this platform's simple algorithm for the feed can be transparent and directly altered by the end user.</li></ul><p>The hub will combine consolidated information, structured and tagged data in the knowledge hub, with unstructured data in chats. It will be a place where new animal advocacy terms can be created, in-depth interviews and articles are posted, and where synergy is dominant.</p><h3><strong>The Challenge of Creating a Widely Used Hub is HUGE</strong></h3><p>I perceive the creation of such a knowledge platform as, first and foremost, a social challenge. Ultimately, no platform will be utilized if it feels like a disconnected archive. To integrate it into the fabric of daily life, the data must \u201clive\u201d and become an integral part of chats, emails, online presentations, meetings, and much more.</p><h3><strong>Some Possible Advantages and Disadvantages</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Advantages</strong><ul><li>Enhances knowledge and connectivity.</li><li>Helps newcomers integrate into the movement.</li><li>Enhances collaboration and fosters new relationships.</li><li>Initiates a culture of advocates that \u201ccommunitize\u201d knowledge, meaning sharing it in a structured, lasting manner. Activists could view their actions, even small local things, in a wider perspective: can the knowledge I acquired help the community?</li><li>Complements other efforts to strengthen the community, such as conferences and virtual meetings.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Disadvantages and Challenges</strong><ul><li>Challenging to execute and encourage regular use.</li><li>Labor-intensive, requiring significant effort in inputting data, sorting, curating, and tagging, among other tasks.</li><li>A hub can potentially become a place where infighting between individuals or groups is exacerbated.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Final Words</strong></h3><p>The ultimate goal of this potential project is to elevate the animal advocacy movement, aiming for a significant portion of advocates to be empowered by the knowledge hub platform. This initiative seeks to promote flexible cooperation on a large scale, increase effectiveness, foster community solidarity, and encourage financial growth. It focuses our efforts on the most crucial group for the animals - the activists, the 'elite unit' whose performance is a key factor influencing the global state of animal welfare.</p><p>I believe that a knowledge hub vision can be a natural extension of the IAA initiative, as IAA already has a vibrant Slack group and is actively mapping resources, events, fundraising opportunities, and more.</p><p>Humans dominate the planet because of their ability to cooperate flexibly and in vast numbers. If we want to exert more influence over human actions, we need to work in a much more flexible manner. This means that an idea from an advocate in Ghana could lead to a career change for an advocate in Denmark, though they may never have met or spoken, even online. For such connections and collaborations to happen effectively, a robust knowledge hub is essential.</p>", "user": {"username": "Ronen Bar"}}, {"_id": "m73rJpKs476zc52xz", "title": "The Intergovernmental Panel On Global Catastrophic Risks (IPGCR)", "postedAt": "2024-02-01T17:36:21.245Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Summary</h1><p>This post motivates and describes a potential International Panel on Global Catastrophic Risks (IPGCR). The IPGCR will focus only on GCRs: risks that could cause a global collapse of human civilization or human extinction. The IPGCR seeks to fit an important and currently unoccupied niche: an international expert organization whose only purview is to produce expert reports and summaries for the international community on risks that could cause a global collapse of human civilization or human extinction. The IPGCR will produce reports across scientific and technical domains, and it will focus on the ways in which risks may intersect and interact. This will aid policymakers in constructing&nbsp;policy that coordinates and prioritizes responses to different threats, and minimizes the chance that any GCR occurs, regardless of its origin. The IPGCR will work in some areas where there is more consensus among experts and some areas where there is less consensus. Unlike consensus-seeking organizations like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the IPGCR will not necessarily seek consensus. Instead, it will seek to accurately convey areas of consensus, disagreement, and uncertainty among experts. The IPGCR will draw on leadership and expertise from around the world and across levels of economic development to ensure that it promotes the interests of all humanity in helping to avoid and mitigate potential global catastrophes.</p><p>You can chat with the post here: <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-g4Zpem9PL-chat-with-ipgcr\">Chat with IPGCR</a> (although let me know if this GPT seems unaligned with this post as you chat with it).&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>1. Introduction and Rationale</strong></h1><p>Global catastrophic risks (GCRs) are <i>risks that could cause a global collapse of human civilization or human extinction&nbsp;</i>(Bostrom 2013, Bostrom &amp; Cirkovic 2011, Posner 2004). Addressing these risks requires good policy, which requires a good understanding of the risks and options for mitigating them. However, primary research is not enough: policymakers must be informed by objective summaries of the existing scholarship and expert-assessed policy options.&nbsp;</p><p>This post proposes the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Global Catastrophic Risks (IPGCR). The IPGCR is an international organization that synthesizes scientific understanding and makes policy recommendations related to global catastrophic risks. The IPGCR will report on the scientific, technological, and socioeconomic bases of GCRs, the potential impacts of GCRs, and options for the avoidance and mitigation of GCRs.</p><p>The IPGCR will synthesize previously published research into reports that summarize the state of relevant knowledge. It will sit under the auspices of the United Nations, and its reports will include explicit policy recommendations aimed at informing decision-making by the UN and other bodies. To draw an analogy, the IPGCR does not put out forest fires; it surveys the forest, and it advises precautionary measures to minimize the chance of a forest fire occurring.</p><p>The IPGCR\u2019s reports will aim to be done in a comprehensive, objective, open, and transparent manner, including fully communicating uncertainty or incomplete consensus around the findings. The mechanisms for how this will be accomplished are described throughout this document.</p><p>The IPGCR draws on best practices from other international organizations and adopts those that best fit within the IPGCR\u2019s purview. Like the US National Academy of Sciences, the UK Royal Society, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPGCR will primarily operate through expert volunteers from academia, industry, and government, who will write and review the reports<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>In contrast to these other institutions, the IPGCR will be explicitly focused only on how potential risks could destroy civilization globally or cause human extinction. For instance, an IPGCR report on climate change would consider climate change as a GCR itself, as well as how climate change could affect other GCRs, both in terms of their probability of occurrence and the magnitude of their effects. This contrasts with, e.g., IPCC and World Health Organization (WHO) publications, which are meant to provide broad and comprehensive assessments of global health<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> and climate change respectively (IPCC 2014, Hulme 2022). While the IPGCR will likely draw from some of the same experts and knowledge base as these organizations, it will have a sharper focus on global catastrophes. Finally, the IPGCR is constructed to assess GCRs across domains, unlike the domain-specific WHO and IPCC. This will allow the IPGCR to compare potential risks on a like-for-like basis, and to understand how they may intersect and interact. This will aid policymakers in constructing policy that coordinates and prioritizes responses to different threats, and minimizes the chance that any GCR occurs, regardless of its origin.</p><p>The IPGCR\u2019s structure mandates that leaders have diverse expertise, but also that they come from countries across different regions and levels of economic development. The IPGCR will draw on voices across geographies and levels of economic development. This minimizes real and perceived favoring of particular groups, elevates these risks as truly global concerns, and ensures that the IPGCR promotes the interests of all humanity by helping to avoid and mitigate potential global catastrophes.</p><p>The IPGCR will sit under the auspices of the United Nations, and it will be accountable to all participating countries through the IPGCR Delegates Assembly. Each participating country gets a single Delegate in the Assembly. Delegates are both political and technical representatives of their countries. They elect the IPGCR\u2019s management, sign off on changes in strategic direction, and endorse findings and recommendations. The Delegates\u2019 oversight tools are shaped so that they do not unnecessarily impede the IPGCR\u2019s flexibility or speed. For example, Delegates can approve the IPGCR\u2019s actions remotely (without meeting in person), reports\u2019 scientific findings have a lower bar for endorsement than their policy recommendations, and only 90% of Delegates are necessary to endorse a policy recommendation. The governance structure thus gives the IPGCR\u2019s actions broad legitimacy while staying nimble.</p><p>In short, the IPGCR process starts with review of a diffuse array of scholarship and creates a path for analysis and recommendations to ratchet up to higher and higher levels of buy-in, agreement, and authority. The IPGCR would improve existing global governance by making it more effective in noticing, understanding, and combating global catastrophic risks.</p><p>The rest of the article is structured as follows: section 2 provides a brief background on global catastrophic risks. Section 3 describes the content produced by the IPGCR. Section 4 describes the structure and operations of the IPGCR. Section 5 describes the process for the adoption and implementation of the IPGCR.</p><h1><strong>2. Background</strong></h1><p>For the purposes of the IPGCR, <i>global catastrophic risks are defined as risks that could cause a global collapse of human civilization or lead to human extinction</i>. Risks that have the potential to pose a catastrophe of this scale and severity will fall under the purview of the IPGCR\u2019s reports. Risks that are not global in scope or are not severe enough to cause global destruction of civilization, while important, are not covered by the IPGCR. Potential GCRs covered by the IPGCR must have a <i>direct mechanism</i> by which they contribute toward a global catastrophe. Broad social issues such as inequality, poverty, education, and health are critically important, but will not be directly covered by the IPGCR. These issues may contribute towards instability that makes a global catastrophic risk more likely and can be discussed in this context, but these issues will not be the focal point of the IPGCR\u2019s work.</p><p>While there have been many catastrophic events in human history, GCRs have little precedent. World War II caused approximately 60 million deaths<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[2]</a> or ~3% of world population. The 1918 Influenza Pandemic caused 20-40 million deaths<a href=\"#_ftn2\">[3]</a> or 1-2% of world population. The 14th Century Black Death caused approximately 50 million deaths(Benedictow 2005) or ~13% of world population (Roser &amp; Ortiz-Ospina 2017). There have been collapses of civilization on a regional scale, including the Roman Empire in the 5<sup>th</sup> century AD, the Classical Maya in the 9<sup>th</sup> century, and the Rapa Nui of Easter Island in the 17<sup>th</sup> century (Diamond 2005). Although tragic, these events are not included under the purview of GCRs as defined here because they did not lead to human extinction or a collapse of civilization globally.</p><p>One historical event which may have risen to the level of a GCR was the Toba super-volcano eruption in Sumatra ~74,000 years ago, which led to a volcanic winter (Rampino &amp; Self 1992). Because it occurred in prehistory, there is significant uncertainty about the consequences of this event, but some studies suggest that there may have only been a few thousand humans worldwide that survived the event (Ambrose 1998, Oppenheimer 2002).</p><p>GCR-relevant research is currently being done in numerous fields, including environmental science, biology, physics, geology, economics, statistics, psychology, philosophy, political science, computer science, engineering, and more. Most of this research is being carried out as part of the existing research agenda for each of these fields, not necessarily within the specific context of GCRs. However, several scholarly organizations specifically designed to study GCRs and related topics have been created recently. Examples of these institutions include the Oxford Future of Humanity Institute,<a href=\"#_ftn3\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> the Cambridge Centre for the Study of Existential Risk,<a href=\"#_ftn4\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> and the Stanford Existential Risk Initiative.<a href=\"#_ftn5\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> The IPGCR is not intended to replace or duplicate the research of any of these institutions, but to collect and summarize scholarly research relevant to GCRs (regardless of whether that research was originally intended to have GCR implications), and to produce reports that can inform policy.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>3. IPGCR Content</strong></h1><p>This section describes the two key types of documents produced by the IPGCR: IPGCR Reports (3.2) and IPGCR Working Group Summaries (3.3). Each Working Group creates a series of reports throughout the 5-year cycle, and each Working Group creates a Working Group Summary at the end of the 5-year cycle. This section focuses on the content of these two types of documents; the processes and operations by which these documents are created are described in section 4.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>3.1 Defining Scope and Working Groups</strong></h2><p>The IPGCR will produce reports on different GCR topics. The report-writing process will be administered by Working Groups, organized around different sub-topics of Global Catastrophic Risks. Section 4 describes mechanisms by which Working Groups and reports are created.</p><p>While the Working Groups will ultimately be decided by the IPGCR\u2019s governance bodies (described in section 4), for purposes of illustration and clarity, we will assume that the IPGCR\u2019s governing bodies will create two Working Groups throughout the rest of this document: Object-level Risks (WG1) and Meta-Level Topics (WG2). The Object-level Working Group will produce reports on specific risks, while the Meta-Level Working Group will produce reports on topics that are not specific risks themselves, but are relevant to understanding and assessing GCRs. Below is <i>an illustration</i> of what the Working Groups and their report topics might look like:</p><p><strong>Working Group 1 (WG1): Object-Level Risks</strong></p><p><i>Assessments of specific risks that could be globally catastrophic. Potential Task Forces:</i></p><ul><li>Nuclear Weapons</li><li>Biosecurity and Pandemic Preparedness</li><li>Artificial Intelligence</li><li>Climate Change</li><li>Biodiversity Loss</li><li>Interplanetary Object Impacts</li><li>Super Volcanoes</li><li>Cybersecurity Risks to Critical Infrastructure</li></ul><p><strong><u>Working Group 2 (WG2): Meta-Level Topics</u></strong></p><p><i>Topics relevant to understanding, assessing, avoiding, and mitigating GCRs. Potential Task Forces:</i></p><ul><li>Forecasting methods, uncertainty, and high-impact statistical tails</li><li>Systemic risk mechanisms, complex systems, and contagion effects</li><li>Human psychology and decision-making as it relates to understanding and assessing GCRs</li><li>Benefit-Cost Analysis of Catastrophes including topics in Ethics, discount rates, and measuring social welfare across time</li><li>International Cooperation and collective action</li><li>Creating resilient critical infrastructure</li><li>Legal and regulatory methods to address GCRs</li><li>Horizon scanning and preparing for yet unknown risks</li></ul><h2><strong>3.2 Reports</strong></h2><p>The purpose&nbsp;of IPGCR reports is to assess all relevant scholarly information and then communicate the current state of the knowledge to policymakers. As such, unlike the IPCC, IPGCR reports will not necessarily seek consensus, but will identify and communicate the level of uncertainty around the report\u2019s findings. There may indeed be certain parts of a report topic that have wide consensus, while other parts may not have consensus and have high degrees of uncertainty. A major role for IPGCR reports is to present \u2018long tail\u2019 considerations - ideas that exist outside the range of consensus of probable futures, but are nevertheless worth consideration from policymakers. IPGCR reports will treat uncertainty explicitly so that readers will be able to assess and compare uncertainties across different reports.&nbsp;</p><p>Each IPGCR report will be written by a Task Force of expert volunteers, selected through a governance process described in section 4. IPGCR reports will use literature review, not original research. Priority will be given to peer-reviewed scientific, technical, and social-economic literature. Other literature, such as reports from governments and industry, can be used to expand the depth and breadth of the assessment. However, each Task Force must ensure the quality and validity of cited sources and information.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of the report topic or Working Group, each IPGCR report will have 3 main sections:</p><ol><li>Report Findings</li><li>Report Technical Summary</li><li>Report Summary for Policymakers</li></ol><h3>3.2.1 Report Findings</h3><p>The report findings section is the core of the report that provides a detailed description and overview of the state of current knowledge as it relates to the report\u2019s topic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Working Group 1 (Object-Level Risks)</u></strong></p><p>To make WG1 reports as useful as possible, the report findings section will have a standardized high-level structure. This will help to ensure continuity between the different Object Level Risks covered by WG1, and to ensure that reports on risks ranging from nuclear weapons to artificial intelligence to climate change will not be wildly different in the scope of their content. There will be a degree of authority given to Task Forces to make decisions that make sense for each specific report, but this will be within the standardized high-level structure outlined below:</p><ul><li><strong>Physical and Socioeconomic Bases of the Risk&nbsp;</strong>\u2013 A literature review of the current state of the natural, social, engineering, and other relevant sciences to describe the risk.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Risk Assessment&nbsp;</strong>\u2013 Qualitatively and quantitatively assess the risk in terms of:&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Direct Impacts and the Severity of Direct Impacts&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2. Indirect Impacts and the Severity of Indirect Impacts&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3. The Scope of Direct and Indirect Impacts&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4. Timing&nbsp;</p><p>5. Likelihood of Occurrence&nbsp;</p><p>A major part of the assessment will be determining the amount of uncertainty involved with the report\u2019s assertions.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Risk Avoidance and Mitigation&nbsp;</strong>\u2013 A detailed discussion of different potential strategies for avoiding or mitigating the risk, including corresponding uncertainties. This section will not provide specific recommendations for policymakers, which are handled in the report's Summary for Policymakers section (discussed in section 3.2.3).</li></ul><p><strong><u>Working Group 2 (Meta-Level Topics)</u></strong></p><p>Unlike WG1, WG2 covers a range of topics that are useful in understanding GCRs, but does not provide assessments of specific GCRs themselves. As such, WG2\u2019s report findings section will not have a systematized structure, but will be at the discretion of the Task Force, with oversight from the WG2 Board leadership.</p><h3><strong>3.2.2 Report Technical Summary</strong></h3><p>This section provides a summary of the report findings section using technical/scientific terms.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.2.3 Report Summary for Policymakers</strong></h3><p>This section provides an overview of the report findings in lay terms. Importantly, this section also introduces policy recommendations. These recommendations will be informed by the review of existing scholarship, but the Task Force will have the freedom to consider risk avoidance and mitigation strategies that have not been previously implemented or tested. Still, whenever possible they should anchor these strategies in prior research.&nbsp;</p><p>The reports of Working Group 1 (Object-Level Risks) will include recommendations for avoiding and mitigating the risk covered by that report. Working Group 2 (Meta-Level Topics), however, may not necessarily include recommendations, since these reports are focused on providing a synthesis of topics relevant to GCRs, and not on assessing specific GCRs themselves. However, Working Group 2 reports can include recommendations if the Task Force feels that it has found concrete policy recommendations as part of its work.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>3.3. Working Group Summaries</strong></h2><p>Every 5 years, each Working Group will create a summary of all new reports (process described in detail in section 4). This summary will be based on each report\u2019s individual Technical and Policymaker Summaries. The final Working Group Summaries will include:</p><ul><li><strong>Working Group Technical Summary</strong> - Provides a more detailed technical summary of the Working Group\u2019s reports.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Working Group Summary for Policymakers</strong> - Provides an overview of the Working Group\u2019s reports in layman\u2019s terms, including recommendations.</li></ul><p>Because these Working Group Summaries will summarize 5 years of the Working Group\u2019s efforts, they will likely be the IPGCR documents most widely read by both policymakers and the general public.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>4. Structure &amp; Operations</strong></h1><p>At a high level, the IPGCR will run on a 5-year cycle. Every 5 years, the Delegates Assembly (the IPGCR\u2019s representative body, described in more detail below) meets as a large group to discuss and vote on key aspects of the IPGCR\u2019s plan, policies, and procedures, including what Working Groups should exist. Working Groups will then act somewhat autonomously, with oversight from the Delegates Assembly, to produce reports as they see fit over that 5-year period. This structure will allow the IPGCR to create up-to-date reports that can address the often-changing state of knowledge in a timely manner. This structure will allow the IPGCR to be nimbler and responsive, and distinguishes it from a body such as the IPCC, which produces a single large report every 5-8 years.<sup>&nbsp;</sup>In the IPGCR, each Working Group will aggregate its reports every 5 years, creating a Working Group Summary. Working Group Summaries will likely be the most widely read IPGCR document. All IPGCR content will require endorsements from the Delegates Assembly in a process described throughout this section.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/j333ovg1vmefsbikd6rq\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/pfav4gpdxfd1squbstcn 90w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/aaqyl4uxog108f86cfwj 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/dfkqazcxewfrdkyhlbls 270w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/pahwtflkwo7qfogcl5xz 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/aqr95j85hzy36bszupos 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/grjzfeqedpck7yncsnjk 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/b23ogoxxcvlzy7wwueox 630w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/sh6yicbsgasreoobgwub 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/vvldoittvs0snwvh7mef 810w\"></figure><p><i>Figure 1:<strong> IPGCR governance structure</strong>. The IPGCR is designed as a nimble structure capable of frequently synthesizing varied research while obtaining broad buy-in and legitimacy from participating countries.</i></p><h2><strong>4.1 Governance</strong></h2><h3><strong>4.1.1 Delegates Assembly</strong></h3><p>The Delegates Assembly is made of Delegates from all participating countries. Delegates will be both diplomatic and scientific representatives of their countries, and will approve IPGCR reports. The Delegates Assembly will have a large in-person meeting once every 5 years to discuss and vote on key aspects of the IPGCR, such as the IPGCR\u2019s processes and elections of Executive Board members. The Delegates Assembly will also have shorter annual meetings to monitor the IPGCR\u2019s ongoing operations. The Delegates Assembly plays a key role in the IPGCR review process, described in sections 4.2 and 4.3 below. Due to the autonomous nature of the Working Groups and the ongoing nature of the Working Group reports, the Delegates Assembly will need to be available on an ongoing basis for remote review and remote voting on items that require their approval (described in detail in sections 4.2 and 4.3). This structure ensures all Delegates will have a say in the IPGCR\u2019s operations, while also keeping the organization nimble enough to respond to changes in the state of knowledge relating to global catastrophic risks.</p><h3><strong>4.1.2 Executive Board</strong></h3><p>The Executive Board will include the IPGCR Chair and 3 Vice-Chairs, which are elected by the Delegates Assembly. To ensure heterogeneous geographical representation, there must be at least one Vice-Chair from a developing economy and at least one from a developed economy. In addition, each of the Vice-Chairs should come from different disciplinary backgrounds; possible membership could be a natural scientist, a social scientist, and an engineer, but the exact disciplines will be up to the discretion of the Delegates Assembly. Once appointed, the Executive Board will manage the IPGCR on an ongoing basis and make executive decisions around management and content.</p><h3><strong>4.1.3 Working Groups</strong></h3><p>Working Groups are operational divisions of the IPGCR, which are created by the Executive Board and approved by the Delegates Assembly. Each Working Group has a Board of five members, elected by the Delegates Assembly. At least two of these members must be from a developing economy and at least two must be from a developed economy. The five Working Group Board members should represent at least three disciplinary backgrounds, most likely a natural scientist, a social scientist, and an engineer, although the exact disciplines are up to the discretion of the Delegates Assembly. Each Working Group Board will decide internally who will serve as Chair. The Chair will have an administrative role, with no additional executive or voting power.</p><p>Working Groups will have the flexibility to be restructured as needed, though this will likely be rare, and will need to be approved by the Delegates Assembly. Each Working Group will have 5-10 full-time staff, which will assist the Task Forces.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>4.1.4 Review Team</strong></h3><p>In addition to the Working Groups that produce reports, there will be an independent Review Team, which puts reports through independent peer review. The Review Team will be managed by a Chief Review Editor, who is appointed by the Executive Board. The Chief Review Editor appoints an individual Review Monitor for each Working Group report (described in more detail below).</p><h2><strong>4.2 Report Creation and Review</strong></h2><p>The Working Group Boards will identify topics on which reports should be written. For WG1 (Object-Level Risks), the report topics will be potential GCRs. For WG2 (Meta-Level Topics), these reports will cover topics that are key to understanding, assessing, avoiding, and mitigating GCRs. When the Working Group Board proposes a report topic, the Delegates Assembly then approves or denies the Working Group\u2019s request to continue the report-creation process. Delegates have 1 month to respond with a yes/no vote. If Delegates do not vote in time, their vote is not counted for or against. 90% approval is needed to proceed with the report.</p><h3><strong>4.2.1 Identifying Report Topics</strong></h3><p>The Working Group Boards will identify topics on which reports should be written. For WG1 (Object-Level Risks), the report topics will be potential GCRs. For WG2 (Meta-Level Topics), these reports will cover topics that are key to understanding, assessing, avoiding, and mitigating GCRs. When the Working Group Board proposes a report topic, the Delegates Assembly then approves or denies the Working Group\u2019s request to continue the report-creation process. Delegates have 1 month to respond with a yes/no vote. If Delegates do not vote in time, their vote is not counted for or against. 90% approval is needed to proceed with the report.</p><h3><strong>4.2.2 Assembling Task Forces</strong></h3><p><strong>Two Team Leads</strong></p><p>Each report will be written by Task Force, led by two Team Leads. The Team Leads will be selected by the Working Group Board. For WG1, one Team Lead must be a natural science or technical expert (e.g. a biologist, an engineer, or a computer scientist) and one must be a social science expert (e.g. an economist, a sociologist, or a legal expert). WG2\u2019s Team Leads should also be selected to maintain some heterogeneity of expertise or background, though there are no formal requirements. In all Working Groups, one Team Lead must be from a developing economy and one from a developed economy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Team of Authors</u></strong></p><p>Team Leads will assemble a team of authors, with the oversight and consent of the Working Group Board. The team of authors will write the report content, as managed by the Team Leads. All authors, including the Team Leads, will be volunteers, and will predominantly be based in academia, industry, or government.</p><p><strong><u>Technical Support</u></strong></p><p>The Task Force will be assisted by the Working Group staff. Each Working Group will have 5-10 technical support staff, who are funded by the developed economies that have representation on the Working Group Board.</p><p><strong><u>Review Monitor</u></strong></p><p>The Chief Review Editor will appoint a volunteer Review Monitor for the report, who will manage and oversee the review process. The Review Monitor will be an expert in the report topic, and will assemble expert reviewers to review and comment on the report. The Review Monitor will arbitrate any disputes between reviewers and authors.</p><h3><strong>4.2.3 Drafting the Report Findings</strong></h3><p>Once assembled, the Task Force is expected to draft the report\u2019s findings in about a year. The exact process of drafting the report will be up to the Task Force, but Task Forces will be funded to meet in person 2-4 times to coordinate and discuss the report\u2019s content. The workflow of drafting, reviewing, and endorsing the report is shown in Figure 2.1 and is described below.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>4.2.4 First Draft Review (Expert Review)</strong></h3><p>The Task Force will suggest possible reviewers to the Review Monitor, but the Review Monitor will make final decisions on reviewers. The Review Monitor will invite a broad array of experts to read and critique the draft. These reviewers\u2019 comments will be sent to the Task Force anonymously, and the Task Force must respond to them. It is the role of the Review Monitor to mediate disagreements between the Task Force and the reviewers, and to ensure the reviewers\u2019 comments are properly responded to by the Task Force. This portion of the review process will typically take several months. Upon future publication of the report, the reviewers\u2019 names will be listed on the report. To aid in transparency, all reviewer comments, without attribution, will be publicly available online.</p><h3><strong>4.2.5 Second Draft and Construction of the Report Summary for Policymakers and the Report Technical Summary</strong></h3><p>After receiving and responding to comments from the expert reviewers, the Task Force will create a second draft. Expert reviewers may have raised gaps in knowledge that require the Team Leads to recruit additional authors to complete the second draft.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, as the second draft is being written, two summary sections will be drafted by the Team Leads:</p><ul><li><strong>Report Summary for Policymakers</strong> - Provides an overview of the report findings in layman\u2019s terms as well as recommendations. All report authors will be involved in the recommendation-creating process, as Team Leads will solicit recommendations from each author working on the report. However, the Team Leads will have the ultimate editorial authority to decide which recommendations are included in the final report.</li><li><strong>Report Technical Summary</strong> - Provides a technical summary of the report.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>4.2.6 Second Draft Review (Expert and Government Review)</strong></h3><p>Upon completion of the second draft, the Review Monitor will redistribute the report findings to experts, who will review the second draft with a particular focus on new material that was added to the second draft. In addition, Delegates (who act as representatives of their countries) will receive the report findings and the first drafts of the report Summary for Policymakers and the report Technical Summary. Delegates can provide comments that are taken into account, but don\u2019t necessarily need to be responded to by authors. As mentioned, to ensure that reports can be created in a timely manner, Delegates will have 2 months to give comments. In addition to their review comments, Delegates will provide Yes/No approval of each recommendation, and the tally will be communicated to the Task Force (e.g. 68% approved of recommendation #3). Ultimately, Delegates will provide endorsements in final review as outlined below, so authors will want to consider Delegate comments in their final changes to the document.&nbsp;</p><p>Review Monitors will continue to mediate disagreements. Significant disputes will be mediated by the Working Group Board.</p><h3><strong>4.2.7 Final Changes and Review</strong></h3><p>The Task Force will make final changes to the documents. The document will then be sent to Delegates for endorsement. Delegates will provide the following types of endorsements for the different components of the report:</p><ul><li>Report Findings - Delegates provide an overall endorsement that the report presents a fair assessment of the state of current knowledge around the report subject.&nbsp;</li><li>Report Technical Summary - Delegates provide section-by-section endorsement.&nbsp;</li><li>Report Summary for Policymakers - Delegates provide line-by-line endorsement.&nbsp;</li><li>The overall report findings section, each section of the report Technical Summary, and each line of the report Summary for Policymakers must receive 90% endorsement from Delegates to be finalized as an IPGCR publication.</li></ul><h2>&nbsp;4.3 <strong>Working Group Summary Creation and Review</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/cfe3rsnddne5fztow2js\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/de9nvrfhau5dqse7pj3f 101w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/jdqjvlfhlfsiscol3oxn 181w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/hv3a4fmoyy3s8s37wcqb 261w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/g0speqqar3bai22cnsu5 341w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/gpjbctrrcyvfuuhwhj6w 421w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/kgonkfadlquzyarzaasz 501w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/dkkpccvzhf6no8hasxeh 581w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/nhvgvwtmmjhq2cl1gr5h 661w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/ufbar6gkg4a1vjhud2t8 741w\"><i>Figure 2.1: Working Group Summary Creation Process</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/wtzzbtfeqcfkir6v7cer\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/ckctr8qdharyvgcmub7b 83w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/oejqthudinrsxhzbn3xv 163w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/dxoqbsvc1c8yvqshuxer 243w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/hhcb1fxgmsxbsahwhxbe 323w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/dudz9yxgeaqtindioqun 403w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/tf4vnjmdcgg8onnttcqx 483w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/lj19pkild1r2dmbw0tvo 563w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/by2lfmhujcoi92ruxhr6 643w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/m73rJpKs476zc52xz/bgpazsajbwt7pytwplsh 723w\"></figure><p><i>Figure 2.2: Report Creation Process</i></p><p>3 years into the IPGCR\u2019s 5-year cycle, the Working Group Board members will start drafting the Working Group Summaries, described in section 3.2. These Working Group Summaries will be the culmination of the Working Group\u2019s work over the 5-year cycle. They will summarize 5 years of the Working Group\u2019s work, and will likely be the documents most widely read by policymakers and the general public. The Working Group Summaries will include two parts:</p><ul><li><strong>Working Group Technical Summary</strong> - Provides a more detailed technical summary of the Working Group\u2019s reports.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Working Group Summary for Policymakers</strong> - Provides an overview of the Working Group\u2019s reports in layman\u2019s terms, including recommendations.</li></ul><p>After drafting, the two Working Group Summaries will be sent to Delegates for review (review process shown in Figure 2.2). Since these summaries will largely build off each of the individual reports from the Working Groups, which have already been reviewed by experts, these summaries will only be reviewed by the Delegates Assembly.&nbsp;</p><p>As with Working Group reports, each Delegate will be given 2 months to provide comments on the Working Group summaries. Their comments will go back to the Working Group Board, which will then complete the final summary. In the 4th annual Delegates Assembly meeting within the Working Group cycle, Delegates will discuss and deliberate on the Working Group Summaries, then vote to endorse them, at different levels:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Working Group Technical Summary - Delegates provide section-by-section endorsement.</li><li>Working Group Summary for Policymakers - Delegates provide line-by-line endorsement.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>As with the Working Group reports, each section of the Working Group Technical Summary and each line of the Working Group Summary for Policymakers must have at least 90% endorsement from Delegates to stay. Since Working Group Summaries will be endorsed as part of the Delegates Assembly meeting, all participating countries will have the opportunity to vote. However, since these Working Group Summaries build off of Working Group reports, which have already received Delegate endorsement, it will be unlikely for large parts of the Working Group Summaries to be rejected in this process.</p><h1><strong>5. IPGCR Adoption and Implementation</strong></h1><p>The IPGCR will be established by a resolution of the UN General Assembly, creating it as a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly. The majority of General Assembly resolutions are passed without a vote (United Nations 2022), including Resolution 43/53 that endorsed the creation of the IPCC in 1988 (United Nations 1988). Given that the benefits of addressing global catastrophic risks are by definition global, and the budget requirements are likely small\u2014for reference, the annual budget of the IPCC is roughly $4.5M (IPCC 2016)\u2014passing a UNGA resolution to create the IPGCR seems achievable.&nbsp;</p><p>Once adopted, the process to implement the IPGCR will proceed as follows:</p><ol><li>Countries appoint their Delegates to the Delegates Assembly.</li><li>The Delegates Assembly votes on the Executive Board.</li><li>The Executive Board drafts the original plan, policies, and procedures for the IPGCR, including the decision on which Working Groups will be included.</li><li>The Delegates Assembly votes on the plan, policies, and procedures and elects Working Group Board members.</li><li>The Executive Board appoints a Review Editor.</li><li>Working Group Boards identify report topics.</li><li>The content creation process begins.</li><li>Working Group Boards release a summary of all reports every 5 years.&nbsp;</li><li>Every 5 years the Executive Board reviews the IPGCR\u2019s plan, policies, and procedures, including what Working Groups should exist. The Delegates Assembly meets in a large meeting every 5 years to review the Executive Board\u2019s recommendations, and to vote on the new plan, policy, procedures, Working Groups, and leadership for the next 5-year cycle of the IPGCR.</li></ol><h1><strong>References&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>Ambrose, S.

At this stage, I'm working to put together strong evidence for all three points.</p><p>And I'm looking for help! The goal is to build a powerful argument that this space lacks funding and political urgency relative to its potential and then advance that case to the public and policy makers. &nbsp;I've been doing some writing that may become a public substack and have done a lot of research already on the state of the field and the key players. &nbsp;I don't think this information has been brought together anywhere publicly before.</p><p>My background is in public policy and tech-- I went to Brown for public policy, started and ran award-winning open-source and tech rights advocacy non-profit organizations, and then had a successful run in for-profit tech, which has given me the ability to choose my next project without worrying about income. &nbsp;I also have a science background so I'm able to read and understand the literature on these emerging treatments to a moderate level of granularity.</p><p>I'm making good progress myself but could use help in a few areas and I think having a small team of folks who are volunteering together could work really well and would be pretty fun.</p><p>Skills I'm looking for:</p><p>\u2022 It would be great to have someone looking at the numbers and building the analytic case for investment. &nbsp;For example, I believe that in the US overdoses are the 3rd largest cause of years of life lost behind only heart disease and cancer, but I need a little help locking down the numbers on that since the overdose stats are buried within 'accidents' mortality reporting. &nbsp;Similarly, I want to quantify some costs of the drug war on global development, impact of drug related crime in the US and globally, etc etc.</p><p>\u2022 A biology PhD would be great to have on this ragtag squad.</p><p>\u2022 Anyone with professional expertise in health policy would be super helpful.</p><p>\u2022 Anyone with professional experience in bringing drugs to market would be very helpful for evaluating timelines and likelihood of approval for various treatments, as part of building the case for increased investment.</p><p>\u2022 Someone who is good at turning numbers into clean charts and graphics would be very helpful for making strong presentation materials.</p><p>If you're interested or have questions or suggestions or know of resources that have addressed this topic that I may have missed, please message me on the forum! &nbsp;I'm new here, so I apologize if I'm not familiar with forum practices and etiquette.</p>", "user": {"username": "mincho "}}, {"_id": "iPHoSkKC62xRoc6Lj", "title": "Standard policy frameworks for AI governance", "postedAt": "2024-01-30T18:14:02.438Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>CW: &nbsp;reference to sexual violence</i></p><p>A way I\u2019ve been thinking about AI governance recently is in terms of different standard frames that strands of AI governance map onto. The current frame that\u2019s most in vogue is treating AI as a standard product that carries substantial safety risks, and then applying standard policy tools from this area to regulate AI systems. One reason I find this useful is as a way of finding relevant case studies.</p><p>Some other frames that I think AI governance work falls within are:</p><p><strong>A product that carries large negative externalities</strong></p><p>This is the frame that\u2019s being focused on the most at the moment, and I think motivates work like looking at how the aircraft and nuclear power industries achieve such low accident rates. I think lots of evals work also makes sense in this framework, insofar as evaluations aim to be the basis for standards regulators can adopt. I think some corporate governance work also falls into this category, like whistleblower protections. I think this frame makes sense when governments can unilaterally enact strong, competent regulations without being undone by national security concerns and regulatory arbitrage.</p><p><strong>Innovation policy</strong></p><p>One strand of AI governance work looks like innovation policy where the focus is on creating incentives for researchers to create new safety technologies. Lots of the responses to climate change fall within this frame, like subsidies for solar panels and funding for fundamental science aimed at technologies to reduce the harms of climate change. I think this type of policy is useful when coordination and regulation are really hard for some reason and so instead of adopting coordination measures (like the Kyoto or Paris climate agreements), it makes more sense to change the technology available to actors so it\u2019s cheaper for them to produce fewer negative externalities. I think this approach works less well when, not only are actors not coordinating, but they\u2019re competing with each other. Nuclear weapons probably look like this - it seems pretty hard to come up with innovations that change the incentives countries face so that they give up nuclear weapons of their own free will.</p><p><strong>A national security risk</strong></p><p>In this framework, AI is a potentially dangerous technology that adversarial state and or non-state actors can use this technology to pose criminal or terrorist threat. I think things like bio-evals are working in this framework, as is work focused on controlling open-source models, at least to some degree. In this frame, AI is treated like other WMD technologies like nuclear and chemical weapons, as well as other technologies that significantly enhance criminal capabilities like malware.</p><p><strong>Preventing competitive dynamics</strong></p><p>Work in compute governance aimed at preventing Chinese AI firms from accessing cutting-edge chips is in this category, as is work ensuring that AI firms have good information security. This work aims to generally prevent competition between actors that make it more expensive for them to adopt safety-enhancing technologies. This looks like a policy aimed at preventing race-to-the-bottom dynamics, for instance, a policy that tries to reduce the use of corporate tax havens.</p><p><strong>As an instrument of great power conflict</strong></p><p>This frames views AI as an important strategic technology that it\u2019s important that - something like - the free world leads in. Some AI policy aimed at ensuring that the US has access to high-skilled immigration is in this camp. Other examples of this kind of policy are early nuclear weapons policy and early space technology.</p><p><strong>Improving consumer welfare</strong></p><p>A huge amount of normal policy work is aimed at improving consumer welfare. Some examples include competition policy, policy regulating consumer financial products, advertising restrictions, and arguably privacy policy. Quite a lot of non-catastrophic risk-focused AI policies might fall into this camp, like policies aimed at trying to ensure that LLM services have the same standards as relevant professional groups e.g., that when LLMs give financial advice it doesn\u2019t carry the same risks that financial advice from individuals without financial planning licenses might give. Another example might be work trying to prevent chatbots from having the same quasi-addictive qualities that social media has.</p><p><strong>Political economy</strong></p><p>This is a very large category that includes work in bias and fairness camp, but also work around ensuring that there\u2019s broadly shared prosperity following large-scale automation and ensuring election integrity. I\u2019m grouping all of these categories because I think that they're focused on questions of the distribution of power and the economic consequences of this. Lots of the history of liberalism and the left has been focused on these kinds of questions, like the passage of the lords reform and the people\u2019s budget under the British Liberal government of the very early 20th century, and LBJ\u2019s great society and civil rates bills.</p><p>Potentially, work on AI sentience will be in this camp, structured similarly to anti-slavery work in Britain in the early 19th century, where the oppressed group wasn\u2019t the primary locus for change (unlike say 2nd wave feminism.)</p><p><strong>Military technology</strong></p><p>In this frame, AI is a technology with the potential to make war worse and more dangerous. The campaign to stop killer robots fits in this category. Other examples of this kind of policy work include the banning of particularly nasty types of weapons like bouncing bombs, as well as more prosaic work like reducing the use of tactical nuclear weapons.</p><p>My impression is that for this kind of work to be effective it has to not put militaries that adopt these limitations at a severe disadvantage. I suspect this is part of the reason why laws of war that prevent targeting civilians have been reasonably effective - armies can still fight effectively while not, for instance, committing sexual violence, whereas they can fight effectively by using rubber bullets.</p><p><strong>Innovation policy part 2 (electric boogaloo)</strong></p><p>This frame is focused on the economic growth benefits of AI and focuses on questions like leveraging AI to improve healthcare delivery and drug discovery. I think this just looks like various standard innovation policy questions, like how to structure research grants to incentivize socially useful innovation, and loan programs for startups developing socially useful products.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Nathan_Barnard"}}, {"_id": "NqnNjefZDpd6MqbWw", "title": "Deciding What Project/Org to Start: A Guide to Prioritization Research", "postedAt": "2024-01-30T18:10:01.296Z", "htmlBody": "<p>If you\u2019re&nbsp;deciding what <strong>(research) project, organization or intervention</strong> to go for, analyzing your options through prioritization research can be invaluable.

In this post, I will share my blueprint and learnings from this process. Please note that you don\u2019t need to be a researcher to benefit from conducting prioritization research.</p><h1>Why prioritization research</h1><h2>No need to wait for inspiration to strike</h2><p>If you're at a crossroads trying to come up with a great idea, I have good news: you don't have to invent something new.

Don\u2019t go for the first thing that came to mind, but rather take some time to scope the field and possibly find an even better option.</p><h2>The difference in impact between a \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018great\u2019 intervention is huge - especially within a high-impact cause area</h2><p>One of the original points EA focused on was the huge difference in impact between different interventions within global health.&nbsp;</p><p><img style=\"width:78.87%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NqnNjefZDpd6MqbWw/icz2zaqanysqtisqls6y\"></p><p><i>Illustrative Graph from this&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2023/02/how-much-do-solutions-differ-in-effectiveness/#1-data-on-how-much-solutions-differ-in-effectiveness-within-cause-areas\"><i><u>80.000 Hours article</u></i></a></p><p><br>To me, it seems likely that the big difference in impact between interventions is similar in different cause areas.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, apart from wisely choosing what cause to work on, I think it is still very crucial to wisely pick what you work on&nbsp;<i>within</i> that cause area. One of the \u2018best\u2019 interventions in this area is likely many times more impactful than the median.&nbsp;</p><p>If you work within&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\"><u>a cause area that is especially high-impact</u></a>, then finding one of the very best things to do could be especially consequential. Within such a cause area, the median intervention might already make a very big difference. Don\u2019t let this be encouragement to settle - instead let this be encouragement to find an outlier which is 10x as impactful as this already-great median intervention.</p><p>In other words, don\u2019t fall into the \u201c<strong>it\u2019s-in-an-EA-cause-area-so-it\u2019s-high-impact-anyways\u201d fallacy</strong> (I\u2019ll have to work on the naming). Although at this point it might all just feel \u2018very impactful\u2019, don\u2019t forget that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_neglect#:~:text=Scope%20neglect%20or%20scope%20insensitivity,specific%20form%20of%20extension%20neglect.\"><u>Scope Insensitivity Bias</u></a> might be clouding your judgement.</p><h2>Get better feedback and advice by reasoning explicitly &amp; strengthen your skills</h2><p>The skills you can learn through prioritization research can for example be useful if you\u2019d like to move into a grantmaker role or research role. I\u2019ve personally also found it useful in my impact-focused entrepreneurship endeavours.</p><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>My blueprint for prioritization research</h1><p>Below I\u2019ll describe the steps I took to decide roughly what intervention I wanted to build an organization around. In deciding what these steps looked like, I largely took inspiration from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship</u></a>\u2019s (CE) materials (their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/book\"><u>book</u></a> and information I could find on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/\"><u>their website</u></a> about their approach).&nbsp;</p><p>I by no means want to claim that the method I put together below is the&nbsp;<i>best</i> way to do prioritization research. Instead, I\u2019d like to give readers some place to start from more quickly by sharing the specific steps and templates I put together. I think that finding materials like these would have helped me to get going more quickly and improve my methods. I encourage others to iterate and adjust the approach for themselves, and to share in the comments how they would change it. I\u2019ll also recommend some things you can change about the process below depending on your situation (e.g. how much time you have available).</p><p><strong>As you proceed, your list of ideas becomes more concise, like a funnel</strong>. In the beginning, your approach should be broad, collecting a wide array of ideas. As you progress, the number of interventions narrows, and the depth of your research increases. This funnel process ensures that, by the end, you are left with a few good and extensively researched options.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><img style=\"width:44.83%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NqnNjefZDpd6MqbWw/pkbcgnjwn5fzkktpf7zn\"></p><h2>Step 1: Consider and collect lots of ideas on a longlist</h2><p>You can collect the ideas you think are somewhat promising on a longlist. The ideas you consider can come from various sources, including posts online, that \u2018ideas\u2019 note in your phone, and brainstorming sessions.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also try to source ideas from people who are experienced in your field(s) of choice and you trust. They might have a better sense of the important gaps in the field than someone from the outside. Referring to experts\u2019 intuitions can be especially useful if there is little evidence to lean on or if you have little time to investigate the field yourself.</p><p>At this stage, some advice I have is: try to go for speed, not perfection. Your bar for including an idea shouldn\u2019t be too high; separate the process of ideation and selection. You probably don\u2019t have time to research the ideas before putting them on your longlist. You will do this later. Just go by your intuition: does this intervention sound like something I might want to do? And does this sound like it could have a lot of impact?</p><p>Personally, I aimed to gather around 100 ideas on my longlist and landed at around 85.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>If your time or scope is limited, consider instead collecting 20, 40, or 60 ideas, just see what is realistic and useful. Then, instead of going from top 100 -&gt; top 10 -&gt; top 3, you can also go from top 20 -&gt; top 6- &gt; top 2 or any other variation you find sensible.</p><p><strong>Resources:</strong></p><ul><li>This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/K5R35pgPFk3DcGyRp/impactful-side-projects-and-organizations-to-start\"><u>list of high-impact project/organization ideas</u></a> (I collected these while going through this process).</li><li>Your&nbsp;<strong>longlist</strong> (here\u2019s a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TRhiLbaU0GzH2II7MYq0ci8UG9lhESGivd-5MPOPzA0/edit#gid=1731554989\"><u>template</u></a> so you can set up your longlist in a way that makes step 2 easier).</li></ul><h2>Step 2: Reduce to a top 10&nbsp;</h2><p>Now, you can transition to a more analytical phase using a Weighted Factor Model (WFM). In short, a WFM lets you rank a list of options by the set of criteria you determine (e.g. impact, motivation, personal fit). You give the criteria different \u2018weights\u2019 which depend on how important you think the criteria are.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NqnNjefZDpd6MqbWw/vvsgxvmjmmo7mioy3e3q\"><i>An example from Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/weighted-factor-model#:~:text=Broadly%2C%20the%20process%20of%20creating,from%20three%20to%20twelve%20factors.\"><i><u>article</u></i></a><i> on Weighted Factor Models</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this stage it\u2019s about finding a balance \u2013 if you have too many criteria, ranking items in your longlist will take a long time. So focus on what truly matters to you, and keep in mind that this is just initial filtering. You\u2019ll consider more criteria once you have a shorter list of options.&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019d also encourage you to pre-determine how much time you\u2019re willing to spend on each idea at this stage. I would roughly propose: take around 1-4 mins per idea if you have 80-100 interventions to go through. You could take a bit longer if you have less ideas to go through. You could then do some more quick research to take away major uncertainties.</p><p>To check my reasoning, I asked 4 people who know me (so they can judge my personal fit), who know the domains of the ideas, and who I think have good judgement to look at the top 30 in my longlist document. I asked them: 1) which ratings would you change, and 2) are there any interventions in the top 30 that you feel should be in the top 10?</p><p>Alternatively, you could also ask people to individually rate the ideas on different dimensions. This way you can make sure they don\u2019t get influenced by your or others\u2019 ratings.</p><p>If your interventions are within a specific domain, try asking experts in that domain to help you assess the ideas.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Resources:</u></strong></p><ul><li>Your<strong>&nbsp;</strong>trusty&nbsp;<strong>Weighted Factor Model&nbsp;</strong>- this a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TRhiLbaU0GzH2II7MYq0ci8UG9lhESGivd-5MPOPzA0/edit#gid=1731554989\"><u>template</u></a>&nbsp; (the same as I linked in step 1).</li><li>CE\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/weighted-factor-model#:~:text=Broadly%2C%20the%20process%20of%20creating,from%20three%20to%20twelve%20factors.\"><u>explanation</u></a> of how to make a Weighted Factor Model.</li></ul><h2>Step 3: Reduce to a top 3</h2><p>At this stage, I\u2019d recommend investing more serious amounts of time into each of your top 10 ideas. Personally, I spent 4-6 hrs on researching each of the top 10 ideas. You can dive into each option with more in-depth analysis reports. The main things I tried to focus on in these reports is the evidence and quality of evidence for intervention x and the most likely reasons intervention x might not be feasible or impactful.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, you could also create a more refined WFM which considers additional or more granular criteria. The reports you write can inform how you rate different facets of the intervention. For instance, as you learn more about the intervention you might learn that it seems much harder than you expected, and you might give it a low rating on your \u2018feasibility\u2019 criterion. Personally, I added some criteria into my WFM that I did not actually weigh because I was too uncertain about them. For example, I didn\u2019t go into detail regarding impact in the WFM because I didn\u2019t feel I could make a numerically accurate estimate. Instead, that was the focus of the reports I wrote on the interventions.</p><p>Something that was useful for me was spending 1-2 hrs discussing the options in your top 10 with a few experts in the field. They can give you feedback on your ideas and tell you why they think certain ones are more or less promising. You can also ask a few other people to attempt to independently fill out part of your WFM. You can then take their intuitions into account as you refine your own.</p><p>Taking into consideration the WFM and the reports, you can now pick which few ideas you think are most promising, which brings you down to your top 3.</p><p><strong>Resources:</strong></p><ul><li>A list of questions to guide your more in-depth research (this is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18L16ow4GiaJXfYorS22k4UX8FxiGEalccSCxJo1L--4/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>template</u></a> you can use for this).</li><li>Your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TLrBZ6svksSdc9u6AhQKF7B3yG5I4EU_Zfkxkig7ILo/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>shortlist</u></a> (Weighted Factor Model).</li></ul><h2>Step 4: Pick one</h2><p>For this, you can conduct additional research into your top 3. I spent around 15-20 additional hrs on each, building on the initial report I had written for them. My focus here was on hashing out uncertainties. At this stage, talking to experts regarding those interventions is very useful.&nbsp;</p><p>After this, I picked the intervention I found most promising. This is only a starting point though, from here many more hours go into refining choices within that and iterating on your plans.&nbsp;</p><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>Some tips to keep in mind</h1><h2>The trade-off between depth and breadth</h2><p>Be mindful of the trade-offs involved in your approach. Starting with a narrow focus, such as specifically prioritizing between anti-factory farming interventions, can yield more precise outcomes. However, this also means you might overlook other potentially impactful areas. Consider how you want to strike this balance between depth and breadth.</p><h2>Decide what time commitment makes sense and hold on for dear life to time-capping</h2><p>From my own experience I can tell you that it is easy to spend way too much time on this. You will discover a million uncertainties you need to look into to feel like you\u2019re making an informed choice. This makes it easy to get stuck in \u2018<strong>analysis paralysis</strong>\u2019. Try to prevent this by pre-committing to how much time you want to invest into this research phase - and then sticking to it (a.k.a. time-capping).&nbsp;</p><p>You\u2019ll have to trust in the&nbsp;<strong>80/20</strong> principle: 80% of results come from 20% of the efforts. This involves making choices even when you feel like you need more information to do so.</p><p>How much time you put into this should probably vary depending on how big the future commitment is - are you starting a new org or just a 3-month research project?</p><p>It can also vary depending on how important it is that you identify a very impactful next step. For instance, if you want to just learn a lot in your upcoming project, the impact of the project might matter less to you.</p><h2>Seek feedback</h2><p>Throughout every stage of this process, I encourage you to actively seek out feedback from trusted individuals. Their insights can help you identify blind spots in your reasoning and approach.</p><h2>Find someone to do this with</h2><p>I would recommend going through this process together with a small group of people. I didn\u2019t but would if I were to do it again. This can help you stay on track, stick to the time-capping, and stay motivated. If you don\u2019t know where to find your prioritization research partner, you can start by just posting a message about it in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/eavirtualmeetupgroup/shared_invite/zt-2bo7vo3dw-Y4FAPfPQdrnXJu03WOUV8g\"><u>EA Anywhere Slack</u></a> channel.</p><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>Further resources</h1><p>\u2022&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/book\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship handbook</u></a> - Chapter 19 (on how to decide on a charity idea).</p><p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sxk6BVoopq4&amp;ab_channel=CentreforEffectiveAltruism\"><u>Workshop: How to prioritize | Renan Araujo, Marie Buhl, Jam Kraprayoon | EAG London 23</u></a><u>.</u></p><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>Good luck!</h1><p><br><i>Many thanks to Marie Buhl for the useful additions and input, and thank you to G\u00e1bor Sz\u00f3r\u00e1d, Veerle Korsten and Bryce Robertson for providing feedback on drafts of this post.</i></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Alexandra Bos"}}, {"_id": "PhuWzoDC7pgwzEsye", "title": "Things newer (university) group organisers should know about", "postedAt": "2024-01-30T14:38:53.561Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>TL;DR:&nbsp;</strong>Group organisers should focus more on developing themselves and their highly engaged members more than they currently do; goal setting, utilising pre-existing materials and external assistance can help organisers do this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Epistemic status:&nbsp;</strong>The ideas below have arisen from (i) conversations I\u2019ve had with ~30 organisers, (ii) my own experience organising a medium-sized, reasonably \u2018successful\u2019 group, (iii) things I\u2019ve picked up/observed whilst interning full-time then contracting part-time for the CEA Uni Groups Team, and (iv) a collection of my own and others\u2019 armchair philosophy.

Introduction</h1><p>This post was, in part, inspired by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ko5fDSHFsJ35v6HMa/some-advice-the-cea-groups-team-gives-to-new-university#:~:text=Build%20a%20deep%20community%20that,by%20not%20being%20too%20salesy.\"><u>Jessica McCurdy\u2019s post</u></a> on advice CEA gives to newer organisers; I strongly recommend reading it before or after this, whether you are a new or an experienced organiser.&nbsp;</p><p>As a contractor for the University Groups Team at CEA, I recently ran a retreat for university group organisers. I found myself giving similar advice to many participants: resources, heuristics, framings etc. Hence, I thought it might be useful to write this up so that I could (i) easily share with others that I have similar conversations with and (ii) assist those I don\u2019t get to chat with. This post is intended to be a broad overview of some key things and ideas within university group organising - it\u2019s not holistic and shouldn\u2019t be treated as such. If anyone has specific questions about action-guiding advice, I would encourage them to explore the resources detailed in section 3 below.&nbsp;</p><p>About me: I\u2019ve been organising my group at the University of St. Andrews (a small yet somewhat prestigious university in the UK) for ~2 years. I interned with the University Groups Team at CEA in the summer of 2023 where I updated the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://resources.eagroups.org/\"><u>EA Groups Resource Centre</u></a>, and have been contracting for them since whilst doing my degree in philosophy. I always like chatting about at least one non-EA thing when I meet people in EA contexts; I can\u2019t do that here, but in the same spirit, I\u2019ll share that house and jungle music instantly improve my mood by at least 2 points and I think udon noodles (especially with a \u2018dan dan\u2019 sauce) are the best food ever made in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>1. Development&nbsp;</h1><h2>1.1 On developing group members</h2><h3>1.1.1 Backchaining to determine what you should do&nbsp;</h3><p>Within effective altruism we all share a common goal - to do as much good as we can. I think that group organisers will benefit significantly from thinking more about this final goal, and will get sidetracked less by loosely related goals - a recurring failure mode I see in groups. <strong>The process of backchaining can help avoid optimising for the wrong thing</strong>: think about your final goal, and work back from there until you reach an action step that you can complete now. Let us apply this to EA and group organising:</p><ul><li>Final goal: the most good getting done</li><li>Sub-goal 1: the world\u2019s most pressing issues being solved.&nbsp;</li><li>Sub-goal 2: people solving the world\u2019s most pressing issues.&nbsp;</li><li>Sub-goal 3: people existing who are willing and able to solve the world\u2019s most pressing issues.</li><li>Sub-goal 4: EA groups helping people who are motivated to solve the world\u2019s problems become able to do so.&nbsp;</li><li>Sub-goal 5: EA groups sharing EA ideas in a way that motivates people to work on the world\u2019s most pressing problems (see point 2.1).</li></ul><p>I think the above backchain can help us formulate our group strategy by ensuring we keep our final goal in mind. For example, <strong>many university societies are viewed as \u2018succeeding\u2019 if they have many members who regularly attend events. However, this is not necessarily a success for an EA group.</strong> If your group has 100 members who attend events, none of whom intend to take any kind of significant action in the future, this group may be less impactful than a group of 5 members, all of whom intend to go into EA careers. From this thinking we arrive at the heuristic of \u2018depth over breadth\u2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I want to stress that the notion of \u2018depth over breadth\u2019 does not suggest you should always aim for depth and never breadth. The argument above could be criticised by saying \u2018well, more members means a higher likelihood of finding people who will become deeply engaged\u2019. This is entirely true; however, what this response highlights is that ultimately what we care about is deeply engaged members. The following examples provides clarification:</p><ul><li><i>Example A:</i> You have a group of 20 members. 15 of them don\u2019t engage with EA ideas rigorously, but enjoy chatting about doing good - they would like to do a book club. 5 of the members want to use their careers to do as much good as they can - they would like to work through EA Virtual Programs\u2019 Career Planning Program. You, as an organiser, only have capacity to run one or the other. In this situation, organisers should run the career planning program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><i>Example B:</i> Your group is 2 years old and you\u2019ve built to a point where you have 8 reasonably engaged members. Those members each intend to spend 2-3 hours a week engaging with EA. Your introductory fellowship has 30 applicants. You have to choose either to accept all applicants (and have some of the 8 engaged people facilitate), or accept a smaller amount of applicants (meaning that the 8 engaged people focus on their personal development. Whilst there may be situations where it\u2019s good to accept all applicants (e.g., all of the 8 engaged members are about to graduate and you need the group to be sustained), in most scenarios, it would be appropriate to run a reduced introductory fellowship so that the 8 engaged members can develop.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>1.1.2 Goal setting&nbsp;</h3><p>Group organisers will benefit greatly from setting clear goals for themselves, their group, and their group members. I highly endorse&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals#:~:text=What%20are%20SMART%20goals%3F,within%20a%20certain%20time%20frame.\"><u>SMART goals</u></a>. There is a lot of writing on this, so I won\u2019t go into detail, but an example may help explain my point: imagine the goal of a group member is \u201cI want to know more about x-risk from AI this semester\u201d. The sentiment of this goal is good, but there is no clear path to achieving it, nor is there a clear way to tell if it has been achieved. Instead, we should set the goal as \u201cI want to have written three 400-word failure modes for how AI could have gone wrong by X date\u201d. Here, there is a very tangible thing for you or your group member to work towards.&nbsp;<br>Having tangible goals to work towards makes learning much easier: I encourage people to ensure that they and their engaged members pretty much always have a SMART goal they\u2019re working towards, as well as making sure that SMART goals are set for the group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>1.1.3 Outsourcing</h3><p>One of the wonderful things about the EA community is that we\u2019re all working towards the same goal. This means that unlike the finance world, or any other for-profit domains, when you ask someone to help you in the EA community, they will often want to help without requesting anything in return. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/promoting-effective-altruism/#multiplier-effect\"><u>multiplier effect</u></a> is strong, and people are aware that their impact will often come from facilitating others to have an impact. From this, it follows that as a community builder, you should try to build your network where you can: referring your group members to EAs you know is a low-cost way to help them.</p><p>The previous paragraph focused on outsourcing by connecting your group members to people they can chat with. However, another (easy) way of outsourcing is to connect people to opportunities that will allow them to progress in their EA development without you needing to be heavily involved. Some examples could be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sxKJckCiZQyux4kCx/ea-global-tips-networking-with-others-in-mind\"><u>EAG(x) conferences</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.globalchallengesproject.org/calendar\"><u>Global Challenges Project X-RIsk Workshops</u></a>. Sign up to the things on<a href=\"https://resources.eagroups.org/things-we-recommend-you-sign-up-to\"><u> this</u></a> page to ensure you\u2019re notified of future opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>1.2 Ensuring you (the organiser) are in the best position to do good&nbsp;</h2><h3>1.2.1 The importance of your own development&nbsp;</h3><p>An idea that you may hear often in EA community building is that impact is heavy-tailed. This is the notion that a large amount of the good that is done in the world is done by a small group of people. If we\u2019re thinking about which of the people in university groups are most likely to be in this small group, the obvious answer is the organiser! Hence, you should <strong>treat yourself like one of your members that you are responsible for helping</strong>. Focusing on your own development will help you have an impact, which is probably where a lot of the impact of your group will come. For further thinking on this, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2YASg3FojAemJwXZ9/community-builders-spend-too-much-time-community-building\"><u>here</u></a>. You can use the ideas in section 1.1.2 (Goal Setting) to help you with your personal development; additionally, personal growth will likely lead to expanding your EA network, which will help with 1.1.3 (Outsourcing).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>1.2.2 Safeguarding your values&nbsp;</h3><p>One of the guests at the recent retreat mentioned above shared the idea of safeguarding values with me - I found that the notion deeply resonated with me; hence, I thought I would share my understanding of the notinon and takeaway. Safeguarding values in an EA context refers to taking actions now to increase the likelihood that in the future we will want to do good as much as we do now.&nbsp;</p><p>To my knowledge, as people get older, their desire to help the world through charitable endeavours becomes overpowered by other desires: getting a mortgage, having more disposable income, caring for their friends and family, and having a successful career. Sometimes, this can result in charitable activities being deprioritised. Donating money to charity, acting in accordance with moral principles, and trying to help those whom we do not know may no longer be things that are viewed as especially important relative to other desires. This suggests that as we (group organisers) grow up, we are likely to care less about changing the world than we currently do</p><p>However, it is also well-documented that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/job-satisfaction/#should-you-just-follow-your-passion:~:text=of%20your%20life-,Should%20you%20just%20follow%20your%20passion%3F,-Do%20what%20contributes\"><u>we can actively influence our desires</u></a>. The job we do, and the people we spend time with, have a significant influence on who we are as people. In the same vein, performing an action makes us more likely to believe that doing that action is right. From this, we can conclude that donating money, being morally conscious about our diet, and actively spending time with EAs will increase our likelihood that we will still want to do as much good as we can in the future. This idea of safeguarding values becomes especially important when we consider that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/key-ideas-2023/career-capital/\"><u>the majority of the impact we are going to have is likely to come at the latter end of our careers</u></a> - when we have more career capital, experience, and skills to be able to influence situations in favour of doing more good.</p><p>Whilst I endorse living our lives in a way that is likely to result in our future selves holding our current values, I think we must be careful not to be too strict with this: it is unsustainable to do these things to a maximal degree. E.g., when someone first hears about effective giving, it\u2019s probably not a good idea for them to take the lifetime GWWC Pledge straight away; instead, it might be a good idea to take the 1%, 1-year, trial pledge. Some may argue that taking the lifetime pledge exhibits the behaviour I\u2019m endorsing; however, I think locking oneself into a \u2018value\u2019 too strongly is risky. If it is the case that you change your mind about effective giving in the future, you may then be resentful of your past self for being so quick to make decisions, and may then become resentful of EA ideas. Furthermore, locking yourself in when you haven\u2019t had time to properly process the arguments for and against doing something is likely to result in you making the wrong decision!</p><p>Another benefit of (publicly) doing some of the things that safeguard your values is that you set a good example for your group. I have had countless conversations with group organisers who have said that the group members are similar to them in many ways; hence, embodying the values you want your group members to have encourages and empowers them to also have these values. I recently spoke to a fellow community builder about my donation plans, and they said that they could feel themselves wanting to donate more because of our conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>2. Outreach and Communication</h1><h2>2.1 Frame EA as an opportunity, not as an obligation</h2><p>When I first learnt about how rich I am relative to the world\u2019s average incomes, how much it costs to help others, how much animals suffer, and how little attention the world is paying to potential x-risks, I wanted to grab every person in the street and tell them about cost-effectiveness, scope insensitivity, and the immense capacity we have as individuals to impact others\u2019 lives. This information felt so important to share, and I had a deep emotional desire to almost evangelise about EA. I\u2019ve chatted with some friends in EA, and they\u2019ve had similar reactions.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as you may have learnt,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PreacherLawson/photos/who-made-this-disrespectful-meme-/2375463765859127/\"><u>people don\u2019t respond well to being preached at</u></a>. Additionally, it is unlikely that someone who joins your EA group because they have been \u2018persuaded\u2019 and \u2018preached at\u2019 will remain engaged with EA for a long time. Instead, I think we should be framing EA as an opportunity. Some people see effective altruism as requiring great sacrifice - I understand this and sometimes feel it too. However, I am also extremely grateful to be aware of ways in which I can make a positive impact in the world; the fact that I have the potential to save lives and reduce existential risk amongst many other important things, is truly exciting. I think that if we share this enthusiasm instead of framing EA as a moral obligation, we will have better results. Slightly more tangible ways in which EA can be framed as an opportunity: (i) this post by 80,000 Hours, sharing findings that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/job-satisfaction/\"><u>doing careers that do good often make people happier than otherwise</u></a>; and (ii)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness/#if-you-gave-money-to-charity-would-it-make-you-more-satisfied-or-less\"><u>how giving money makes you happier</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>2.2 Separate socials and development&nbsp;</h2><p>One of the difficult things about running EA groups at universities is that the members of the group are students. Few students are looking to spend all of their free time reading in-depth articles about cost-effectiveness, career planning, and organisational tasks! Hence, it\u2019s important to also try to create a social dynamic within your group. However, one potential issue with this is that you create an EA group where everyone is mildly interested in EA ideas, but is there mostly for socialising (see 1.1 \u2018On developing group members\u2019 for reasons why this is might not be optimal). If your group members do not intend to take any action because of EA ideas, it is unlikely they will have a big impact!&nbsp;</p><p>One way to navigate this trade-off between engaging deeply with EA ideas and having a social dynamic within the group is to separate the two activities. In my group, when we are doing a reading group, workshop or career planning, we try to stay on task and not \u2018mess around\u2019. We\u2019ll then often have a social straight after, where we try largely to not talk about EA too much - inevitably, conversations stray onto EA topics (often the fault of the philosophy students, we apologise!), but they are not explicitly about goals and planning etc.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>3.

And I'm eager to learn more about ways in which I can reduce suffering in the world.</p><p>So regarding my question, Peter Singer's views have had a huge influence on my own ideas regarding ethics, especially in relation to animals. A lecture of his that I saw several years ago convinced me to adopt a vegetarian diet. However, about a few months ago, some uncertainty started to creep in regarding my views related to the welfare of animals, especially in the context of the country I live in, which is Pakistan.</p><p>According to Singer, factory farming contributes a great deal to the suffering of the farmed animals, so much so, that, at least in terms of the majority of these animals, their lives are not worth living. Therefore, the abolition of this system would significantly reduce the suffering in the world.</p><p>However, according to the Voiceless Animal Cruelty Index (https://vaci.voiceless.org.au/countries/pakistan/), most farm operations in Pakistan are small-scale, and therefore, it seems, that the suffering that is inflicted upon the farmed animals is significantly less than what the animals in factory farms might experience. Now, I do realize that they are still subjected to practices that are detrimental to their well-being, but there is still the possibility that these animals, or the majority of them anyway, have lives worth living. In other words, the good in their lives outweighs the bad.</p><p>I understand that it is also important to take greenhouse gas emissions into consideration since animal agriculture is a significant contributor. But, according to Our World in Data's assessment for the year 2022 (https://ourworldindata.org/co2/country/pakistan?country=PAK~OWID_WRL), Pakistan emits only 0.54% of the total global emissions.</p><p>Another consideration that might be worth taking into account is the level of poverty in Pakistan. As many as 10.47 million people were living under the International Poverty Line of $2.15 per day in 2018 (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-population-in-extreme-poverty?tab=chart&amp;country=PAK). And many people rely on animal agriculture as a source of income in this country.</p><p>Considering this data, do you still think that it would be more ethical to adopt a vegetarian or vegan diet as opposed to a meat-based diet?

He tried to simulate a conversation to have the AI help him with some writing he was working on, and the AI simulacrum repeatedly insisted it was by Drexler.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>A somewhat well-known Haskell programmer - let\u2019s call her Alice - wrote two draft paragraphs of a blog post she wanted to write, began prompting the base model with it, and after about two iterations it generated a link to her draft blog post repo with her name.</p></blockquote><p>More generally, this is a cluster of capabilities that could be described as language models inferring a surprising amount about the data-generation process that produced its prompt, such as the identity, personality, intentions, or history of a user<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrkiswr7k1lh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrkiswr7k1lh\">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>The reason I expect most capability evals people currently run on language models to miss out on most abilities like these is primarily that they\u2019re most naturally observed when dealing with much more open-ended contexts. For instance, continuing text as the user, predicting an assistant free to do things that could superficially look like hallucinations<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5wgg95djvz6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5wgg95djvz6\">[2]</a></sup></span>, and so on. Most evaluation mechanisms people use today involve testing the ability of fine-tuned<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqy4k4jalj9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqy4k4jalj9\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;models to perform a broad array number of specified tasks in some specified contexts, with or without some scaffolding - a setting that doesn\u2019t lend itself very well toward the kind of contexts I describe above.</p><p>A pretty reasonable question to ask at this point is why it matters at all whether we can detect <i>these</i>&nbsp;capabilities. A position one could have here is that there are capabilities much more salient to various takeover scenarios that are more useful to try and detect, such as the ability to phish people, hack into secure accounts, or fine-tune other models. From that perspective, evals trying to identify capabilities like these are just far less important. Another pretty reasonable position is that these particular instances of capabilities just don\u2019t seem very impressive, and are basically what you would expect out of language models.</p><p>My response to the first would be that I think it\u2019s important to ask what we\u2019re actually trying to achieve with our model eval mechanisms. Broadly, I think there are two different (and very often overlapping) things we would want our capability evals<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcg9azrx7und\"><sup><a href=\"#fncg9azrx7und\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;to&nbsp;be doing:</p><ul><li>Understanding whether or not a specific model is possessed of some dangerous capabilities, or prone to acting in a malicious way in some context.</li><li>Giving us information to better forecast the capabilities of future models. In other words, constructing good scaling laws for our capability evals.</li></ul><p>I\u2019m much more excited about the latter kind of capability evals, and most of my case here is directed at that. Specifically, I think that if you want to forecast what future models will be good at, then by default you\u2019re operating in a regime where you have to account for a bunch of different emergent capabilities that don\u2019t necessarily look identical to what you\u2019ve already seen.</p><p>Even if you really only care about a specific narrow band of capabilities that you expect to be very likely convergent to takeover scenarios - an expectation I don\u2019t really buy as something you can very safely assume because of the uncertainty and plurality of takeover scenarios - there is still more than one way in which you can accomplish some subtasks, some of which may only show up in more powerful models.</p><p>As a concrete example, consider the task of phishing someone on the internet. One straightforward way to achieve this would be to figure out how to construct sophisticated fake identities on the internet, such as doing research into targeted individuals, creating and deploying websites on domains that look like trusted websites, and so on. I think current evals do a good job of detecting attack vectors like this one.</p><p>Another way in which it seems like you could achieve this task however, is to refer to a targeted individual\u2019s digital footprint, and make inferences of potentially sensitive information - the handle of a private alt, for example - and use that to exploit trust vectors. I think current evals <i>could</i>&nbsp;do a good job of detecting and forecasting attack vectors like this one, <i>after</i>&nbsp;having identified them at all. Identifying them is where I expect current evals could be doing much better.</p><p>More precisely, borrowing from <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/SAjYaHfCAGzKsjHZp/p/suSpo6JQqikDYCskw\"><i><u>Studying The Alien Mind</u></i></a>&nbsp;(which I strongly recommend): there\u2019s a trade-off between bandwidth of observational information and targeted, rigorous results in controlled experimental settings. From the field of animal psychology, my go-to example (also originating from Nick) is Jane Goodall, who pioneered a certain kind of empirical approach to understanding animal behavior. She spent years living with and documenting the behavior of chimpanzees in the wild, focusing on collecting as many observations as possible in the animal\u2019s natural habitat.</p><p>This is not to say that all - or even most - insights into studying animal psychology came from research that tended more toward this style of research. Rather, the idea is that the Jane Goodall approach has higher potential to reveal <i>unexpected</i>&nbsp;insights<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflr77xabtyae\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlr77xabtyae\">[5]</a></sup></span>. I think it\u2019s likely that more traditional experimental research would have eventually uncovered the same insights, but how quickly you get there does matter, especially with increasingly powerful models. I think this is basically how it\u2019s played out so far with some unexpected capabilities.</p><p>On the trade-off between bandwidth and targeted settings, I think we understand sufficiently little about language model capabilities that it makes much more sense to gain a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/9kNxhKWvixtKW5anS/you-are-not-measuring-what-you-think-you-are-measuring%23Solution__Measure_Lots_of_Things\"><u>firehose of bits</u></a>&nbsp;of what models are capable of, to better identify feasible threat vectors.</p><p>This is also in part my answer to the other position, that these abilities simply aren\u2019t very impressive. Insofar as we care about identifying and forecasting potential threat vectors, things in the general cluster of \u201cabilities models will be pretty superhuman at before&nbsp;transformative AI\u201d seems pretty relevant, and what seems obvious post-hoc often isn\u2019t directly correlated with specific predictions that are obvious. Certainly many of the people I\u2019ve spoken to who I expect to have spent some time thinking about model capabilities were surprised by some of the examples of truesight within current models. Inferring properties of the authors of some text isn\u2019t itself something I consider wildly useful for takeover, but I think of it as belonging to this more general cluster of capabilities.</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the framing used in the recent <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fnc6Sgt3CGCdFmmgX/we-need-a-science-of-evals\"><u>Science of Evals</u></a>&nbsp;post, which delineates what a mature state of the field of evals would look like, the arguments made by this post could be described as \u201ca large amount of the useful work in discovering what we care about seems to be in explorative work\u201d. I don\u2019t think this is in contradiction with the overall point made in the post, which reads to me like pushing for the field to reach a state where we have a robust science on methodology that captures everything we care about, and having better frameworks for analyzing evals methods. I might disagree with more specific claims about whether the field is in that state, however.</p><p>To be clear, my position isn\u2019t simply that people should be doing capability evals on base models instead (though I think more of this would be very valuable, given that RLHF very often masks certain capabilities). For instance, I think many of the insights shared <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tbJdxJMAiehewGpq2/impressions-from-base-gpt-4?commentId%3DCemTb7c2gmwuSAwCC\"><u>here</u></a>&nbsp;and the generator upstream of them, are very useful, and that people should be doing more of that kind of exploration.</p><p>Rather, I think that in a regime where there are a lot of unknown unknowns - such as the general cluster described above - trying to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hRAzDwwMuu8CZSTvN/start-under-the-streetlight-then-push-into-the-shadows\"><u>search in the shadows</u></a>&nbsp;and get a lot of information through more open-ended exploration is very useful. I wanted to include some slightly more concrete ways in which current evals fail, but I think <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/users/janus-1\"><u>Janus</u></a>&nbsp;does a much better job of writing about them - which the comments of this post may contain! Eventually.</p><p>I expect this to be a significantly harder problem to tackle - we're effectively trying to interface with objects closer in complexity to human minds, history, ecosystems, the internet, or reality as a whole than to systems like cars where you can hope to measure all the relevant variables with simple diagnostics, especially before entire fields are invented or adapted to study these ontologically unprecedented and confusing entities<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqevftanh45\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqevftanh45\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;- but that trying to tackle it will be useful - and probably very interesting.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnrkiswr7k1lh\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefrkiswr7k1lh\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;This is often referred to as \u201ctruesight\u201d, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tbJdxJMAiehewGpq2/impressions-from-base-gpt-4?commentId%3DCemTb7c2gmwuSAwCC\"><u>here</u></a>.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn5wgg95djvz6\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref5wgg95djvz6\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Some context on what I mean by this: often when fine-tuning a model, one thing you might want to do is fine-tune to prevent a model from hallucinating.

This ban includes (but is not necessarily limited to) employment, contracting, volunteering, attendance at events, retreats, and being a member of EV coworking spaces<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7u190ejmjif\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7u190ejmjif\">[4]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxhn875a9tmk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxhn875a9tmk\">[5]</a></sup></span>.</li><li>After February 11th, 2025, Owen Cotton-Barratt will need to appeal to the boards of EV US and EV UK to participate in any overnight events or to be a member in an EV coworking space. (We recognize there is a possibility that EV may no longer exist by that time, in which case EV\u2019s spunout projects will be able to make their own decisions).</li><li>Before participating in any EV-hosted activities, Owen will need to complete training on sexual misconduct.</li><li>Any grant applications from Owen to any EV entities during this period must be flagged to the EV boards, who may or may not decide to veto the grant request depending on the specifics of the grant and the potential risks it poses.</li><li>Once the ban is complete and Owen has completed sexual misconduct training, it will be up to decision-makers within EV\u2019s individual projects to make their own decisions on whether and how to engage with Owen, with the exception of the aforementioned requirement to appeal to the boards before participating in overnight events or be a member of a coworking space. Individual decision-makers may still decide to ban him.</li></ul><p>The EV boards have also begun to proactively check with Community Health before bringing on new board members, as well as conducting more thorough independent background and reference checks.</p><h1>Determinations regarding the Community Health team</h1><p>The boards unanimously agree on the following:</p><ul><li>The Community Health team made important mistakes during the process of investigating Owen. The boards do not believe any of these mistakes were intentional, but believe that they had a negative impact. The boards considered taking disciplinary action (e.g. firing or suspension) against members of the Community Health team and decided they did not reach a threshold to do so based on either intent or impact, but the boards do believe improvements and reforms should occur.</li><li>There were multiple reports of concerning behavior about Owen, some of which we believe were handled reasonably by Community Health, and some of which we believe were not.&nbsp;</li><li>A consistent mistake was the lack of policies and oversight:<ul><li>Julia Wise was friends with Owen. While we do not have clear evidence that suggests Julia\u2019s response was unduly biased towards Owen, the lack of formal mechanisms to mitigate these issues (e.g. handing off the case to another team member) and the potential perception of bias undermined the credibility of Julia\u2019s investigation.</li><li>There was no clear policy in place for when an issue deserved escalation to the boards or others. Julia only alerted the full boards to Owen\u2019s conduct after Owen was (anonymously) described in an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/6252617/effective-altruism-sexual-harassment/\"><u>article by TIME magazine</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6n3bw8r1kn8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6n3bw8r1kn8\">[6]</a></sup></span>.</li><li>There were few checks on Julia\u2019s decisions, and Nicole had only partial information about the accusations against Owen<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgelitj3u3mc\"><sup><a href=\"#fngelitj3u3mc\">[7]</a></sup></span>.</li></ul></li><li>Given the potential for a pattern of behavior among the reports and Owen\u2019s stature in the community, we think the Community Health team insufficiently prioritized gathering follow-up information from at least one of the women involved.</li><li>The boards have directed the Community Health team to formalize their operating principles, including via the creation of team-wide policies governing conflicts of interests and escalation. These policies will require review and signoff from EV US and EV UK\u2019s general counsels, with any unresolved issues being escalated to EV US and EV UK\u2019s CEOs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The Community Health team also conducted an internal reflection and review on the Owen case and their policies (previously mentioned&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9JCkkjKMNL4Hmg4qP/ev-uk-board-statement-on-owen-s-resignation?commentId=CRdikDzzK2z92GLSs\"><u>here</u></a>) and independently have been making significant updates to their policies<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreforsojtisi5f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnorsojtisi5f\">[8]</a></sup></span>. They will be sharing information about these updates shortly.</p><h1>Appendix: Investigative process</h1><ul><li>The investigators spoke with Owen Cotton-Barratt, Julia Wise, Nicole Ross, Toby Ord, and multiple women who Julia was aware had relevant prior interactions with Owen.</li><li>The investigators also considered contemporaneous documents (e.g. communications between Owen and the other interviewees), as well as follow-up messages from interviewees adding more detail.</li><li>Only the EV US and EV UK boards and legal teams have seen the full report; interviewees have not seen the full report or had a chance to respond directly. The report summarized the investigators\u2019 findings and did not include the detailed interview notes. This was intentional to help preserve the anonymity of the interviewees.</li><li>A draft of this post was shown to Owen and the Community Health team before posting. In response to their feedback, we have made a few minor modifications for precision and clarity, but the substance of the post remains largely the same, and should not be read as a shared perspective or joint statement with either Owen or Community Health. We expect there may be disagreements with some of these conclusions, and anyone discussed in this post is of course welcome to share their own perspectives.</li></ul><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnihu1o23mko\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefihu1o23mko\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Nicole Ross is on EV US\u2019s board; she was recused from this process</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnntbraxvhw5r\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefntbraxvhw5r\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;When Owen was shown a draft of this post, he noted that he was confused by this finding.

On the one hand, having even a small number of large donors means we have a lot of funding, which allows us to make a great impact.

Organisations within the movement highly value the access to qualified candidates, a gap AAC aims to fill through its various services, including career advice, workshops, and job boards.</p><p>AAC's theory of change (ToC) is robust and predominantly supported by evidence. It suggests a positive impact on animal welfare through its programmes. However, this review identifies key uncertainties that need addressing. Firstly, the potential negative externalities of AAC's services, such as inadvertently directing individuals towards less optimal career paths or inducing anxiety over career choices, require careful monitoring and research. Secondly, the efficacy of AAC's recruitment services, despite high demand, remains a point of scepticism. These services need close evaluation to determine their future role in AAC's portfolio.</p><p>A standout aspect of AAC's methodology is the innovative use of Importance- and Counterfactual-Adjusted Placements (ICAPs) for evaluating its impact. This approach indicates a positive cost-benefit ratio, with AAC generating approximately USD 2.6 for every dollar spent. However, this metric's robustness could be further enhanced. Recommendations include adopting systematic approaches such as confidence intervals and developing a detailed rubric for counterfactual judgement. We also recommend that AAC collect stronger data for backing some of the assumptions in its monetary valuation of one ICAP. Such refinements would increase the accuracy and transparency of AAC's impact assessments.</p><p>Regarding organisational health, AAC demonstrates stability and efficiency with no major concerns. Their transparency and leadership's clear future vision are commendable. However, some improvements can be made to further strengthen their organisational framework.</p><p>Finally, we advise AAC to try to diversify their funding sources. Their current primary reliance on a few large donors within the Effective Altruism community might present a risk.</p><p>In summary, AAC stands out as a valuable contributor to the animal advocacy movement. It effectively addresses crucial talent needs and demonstrates impactful programme execution. However, there is room for enhancement in its monitoring systems, recruitment service, and funding diversification. Overall, our assessment of AAC is positive, with targeted recommendations aimed at maximising its impact and ensuring its long-term success in the movement.</p><h1>1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Background</h1><blockquote><p><i>\u201cAnimal Advocacy Careers (AAC) was founded in late 2019 through Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s incubation program, with the goal to attract top talent to the [effective animal advocacy] movement and empower them to make a real impact.\u201d</i> (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/about\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, n.d.-a</u></a>)</p></blockquote><p>AAC is a typical example of a capacity-building organisation, aiming to reduce the unnecessary suffering and improve the welfare of animals by supporting those who themselves work on this issue directly.</p><p>In this report we aim to assess AAC\u2019s success and effectiveness in achieving this goal. To start with, in this section, we will first examine whether AAC is addressing an important problem within the cause area of animal welfare (<u>1.1</u>), and then describe AAC\u2019s different programmes (<u>1.2</u>). This builds the foundation for the following sections, where we then evaluate AAC\u2019s work.</p><h2>1.1 &nbsp; Needs assessment</h2><p>On their \u201cAbout\u201d page, AAC writes:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe animal advocacy movement is desperately in need of passionate, talented professionals to help fast forward the end of animal suffering. Recruiting the perfect fit for a role can be an arduous process, with organisations often spending months searching for the ideal candidate for some roles.\u201d</i> (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/about\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, n.d.-a</u></a>)</p></blockquote><p>AAC also writes that talent bottlenecks can have many detrimental effects on the movement. Among others, they can slow down the growth of organisations or lead to less effective work due to lower quality hires (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/about\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, n.d.-a</u></a>). In this section, we aim to evaluate these claims, understanding the problem that AAC is trying to solve and how important it is.</p><p><strong>Charity Entrepreneurship incubation</strong></p><p>The logical starting point for our assessment is the research done by Charity Entrepreneurship (CE) which led to the creation of AAC. In the publication of their top charity ideas for 2019, CE explains that finding the right staff is a frequent challenge for animal advocacy organisations (<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/post/top-charity-ideas-2019\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship, 2019</u></a>). In a survey of leaders and researchers within the movement, they found some excitement around the possibility of increasing the talent pool in the animal advocacy movement, especially in large neglected countries like China or India. CE estimated this to be a tricky problem to work on, but one that could be of very high impact. (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jR2LKoXoL4Aq9T2MQ/how-to-make-an-impact-in-animal-advocacy-a-survey\"><u>Savoie, 2018</u></a>) Due to the large uncertainties involved and the lack of systematic research that has been done on this issue, CE suggested that ways of improving hiring and training within the movement should be investigated and tested further. This research was supposed to be done by a new organisation focused specifically on animal advocacy careers. Apart from research, this new organisation could act as a central contact point for talent and career topics. (<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/post/top-charity-ideas-2019\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship, 2019</u></a>)</p><p>CE recommended that the organisation would conduct small experiments in three different areas, trying to understand what is the most effective approach for filling talent gaps:</p><ol><li>Finding (e.g., finding new applicants through headhunting or outreach),</li><li>Training (e.g., training possible candidates in management skills that are highly lacking in the movement), and</li><li>Sorting (e.g., matching people with fitting roles). (<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/post/top-charity-ideas-2019\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship, 2019</u></a>)</li></ol><p><strong>Animal Advocacy Careers\u2019 own research</strong></p><p>Following these recommendations and the incubation by CE, AAC started conducting research into different potential priority areas and published the results from a variety of research projects on the blog on their website in late 2020. These findings were supposed to help them in their strategic prioritisation and the design of their services, but could also be useful to others. The following is an overview of different topics they researched:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Topic</strong></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Source</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">The characteristics of effective training programmes</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/effective-training-programmes\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, 2020a</u></a></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">The effectiveness of management and leadership training</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/the-effectiveness-of-management-and-leadership-training\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, 2020b</u></a></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">The characteristics of good management</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/the-characteristics-of-good-management-and-leadership\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, 2020c</u></a></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">A brief overview of recruitment and retention research</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/a-brief-overview-of-recruitment-and-retention-research\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, 2020d</u></a></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">A brief overview of hiring and turnover costs research</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/hiring-and-turnover-costs\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, 2020e</u></a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>We do not describe the findings of these research projects here, as they do not seem relevant for our needs assessment.</p><p>However, one research project conducted by AAC is highly relevant here. In 2020, AAC published the results of surveys they had done with HR experts and directors of nine animal advocacy organisations, trying to understand their biggest talent and hiring bottlenecks and how they could be addressed<i>&nbsp;</i>(<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/talent-bottleneck-survey\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, 2020f</u></a>). Crucially, when it comes to the importance of an influx of stronger talent into the movement, AAC reports the following finding:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cAll organisations unanimously agreed that if their quality-adjusted pool of applicants doubled for the next 3 years (vs staying constant), this would contribute more to enable them to do good as an organisation than a doubling of their funding over the same period. The majority agreed they would be able to double the amount of good but some more cautiously estimated 25% more good.\u201d&nbsp;</i>(<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/talent-bottleneck-survey\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, 2020f</u></a>)</p></blockquote><p>Following these initial, brief surveys, AAC ran an enhanced version of this research, conducting two surveys with different sets of participants (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/animal-advocacy-bottlenecks\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, 2021</u></a>):</p><ol><li>Leadership and hiring managers at effective animal advocacy nonprofits:<br>AAC reached out to 56 organisations, achieving a 70% response rate with 39 distinct organisations participating. The survey was designed to gather a single representative response from each organisation, specifically targeting individuals in top-level leadership positions such as CEO, ED, COO, VP, or those involved in hiring or human resources. The majority of respondents, with the exception of three, held leadership roles within their respective organisations. Further information on the kinds of organisations that took part in the surveys (e.g., their geographic location, their size, or the focus of their work) can be found in AAC\u2019s report.</li><li>Researchers, grant-makers, plus others working on \u201cmeta\u201d and movement-building services for the movement:<br>For this survey, AAC adopted a less formal approach in terms of inclusion or exclusion criteria, reaching out to organisations involved in research, grant-making, and other movement-building services, where they anticipated valuable input. They did not imply a need for the responses to be representative of the entire organisation, but in most instances, they still requested only one response per organisation to minimise the time required for completing the survey. They contacted 21 organisations and received 16 responses from 13 different organisations, resulting in a 62% response rate.</li></ol><p>Below, we summarise the findings from these surveys in depth, as they offer crucial insights into the talent needs of the movement and form the basis for AAC\u2019s strategic prioritisation.</p><p>AAC\u2019s surveys confirmed that the availability of high quality applicants for paid roles was a highly important bottleneck, and that this finding was consistent across regions. Lack of funding was the key bottleneck in both surveys, with lack of (qualified and capable) applicants for paid roles not far behind. Other highly important bottlenecks were unfavourable attitudes from targets of advocacy and a lack of public awareness of the organisations\u2019 work. The ranking of items from most to least limiting was similar for both the Global North and South. The lack of qualified and capable applicants was particularly highly rated as a bottleneck in Asia and for corporate/producer welfare campaigns. (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/animal-advocacy-bottlenecks\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, 2021</u></a>)</p><p>In line with their previous survey, AAC also identified that a high threshold is required for individuals to help animals more by choosing careers focused on donating money to nonprofits rather than dedicating time and labour directly, even for roles which are not necessarily the hardest to hire for. They note that one \u201ccould interpret these results as suggesting that organisations would rather receive one additional very-high quality applicant for the roles that are hardest to hire for than receive $25,000 or more (each year for the length of time that the applicant might otherwise have been employed for)\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/animal-advocacy-bottlenecks\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, 2021</u></a>). However, this finding should not be taken extremely strongly due to concerns about reasoning and interpretation of the corresponding survey question. The finding is also somewhat at odds with AAC\u2019s other finding that funding is the biggest bottleneck for the organisations in their survey.</p><p>Nevertheless, the report provides moderately strong evidence that the availability of high quality applicants for paid roles is a major concern for animal advocacy organisations.</p><p>More specifically, organisations that participated in the survey faced the most substantial hiring difficulties for roles focusing on leadership or senior management, fundraising or development, and government, policy, lobbying, or legal tasks. However, on average, this difficulty peaked at 3.6, where 3 represented somewhat difficult and 5 represented very much. There were generally higher difficulties in meeting talent bottlenecks in the Global South and Asia, compared to the Global North and not Asia. There were few differences by role type in terms of retaining staff, though fundraising and development stood out as slightly more difficult than average. Retention challenges were considerably lower for each position than hiring challenges, suggesting that responders found hiring a larger issue than retaining talent. To address existing talent bottlenecks, respondents commonly suggested headhunting and training for current staff as solutions. (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/animal-advocacy-bottlenecks\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, 2021</u></a>)</p><p>Continuing their efforts of identifying the crucial talent bottlenecks in the movement, AAC published further research into the hiring challenges faced by organisations in 2022. This most recent survey was less extensive than the previous one explained above, as AAC did not expect things to have changed drastically over a relatively short period of time and aimed to reduce the effort for participating organisations. (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/hiring-difficulties\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, 2022</u></a>) The key findings are thus only summarised shortly here as follows:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cAs with some of our previous evidence, this survey suggests that senior leadership roles are most difficult to hire for, followed by fundraising and development roles. There were some results that differed from our previous research, such as an absence of evidence that \u201cIT or software\u201d roles are particularly difficult to hire for.</i></p><p><i>We also asked some questions about what might make candidates for roles seem more or less promising. One surprising finding here was that having an additional year of volunteering with effective animal advocacy nonprofits using relevant professional expertise was evaluated more favourably than having an additional year of somewhat relevant paid experience.\u201d</i> (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/hiring-difficulties\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, 2022</u></a>)</p></blockquote><p>Overall, the evidence from AAC\u2019s own research suggests that talent is a major bottleneck for animal advocacy organisations, specifically in fundraising, leadership, management, and development. While funding was identified as the largest bottleneck for organisations, increased fundraising talent may go some way towards addressing this.</p><p><strong>Further external evidence</strong></p><p>Apart from the research conducted by AAC themselves and their \u2018parent organisation\u2019 CE, we also have to investigate external evidence to understand whether the problem that AAC is trying to address is really as important as they claim it is.</p><p>On their website, Animal Advocacy Careers (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/about\"><u>n.d.-a</u></a>) make the case that capacity building, the area of work which AAC\u2019s services belong to, is relatively neglected in the effective animal advocacy movement. First, they quote a study from Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) from 2018 to highlight that capacity building receives only an estimated 2.5% of all resources spent by the U.S. farmed animal movement (<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/ace-highlight-allocation-of-resources/\"><u>Animal Charity Evaluators, 2018</u></a>). Second, they link to an EA Forum post by their co-founder Jamie Harris (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7sdcXbTqjgFwzds2S/effective-animal-advocacy-movement-building-a-neglected\"><u>2019</u></a>), highlighting that there are strong movement building initiatives in Effective Altruism generally, but that these tend to neglect animal welfare as a cause area and focus instead on more long-termist objectives. This provides some evidence that addressing talent bottlenecks might be a neglected issue, just as other capacity and movement building activities.</p><p>Rethink Priorities seems to corroborate the view that talent constraints are a high priority issue in their 2023 survey of 35 key decision-makers in the animal advocacy community. They find that the most lacking are experts on the developing world or specific neglected but populous countries, fundraisers, and government and policy and/or lobbying experts. However, as shown in the graph below, they also report that the majority of respondents does not find it either \u2018quite\u2019 or \u2018somewhat\u2019 hard to find outstanding candidates who want to work at their organisation. (<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/animal-advocacy-strategy-forum-2023-summary\"><u>Rethink Priorities, 2023</u></a>)</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/c2q4EetRFKqAzzxQt/qc50zmidivdxcm1udh4n\"></p><p>The share of respondents who had indicated that it is hard to find outstanding candidates was higher in the previous year\u2019s survey (<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/2022-effective-animal-advocacy-forum-survey\"><u>Rethink Priorities, 2022</u></a>). This provides some evidence that talent gaps might be declining. This could be a result of AAC\u2019s work on filling talent gaps, but it is hard to establish a causal effect here.</p><p>Overall, the contrary evidence cited is not strong enough for us to suggest that talent gaps are not still a major bottleneck for the animal advocacy movement. The bulk of the evidence suggests that AAC\u2019s focus area of improving the talent base within the movement is an important problem to work on. However, Rethink Priorities\u2019 findings highlight the need for continuously monitoring this issue, understanding whether AAC might hit diminishing returns and the movement might experience a talent overhang (compared to other scarce resources) at some time in the future. There is a possibility that AAC\u2019s services will be less needed in the future.</p><p>This view is supported by the fact that a variety of capacity-building initiatives have emerged within the movement over the last years. Organisations like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://veganadvocacy.org/\"><u>Center for Effective Vegan Advocacy</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://proveggrants.org/\"><u>ProVeg</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scarletspark.org/\"><u>Scarlet Spark</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themissionmotor.org/\"><u>The Mission Motor</u></a> run courses, trainings, accelerators, and incubators, or provide mentoring and consulting. Other organisations focus on building the capacity of the movement in certain geographic areas, like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/\"><u>Animal Advocacy Africa</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalallianceasia.org/\"><u>Animal Alliance Asia</u></a>. Still others specialise in careers and talent bottlenecks in the movement-adjacent alternative protein space, like the Good Food Institute (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gfi.org/resource/talent-database/\"><u>talent database</u></a>) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://talist.org/\"><u>T\u00e4list</u></a>. This emergence of broader capacity-building services needs to be monitored in order for AAC to coordinate with others and direct its resources towards the most important bottlenecks and most cost-effective solutions. We are not concerned about this though. It is our understanding that AAC is actively coordinating with other actors like the ones mentioned above to make sure that there is no duplication of efforts and the most important needs of the movement are addressed. The fact that AAC played an important role in the initiation of two of the organisations mentioned above strongly supports this view.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>Overall, we find that talent indeed seems to be a major bottleneck in the movement. While funding seems to be an even greater need for the movement, organisations are still willing to trade off significant amounts of money for access to better candidates. AAC is thus addressing an important problem. However, it is important to monitor this need over the next few years, as talent gaps are gradually being filled and other capacity-building initiatives emerge.</p><h2>1.2 Programme description</h2><p>AAC works to empower animal advocates and organisations who themselves work on improving welfare directly. Their primary pathway to achieving this is through strengthening the talent pool available to animal advocacy organisations. Apart from that, as secondary streams towards impact, AAC also supports organisations in their hiring practices and aims to strengthen the wider ecosystem of farmed animal advocacy (i.e., by increasing donations to the movement and supporting the creation of new organisations).</p><p>In order to achieve their goal, AAC is running a variety of programmes. In this section, we provide an overview of these programmes, using publicly available information from AAC\u2019s website and internal descriptions that AAC has made available to us. We therefore do not provide sources below, except for specific quotes or examples. We only include programmes that are either still active, have been active until recently, or still have relevance for AAC\u2019s current activities. For instance, AAC\u2019s management and leadership training is not included here, as it was suspended years ago and is not relevant anymore.</p><p><strong>Career advice resources</strong></p><p>AAC is providing career advice to individuals that are interested in contributing to the movement by publishing freely available content on their website. They showcase a wide variety of resources that can help people create a strong career in animal advocacy. On the one hand, they write and publish their own reports and posts. This includes, among others, their skill profiles (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/skills-profiles\"><u>here</u></a>), an \u201cEssential Guide for Animal Advocacy\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/free-guide\"><u>here</u></a>), a series of animal advocate profiles (see for example&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/animal-advocate-series-haven-king-nobles\"><u>here</u></a>), a series of posts about career paths (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/donate-to-animal-charities\"><u>here</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/careers-to-help-animals\"><u>here</u></a>), or explorations of certain specific ideas (see for example&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/jobs-working-with-animals\"><u>here</u></a>). On the other hand, they compile other/external helpful and relevant resources&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/resources\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Earning to give</strong></p><p>A fairly recent addition is AAC\u2019s programme on earning to give. Given that there is a limited number of roles available in the movement and not everyone will be a good fit for those or be willing to completely change career paths, AAC has decided to more actively encourage people to take the Giving What We Can pledge or otherwise make significant donations to effective animal advocacy organisations. This programme aims to contribute to a more diversified and robust funding ecosystem for the movement. In order to fulfil this aim, AAC develops website content and marketing materials to spread their message, hoping for this to be a potentially low-cost and high-return way of bringing value to the movement. As such, this programme is highly related to the career advice resources mentioned above and we do not include it separately in our theory of change in&nbsp;<u>section 2</u>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Career advice calls</strong></p><p>AAC is also giving career advice in direct calls with people, supporting them in their career planning and concrete next steps. While the first stream of career advice above provides generic information and input, this second stream is more personalised and targeted. This service is aimed at only very promising individuals due to the larger time investment needed to conduct these calls. They have trialled both 1-1 and group formats over the last years, focusing more on the latter lately in order to improve the cost-effectiveness of this service.</p><p><strong>Online course</strong></p><p>AAC is running a free, self-paced \u201cIntroduction to Animal Advocacy\u201d online course. The course is based on the research and resources described above in the first stream of AAC\u2019s career advice activities and provides a relatively basic introduction to a potentially high-impact career within the farmed animal advocacy movement. With an expected time commitment of roughly 9-18 hours participants are supposed to discover relevant career options, design their career plans, and define actionable next steps. Participants do not have to do the full course, but can pick and choose sessions. Successful participants receive a certificate and are invited to be included in AAC\u2019s talent database which is shared with hiring managers (see&nbsp;<u>below</u>). This is a scalable programme that requires much less staff time per person than personalised career advice.</p><p><strong>Job board</strong></p><p>AAC hosts a job board on its website, highlighting roles at impact-focused animal nonprofits and key details such as location and application deadline. The board is updated weekly based on AAC\u2019s active research and suggestions by others. Because of AAC\u2019s primary aim of connecting individuals with roles directly within the animal advocacy organisations, the board does not include potentially high-impact roles in academia, government, food companies, or similar. For such roles, AAC refers to other resources (e.g. skill profiles, other job boards). Related to this job board is an AAC mailing list that informs interested people directly about current relevant opportunities.</p><p><strong>Fundraising work placement</strong></p><p>AAC has run a fundraising work placement programme for the first time in 2022. The programme was informed by previous AAC research on the needs and bottlenecks in the movement (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/hiring-difficulties\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, 2022</u></a>) and aimed to place promising individuals into remote, paid, temporary fundraising positions at effective animal advocacy nonprofits. Participating individuals first did independent learning with AAC\u2019s support for 10-30 hours and were connected with other fundraisers and advocates, before being matched with a partner organisation. They were compensated for the full process. They then moved on to work full- or part-time at the partner organisation for three months, aiming to fill common fundraising bottlenecks and thereby increase the organisation\u2019s impact. Participants were supposed to develop important skills, make connections, and build experience, potentially getting hired by their organisation for a job after the temporary placement.</p><p><strong>Recruitment</strong></p><p>AAC has experimented with different direct recruitment services. At the beginning, AAC directly supported organisations with recruitment for leadership, management, and fundraising roles, as these were harder to fill than others and could significantly affect the organisations\u2019 impact. In addition, AAC occasionally offered guidance on organisations\u2019 hiring and recruitment practices, either as a substitute for or in addition to their primary search efforts. However, this form of recruitment service was discontinued based on internal evaluation results (see&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.2.2</u>). It is therefore also not included in the theory of change we outline in&nbsp;<u>section 2</u>.</p><p><strong>Top candidate database</strong></p><p>Instead, AAC decided to trial a new version of recruitment service from October 2022 onwards: their top candidate database. This database includes candidates for which participating organisations report that they have been unsuccessful in an application with them but seem promising. The database is privately shared with partner organisations to consider in their hiring processes. The aim is to avoid the drain of talent from the movement and increase access to strong candidates for animal advocacy organisations.</p><p><strong>Inclusive hiring skills workshops</strong></p><p>In collaboration with Tania Luna, AAC has run a series of three workshops for hiring professionals (e.g., HR managers, founders) of roughly 90 minutes each. Originally, tickets had to be bought for attending these workshops (at USD 249 for all three workshops as a bundle), but the sessions are now freely available on AAC\u2019s website based on email signup. The content focuses on strategies for successful talent acquisition and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices, aiming to build better teams at animal advocacy organisations. Participants are supplied with tools, skills, insights, and a community of like minded people. The idea is nicely summarised by this quote from AAC\u2019s website: \u201cLet\u2019s come together to make the world a better place for animals by making the workplace better for people\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/inclusive-hiring-program\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, n.d.-c</u></a>). This programme is different from AAC\u2019s other work, as it focuses on hiring practices instead of the enhanced access to strong candidates. It therefore also follows a different path to impact in the theory of change that we outline in&nbsp;<u>section 2</u>.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>In sum, we have identified the following services that seem relevant for AAC\u2019s theory of change: career advice calls, career advice resources, fundraising work placement, inclusive hiring skills workshops, job board, online course, and top candidate database. Here we exclude the earning to give and recruitment programmes described above, since the former is subsumed under the career advice resources and the latter was suspended in 2022.</p><h1>2 Theory of change</h1><h2>2.1 &nbsp; Causal chain</h2><p>In order to understand exactly how AAC aims to tackle the need described in&nbsp;<u>section 1.1</u> with the programmes described in&nbsp;<u>section 1.2</u>, we have constructed a theory of change (ToC) for their work. The ToC outlines the different steps that need to hold true in order for AAC to have the desired positive effect on animal welfare.</p><p>In constructing this ToC, we first aimed to take an unbiased outside view, trying to understand the different pillars of AAC\u2019s work and how they fit together to create positive change. We actively refrained from looking at existing ToCs about AAC\u2019s work at this first stage. Once we felt comfortable about our ToC, we consulted existing ToCs (a simple one from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/programs\"><u>AAC\u2019s website</u></a>, another very simple one from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/animal-advocacy-careers/\"><u>Animal Charity Evaluators</u></a>, and a more comprehensive internal one provided to us privately by AAC) in order to see whether we had missed any crucial considerations or had made any mistakes. We also consulted AAC staff for feedback on some open questions. We found that the ToC we had constructed was reasonable and did not include major mistakes. However, we detected some minor omissions that we then added to our conceptualisation (e.g. the potential for AAC to lead people to impactful paths outside of the narrow animal advocacy movement that can help improve animal welfare, like earning to give or working on alternative proteins).</p><p>The full visualisation that resulted from this process is shown in the picture below and is available with better visibility&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.canva.com/design/DAF1_3iI16M/mykTdXRIDMYplyl-Qm9KBw/edit?utm_content=DAF1_3iI16M&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link2&amp;utm_source=sharebutton\"><u>here</u></a>. The outputs are the seven programmes identified in&nbsp;<u>section 1.2</u>. The numbers indicate assumptions that need to hold for the different steps to work out as intended. Their colours represent the level of uncertainty for this specific assumption/part of the ToC prior to a deeper evidence review, from red (high), to yellow (medium), and green (low).</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/c2q4EetRFKqAzzxQt/aummawcug9ewqfj6ks9g\"></p><h2>2.2 &nbsp; Outlining assumptions and levels of uncertainty</h2><p>In this section we outline the assumptions that we identified in the ToC shown above, highlighting some preliminary thoughts and considerations, before we try to resolve as many uncertainties as possible via our&nbsp;<u>evidence review in section 3</u>.</p><p><i>1. AAC can find out which are the most important bottlenecks and most promising careers in animal advocacy.</i></p><p>This assumption seems extremely important for AAC\u2019s ToC. If they cannot find out what the most important bottlenecks and most promising careers in animal advocacy are, they cannot give helpful advice. Their impact would then mostly be in helping people to find opportunities/roles (see assumption #6), giving animal advocacy organisations access to a candidate database (see assumption #8), and improving the hiring skills of these organisations (see assumption #9). Our initial assumption is that AAC\u2019s biggest impact comes from skill-building and providing research and resources to interested individuals (assumption #13). We therefore think that AAC would be left with only a fraction of its impact, if assumption #1 broke down and all of the tightly related services (career advice, online course, and fundraising work placement) could not positively impact people\u2019s career trajectory.</p><p>Overall, it seems plausible that AAC can arrive at findings that marginally improve career decisions. Our needs assessment in&nbsp;<u>section 1.1</u> has already described some research that seems relevant in this regard. It is important for AAC to continuously monitor this though, which we understand they do.</p><p><i>2. AAC is able to publish research and resources that are interesting/relevant to a wide-enough target audience.</i></p><p>It seems plausible that content might not be used/consumed by many people. Only if the resources are used can they have an impact on people\u2019s careers.</p><p>However, the assumption is not absolutely necessary to hold for AAC to have the ultimate impact they aim for, since there are other programmes / parallel paths. If we find that the resources are not widely used, AAC might consider shutting down this part of their activities. This seems unlikely to be a good course of action though, since the underlying research and resources are important for other parts of their works as well (direct career advice, etc.). Even if this public part of AAC\u2019s research would not provide much direct external value, the research should generate a solid foundation for their other services.</p><p><i>3. AAC is able to give direct career advice that is interesting/relevant to a wide-enough target audience.</i></p><p>If the direct career advice service is not frequently requested/used, this part of AAC\u2019s services could be suspended, as it is not crucial for other parts of the ToC to hold.</p><p>Our prior familiarity with AAC\u2019s work suggests that this is an attractive service for people and is well-received.</p><p><i>4. AAC is able to run an online course that is interesting/relevant to a wide-enough target audience.</i></p><p>Our initial perspective on this assumption is the same as for assumption #3.</p><p><i>5. AAC is able to run a fundraising work placement programme that is interesting/relevant to a wide-enough target audience.</i></p><p>Our initial perspective on this assumption is similar as for assumptions #3 and 4.</p><p>However, this programme was only run in 2022 and seems not to have been repeated so far due to funding constraints (<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/animal-advocacy-careers\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship, n.d.</u></a>). This might imply that funders did not judge this programme as a good use of resources. Whether this is true or whether there are other reasons for the programme having only been run once is an important aspect to check in our review.</p><p><i>6. AAC is able to curate an overview of opportunities/roles that is interesting/relevant to a wide-enough target audience.</i></p><p>This is an important assumption that needs to hold in order for AAC to be able to help individuals find high-impact roles and opportunities. In theory, AAC could also suspend this service and only focus on other services. As described under assumption #1, we assume that AAC\u2019s largest impact comes from equipping people with the advice and skills they need to have a strong career in animal advocacy (assumption #13). This could also be done without facilitating the search for roles/opportunities. In practice however, we think that there is a strong interplay between equipping people with advice and skills on the one hand and showcasing potential roles and opportunities on the other hand. It is thus important for this assumption to hold in order for AAC to achieve its full impact on talent availability in the animal advocacy movement.</p><p>It seems fairly straightforward to curate an overview of opportunities and roles. Our prior familiarity with AAC\u2019s work suggests that this is an attractive service for people and is well-received.</p><p><i>7. AAC is able to do effective outreach and build a strong network of individuals and organisations that want to use their services.</i></p><p>Strong marketing, outreach, and networking is an important supporting factor for all of AAC\u2019s services. On the one hand, it helps AAC to drive more individuals towards their services, thereby increasing the value of their services to the movement. On the other hand, a strong network of partner organisations also helps to enhance AAC\u2019s offering and make it more attractive to individuals. This assumption is thus an important one for AAC to have a strong impact.</p><p>Our prior familiarity with AAC\u2019s work suggests that they have marketed their services well and dispose of a good network of individuals and organisations.</p><p><i>8. AAC is able to maintain a candidate database that is interesting/relevant to animal advocacy organisations.</i></p><p>Our initial perspective on this assumption is similar as for assumptions #3 and 4.</p><p>If the candidate database is not frequently used, this part of AAC\u2019s services could be suspended, as it is not crucial for other parts of the ToC to hold. We do not know how well-received the service is though.</p><p><i>9. AAC is able to run inclusive hiring skills workshops that are interesting/relevant to animal advocacy professionals.</i></p><p>This part of the ToC seems fairly detached from AAC\u2019s other streams of impact. It should constitute a very minor part of their overall impact. As such, this assumption is not necessary to hold. We still decided to include this aspect of AAC\u2019s work in order to get a comprehensive picture of all the ways in which they aim to improve the lives of animals.</p><p>If the workshops are not frequently requested/used, this part of AAC\u2019s services could be suspended, as it is not crucial for other parts of the ToC to hold. We do not know how well-received the workshops are. The fact that they are now offered for free, while they previously had a significant price tag, suggests that demand was not too high.</p><p><i>10. Consumers of AAC\u2019s services decide to found their own organisations.</i></p><p>AAC\u2019s focus seems to be on getting people into roles directly at animal advocacy organisations. However, some people might be influenced by AAC\u2019s career advice to start their own organisation in animal advocacy. Given the large potential value of charity entrepreneurship, the value of this could be significant, even if it only affects a small number of people. We are unsure whether AAC\u2019s work has had any significant effects in this respect so far.</p><p><i>11. Consumers of AAC\u2019s services enhance their career plans and capabilities for work outside of direct animal advocacy that still helps the animal advocacy movement or to improve animal welfare.</i></p><p>Similar to assumption #10, AAC might also influence people to change their career paths into adjacent areas that help animal welfare, like working on alternative proteins or earning to give to animal causes. This should probably not be the main path of AAC\u2019s impact on people\u2019s careers, but it could have significant value and should be considered. In fact, this path might become more relevant now and in the future, as AAC has started a dedicated earning to give programme, as described in&nbsp;<u>section 1.2</u>.</p><p><i>12. Consumers of AAC\u2019s services increase their donations to or otherwise cause counterfactual funding increases for effective animal advocacy organisations.</i></p><p>The earning to give path directly influences people\u2019s donations to effective animal advocacy organisations. However, AAC\u2019s services might also have an effect on the donations of people that are not explicitly choosing a career path focused on earning to give. We are unsure whether AAC\u2019s work has had any significant effects in this respect so far.</p><p>In addition, AAC\u2019s fundraising work placement programme directly aimed at strengthening the funding situation for participating organisations.</p><p><i>13. Consumers of AAC\u2019s services enhance their career plans and capabilities for work in direct animal advocacy.</i></p><p>This assumption is crucial to hold for AAC to have its desired ultimate impact, as a lot of their services are geared towards exactly this outcome.</p><p>If the programmes are well-designed and well-received, this assumption should be likely to hold as well. We have to look for evidence on how AAC influences people\u2019s career plans and capabilities. In the optimal case, we can break this down by service, to see how much impact each of the different services has.</p><p>We also have to consider counterfactuals here, namely what other paths the consumers of AAC\u2019s services would have pursued in the absence of AAC\u2019s services. Overall, the validity of this assumption is crucial for AAC\u2019s overall impact.</p><p><i>14. Consumers of AAC\u2019s services increase their awareness of relevant roles and opportunities.</i></p><p>As written before (see assumption #6), we assume that AAC\u2019s largest impact comes from equipping people with the advice and skills they need to have a strong career in animal advocacy (assumption #13). This could also be done without facilitating the search for roles/opportunities. In practice however, we think that there is a strong interplay between equipping people with advice and skills on the one hand and showcasing potential roles and opportunities on the other hand. It is thus important for this assumption to hold in order for AAC to achieve its full impact on talent availability in the animal advocacy movement.</p><p>If the preceding assumptions hold (AAC\u2019s programmes are well-designed and well-received and they are able to curate and distribute relevant opportunities), this assumption should be very likely to hold as well.</p><p><i>15. AAC\u2019s activities cause an influx of more and/or better talent to animal advocacy organisations.</i></p><p>This assumption is crucial to hold, as it arguably describes the key outcome of AAC\u2019s work (based on our understanding and statements made by AAC)..</p><p>If the preceding assumptions hold , this assumption should be likely to hold as well. However, since this assumption is so crucial, we have to look for evidence on how AAC\u2019s work influences organisations.</p><p><i>16. AAC\u2019s workshops improve the hiring processes of animal advocacy organisations.</i></p><p>As written before (see assumption #9), this part of the ToC seems fairly detached from AAC\u2019s other streams of impact. It should constitute a very minor part of their overall impact. As such, this assumption is not necessary to hold. We still decided to include this aspect of AAC\u2019s work in order to get a comprehensive picture of all the ways in which they aim to improve the lives of animals.</p><p>The impact of workshops on organisations seems uncertain. If workshops do not have an impact on hiring processes, this part of AAC\u2019s services could be suspended, as it is not crucial for other parts of the ToC to hold. We need to evaluate this.</p><p><i>17. Better candidates and hiring processes lead to better staff.</i></p><p>This assumption seems very straightforward and we will not review it in detail here.</p><p><i>18. Better staff allows organisations to do more effective work for animals.</i></p><p>This assumption seems very straightforward.</p><p>However, we need to consider here that a lack of talent may not be a main limiting factor for organisations to do more effective work. Instead, they may lack funding or may be inhibited by other factors. Our needs assessment in&nbsp;<u>section 1.1</u> indeed showed evidence that a lack of funding, unfavourable attitudes from targets, and a lack of public awareness all ranked before a lack of talent when it comes to the most important bottlenecks. However, lack of talent still emerged as a major limiting factor and there is some evidence that organisations prefer talent over donations in certain cases. Overall, this assumption should hold.</p><p><i>19. Increased funding allows organisations to do more effective work for animals.</i></p><p>This assumption seems very straightforward, as our needs assessment in section 1.1 has shown that funding seems to be the major bottleneck for the movement. We will therefore not review this assumption in detail.</p><p><i>20. Career paths outside of existing animal advocacy organisations enhance the movement\u2019s ability to help animals.</i></p><p>This assumption seems very straightforward. If individuals choose to found their own animal advocacy organisation or decide to work in adjacent sectors (i.e. policy, alternative proteins), this should positively influence the movement\u2019s ability to effectively help animals.</p><p><i>21. More effective work for animals improves animal welfare.</i></p><p>This assumption seems true by definition (almost tautological) and we will not review it in detail here.</p><h1>3&nbsp; &nbsp; Evidence review</h1><p>In this section, we use evidence to inform our view of the validity of the different steps and assumptions in the ToC described in&nbsp;<u>section 2</u>. We first look at evidence collected by AAC themselves in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1</u>, aiming to give an overview of AAC\u2019s monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) efforts, explain what we can learn from them, and make recommendations about improvements. We then additionally consult external evidence in&nbsp;<u>section 3.2</u>, in order to get a broader understanding of AAC\u2019s streams of work. In&nbsp;<u>section 3.3</u>, we summarise how this analysis of internal and external data updates our view on AAC\u2019s ToC and the key steps and assumptions it involves. Readers looking for a compact summary of our findings are invited to jump to&nbsp;<u>section 3.3</u> directly.</p><h2>3.1 &nbsp; Evidence collected by the organisation</h2><p>Our review of the evidence collected by AAC mainly distinguishes between two kinds of evidence: monitoring and evaluation evidence. These different aspects are often also called \u2018process evaluation\u2019 and \u2018impact evaluation\u2019 (<a href=\"https://www.betterevaluation.org/getting-started/what-evaluation\"><u>BetterEvaluation, n.d.</u></a>). The former aims to understand whether the programmes are properly implemented and how they could be improved (e.g., by understanding completion rates and satisfaction scores of a course), while the latter is focused on the observed changes caused by the programmes, also taking counterfactuals into account (e.g., improvements in participants\u2019 capabilities or changes in their career outcomes that are a result of participation in a course). We consider as monitoring evidence everything that covers activities and outputs in our ToC (assumptions #1 to 9). The remaining part of the ToC (assumptions #10 to 21) is analysed with the help of evaluation evidence, as it is concerned with the outcomes and impact of AAC\u2019s work.</p><p>We primarily use data that AAC has provided to us directly for this evaluation, as this should be the most up-to-date and accurate data available. We only referred to their yearly reviews (for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/2021-plans-and-2020-review\"><u>2020</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/2022-plans-and-2021-review\"><u>2021</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/year-in-review-2022\"><u>2022</u></a>) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/impact\"><u>impact page</u></a> as well as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/animal-advocacy-careers\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s overview page on AAC</u></a> where this seemed helpful or necessary.</p><p>In&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.1</u>, we first give an overview of the kinds of data that AAC is collecting, detailing their M&amp;E approach and its strengths and weaknesses. In&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.2</u>, we then move on to describe the results and findings from this internal data. Across the two sections, we do not only describe AAC\u2019s M&amp;E efforts but also provide our perspective and make recommendations about improvements.</p><h3>3.1.1 What type of evidence are they collecting?</h3><p><strong>3.1.1.1 Monitoring evidence</strong></p><p><strong>The approach</strong></p><p>AAC collects different monitoring data for the different programmes they are running. AAC\u2019s leadership reported to us that this data was scattered until recently, but they now have a comprehensive overview of monitoring data for their different programmes. We used this internal overview to understand what kind of monitoring data is collected for each of the programmes.</p><p>Below, we provide an overview of the metrics used for the different programmes described in&nbsp;<u>section 1.2</u> (in alphabetical order). This list is probably not exhaustive but should cover the most important aspects. We exclude all impact-focused metrics (e.g. number of placements caused) here, since they are covered under evaluation evidence in&nbsp;<u>the next section</u>.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Programme</strong></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Monitoring metrics</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Career advice calls</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">1:1 and group calls</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Career advice resources</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><i>No clear monitoring found for this service</i></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Earning to give</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><i>No clear monitoring found for this service</i></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Fundraising work placement</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Applicants</p><p>Candidates placed</p><p>Diversity of applicants and candidates</p><p>Organisations participating</p><p>Organisations satisfied with placements</p><p>Dropouts (candidates and organisations)</p><p>Time required for running programme</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Inclusive hiring skills workshops</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Organisations participating</p><p>Paid tickets</p><p>Repeat attendees</p><p>Issues identified and addressed in events</p><p>Usefulness and enjoyment of events</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Job board</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Roles listed</p><p>Organisations included</p><p>Page views (main and all other job board pages)</p><p>Users (all job board pages)</p><p>\u201cApply now\u201d clicks</p><p>\u201cView job details\u201d clicks</p><p>Mailing list stats (e.g., subscribers, open rates)</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Online course</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Sign-ups</p><p>Enrollments</p><p>Completions and completion rate</p><p>Certificates</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Recruitment</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Organisations supported</p><p>Roles assisted with</p><p>Candidates introduced to roles</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Top candidate database</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Candidates listed (incl. share from developing countries and with skills in key bottlenecks)<br>Organisations participating</p><p>Referrals from organisations</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>In addition to these programme-specific metrics, AAC also collects monitoring data on their marketing efforts (assumption #7). This was reported to us by AAC\u2019s leadership, but we did not see a comprehensive overview of this data and did not have the time to inquire further on this.</p><p><strong>Our perspective and recommendations</strong></p><p>Overall, AAC\u2019s monitoring approach seems reasonable and it is positive to see that AAC has an overview of monitoring metrics for almost all of its programmes. These metrics can help to reduce our uncertainties on assumptions #2 to 9.</p><p>However, we see some areas that could be reviewed and potentially improved upon:</p><ul><li>We are unsure how the monitoring data is used to make decisions internally. We generally recommend that AAC make sure that all of this data is collected with a specific purpose in mind and that they focus on those metrics that are relevant for their decision making.</li><li>Monitoring data is missing for those services that AAC provides to a broad audience via its website or general online presence, namely the generic career advice resources and its earning to give outreach. While we understand that it is hard to track the impact of activities whose effects are so scattered as for these generic services, we still think that there is some monitoring data that could be collected. For instance, just as for its job board, AAC could track the number of page views for its career advice resources. Even though such data might not provide a strong basis for evaluating the effectiveness of these programmes, they can be a first step towards understanding the relevance of different career advice pages (over time) and improving the services provided on that basis.</li><li>For some of the programmes, AAC only collects \u2018hard\u2019 data such as the number of people and organisations affected, but neglects to collect \u2018softer\u2019 data that can yield more qualitative insights for improving the services. For instance, both the career advice calls and the online course do not seem to solicit feedback from participants on the services provided, understanding how valuable they are and how they could be improved. This might be a missed opportunity for AAC. However, we acknowledge the limitations of such data (e.g., positivity bias in responses) and understand the associated costs (e.g., effort for both AAC and its advisees). This should therefore be seen as a weaker suggestion than the other ones above.</li></ul><p><strong>3.1.1.2 Evaluation evidence</strong></p><p><strong>The approach</strong></p><p>AAC adopts a meticulous approach to evaluating the impact of its programmes, mainly focusing on an innovative metric: the number of Importance- and Counterfactual-Adjusted Placements (ICAPs). This rigorous method underpins their commitment to steering more talent towards the animal advocacy movement, directly addressing assumption #15 in our ToC: the influx of more and/or better talent into animal advocacy organisations. Moreover, the evaluation of ICAPs extends to encompass people founding their own organisations or working in adjacent sectors like alternative proteins, thereby also informing assumption #20.</p><p>ICAPs are calculated via a three-step process:</p><ol><li>Identifying potential placements:<br>AAC's first step aims to detect new placements for people who previously participated in AAC\u2019s programmes. This involves the quarterly monitoring of LinkedIn profiles and conducting annual surveys, as well as direct feedback from organisations.</li><li>Interviewing placements:<br>Once potential placements are identified, AAC tries to conduct interviews with each individual to assess the counterfactual impact of their services. This critical step determines the extent to which AAC's intervention contributed to the placement's success.</li><li>Assessing and adjusting placements:<br>The final step involves adjusting the placement score based on the counterfactuals identified in the interviews and making a subjective importance assessment based on the organisation's and the role's significance. These adjustments transform the placement figures into ICAPs. For each ICAP, AAC estimates an addition of $37,500 to the movement. This calculation is based on the assumption that each placement is at least 10% better than the next best candidate and will continue working in the movement for 7.5 years, with an average salary of $50,000 annually. In&nbsp;<u>section 4</u>, we will provide more details on the reasoning behind these calculations and describe our perspective on their validity.</li></ol><p>Next to their ICAPs metric, AAC also monitors significant donations influenced by their efforts. This tracking is facilitated through communications with Giving What We Can, where pledgers are asked about contributing factors to their decisions, and AAC's annual surveys. For their most recent earning to give programme, AAC is collecting the number of giving pledges they caused. AAC has also tracked the funds raised and time saved for organisations participating in the Fundraising Work Placement programme. This involved surveying and interviewing participant organisations and assessing counterfactuals to determine the extent of the funds raised due to the programme. For the Fundraising Work Placement programme, AAC also collected further evaluation evidence, specifically how many participants changed their career plans after the programme.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on all of this data, twice a year, AAC conducts evaluations of each programme's performance to decide whether to stop, pivot, continue, or scale them up. This decision-making process is particularly challenging for newer programmes with fewer ICAPs. In such cases, AAC sets specific goals and failure points that programmes must meet to continue. Early-stage evaluations rely on programme data, feedback from organisations and candidates, and potential assessments relative to other AAC programmes. For more established programmes, the ICAPs generated are compared against the effort invested to estimate cost-effectiveness (see&nbsp;<u>section 4</u>). Some write ups of detailed evaluations of specific programmes are publicly available&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/career-advice-impact-animals\"><u>here</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/analysis-of-aac-s-job-board-data\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Our perspective and recommendations</strong></p><p>Overall, the description above documents an elaborate and rigorous evaluation approach. The use of ICAPs is an especially innovative and strong method to measure outcomes.</p><p>However, every approach will inevitably have its limitations. Below we list the most important limitations for AAC\u2019s current methodology. We also explain if and how these limitations should be addressed, considering the costs associated with potential enhancements.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Assumptions and omissions in ICAPs calculations:<ul><li>AAC\u2019s approach for identifying placements possibly misses placements not represented on LinkedIn or through survey responses. This issue is especially relevant in developing countries. However, the current process employed by AAC seems reasonable and should cover the majority of placements influenced. Getting a completely exhaustive overview of all placements does not seem realistic and would be associated with excessive effort.</li><li>AAC anticipates a time lag of 6-24 months between intervention and measurable results, meaning their most recent impact estimates (2023) could be significant understatements. This is an inherent limitation given the longer time periods over which AAC\u2019s impact unfolds. Noting this limitation and considering it in evaluations in decisions seems sufficient.&nbsp;</li><li>AAC experiences some drop-off in interview responses in step two and estimates that about 80% of their impact is traceable through these interviews. Once again, we think that this is a natural limitation for interviews and think that AAC\u2019s current response rate is acceptable.</li><li>All of the three bullet points above suggest that AAC\u2019s ICAP estimates are conservative. AAC could add a factor in their calculations that accounts for such missing data. However, we appreciate that AAC only considers the impact of those placements that they know they have influenced and does not artificially inflate their ICAP estimates. We agree that it is better to err on the conservative side here.</li><li>AAC\u2019s assessment of counterfactuals and the importance of certain placements is subjective. They try to guard against this issue by averaging the scores given by two people. To ensure the accuracy and impartiality of these judgments, AAC has also sought feedback from external stakeholders and experts. We have also done some sanity-checks on their scores ourselves (see&nbsp;<u>section 4</u>). We think that AAC could improve its process here and reduce noise in its judgements, by implementing clearer guardrails on how to score different placements (e.g., via a scoring rubric or framework).</li><li>AAC\u2019s estimates for the monetary value of an ICAP are based on crucial assumptions that reasonable people could disagree about. We provide more details and our perspective on this in&nbsp;<u>section 4</u>.</li></ul></li><li>Volunteering roles/placements are not tracked and not included in the ICAP calculation. We are unsure why AAC decided to drop this measurement, but suspect this to be due to the low expected impact and high data collection effort involved. The fact that AAC is not tracking this implies that some positive impact of their work might not be tracked and makes their ICAP estimates more conservative. We are unsure whether AAC should track such volunteer placements as well but suspect that AAC has good reasons not to do so.</li><li>AAC is not tracking attitude changes, career plan changes, or other behavioural changes (e.g., diet change). This seems reasonable, as AAC should focus on the most important metrics in order to avoid interview/survey fatigue.</li><li>AAC does not seem to robustly evaluate the impact that its services have on hiring practices, specifically when it comes to the inclusive hiring skills workshops. AAC had initially planned to evaluate these workshops in more depth via follow-up surveys. However, they decided to suspend this service, as another organisation was founded that would focus specifically on this issue (Scarlet Spark). Given these developments, a thorough evaluation is not planned anymore. We think that this decision is reasonable, also given that this service was quite separate from AAC\u2019s other programmes.</li><li>Just as for the monitoring evidence (see&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.1.1</u>), AAC is missing a method to gather evaluation evidence for their career advice resources and earning to give programmes. While we understand that it is hard to track the impact of activities whose effects are so scattered as for these generic services, we think that AAC should attempt to capture the effects of this as well. In our interview, AAC\u2019s leadership indicated that this issue is on their agenda.</li><li>AAC does not measure how much faster individuals entered the movement due to their interventions, like other organisations such as 80,000 Hours do. This seems fine to us, as their impact on people\u2019s careers is thoroughly assessed via their ICAPs metric.</li></ul><h3>3.1.2&nbsp; What are the results from that monitoring and evaluation evidence?</h3><p>As we now understand how AAC collects its internal data, we can describe what the results from that data collection look like in practice. As in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.1</u>, we start with monitoring data (<u>section 3.1.2.1</u>) and then move on to evaluation data (<u>section 3.1.2.2</u>).</p><p><strong>3.1.2.1 Monitoring evidence</strong></p><p><strong>The hard data</strong></p><p>It is hard to give an overview of monitoring data that allows for cross-programme comparisons. As described in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.1.1</u>, AAC collects different monitoring evidence for the different programmes it is running. In addition, the programmes have been run for different time frames and with different levels of effort invested. We therefore only record the numbers in the table below for readers to get a rough sense for different metrics across the different programmes for certain time frames. The numbers should be taken with caution, as we are unsure whether we read AAC\u2019s data correctly. They should be directionally correct though. The programmes for career advice resources, earning to give, and recruitment are not included, based on the analysis in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.1.1</u>.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th

AAC\u2019s monitoring data on marketing activities and did not have the time to inquire further on this.</p><p><strong>Further context and our perspective</strong></p><p>In addition to this rough overview, we can provide some further insights and our perspective on the different programmes:</p><ul><li>Career advice calls have been a steady component of AAC\u2019s work since the very beginning. The number of calls fluctuates over the different years. We expect this to be the result of this service being very time-intensive and AAC experimenting with 1:1 versus group calls. We know that the demand for these calls is high, but AAC needs to prioritise and can only allocate certain amounts of time to this service.</li><li>The initial fundraising work placement programme seems to have been well-received. The list of partner organisations for this initial programme seems impressive, including Animal Ethics, Sentient Media, Veganuary, Animal Advocacy Africa, and many more. The number and quality of applicants was also strong. In addition, AAC has conducted an assessment of the diversity of applicants and candidates for this programme. We did not check this in detail due to the limited amount of time available for this report.</li><li>The data for inclusive hiring skills workshops is very scarce and unclear. This makes sense in light of AAC\u2019s decision to drop this service, as described in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.1.2</u>. We therefore did not investigate this further.</li><li>The job board is steadily growing, both in terms of the number of roles listed and organisations included, as well as the number of people visiting and using it. This is a positive indication that the programme is running well.</li><li>The online course has also been a steady component of AAC\u2019s work since the beginning. The number of people who sign up, enrol, and complete the course has grown steadily over the years. We observe a slight drop in completion rates over time, but nothing that seems worrisome.</li><li>The top candidate database has been steadily growing for the first few months of operation. It seems too early to draw any conclusions here though.</li></ul><p>These findings positively update us on assumptions #3 (career advice calls), 4 (online course), 5 (fundraising work placement), and 6 (job board). A slight positive update on assumption #8 (top candidate database) could also be warranted. The data does not help us to reduce our uncertainty around assumption #2 (career advice resources), 7 (marketing and outreach activities), and 9 (inclusive hiring skills workshops) though.</p><p><strong>3.1.2.2 Evaluation evidence</strong></p><p><strong>The hard data</strong></p><p>When it comes to evaluation evidence, the crucial metric AAC uses are ICAPs. As described in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.1.2</u>, ICAPs are calculated for all programmes except for career advice resources, earning to give, and the inclusive hiring skills workshops. Since AAC has a comprehensive overview of ICAPs generated by each programme, we can directly replicate their evidence in the table below. It represents all ICAPs generated by AAC in the years 2019 to 2023 YTD. The last column sets the number of ICAPs generated in relation to the amount of resources invested into the programme. This allows us to draw conclusions on the relative effectiveness of the different programmes.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Programme</strong></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Base placements</strong></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>ICAPs</strong></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>USD cost per ICAP</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Career advice calls</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>22.1</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>14.6</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>3,056</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Fundraising work placement</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>5.0</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>3.2</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>39,028</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Job board</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>16.8</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>10.0</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>1,827</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Online course</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>31.9</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>8.4</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>6,335</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Recruitment</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>3.5</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>1.4</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>30,353</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Top candidate database</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>2.0</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>0.5</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>41,289</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Other</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>4.8</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>1.8</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>-</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Total</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>85.0</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>39.9</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>17,644</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Further context and our perspective</strong></p><p>These numbers are highly relevant, but of course need to be put in context. Below, we provide some further insights and our perspective on the different programmes:</p><ul><li>Due to their central position in AAC\u2019s evaluation efforts, it is important to check the validity of the ICAP estimates above. In order to do so, we perform some sanity checks and sensitivity analyses in&nbsp;<u>section 4</u>. For now, we will take these values as given.</li><li>The career advice course, job board, and online course are the three most cost-effective programmes for AAC. These three programmes are well-established and AAC should continue to run them in the foreseeable future.</li><li>Career advice calls seem cost-effective, but require large time investments. AAC is thus trying out different ways to make this even more efficient.</li><li>The online course is also well established and cost-effective, but is much more scalable.</li><li>The job board seems to be the most cost-effective programme when it comes to creating ICAPs. In addition, since it is fairly difficult to collect feedback from job board users (as for the other website content, as highlighted earlier), the number of ICAPs caused by AAC might be significantly higher and the cost per ICAP even lower.</li><li>The cost per ICAP is relatively high for the fundraising work placement, mostly due to the high effort involved and the large funding amounts needed. However, a large share of participants has landed a permanent role after the programme. Next to ICAPs, AAC has measured the amount raised by participants for the partner orgs, estimating roughly USD 270,000 added and raised counterfactually. Overall, this seems like a high-quality but also high-effort service. AAC seems somewhat positive about the programme and is aiming to run this again or facilitate a similar programme run by another organisation. The focus of this next iteration would be on legal and policy roles instead of fundraising. We are unsure whether this should be a priority area for AAC, as its other services seem more effective and the costs seem too high (see&nbsp;<u>section 4.1</u>).</li><li>As described in&nbsp;<u>section 1.2</u>, AAC has suspended the recruitment programme. The low number of ICAPs generated was a main reason for this. The top candidate database was set up to succeed this service. This new programme is still in its early stages and ICAP numbers should not be relied on heavily at this point yet. AAC seems to be happy with the initial KPIs they are seeing and will need to monitor how the ICAP metric develops over time.</li><li>We did not have the time to analyse in detail how AAC\u2019s services influence people\u2019s donations.</li><li>Due to a lack of data, we could not understand the outcomes and impact of AAC\u2019s career advice resources, earning to give programme, and the inclusive hiring skills workshops.</li></ul><p>Overall, the evaluation evidence demonstrates that AAC has counterfactually caused people to change career paths and assume roles within the movement. This positively updates us on assumptions #10 (founding of new organisations), 11 (strong career paths in related areas), 13 (strong career paths and capabilities for work in the movement), 14 (increased awareness of opportunities), and 15 (influx of talent to the movement). The evidence on assumption #12 (increased donations and funding) is less strong, given that we have seen evidence of increased funding as a result of the fundraising programme but have not had the time to analyse the effect of AAC\u2019s services on people\u2019s donations and the earning to give programme is still in its early stages. We could also not update our uncertainty around assumption #16 (improved hiring practices at organisations) due to a lack of evaluation data for the workshops. Assumptions #17 to 21 were not investigated in detail due to our low uncertainty around them and the absence of relevant data.</p><h2>3.2&nbsp; External evidence not collected by organisation</h2><p>Apart from the evidence that AAC has collected internally, we also need to look at external pieces of evidence that can inform our opinion about the kinds of programmes AAC is running and how likely their ToC is to hold. We specifically took the following steps in order to broaden our perspective on AAC\u2019s work and reduce key uncertainties.</p><ol><li>We did a quick, time-capped literature review on assumption #13 in our ToC, as it is one of the most crucial breaking points in our ToC and we thought we could reduce our uncertainty on this assumption with the help of external evidence</li><li>We reviewed evaluations of EA career interventions that are similar to AAC\u2019s work, looking for findings that might be cross-applicable. Most importantly but not exclusively, we looked at the findings from 80,000 Hours\u2019 annual reviews since 2019.</li><li>We consulted Animal Charity Evaluators\u2019 review of AAC in 2022, especially looking for crucial aspects that we had not considered and checking how their perspective lines up with ours.</li></ol><h3>3.2.1&nbsp; Academic studies on the effect of career services on career plans and capabilities</h3><p>Due to the limited time available for this research, we decided to focus our efforts in looking for external academic evidence on the plausibility of AAC\u2019s ToC on assumption #13: \u201cConsumers of AAC\u2019s services enhance their career plans and capabilities for work in direct animal advocacy\u201d. Among the three most crucial and uncertain assumptions in the ToC (#1, 13, and 15), this was the assumption we thought could clearly benefit the most from external research. Assumption #1 was already covered by other pieces of evidence (as described in our needs assessment in&nbsp;<u>section 1.1</u>) and #15 seemed highly specific to AAC\u2019s work and a review of external literature did not seem likely to yield highly relevant insights.</p><p>As a result, we focused our attention on the question how likely different AAC services are to influence career plans and capabilities of advisees. In line with the ToC, we focused our attention on those services that aimed to influence these outcomes, namely AAC\u2019s career advice (both in generic as well as personal form), online course, and fundraising placement programme. We investigated each kind of service in a quick literature review, using standard tools like Google Scholar or Elicit.</p><p><strong>Career advice</strong></p><p>In order to evaluate the effects of career advice, we grouped the generic online-content version and the more personal and direct version of AAC\u2019s services together, since some of the best studies we found included different kinds of career advice interventions.</p><p>For instance, one random-effects meta-analytical study from 2023 sought to determine the \u201cimpacts of career guidance interventions on school students' career-related skills, knowledge and beliefs\u201d (<a href=\"https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1396246\"><u>Nargiza et al., 2023</u></a>), evaluating empirical studies carried out over the previous 10 years, including nine studies involving a total of 1,433 participants. The analysis resulted in a weighted mean effect size of 0.42 (95% confidence interval = 0.19, 0.65; z = 3.61, p &lt; 0.01), which they interpreted as a moderate-to-high effect size, noting a significant difference between the treatment and control conditions at post-treatment. They found that post-test career-related outcomes in students which received career guidance were significantly higher than for students who did not receive career guidance. This suggests that career guidance interventions may provide some modest developmental progression in school-age children and adolescents, \u201cparticularly through improving learners' career decidedness and attitudes such as future time perspective\u201d (<a href=\"https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1396246\"><u>Nargiza et al., 2023</u></a>). Notably, the types of interventions varied between studies, but included short to medium term interventions such as a training programme to improve emotional intelligence, a programme aimed to promote learners\u2019 future time perspective and to learn about the current world of work and vocational planning. (<a href=\"https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1396246\"><u>Nargiza et al., 2023</u></a>)</p><p>Similarly, another meta analysis of different career choice interventions found that the targets of such interventions scored roughly one third of a standard deviation higher on various outcome measures like career maturity, career decidedness, career decision-making self-efficacy, perceived environmental support, and perceived career barriers (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879117300283\"><u>Whiston et al., 2017</u></a>).</p><p>A review by Mackay et al. (<a href=\"https://repository.derby.ac.uk/download/1f86fdac0155374f9654993b5739034f3042a0c914d04fe815bd50717d8360fe/696309/FINAL%20Best%20Practice%20Literature%20Review%20-%20Career%20Management%20Skills.pdf\"><u>2015</u></a>) found that&nbsp;no single intervention or group of interventions appeared most effective in improving career management skills. However, they identified the five components below which underpinned the interventions that substantially increased effectiveness and can be considered by AAC in their intervention design:</p><ul><li>The use of narrative/writing</li><li>The importance of providing a \u2018safe\u2019 environment</li><li>The quality of the adviser-client relationship</li><li>The need for flexibility in approach; the provision of specialist information and support</li><li>Clarity on the purpose and aims of action planning</li></ul><p>Specifically related to direct, personal career advice, we found some further evidence. Due to a lack of abundant meta analyses or systematic reviews, we decided to include one well-designed non-meta study of career counselling. This study found decreases in career indecision and increases in life satisfaction for recipients of career counselling. \u201cThe majority of clients implemented their career choice within a period of one year; some partially implemented it; others changed their career choice, rather successfully; and few people did not demonstrate advancement in either their choice or its implementation during this period of time\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0001879111001187?via%3Dihub\"><u>Perdrix, 2012</u></a>). We also decided to include a meta analysis of the effects of mentoring here, since mentoring and career advice calls share significant similarities. This meta analysis on the effects of mentoring finds benefits on career outcomes at small effect sizes (<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-10572-010\"><u>Allen et al., 2004</u></a>).</p><p>Overall, we find strong evidence that career advice can boost capabilities, career outcomes and plans.</p><p><strong>Online Courses</strong></p><p>Allen et al. (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1460-2466.2004.tb02636.x\"><u>2006</u></a>) conducted a meta analysis to compare the test performance of students that engaged in distance versus traditional learning. They found that \u201cdistance education course students slightly outperformed traditional students on exams and course grades\u201d. The U.S. Department of Education (<a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/tech/evidence-based-practices/finalreport.pdf\"><u>2010</u></a>) reported similar findings in their meta analysis, showing modestly stronger performance of students in online learning versus face-to-face settings. Mathieson (<a href=\"http://iase-web.org/icots/8/cd/pdfs/contributed/ICOTS8_C112_MATHIESON.pdf\"><u>2010</u></a>) systematically reviewed the results for statistics courses specifically and found student performance to be similar between online and face-to-face learning. Gao et al. (<a href=\"https://iubmb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bmb.21523\"><u>2021</u></a>) found that exam performance for medical courses in China was higher in participants of massive open online courses versus traditional courses. In sum, all of the relevant meta analyses and systematic reviews we identified in our quick review of the evidence point at the ability of online courses to positively influence student\u2019s capabilities.</p><p>When it comes to the effect of online courses on career plans, we could not identify any strong studies in the short time available. The best evidence for this clearly seems to be AAC\u2019s (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/career-advice-impact-animals\"><u>2023</u></a>) own evaluation of the effects of their career advice and online course on career-related outcome measures. This was already summarised in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.2.2</u> and we can neither positively or negatively update our view based on external evidence here.</p><p>Overall, we find good evidence that online courses are an effective tool for learning and can improve participants\u2019 capabilities. The effect on career plans is not clear.</p><p><strong>Fundraising placement programme</strong></p><p>Inceoglu et al. (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879118301039\"><u>2021</u></a>) conducted a systematic review of quantitative studies that either offered a control group or a longitudinal design, seeking to evaluate the effectiveness of placements for career outcomes. They screened 2394 studies and retained 40 for an in-depth review. They identified that \u201cPlacement participation elicits an overall positive (but small) effect on career outcomes\u201d. Most notably, graduates who completed placements found employment more quickly, and students\u2019 perception of their own self-efficacy, knowledge, skills, and attitudes were improved.&nbsp;</p><p>A report by the UK Department of Education (<a href=\"https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/82661/1/Atfield_etal_DfE_2021_Employability_programmes_and_work_placements_in_higher_education.pdf\"><u>2021</u></a>) corroborates the general finding that work placements have a small, positive association with career outcomes. Looking at employability programmes and work placements in UK Higher Education, they find that \u201cresearch looking at students\u2019 own assessments tended to find almost ubiquitous evidence of perceived skill development\u201d. Indeed, they conclude that even when statistical techniques are employed to account for selection effects from ability or motivation, \u201ca positive, albeit possibly smaller, wage return to work placements is seen [...], as well as a positive impact on employment outcomes such as the likelihood of being invited to interview\u201d. However they also note several concerns with the methodology and sparsity of evidence available in this field. In particular, they identify that \u201ceven in the literature on opportunities, costs and benefits for students or graduates, the research evidence tended to be piecemeal rather than comprehensive.\u201d Further, they note that skill development does not always translate into improved labour outcomes, and posit several explanations for this, such as that not all work placements develop skills equally and that work placements are associated with improved career outcomes as they serve as signals to employers rather than necessarily increasing skills.</p><p>Another systematic review, focused on international internships and skill development, found that in 9 out of 49 studies reviewed, career decision-management was identified as a skill gained through participation in international internships by students in higher education (<a href=\"https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/rev3.3363\"><u>Di Pietro, 2022</u></a>).</p><p>Gillespie et al. (<a href=\"https://ccwt.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CCWT_report_LR-Psychosocial-Factors-and-Outcomes-of-College-Internships.pdf\"><u>2020</u></a>) also found positive relationships between internship participation and career development measures (including professional development, career adaptability, career commitment, and career exploration) and learning outcome measures (such as GPA and skill development) in their review. They concluded that the positive effects of internship participation seem greater from voluntary than for compulsory internships and that the positive effects diminish over time. Further, they corroborate the suggestion of the aforementioned studies, that the role of internships is as a signal that students acquired greater skills, knowledge, and productivity.</p><p>Overall, we found reasonably strong evidence of a small to moderate positive association between internship or work placement completion and career outcomes, measured through a range of factors including skill development, self-perception, employment outcomes, and career adaptability. However, there is also a suggestion that this association is explained best by the signalling hypothesis, that internships serve as a signal of skills to employers, and that this may not necessarily mean capabilities themselves are significantly improved. Despite this uncertainty, it seems plausible that such placements improve capabilities and career outcomes. It should be noted that the majority of studies concern students in higher education, which AAC\u2019s programme was not limited to. Further, skill development may be higher in effectively designed fundraising placements which AAC\u2019s programme provides than at the baseline for such placements. Nevertheless, this provides enough collective evidence that placements tend to have positive effects upon capabilities and career plans.</p><p>Overall, the evidence for the effect of placements and internships on capabilities and career plans seems even stronger than for the other services. This is in line with the finding in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.2.2</u> that the work placement programme is a high-quality and high-effort service.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>In sum, we find good evidence for assumption #13 of the ToC to hold. If properly implemented, AAC\u2019s career advice, online course, and fundraising programme should improve participants\u2019 career plans and outcomes as well as capabilities. This matches with the internal evaluation evidence collected by AAC described in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.2.2</u>.</p><h3>3.2.2&nbsp; Evidence from similar EA programmes</h3><p>On their \u201cAbout\u201d page, AAC cite&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/\"><u>80,000 Hours (80K)</u></a> as a successful example of an organisation that provides career advice and addresses talent bottlenecks in the adjacent effective altruism community. They suggest that similar services focused specifically on animal issues could have similarly positive effects. (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/about\"><u>Animal Advocacy Careers, 2019</u></a>) We agree that evidence from highly related programmes is an important form of evidence for us to consider here. While it might be less rigorous than the academic studies cited above, this evidence is more directly applicable to the case of AAC and can thus give more practical insights.</p><p><strong>80,000 Hours</strong></p><p>When looking at programmes that are similar to AAC\u2019s and how they can inform our perspective on AAC\u2019s work, 80,000 Hours indeed stands out.</p><p>As 80K started already in 2011 (<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/about/\"><u>80,000 Hours, n.d.</u></a>), they have been able to review and refine their services over a longer time span than AAC. For instance, they already did surveys in 2014 that seem highly insightful into the kind of impact that career advice services can have. In these surveys, they found that 63 out of 206 respondents said that engagement with 80K had changed their career plans. Other sources apart from their surveys informed them of another forty people that had changed plans because of them. These career changes were based on multiple different 80K services like 1-1 advice and events, which all seemed impactful. Roughly one third of plan changes were the result of just reading 80K\u2019s online content, showing that online content alone can be impactful, without deeper engagement levels (like direct, personal advice). In addition to plan changes, 80K also found that their services successfully introduced people to the EA community and changed people\u2019s attitudes towards career. (<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2014/03/80-000-hours-impact-survey-evaluation/\"><u>80,000 Hours, 2014</u></a>)</p><p>Later reviews by 80K found that their initial impact estimates were probably overly optimistic and had to be corrected downwards. In 2019, they wrote the following:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIn past years, we were overly credulous when the people who made plan changes claimed we permanently changed the trajectory of their careers and our investigations into these claims were insufficiently skeptical, thoughtful and thorough. This led us to overestimate our impact, especially on those people who already had some ties to the EA community, because there are already other influences pushing in the same direction. The team has become substantially less likely to take claims about our impact at face value, which we think is reflected in the new system we\u2019re developing for evaluating our impact.\u201d</i> (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PFSKzGV_fVcBJgV77dtiNTi9d1kFE1_skODtPXXqGec/edit#heading=h.t724g17at0yo\"><u>80,000 Hours, 2019</u></a>)</p></blockquote><p>80K\u2019s work generally stresses that tracking the impact on career plans is very hard, especially because such changes occur over long periods of time. To account for this, 80K uses qualitative insights as an additional perspective in their evaluations. (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PFSKzGV_fVcBJgV77dtiNTi9d1kFE1_skODtPXXqGec/edit#heading=h.t724g17at0yo\"><u>80,000 Hours, 2019</u></a>)</p><p>80K\u2019s reviews in later years still showed a positive impact of their work. However, there are some negative aspects or doubts that we need to highlight here. First, it seems that 80K\u2019s work has hit diminishing returns, as their services have grown over the years (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rWfQ3Lja2kYoUm_t9uNqBgEn5nz6KL8fmNP5db8cZRU/edit\"><u>80,000 Hours, 2020</u></a>). Second, 80K found its job board to be less cost-effective than other services and considered cutting the service back or spinning it off. They decided to continue running it, as it seems like a low-effort resource that the EA community should have at its disposal. However, they also decided against investing further into this service and kept it running at low capacity. (80,000 Hours,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PFSKzGV_fVcBJgV77dtiNTi9d1kFE1_skODtPXXqGec/edit\"><u>2019</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rWfQ3Lja2kYoUm_t9uNqBgEn5nz6KL8fmNP5db8cZRU/edit\"><u>2020</u></a>) Third, 80K decided to pause its headhunting service in 2022, focusing more on career advice. The reasons for this seem to have been mostly administrative (i.e. not finding a good person to lead this aspect of their work) and not related to the service\u2019s effectiveness. Fourth, 80K found that their content made some of their readers feel sad/stressed/demoralised, as they came away feeling that they did not have what it takes to make a meaningful contribution (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rWfQ3Lja2kYoUm_t9uNqBgEn5nz6KL8fmNP5db8cZRU/edit\"><u>80,000 Hours, 2020</u></a>). Fifth, the collapse of FTX and the case of Sam Bankman-Fried made 80K aware of other potentially negative effects of their work, causing them to update some of their advice. Their decision to focus more on doing research and improving their advice in 2023 also seems tightly connected to these developments. (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mZmox0G910jw7I9jCoDC6vowz_PcrHRfFoW04G59XMA/edit#\"><u>80,000 Hours, 2022</u></a>).</p><p>These experiences seem highly relevant for our assessment of AAC\u2019s programmes and their (potential) impact. 80K generally offers quite similar services, just at a larger scale and with a broader focus, and can thus act as a good comparison. Below we describe the key takeaways from our review of 80K and how they update our perspective:</p><ul><li>Overall, 80K\u2019s success in a highly similar field updates us positively on the likelihood of impact and effectiveness of AAC\u2019s programmes. Particularly, the general online career resources and the direct, personal advice should be effective in changing people\u2019s career plans. 80K\u2019s experience with the job board seems less promising, but it still seems like a service worth offering. This leads us to positively update our perspective on assumptions #2 and 3, and to a lesser extent #10, 11, 13, and 14.</li><li>80K\u2019s initial overestimation of their impact highlights why counterfactuals need to be taken seriously when evaluating impact. As described in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.1.2</u>, we think that AAC has properly incorporated counterfactual considerations into their approach, adjusting the placements they influenced for importance and counterfactuals. While counterfactuals are hard to account for, AAC\u2019s approach seems sufficiently rigorous. The fact that 80K was and is also struggling with their M&amp;E efforts and find it hard to assess their own impact shows how difficult such an exercise is in the realm of meta interventions like AAC\u2019s.</li><li>80K\u2019s decision to pause its headhunting services seems different from that of AAC to suspend their recruitment service. While 80K\u2019s reasons were mostly operational/administrative, AAC had concerns about the effectiveness of the programme. It still seems notable that both organisations experienced difficulties with this approach, making us sceptical of the value of recruitment services. This affects assumption #15, as recruitment services are aimed at directly increasing the availability of good talent in the movement.</li><li>AAC needs to watch out for diminishing returns in the services they provide. This seems like a natural development in many fields and should keep AAC vigilant in their assessment of their own programmes and in making strategic decisions.</li><li>There are significant potential negative effects to giving wrong, misleading, or otherwise harmful career advice. On the one hand, AAC needs to mind the potential of their content to alienate its consumers. On the other hand, they should stress to their advisees\u2019 the importance of wider, long-term consequences of their actions, especially when it comes to outsized risk taking and unethical behaviour. These concerns caution us in our assessment and should be actively considered by AAC. They slightly negatively update our view on assumption #1, as well as on assumptions #15 and 20, as it seems more uncertain that AAC can find the most promising careers in animal advocacy and give correct advice that will lead to positive changes in people\u2019s career paths.</li></ul><p><strong>Centre for Effective Altruism</strong></p><p>Apart from 80,000 Hours, there are some other programmes within EA focused on careers and movement building that bear some similarity to some of AAC\u2019s work. For instance, the Centre for Effective Altruism is trying to grow the effective altruism movement by running fellowships and virtual programmes, supporting university groups, organising conferences and retreats, and other services. We checked some of their reporting to see whether it can yield relevant insights for our evaluation of AAC.</p><p>However, most of the information we found did not prove to be too helpful. While they have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\"><u>public data dashboard</u></a> and regularly posts updates about their work on their blog (Centre for Effective Altruism&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/many-groups-metrics-have-grown-by-100-to-400-in-the-past-year\"><u>2021</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/midyear-update\"><u>2023</u></a>), almost all of the data the Centre for Effective Altruism reports on seems to focus on activities and outputs. For example, they list the number of attendees of retreats and EA Global conferences, the number of university groups supported via advice and grants, and the number of participants in fellowships and virtual programmes. They do report on some more advanced measures like people\u2019s likelihood to recommend retreats and conferences, as well as completion rates for their fellowships and virtual programmes. Philip Hall Andersen\u2019s (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JDEDsCaQd2CYm7QEi/red-teaming-introductory-ea-courses\"><u>2022</u></a>) review of introductory EA courses also mostly focuses on monitoring and process evaluation, but does not look at the further effects on career choices.</p><p>We did find one EA Forum post (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AJ4ZXWNjcxHL9JEyq/a-report-on-running-1-1s-with-ea-virtual-programs\"><u>2019</u></a>) on the Centre for Effective Altruism\u2019s work that contained some useful information. Evaluating 1-1 meetings they organised for participants in EA virtual programmes, they found that such meetings generally seem valuable, but less scalable and more time-consuming than other services. Especially valuable seem those 1-1s focused on careers and networking, with mentors that are experienced in a specific cause area (e.g. animal welfare), sociable, and very knowledgeable. Mid-career professionals are mentioned as the most promising target group for such 1-1s. The organisers think that the meetings can be impactful when it comes to influencing people\u2019s career paths. All of these findings are tentative and do not seem based on an extremely rigorous evaluation. They should thus be taken with caution, but can provide a weak form of evidence for our review.</p><p>Below we summarise our key takeaways from the review of the Centre of Effective Altruism and how they update our perspective</p><ul><li>Most of the data we found is not comprehensive enough and too dependent on the specific implementation of CEA\u2019s programmes such that it cannot be used to inform our view of AAC\u2019s work.</li><li>The findings from evaluating 1-1s seem applicable to AAC\u2019s work and match some of the findings from their evaluation. Specifically, they positively update us on assumption #3 (the ability to run a well-received direct career advice programme) and, to a lesser extent, #10, 11, and 13 (changes in career plans based on AAC\u2019s activities), showing that personal meetings to discuss careers can be a valuable service to the community.</li></ul><p><strong>Animal-focused organisations</strong></p><p>Further relevant external evidence could come from other capacity-building organisations in the animal advocacy movement. Especially career-oriented services like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gfi.org/resource/talent-database/\"><u>the talent database offered by the Good Food Institute</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://talist.org/\"><u>T\u00e4list</u></a>\u2019s services could be investigated. Due to the limited time available for this report, we decided not to pursue these paths here though. Also, T\u00e4list might be too young (they started in 2022) to already have a good understanding of the impact of their work.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>In sum, we find highly relevant evidence from similar programmes within the EA movement. The overwhelming majority of evidence updates us positively on a variety of assumptions in the ToC. However, we also found some reasons for caution that need to be strongly considered by AAC.</p><h3>3.2.3&nbsp; 2022 Animal Charity Evaluators review</h3><p>In 2022, Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) evaluated AAC in order to determine whether they should be recommended to donors as one of their top or standout charities. ACE\u2019s review was overall very positive but did not end up recommending AAC because other charities scored higher on the kinds of programmes they pursue and their cost-effectiveness. (<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/animal-advocacy-careers/\"><u>Animal Charity Evaluators, 2022</u></a>)</p><p>ACE thinks that AAC\u2019s strategic priorities are important ones, targeting high-priority countries and focusing on high-priority outcomes and interventions. Capacity building is seen as a neglected but important area and the impact of research is considered promising, especially in the long term. The online course, fundraising placement programme, and job board were found to be the most cost-effective of AAC\u2019s services, while the recruitment service scored lowest. All programmes scored moderate to high in terms of cost-effectiveness. It is important to note that the review did not seem to include AAC\u2019s written career advice, mailing list, and inclusive hiring workshops. (<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/animal-advocacy-careers/\"><u>Animal Charity Evaluators, 2022</u></a>)</p><p>Overall, these findings provide the following updates to our view of AAC\u2019s work:</p><ul><li>The review by ACE does not provide much significant new information that we had not already gathered in previous sections of this evidence review. The overall picture of AAC\u2019s programmes and organisation is very positive, which matches our perspective thus far.</li><li>The recruitment services offered by AAC are an issue to monitor, as they seemed least cost effective to ACE and were already restructured by AAC (as described in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1</u>). Investigating the effects of AAC\u2019s top candidate database (the new implementation of recruitment services) should be an evaluation priority going forward.</li></ul><h2>3.3&nbsp; What have we learned and not learned?</h2><p>The evidence we have collected in this section gives us a much better understanding of AAC\u2019s work and impact. In the table below, we summarise the assumptions from the ToC described in&nbsp;<u>section 2</u> and how we update our views on each of them based on this evidence review. The colours in the \u2018Assumption\u2019 column match those given in&nbsp;<u>section 2.2</u>, indicating our levels of uncertainty around the assumptions, while the colours in the \u2018Update\u2019 column represent how the different factors we identified update our view. We naturally weigh strong, internal, or case-specific evidence more heavily than weak, external, or general evidence. The different shades of red and green in the \u2018Update\u2019 column account for this. We then assign a final uncertainty score from 1 (low uncertainty) to 5 (high uncertainty).</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border:1pt solid

updates us on most assumptions in the ToC and that we generally have few significant uncertainties.</p><p>Below we list the most important remaining uncertainties and our perspective on them:</p><ul><li>To what extent can AAC make sure that the services they provide do not have negative externalities by pushing people into paths that are not the best option for them, causing anxiety over career decisions, or causing overall harm to the movement?<ul><li>This seems hard to guarantee. The best way to avoid negative externalities is probably to do rigorous research into the best career paths and carefully consider all options. Specifically monitoring potential negative effects could also be helpful.</li></ul></li><li>Should AAC continue to pursue recruitment services in some form or another, given that previous experiences with these services do not seem too promising?<ul><li>AAC\u2019s leadership has shared with us that there is a strong demand for these services from the organisations in their network. Recruitment services also seem highly demanded in the for-profit sector, so they should be helpful in the nonprofit sector as well. It might just be about finding out which kind of service works best. We remain somewhat sceptical about this and think this needs to be monitored closely, as it might simply be that there is no recruitment service that can be as cost effective as AAC\u2019s other services.</li></ul></li></ul><p>We will summarise these and all of our other recommendations for AAC in&nbsp;<u>section 7</u>. Before we do that however, we first need to have a more detailed look at the cost-effectiveness of AAC\u2019s programmes in the next section, the health of the organisation as a whole in&nbsp;<u>section 5</u>, as well as their future plans and room for more funding in&nbsp;<u>section 6</u>.</p><h1>4 &nbsp; Cost-effectiveness analysis</h1><p>In this section we dive deeper into the cost effectiveness of AAC\u2019s services. To do so, we build on the evaluation evidence described in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.2.2</u>, namely AAC\u2019s ICAP estimates per programme. In&nbsp;<u>section 4.1</u>, we first replicate AAC\u2019s own cost-effectiveness estimates by comparing the effects described in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.2.2</u> with the total costs. We then move on to evaluate AAC\u2019s methodology in arriving at these cost-effectiveness estimates in&nbsp;<u>section 4.2</u>.</p><h2>4.1 Summary of AAC\u2019s internal cost effectiveness estimates</h2><p>The following table summarises AAC\u2019s expenditures per programme and overall, since conception. More than 50% of expenditure came from the \u2018Other\u2019 category, which we cannot easily associate with a specific programme. The most costly individual programme was the fundraising work placement, which is very noticeable, since the programme has only been run in 2022. Career advice calls, the online course, and recruitment all required similar proportions of the total expenditure. The job board takes only a small share of the overall costs. The same is true for the top candidate database, which was only started recently.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Programme</p></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>USD spent</p></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Percentage (%)&nbsp;</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Career advice calls</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>44,707</p></td><td style=\"border-color:#000000;border-style:solid;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>6.4</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Fundraising work placement</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>124,264</p></td><td style=\"border-color:#000000;border-style:solid;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>17.6</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Job board</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>18,275</p></td><td style=\"border-color:#000000;border-style:solid;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>2.6</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Online course</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>53,202</p></td><td style=\"border-color:#000000;border-style:solid;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>7.6</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Recruitment</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>42,950</p></td><td style=\"border-color:#000000;border-style:solid;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>6.1</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Top candidate database</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>20,593</p></td><td style=\"border-color:#000000;border-style:solid;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>2.9</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Other</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>400,425</p></td><td style=\"border-color:#000000;border-style:solid;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><p>56.8</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Total</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>704,416</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Combining the costs with the ICAPs generated per programme, AAC can estimate a USD cost per ICAP, as already shown in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.2.2</u>.

programmes was already described in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.2.2</u>. Combining the total value generated for the movement via ICAPs (USD 1,814,933) with the total costs (USD 704,416), AAC achieves a multiplier of USD 2.6 generated for every USD spent.</p><h2>4.2 Evaluation of AAC\u2019s methodology</h2><p>Given the limited time available for this section of the report, we determined that we would be unable to produce a higher quality metric to measure impact than AAC\u2019s own ICAPs. We therefore decided to instead examine AAC\u2019s methodology and calculations in depth and make recommendations for how they could be improved. First, in&nbsp;<u>section 4.2.1</u>, we look at how AAC estimates the ICAPs generated by a given placement and how robust these estimates are. We also make recommendations for how this could be improved. Second, in&nbsp;<u>section 4.2.2</u>, we analyse the calculation underlying the monetary value of one ICAP and make recommendations for how it could be made more robust.</p><h3>4.2.1&nbsp; ICAP estimates per placement</h3><p>Calibration of counterfactual estimates</p><p>In order to estimate the ICAPs generated by a certain placement, AAC follows three steps:</p><ol><li>Identifying the distribution of impact AAC had upon the participant\u2019s placement over each service engaged with by the participant</li><li>Identifying the importance of a placement to the movement by assigning an estimated multiplier for the importance of their organisation, relative to the average EAA organisation</li><li>Identifying the counterfactual impact that AAC had on this placement by estimating the probability of the individual&nbsp;<i>not</i> placing a role within the movement within the next five years</li></ol><p>In order to test the validity of AAC\u2019s importance judgments (step #2 above), AAC have sought independent judgement calibration from other organisations.</p><p>However, the counterfactual judgments (step #3) have not been tested.

This provides some evidence for the robustness of AAC\u2019s estimates. However, given our limited knowledge of the animal advocacy job space, we would not over-index on our own estimates of the probability of the individual&nbsp;<i>not</i> placing a role within the movement within the next five years.&nbsp;</p><p>We recommend that AAC solicit feedback from more experienced people to calibrate their judgements. In addition, AAC currently does not have a clear rubric or framework for coming to well calibrated estimates. This may lead to some margin of error or variation in scores. As described above, we created a simple rubric for assigning our scores in this calibration exercise. We recommend that AAC develop something similar for their own use. Below, we list the factors used in our calibration, which can serve as inspiration and starting point for AAC to build upon.</p><ul><li>Motivation<ul><li>Was the participant interested in working in animal advocacy?</li></ul></li><li>Initiative<ul><li>Have they taken any previous steps to improve their fit for jobs?</li><li>Have they taken any previous steps to apply for jobs?</li><li>Did the AAC programme they engaged with increase their motivation to find a job?</li></ul></li><li>Competence<ul><li>Did they possess a relevant skill set to provide value to an organisation within the movement?</li><li>Did they possess relevant experience with EAA or the job-type they sought?</li><li>Did the AAC programme they engaged with increase their skill set?</li></ul></li><li>Awareness<ul><li>Did they have the relevant network and/or awareness of jobs within the EAA space without AAC?</li><li>Did the AAC programme they engaged with increase their awareness of opportunities?</li></ul></li></ul><p>Sensitivity analysis on counterfactual estimates</p><p>Given that the scores we arrived at differed somewhat from those given by AAC, it is important to determine how significant variation in this metric would be upon the final impact and cost effectiveness estimates. Therefore, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on this metric, adjusting all estimates for counterfactual impact since the beginning of ACE\u2019s impact evaluation.</p><p>The table below outlines the sensitivity analysis performed, determining the effect of varying the counterfactual judgement score upon the overall impact and cost effectiveness of AAC\u2019s total activities.

central to calculating the number of ICAPs generated per placement can result in moderately large changes in the total cost-effectiveness of the organisation. This highlights the importance of systematising the values assigned to this metric.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As aforementioned, given these results we recommend that AAC take efforts to systematise their counterfactual judgement estimations. The following steps seem promising to us:</p><ol><li>Use confidence intervals rather than point estimates:<br>Currently, two employees of AAC provide point estimates for this metric. To improve robustness and increase reasoning transparency, we suggest that they provide a 90% confidence interval, and take the average of the overlap between these intervals. Our prior is that using ranges rather than point estimates increases the accuracy of the judgement, as one can consider what they believe the upper and lower bound to be, and this also allows for the level of uncertainty and precision to be conveyed.&nbsp;</li><li>Develop a rubric:<br>A rubric or framework for coming to these judgements is critical, in order to ensure that this process is systematic and controlled.</li><li>Identify examples of individual cases where the confidence is in the estimate is high for the calibration of scores</li><li>Determine base rates, upper and lower bounds:<br>AAC should determine the extent to which different factors tend to contribute to job placement. Determining the base rate for different broad categories of individuals to land placements in the movement, based on key factors like experience, skill, motivation and awareness, may help to calibrate estimates. Further, determining the expected upper and lower bounds for the probability of any person to land a placements in the EAA movement regardless of the aforementioned factors, would improve judgements at the extremes.</li></ol><h3>4.2.2&nbsp; The monetary value of an ICAP</h3><p>Assuming that ICAP estimates per placement are relatively robust (which they seem to be based on our analysis above and which they might be even more so in the future if our recommendations are implemented), the cost effectiveness estimates of AAC\u2019s work might still be mistaken, if the monetary value assigned to an ICAP is off.</p><p>ICAPs are calculated based on a multiplicative model and represent a monetary equivalent of value added to the movement as a result of AAC\u2019s programmes. AAC uses the following formula:</p><p><i>1 ICAP = Average number of years the candidate will continue working in the movement * Average salary of a candidate * Percentage better the candidate is than the next best candidate</i></p><p>For each ICAP, AAC estimates an addition of&nbsp; USD 37,500 to the movement. This is based on the assumption that each placement is 10% better than the next best candidate and will continue working in the movement for 7.5 years, with an average salary of&nbsp; USD 50,000 annually. AAC has also added a multiplier for cases where organisations think that the placement was above or below the 10% assumption, to adjust this value.</p><p>From our interview with AAC, we understood that the assumption of the number of years a new placement will stay in the movement is a conservative estimate, and is not based on any particular dataset. Given the degree of variation there may be in this value, we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how changes in this value would impact the total value of one ICAP in the table below.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Years in the movement</strong></th><th style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>USD value per ICAP</strong></th><th style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Difference from baseline</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>2.5</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>12,500</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>-66.67%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>5.0</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>25,000</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>-33.33%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>7.5</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>37,500</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>0.00%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>10.0</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>50,000</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>33.33%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>12.5</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>62,500</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>66.67%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>15.0</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>75,000</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>100.00%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>17.5</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>87,500</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>133.33%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>20.0</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>100,000</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>166.67%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>22.5</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>112,500</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>200.00%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>25.0</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>125,000</p></td><td style=\"border:0.5625pt solid #000000;padding:2.834645669291339pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>233.33%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>The analysis shows that the value generated per ICAP varies drastically, if assumptions about the duration of impact change.</p><p>Based on our conversations with AAC, we understand that AAC\u2019s estimate of USD 37,500 per ICAP might err on the conservative side, as other organisations (like 80,000 Hours) use higher monetary values in their evaluations. As such, it seems unlikely that AAC is grossly overestimating its impact.</p><p>Nevertheless, it seems highly beneficial for AAC to enhance the foundations that their ICAP estimate is built on. To increase the certainty around the assumption of the number of years an individual stays in the movement, we propose AAC use existing data or collect novel data, to build a probability distribution for this metric that represents the state of the movement. The weighted average from this can be taken, to more robustly determine the average number of years a new placement stays in the movement. This may also be updated periodically, such as every five years or at points where it becomes clear that career norms in the movement have changed and that the previous value no longer holds.</p><h2>4.3 Recommendations</h2><p>To summarise, the table below provides an overview of the major recommendations made in this section, including their importance, urgency, and expected time investment.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Component</strong></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Importance</strong></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Urgency</strong></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Time investment</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">Develop a probability distribution for the duration of individual commitments in the movement, updating it periodically to reflect changes in career norms</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Very High:</p><p>Given the finding that the value generated per ICAP varies drastically, if assumptions about the duration of impact change, it is very significant to validate the current duration by taking this recommendation.</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Very High:</p><p>This should be addressed very soon.</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:4.251968503937008pt;vertical-align:top\">This would probably involve surveying members of the field to collect data and using that to calculate a weighted average.

In this section, we will first provide our perspective on AAC\u2019s organisational health&nbsp;<u>(section 5.1</u>) and then on their transparency in communication and data sharing (<u>section 5.2</u>). For this, we will draw mainly on ACE\u2019s 2022 review of AAC and our own experience in evaluating AAC.&nbsp;</p><h2>5.1 &nbsp; Organisational health</h2><p>Overall, AAC\u2019s organisational health seems strong. In their review of AAC, Animal Charity Evaluators (<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/animal-advocacy-careers/\"><u>2022</u></a>) did not detect any reason for concern when it comes to AAC\u2019s leadership and culture. We did not perform a detailed review of this ourselves, but could also not detect any issues during the research for this report.</p><p>ACE has one executive staff, Lauren Mee (Chief Executive Offer). Lauren is on the Board of Directors, which consists of three males and three females to provide a gender balanced board. However, Lauren is not a voting member, to avoid conflicts of interest.</p><p>According to ACE, all six staff members responded to their survey about organisational health in 2022, and all agreed that AAC\u2019s leadership team guides the organisation competently. Additionally, AAC\u2019s leadership has \u201ctwo-way feedback sessions\u201d with each staff member to learn about staff morale and work climate.</p><p>In addition, ACE examined whether AAC had best-practice general policies in place.

A list of key staff members and information about their accomplishments are available on AAC\u2019s website. However, their audited financial documents (including the most recently filed IRS form 990 for U.S. organizations)[...] and a list of board members are not available on their website. Based on the information that they make publicly available, we assess AAC\u2019s transparency towards the public as moderate.\u201d&nbsp;</i>(<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/animal-advocacy-careers/\"><u>Animal Charity Evaluators, 2022</u></a>)</p></blockquote><p>In our own review of AAC, we found them to be very transparent with us, sharing the required data as necessary. The evaluation evidence and financial data was well-structured. They have published annual reviews for each of the last years (<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/2021-plans-and-2020-review\"><u>2020</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/post/2022-plans-and-2021-review\"><u>2021</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/year-in-review-2022\"><u>2022</u></a>) and we think that the organisation is generally committed to transparency.</p><p>However, we think that some of the information could be more easily accessible to the public.

Of this, nearly 90% comes from Foundations A and B which are both EA funding sources. This demonstrates that the majority of funding comes from a small number of larger EA donors.&nbsp; We expect that money from EA funding sources would have a higher counterfactual value than money from non-EA funding sources. AAC has reported turning down funding from non-EA sources, since these grants were attached to conditions to remove EA content from the website and promote lower impact opportunities.</p><p>Based on the analysis in this section, we suggest that AAC should seek to diversify its funding sources as much as possible whilst maintaining the ability to prioritise what they judge to be the most impactful and cost effective programmes and opportunities. This would help both to increase their own financial security and to free up more funds within the EAA space. We estimate a priori that, as a meta-organisation focusing on directing animal advocates to achieve the highest impact possible through their careers, AAC may have more potential to win funding from the wider animal advocacy movement beyond EA funders than direct animal organisations. This is due to their provision of services that can be of value to a broad range of animal organisations and animal advocates that are beyond the effective animal advocacy space, unlike many other EAA charities. Further, given the number of individual users of their services, they may be able to seek small donations from those who have found it beneficial. However, this may require them to somewhat broaden the focus of their programmes, to also include promoting and supporting less effective opportunities and organisations, which may reduce their impact. Therefore, we suggest that AAC should (continue) to seek funding from both EA and non-EA funders where possible, whilst continuing to only accept funding when this does not impede their ability to uphold their focus on promoting the most cost effective opportunities.</p><h2>6.2 Future plans</h2><p>AAC seemed to have significant room for more funding beyond AAC\u2019s projected revenues, between USD 200,000 and 300,000 additionally for 2023 and 2024 each. ACE estimated that AAC could productively employ total revenues between USD 800,000 and 850,000 in those two years respectively. (<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/animal-advocacy-careers/\"><u>Animal Charity Evaluators, 2022</u></a>)</p><p>For 2024, AAC has set itself the following strategic priorities:</p><ol><li>Support talented, mission-aligned candidates to maximise the impact of their careers</li><li>Fully fund the organisation's ambitious budget for 2024.</li><li>Develop and sustain talent pipelines focused on the key global talent bottlenecks, paving the way for a landscape of international talent density.</li></ol><p>AAC has clear measurable and quantified targets for each of these, and evaluation points specified.</p><h1>7 Summary</h1><p>This section provides a short summary of the key findings of this review. We decided not to include a summary of all of the recommendations we made throughout this report here, since this would have been too extensive. For more detailed explanations and a wide range of recommendations, see the relevant sections of the report or consult&nbsp;<u>appendix B (in the full PDF report)</u>, which includes a copy of all the recommendations made throughout the report.</p><p>Overall, our perspective on AAC as a charity is mostly positive. We judge their programmes and M&amp;E systems to be moderately strong, but present a variety of suggestions for how this may be improved.&nbsp;</p><p>We find that AAC addresses an important need, as talent seems to be a major bottleneck in the movement. However, it is important to monitor this need over the next few years, as talent gaps are gradually being filled and other capacity-building initiatives emerge.</p><p>The different steps in AAC\u2019s ToC mostly seem well-backed by evidence. We find strong evidence that AAC is pursuing a variety of cost-effective programmes and has counterfactually caused people to change career paths and assume roles within the movement. The main things we are uncertain about when it comes to AAC\u2019s programmes are to what extent AAC can make sure that the services they provide do not have negative externalities and whether AAC should continue to pursue some kind of recruitment service.</p><p>AAC's monitoring system covers most programs effectively. However, for broad-audience services like website resources and 'earning to give' outreach, monitoring is somewhat lacking. AAC's use of ICAPs for evaluating its impact is innovative and useful, but there are some limitations that should be addressed.</p><p>When it comes to the health of the organisation and its funding situation, we did not find major reasons for concern. We do make minor recommendations for improvements in these areas though, most notably with regards to diversifying AAC\u2019s funding streams.</p>", "user": {"username": "moritz-stumpe"}}, {"_id": "2DSmBW9Ek4CSdAwpa", "title": "2) Pandemics Are Solved With Risk Management, Not Science", "postedAt": "2024-01-31T15:51:47.651Z", "htmlBody": "<p>In this piece I will introduce the field of Risk Management (capitalised to represent entire body of knowledge and field of practice), explain how it differs from Science in terms of motivations, methods, and outputs, and argue that an understanding of Risk Management in theory and in practice will be essential if we are to permanently solve the problem of pandemics.</p><p>(You can read more about Risk Management in theory <a href=\"https://pandemicprevention.substack.com/p/wirm-3-the-philosophy-of-risk-management\">here</a> and Risk Management in practice <a href=\"https://pandemicprevention.substack.com/p/wirm-4-the-practice-of-risk-management\">here</a>.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Definitions</h1><p>I\u2019ll start by defining my terms:</p><p><strong>Science</strong> is the process of testing hypotheses, in controlled environments, against large datasets, with all the time, tools, and technology needed to do so.</p><p><strong>Risk Management</strong> is the practice of making decisions, in volatile or uncertain environments, with whatever data, tools, and resources you have available at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Along every axis of these (admittedly brief and stylised) definitions, it should be clear that Science and Risk Management are categorically different things. They are different methods, practiced by different professionals, with different skillsets, in different environments. It stands to reason that one method would be more effective than the other, depending on the environment in which they were applied and the overall purpose of the enterprise.</p><p>We will return to the discussion of suitability of methods later in this piece. First, let's explore the contrasts between Risk Management and Science in more detail...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Risk Management vs Science</h1><h3>Goals</h3><p>The goal of Science is to produce true statements about life, the universe and everything (or some small, specific part therein). What is an atom? What is an electron? Why does the electron orbit the nucleus? What is gravity? What is electromagnetism? How are they all related to each other?</p><p>The answers to these questions are precise statements that are universally and eternally true, and Science is the right tool for the job: Science was designed to produce fixed answers to fixed questions like these.</p><p>The goal of Risk Management is, ultimately, survival. A \u2018risk\u2019 is any event or future state of the world which could cost you time, money, health or any other resources were it to arise, and Risk Management is the method by which we minimise those potential costs. The key idea is that <strong>if you can manage the risks while they are still risks, then the threat may never materialise</strong>. At the very least, you will be prepared for it when it does.</p><p>Risk Management can be applied to any \u2018thing\u2019 (organisations, infrastructure, consumer products, strategic situations) but no matter the context, the goal is always the same: to make the decisions that will ensure the preservation of some valuable thing, be it your home, your savings, your workplace, your community, or your life.</p><h3>Methods</h3><p><strong>Science is a slow, theoretic, and extremely specific process</strong>. It is a very thorough one too, often requiring all relevant variables and alternative hypotheses to be tested one by one until a firm conclusion can be reached \u2013 no matter how long that takes. Most Science takes place in a quiet office or a sterile laboratory where highly-credentialled nerds use precision instruments and advanced technology to analyse a finite number of variables. A structured environment is necessary so that all the effects can be identified, disentangled, and controlled, and the paths of causality revealed.</p><p><strong>Risk Management is a practical, dynamic, and strategic skillset which involves goal-setting, planning, resource management, and tactical decision-making.</strong> Risk Management takes place wherever it is needed, by whoever happens to be present, and it can start or stop at a moment\u2019s notice. While the methods of Risk Management can be applied anywhere, the typical environments would be a battlefield, a house fire, a football field, or the poker table. In these contexts, there are infinite options, limited information, and you\u2019ve got your skin in the game i.e. if you make the wrong decisions, you are going to suffer.</p><p>Science is frequentist: it waits for the data to accumulate before reaching a conclusion. Risk Management is Bayesian: it starts with a position and updates as it goes with whatever data becomes available. Science wants to make that one, big, final statement on the matter, and is happy to wait as long as is necessary to do so. Risk Management is constantly adapting because the environment is dynamic and the \u2018right\u2019 answers are always changing too.</p><h3>Motivations</h3><p><strong>Scientists are motivated by precision whereas Risk Managers are motivated by precaution.</strong> Scientists are focused on the centre of the distribution whereas Risk Managers are fanatical with the tails. Scientists are optimisers because they can afford to be. Risk Managers are satisficers because they <i>can\u2019t</i> afford <i>not</i> to be: they are dealing with life and death decisions, and at a scale and complexity that Science still cannot handle. Near enough is often good enough in Risk Management, but never in Science.</p><p>Science defaults to \u2018no action\u2019 and needs overwhelming evidence to budge from this position. Risk Management defaults to protective action and does not relent until there is conclusive proof that the threat has passed. The Scientist needs to be convinced that the noise in the bushes is a dangerous animal, whereas the Risk Manager has already run away. (Humans have Risk Management in their DNA \u2013 we couldn\u2019t have survived as a species without it!)</p><p><strong>Science makes accurate statements based on what it does know, whereas Risk Management makes adequate decisions based on what it doesn\u2019t know</strong>, and that is why Risk Management is essential in a crisis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Making Statements vs Making Decisions</h1><p>The fundamental difference between Science and Risk Management is that one method is dedicated to making statements whereas the other method is dedicated to making decisions. Making statements and making decisions are two very different things!</p><p>When we make a statement, we are committing to an intellectual position or a belief about the world. When we make a decision however, we are committing ourselves to a particular course of action. Making decisions is about <i>doing</i>, not stating or believing. Statements can be withdrawn or updated as new information becomes available, but actions, once taken, are final. So a wrong decision is far more dangerous than a wrong statement, especially when the playing field is volatile or uncertain and the stakes are high.</p><p>Many important decisions have to be made in situations where Science cannot function. A contagious outbreak, for example, is a complex environment with infinitely many variables and options, where even the first order effects are not well described. Science can\u2019t process the number of paths nor model the complexity that these situations create. We need a better way to safely navigate these environments, and that\u2019s where Risk Management comes in.</p><p>Risk Management is the study and practice of judgement under uncertainty. That is, making decisions and taking actions when the situation is dangerous or uncertain and you don\u2019t have enough information to make the decision for you. In these environments, we don\u2019t have the option of waiting for comprehensive data, but even if we did, the precise statements it could generate would be of little use to us. In situations like these, we need to make decisions which will guarantee our survival.</p><p>Think about it like this: <strong>Science can tell you what a hurricane is, whereas Risk Management can tell you what to do about it</strong> - BIG difference! And which would you rather know? Which body of knowledge would be more useful to you in your life?&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine there was a Cat 5 hurricane headed your way. Would you rather have a Scientist there to tell you the precise definition of a hurricane and reel off statistics about historical Cat 5\u2019s? Or would you prefer a Risk Manager who could calmly advise you how to protect your home and your family, and otherwise best use your remaining time before landfall? (I\u2019ll take the latter, for what it\u2019s worth.)</p><p>Now apply the same logic to outbreaks and epidemics: Science can tell you whether a pathogen is contagious or not, but Risk Management can tell you what to do about it either way. Again, which would you rather know? Which skill would you rather develop in yourself and in your communities? Who would you want leading your national response to a highly-contagious outbreak \u2013 a Scientist or a Risk Manager? (I\u2019ll take the latter again.)</p><p><strong>Science can inform, but it cannot decide.</strong> That\u2019s why wars are fought by generals (generalists) not scientists (specialists). The scientists can provide information which improves the decision-making process, but ultimately it is the generals who make the decisions. Even when the scientists invent decisive military technology, it is still the army generals who decide if and when and where it will be deployed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Different Toolboxes for Different Problems</h1><p>At the end of the day, Science and Risk Management are different toolboxes for different kinds of problems, and it should be no more controversial than that. Both are necessary, both can lead us to important truths, but they serve completely different purposes and should only be used where they are appropriate. <strong>One of the key takeaways for policy-makers is that they need to understand the nature of the problem they are trying to solve </strong><i><strong>before</strong></i><strong> they decide which toolbox to use.</strong></p><p>Blindly applying the Scientific method in all environments is perhaps preferable to pure guesswork, but making statements when you should be making decisions is no better than hammering a screw or eating soup with a fork: you won\u2019t get the results you want and you are likely to make a mess.</p><p><strong>We need Risk Management because there are unavoidable questions in life which Science cannot answer</strong>, or even adequately address: What do you do when there isn\u2019t enough data to tell you what to do for sure? What do you do when there is no prescribed formula or well-trodden path? What do you do when the environment is constantly changing and you have important decisions to make? What do you do when all of the above are true, and there are thousands of lives on the line?</p><p>The ultimate question: What do you do, when you don\u2019t know what to do?</p><p>(Answer: You keep yourself alive \u2013 you manage your risks!)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>We need to let go of our misplaced faith in the omnipotence or infallibility of \u2018The Science\u2019, and recognise instead the essential and irreplaceable value of Risk Management in all crisis management, but especially pandemic prevention.</p><p>Successful outbreak control calls for goal-setting, planning, preparation, resource management, and tactical decision-making in the moment (Risk Management) not precise statement-making at a lag (Science). <strong>We cannot end the threat of pandemics until the people in positions of power and influence understand this distinction.</strong></p><p>As things stand, those people are generally medics, academics, and scientists. Although they may not want to admit it, their skillsets are unsuited to the problem of pandemic prevention: medics are trained in cure, not prevention; academics are concerned with theory, not practice; and scientists make statements, not decisions. They all have valuable contributions to make to pandemic prevention, but they cannot lead - we need Risk Managers for that. (You can read more about Risk Managers <a href=\"https://pandemicprevention.substack.com/p/wirm-6-risk-managers\">here</a>.)</p><p>Science can inform, but it cannot decide, so when Science leads, it will fail. Instead, the principles of Risk Management should guide our decision-making before (planning and preparation), during (tactical decision-making), and after (\u2018black box\u2019 / post-mortem analysis) all crises. If and when that happens, humanity will be one major step closer to making pandemics a thing of the past.</p>", "user": {"username": "PandemicRiskMan"}}, {"_id": "qe7uEMQgccmA5naKf", "title": "GiveWell is hiring for senior roles:\nHead of People Operations and Head of Communications", "postedAt": "2024-02-02T01:16:23.833Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Details about the Head of People Operations and Head of Communications roles are below.

Most silkworms are farmed in China and India, where around 10-47% of them die due to diseases. The worms that make it to the pupae stage, where they encase themselves in cocoons and start their metamorphosis, are then boiled alive in order to extract the silk thread from their cocoons. While most of the discussions on animal welfare issues surrounding this silk production process have focused on the killing of pupae, our research suggests that the majority of animal suffering for silkworms is caused by diseases during their lifetime. Predominantly because of this factor, we expect silkworms to lead net negative lives, which means that reducing the number of silkworms farmed would be a net positive for animal welfare. This is of course conditional on their sentience, for which strong evidence is lacking and unclear. We account for this uncertainty in our analysis.</p><p>Corporate campaigns for animal welfare have impacted the food industry, for example through cage-free egg and broiler campaigns, and the fashion industry, for example through anti-fur campaigns. As of now, there are no corporate campaigns focused on silk or any other insect species. Based on the proven track record of corporate campaigns in different areas and some evidence that consumers and retailers can be made to care about insect welfare and other issues related to silk production, it seems plausible that corporate campaigns against retailers of silk products could be a promising intervention. However, we remain very sceptical about the sympathy that the public may extend to insects like silkworms. While silk campaigns may use the images and videos of boiling cocoons and worm farms to their advantage in generating public pressure, such imagery is unlikely to be as emotionally impactful as that of caged hens or other vertebrate animals. In addition, there is a lack of fully adequate alternatives to silk, which might hinder retailers from moving away from silk products. The alternative options are either of lower quality and mostly synthetic, like nylon and lyocell, or they rely on innovative technologies that are yet to be scaled up and commercially viable, like spider silk. The experts we interviewed emphasised the need to offer alternatives to encourage retailers to transition away from silk.</p><p>Overall, corporate campaigns targeting silk retailers appear to be a promising intervention, given the notable success of similar campaigns in other domains and the ongoing shift away from animal-based materials in fashion. Besides direct animal welfare issues, silk campaigns could leverage concerns about sustainability and human rights issues associated with silk production.</p><p>The expected impact and cost-effectiveness of such campaigns crucially depend on the strategic selection of target countries and retailers. A significant unresolved uncertainty in this report is determining the share of the total silk market attributable to specific retailers. We recommend consulting industry experts or commissioning market research to quantify the exact amount of silk that can realistically be targeted with one campaign. This would reduce the large width of our cost-effectiveness estimate, which currently lies between 0.1 and 1,311 welfare points per dollar, with a geometric mean of 12 welfare points per dollar. The lower cost effectiveness and remaining uncertainties lead us to the conclusion that further targeted research is necessary before deciding for or against recommending this intervention for a new charity.</p><p>Should further research endorse this intervention, we think it should be implemented by a newly incubated charity. The existing charities working on corporate campaigns that could expand their focus to include silkworms are either not strongly impact-focused or have a narrow focus on very different farmed animals.</p><h1>1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Background</h1><h2>1.1&nbsp; &nbsp; Cause area: Insects, farming, and fashion</h2><h3><strong>1.1.1 Moral relevance of insects</strong></h3><p>Invertebrate animals are generally considered to be among the \u2018neglected species\u2019, a group of animals whose welfare concerns are rarely being addressed and considered. Rethink Priorities has done a number of reports on invertebrate welfare, including a 10-part report series exploring the philosophy of pain in non-humans, existing literature on the topic, estimates of cognitive capacity by taxa, and several other topics (Schukraft, 2019). They conclude that invertebrate welfare is a cause area worth prioritising. More than 99.9% of animals on earth are invertebrates, while less than 1% of Effective Altruism (EA) funding goes towards their welfare (as of 2019).</p><p>Insects are an important subgroup of invertebrates. There is no consensus among animal experts and environmentalists on whether or not we should give insects moral relevance. However, Faunalytics (2016) notes that:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cTime after time, societies have overturned widespread and strongly held views about whose welfare matters. The history of moral progress should remind us that what\u2019s obvious isn\u2019t always right. We must be humble enough to at least consider the possibility that we ought to care about insects.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>The question of sentience in insects is largely neglected in the literature. Rethink Priorities (Schukraft) has compiled the available evidence for invertebrate sentience in a 2019 report. The uncertainty of determining sentience in these species is high:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<i>To develop accurate cost-benefit models that can be used to allocate resources across the animal welfare movement, we need to take the possibility of invertebrate pain and pleasure seriously. But determining whether invertebrates have the capacity to experience pain and pleasure in a morally significant way is an extraordinarily complex and difficult undertaking. There is tremendous uncertainty at virtually every level at which one might investigate the matter. We don\u2019t expect to conclude with high confidence that invertebrates do or do not experience morally significant pain and pleasure. Such an outcome is too ambitious. Rather, our goal is to clearly map out the problem so that we can begin to systematically reduce key uncertainties in a cost-effective manner.</i>\u201d (Schukraft, 2019)</p></blockquote><p>While it seems clear that we are still left with tremendous uncertainty, Faunalytics (2016) recommends approaching this uncertainty by assigning a non-trivial likelihood to insects suffering. Even if the likelihood assigned to it is extremely low, the number of insects that exist is so significant that the scale of the problem is still large.&nbsp;<u>Section 3.2.3 of this report</u> will tackle questions of moral weight, welfare ranges, and probability of sentience in more detail.</p><p>There are currently a small number of initiatives working on addressing the problem of insect welfare specifically. Open Philanthropy has funded insect welfare research with grants in recent years (2022a, 2023a). The Insect Welfare Research Society which was founded recently (2023), is also sponsored by Open Philanthropy, and has an academic focus:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<i>The Insect Welfare Research Society is an academic-led research society founded in March 2023. The society aims to support 1) the global insect welfare research community and 2) the incorporation of evidence-based information on insect welfare into policy and practice by relevant stakeholders. We also support welfare research on understudied terrestrial arthropods that are not insects (e.g., spiders and other arachnids, myriapods like millipedes, etc.) and on understudied aquatic invertebrates (e.g., shrimp/prawns, horseshoe crabs, etc.)</i>\u201d (Insect Welfare Research Society, 2023).</p></blockquote><h3><strong>1.1.2 Insect farming</strong></h3><p>When it comes to the specific topic of insects being farmed, the numbers of individuals raised for food and animal feed annually reach 1-1.2 trillion, with between 79-94 billion insects being alive on farms on any given day. The largest producers are Thailand, France, South Africa, China, Canada, and the US. This seems to be a very fast-growing industry, with a lot of new investments and many startups. The most commonly farmed species and their estimated numbers are summarised in the table below (Rowe, 2020).&nbsp;</p><p><i>Table 1: Number of farmed insects</i></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kz3iyh5HYpRDwBKAz/uumvdtzefcukbqfrzf6i\"></p><p>Industrial insect farming is a relatively new practice, and a lot of producers seem to aim to replace fishmeal with insects. The numbers in the table above are likely to multiply massively if this becomes standard practice.&nbsp;</p><p>It appears that more grants and initiatives are being brought forward, mostly by the EA community. One of these is the newly launched (2023) Insect Institute (funded by Rethink Priorities). Their mission states:</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<i>We address challenges and uncertainties related to the production and use of insects for food and feed. We aim to assist this novel industry, policymakers, and other interested parties by providing evidence-based information surrounding the rearing of insects and the creation of a food system that promotes public health, animal welfare, and sustainable protein production</i>\u201d (The Insect Institute, n.d.).</p></blockquote><p>Besides animal and human feed, there are other purposes insects are being farmed in smaller numbers - cochineal are used for red dye in food and cosmetics, honeybees are used for food and pollen products, cockroaches are farmed for traditional Chinese medicine, and silkworms are used for their cocoons, which are turned into silk.</p><p>There is an even larger number of insects alive in the wild. The opinions on whether people should intervene in nature vary among experts (Faunalytics, 2016). Despite the lack of consensus, it might be worth looking into how to limit human-caused suffering for wild insects. This is out of the scope of this report, however.</p><h3><strong>1.1.3 Animal use in fashion</strong></h3><p>There are many different ways animals are still used in the fashion industry today. A number of animals are used for wool - most famously sheep, but also goats for cashmere and Angora rabbits for their famously soft wool. Leather, mostly from cows, is another very commonly used material for shoes, clothing, and furniture. Birds such as ducks or geese are used for their feathers (down) for jackets and bedding. Fur coats from minks, foxes, rabbits, and many other species used to be commonly used and despite many modern alternatives, the fur industry still exists. Silkworms are used for their cocoons, which are then reeled into silk.</p><p>The species most commonly used in the fashion industry are listed in the table below, together with their estimated numbers.</p><p><i>Table 2: Number of animals farmed for fashion</i></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;width:100px\"><strong>Species</strong></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;height:12px;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;width:100px\"><strong>Material</strong></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Number of animals (in existence on an average day, if not indicated otherwise)</strong></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Material produced (tonnes)</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Sheep</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://iwto.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/IWTO-Market-Information-Sample-Edition-17.pdf\"><u>Wool</u></a></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">1.2 bil</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">1.2 mil (clean wool)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Cashmere goats</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cashmere_goat\"><u>Cashmere wool</u></a></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">100 mil</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">20 k</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Cows</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-clothing/leather-industry/global-leather-trade/\"><u>Leather</u></a></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">~1 bil</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">9 mil</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Angora rabbits</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angora_wool\"><u>Angora wool</u></a></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">~50 mil</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">2.3-4 k</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Geese and ducks</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/news/everything-you-need-know-about-buying-ethically-sourced-down-products#:~:text=The%20vast%20majority%20of%20the,before%20heading%20to%20the%20slaughterhouse.\"><u>Down feathers</u></a></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">~3 bil</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">270 k</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Various mammals</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://www.hsi.org/news-resources/fur-trade/#:~:text=Each%20year%2C%20around%20one%20hundred,of%20other%20clothing%20and%20accessories.\"><u>Fur</u></a></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>~100 mil</p><p>(killed annually)</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">N/A</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Silkworms</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/silk-production\"><u>Silk</u></a></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>420 bil -1 tril</p><p>(killed annually)</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">200 k</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Historically, animals and plants (e.g. cotton) were the only source of material for human clothing. In the last century, the share of animal-derived materials has decreased due to the development of many synthetic fibre alternatives, such as polyester, nylon, viscose, and other mostly polymer-based materials (Wikipedia, 2023). A lot of the animal-derived materials are nowadays considered luxury (especially cashmere, silk, and angora wool).</p><p>The fashion industry is associated with many welfare issues and concerns. There have been various corporate and policy commitments to better animal welfare or even bans on production of various materials.</p><h2>1.2&nbsp; &nbsp; Topic area: Silk</h2><h3><strong>1.2.1 Silk production process</strong></h3><p>Silk is the material that silkworms produce to build their cocoons. The production of silk involves a complex and intensive process that makes use of the metamorphosis of silkworms into silk moths.</p><p>The process begins when a female silk moth lays between 300 and 400 eggs, after which she dies. These eggs take roughly ten days to hatch into tiny larvae. These larvae are then housed in designated boxes where they are given mulberry leaves to eat. Over the span of about six weeks, they undergo significant growth, multiplying their original weight by 10,000 times and consuming mulberry leaves that weigh 50,000 times their original weight. Once this growing period is over, the silkworms start the cocooning process. They attach themselves to a stationary object and spend between three to eight days spinning their cocoons (Rowe, 2021).</p><p>Once the larvae encase themselves in cocoons, they are most commonly killed by boiling them alive to extract the silk thread. Boiling is the prevalent method because it preserves the integrity of the long, continuous silk thread. If the pupae inside were to mature into a moth and break free, it would damage the thread, significantly decreasing its commercial value (Animal Ethics, n.d.; Rowe, 2021; Tomasik, 2016). Although there are various species of silkworms, the slaughter methods described above generally apply to all of them (Rowe, 2021). It is unclear how many silkworms exactly have to be killed in order to produce a certain amount of silk. Estimates vary somewhere between 3,000 and 15,000 worms per kilogram, but the most detailed and up-to-date report on this issue by Rethink Priorities argues that the correct number should be close to the lower end of this range (Animal Ethics, n.d.; Faunalytics, 2016; Rowe, 2021; Tomasik, 2016). Many of the dead pupae are recycled as feed for fishes, pigs, and sometimes even for human consumption (Animal Ethics, n.d.). A select few silkworms are not killed and are allowed to mature into moths, ensuring the continuation of the silk production cycle by laying eggs for the next generation (Animal Ethics, n.d., Rowe, 2021).</p><p>The vast majority of silk production is located in Asia, especially China and to a lesser extent India. In 2017, China accounted for ~80% of global production, India for ~18%, with only ~2% distributed among other countries (Rowe, 2021). Consumption patterns are more distributed and will be investigated in more detail in the geographic assessment later in this report.</p><h3><strong>1.2.2 Animal welfare concerns</strong></h3><p>Most of the discussions on animal welfare issues surrounding silk production have focused on the killing of pupae via the process described above. Accordingly, people have argued over the sentience of pupae during this stage of the metamorphosis. Tomasik (2016) provides a good overview of the different factors that have been cited in that debate and concludes that huge uncertainties remain. Rowe (2021) also emphasises large uncertainties: \u201cCurrently, the evidence that silkworms suffer during slaughter is extremely limited, so it is hard to come to a definitive position on the welfare consequences of boiling silkworms specifically.\u201d</p><p>However, Rowe (2021) provides a very helpful reframing of the issue, illustrating that most of the animal suffering in silk production does not come from the killing of worms at the pupae stage, but rather from diseases that affect worms during their lifetime. The reasoning seems worth citing in full here:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cEven if the slaughter is painful, which is not currently borne out in available evidence, it is likely a very brief experience, lasting just a few minutes, or around 0.02% of the average silkworm\u2019s life, compared with disease taking up around 70%. So, any intervention to reduce silkworm farming will most likely primarily be benefiting silkworms who will die on farms due to disease loss.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Estimating the extent of suffering caused by silk production, Rowe (2021) cites the following numbers:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI estimate that in 2017 (the most recent year comprehensive data is available) that between 420 billion and 1 trillion silkworms were killed or died due to disease on silk farms. I further estimate that silkworms lived a total of between 15 trillion and 37 trillion days on farms, of which at least 180 billion to 1.3 trillion days involved some degree of potentially negative experience, such as being slaughtered or suffering from a disease (note that slaughter only counts as a small fraction of day in this estimate, since it only lasts a few minutes). [...] While only 61 billion to 170 billion of these worms die due to diseases and pests, diseases cause up to 99% of the cumulative days of potentially negative experiences I identified on farms, (with the remaining 1% caused by slaughter).\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>The fact that most of the animal welfare concerns for silkworms affect their lives prior to slaughter means that it is much more relevant whether silkworms are sentient over the course of their lifetime than only during the pupae stage. Silkworms being sentient before the pupae stage is also not a given, but seems less controversial. Rethink Priorities has done highly relevant research on this issue (Fischer, 2022, 2023). For now, we will not go into detail on this complicated topic, but will assume that there is a non-trivial likelihood that silkworms are sentient. Given the enormous number of animals involved in silk farming, even a small likelihood of sentience justifies investigating how welfare can potentially be improved.</p><p>In&nbsp;<u>section 3.2.3</u>, we will go more into detail on questions related to the quality of lives that silkworms live under current farming conditions. Apart from the slaughter and diseases mentioned above, we need to consider further aspects of their lives in order to estimate whether the lives of farmed silkworms are net positive or negative on average. We will also build on Rethink Priorities\u2019 work and integrate estimates on the welfare range and probability of sentience of silkworms in our cost-effectiveness analysis.</p><h3><strong>1.2.3 Existing alternatives to conventional silk production</strong></h3><p>As the traditional silk production process raises significant animal welfare issues, some have explored alternative methods like Ahimsa silk. Ahimsa silk, inspired by Jain principles and also called peace silk, allows the moth to emerge from the cocoon before harvesting the silk. Though this method spares the moth's life, the resulting silk is of inferior quality, resembling wool more than conventional silk. (Animal Ethics, n.d.)</p><p>Even though Ahimsa silk avoids the killing of silkworms, it is not without its problems. The worms are still held in captivity and face harm and diseases during the production process. The method also requires more silkworms to produce the same amount of silk, as fewer cocoons are suitable for reeling. Further complicating the ethics of Ahimsa silk is the condition of the moths that emerge from their cocoons. The majority of animals that emerge from their cocoons are not capable of flying and die very shortly after hatching, a circumstance that could potentially lead to more suffering than the traditional method of boiling (Animal Ethics, n.d.; Rowe, 2021). Tomasik (2016) further adds that promoting Ahimsa silk could unintentionally encourage consumers to revert to traditional silk. If the price of Ahimsa silk rises due to increased demand, ethically conscious but financially limited consumers might opt for the less expensive, conventional silk, perpetuating the cycle of animal suffering.</p><p>In sum, \"It seems that Ahimsa silk is not necessarily a more humane alternative, unless one was only concerned about suffering during slaughter, which doesn\u2019t seem to be the main source of suffering in silk worms\" (Rowe, 2021). Therefore, Ahimsa silk should not be viewed as a comprehensive solution to the ethical concerns surrounding silk production.</p><p>A more viable path towards reducing animal suffering caused by silk production seems to simply lie in the replacement of conventional silk with alternative materials, like artificial silk, nylon, mercerized cotton, polyester, and many others (Tomasik, 2016). This would completely remove silkworms from the production process and thereby avoid the suffering caused to them in the process. We will go more into detail on alternative materials in&nbsp;<u>section 3.2.1</u> and&nbsp;<u>the interview with Nicole Rawling</u>.</p><h2>1.3&nbsp; &nbsp; Intervention options</h2><p>Promoting non-animal alternatives to silk is thus one intervention that could potentially alleviate animal suffering by reducing the need and thus scale of silk production. For instance, the Material Innovation Initiative (MII) is \u201cexploring next-generation silk alternatives that are less harmful to both animals and the environment\u201d (Material Innovation Initiative, 2021). Rowe (2021) also mentions the promise of developing and promoting alternative silks to reduce silk production and the ensuing animal suffering.</p><p>However, according to their analysis, the most effective route may be campaigns targeting retailers, particularly in countries of the Global North. Rowe (2021) calls this \"plausibly the most promising avenue for animal advocates to reduce silk production.\" They refer to successful past campaigns by PETA that have led to retailer commitments to stop the sale of silk products.</p><p>Other potential interventions that Rowe (2021) deems somewhat promising lie in advocacy for policy changes that ban the use of silkworms or consumer advocacy to change consumption patterns. Such campaigns could benefit from the existing public interest in more ethical silk production and human welfare issues associated with the process. \u201cOne notable reason silk bans and commitments to end the use of silk have been successful is that the silk industry frequently is accused of having violated human rights, through human health issues, child labour abuses, and slavery on factories\u201d (Rowe, 2021).</p><p>Improving hygiene on silk farms could theoretically also reduce suffering by decreasing the prevalence of disease among silkworms. However, Rowe (2021) is not optimistic about this avenue. They point out that farms already have intensive disinfecting routines, and further hygiene campaigns may not significantly reduce diseases. Moreover, such campaigns could unintentionally make silk cheaper, increasing demand and potentially leading to more silkworms being farmed.</p><p>In conclusion, while various interventions exist, campaigns targeting retailers in countries of the Global North appear to be the most promising route towards reducing animal suffering caused by silk production. This is supported by past successes in securing retailer commitments, as well as the multiple human-welfare angles that could strengthen the argument against silk.</p><h1>2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Theories of change</h1><h2>2.1&nbsp; &nbsp; Scope of the intervention</h2><p>Based on the background given in the previous section, this report focuses on corporate campaigns against retailers of silk products in the Global North as a potential intervention for a new charity to run.</p><p>Capriati (2018) provides a good overview of how corporate campaigns work and what they include:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cCorporate campaigns consist of efforts aimed at shifting corporate practices towards systems that improve animal welfare. Corporate campaigns can use a variety of strategies. In some cases, organisations promote change from within the company by supporting aligned stakeholders or offering technical assistance. Alternatively, advocates can launch social media campaigns against companies that refuse to engage. These campaigns can give consumers \u2013 who are often unaware of the problem \u2013 information about animal treatment in the production chain, creating negative publicity for companies. This creates a PR incentive for companies to address the issue.\u201c</i></p></blockquote><p>This description highlights the dual nature of corporate campaigns. On the one hand, they are based on a collaborative approach, working together with companies to implement certain commitments. On the other hand, they usually also involve a more confrontational approach that pressures companies via negative publicity. While it is typical for these two strategies to be divided up among two different organisations (\u2018good cop and bad cop\u2019), the theory of change (ToC) outlined in this chapter depicts both aspects of this two-pronged approach, in order to analyse all of the relevant steps involved in this intervention. When it comes to implementation, we need to keep in mind that it might be helpful or necessary to have multiple/different actors involved.</p><p>The ToC even makes a further distinction: public pressure can be generated by activist-led activities (e.g. protests), but can also come from the broader public, as they are influenced by public campaigns. The \u201cupper\u201d path (outputs and outcomes) in the visual ToC below concerns the broader public support, while the \u201clower\u201d part represents the direct actions by activists.</p><h2>2.2&nbsp; &nbsp; Causal chain</h2><p>The graph below shows the most important steps that need to be completed for corporate campaigns against silk retailers to have the desired positive effect on animal welfare. The full visualisation can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.canva.com/design/DAFxsYLxJ4Q/nkO5Qe0W0LD1EXUX8wt-xQ/edit?utm_content=DAFxsYLxJ4Q&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link2&amp;utm_source=sharebutton\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>The numbers indicate assumptions that need to hold for the different steps to work out as intended. Their colours represent the level of uncertainty for this specific assumption/part of the ToC prior to a deeper evidence review, from red (high), to yellow (medium), and green (low). These assumptions are outlined in more detail in the&nbsp;<u>following section</u>, highlighting some preliminary thoughts and considerations, before the crucial uncertainties will be addressed with a more in-depth&nbsp;<u>evidence review in section 3</u>.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/kz3iyh5HYpRDwBKAz/cgqk4ustuoelhomyidyg\"></p><h2>2.3&nbsp; &nbsp;Outlining assumptions and levels of uncertainty</h2><p><i>1. There is information about which are the most important silk product retail markets</i></p><p>For assumptions #1 and #2, we need to do a geographic assessment, finding the countries that seem most promising for our work.</p><p>Our campaign should focus on retailers and countries that account for large shares of global silk product consumption, in order for them to have the largest effect possible. As our quick search did not show comprehensive statistics on silk products (only raw silk which is different from end products), we assigned this medium uncertainty. It would be quite problematic, if we could not find a country or group of countries to work in. However, even if there are no official statistics, we should be able to get some guidance from industry experts or other sources.</p><p><i>2. There are indicators that allow us to evaluate which countries provide a good environment for running corporate campaigns</i></p><p>The countries we focus on should not only have the potential to affect large parts of the global silk market, but should also provide an environment that is conducive to running corporate campaigns. Factors that play a role here are civil liberties (i.e. no legal restrictions, freedom to demonstrate, etc.), the strength of the animal advocacy movement and concern for animals among the public, successes of previous campaigns, and many more. It seems like data for good indicators should be available and we are fairly certain that we could find countries where corporate campaigns can be run properly.</p><p><i>3. Information about the main retailers of silk exists and is easy to find</i></p><p>As written under assumption #1, our campaign should focus on retailers and countries that account for large shares of global silk product consumption, in order for them to have the largest effect possible. As our quick search did not show comprehensive statistics on silk retailers, we assigned this medium uncertainty. It is unclear whether we should target broad-market retailers (like H&amp;M or Gap) for whom silk only constitutes a minor share of their sales, or more niche and high-end companies for whom silk as a high-quality material plays a larger role. It would be quite problematic, if we did not know which retailers would be most promising to target. However, even if there are no official statistics, we should be able to get some guidance from industry experts or other sources.</p><p><i>4. Retailers are reachable and when contacted they express willingness to discuss</i></p><p>Once we have settled on certain retailers to target, we need to be able to get in contact with them. In the best case, they are open to changing their policies towards silk use.</p><p>Currently many retailers focus on being branded as ethical and sustainable and have committed to various targets. There could be low-hanging fruits of retailers that are willing to collaborate on moving away from silk. Still, it is far from certain that retailers are willing to collaborate with us. This uncertainty does not seem crucial though. If retailers are not willing to collaborate with us right from the start, we can run pressure campaigns to get them to reconsider their stance.</p><p><i>5. Our campaign reaches the public</i></p><p>As described above, public campaigns are important in order to generate further pressure on retailers that are not willing to comply with our demands. It might be that this \u201cupper\u201d path of our ToC is not strictly necessary, as it is more important that our campaign directly reaches retailers and we might not need broad public support. However, public support should significantly increase our chances of success. This is not just nice-to-have, but is important. Still, it is not as important as the direct path towards retailers.</p><p>In order to reach the public, we need to be able to design a good and convincing campaign. We need the right skills and expertise to do so, but can also learn from the wide range of campaigns that have been run by other organisations before (e.g. fur, cage-free, broiler). The learnings from these campaigns might not be directly applicable to our use case, as there should be a big information gap among the public when it comes to animal suffering in silk production.</p><p>Still, given that we can draw on learnings from other campaigns and that public support is not strictly necessary, this assumption does not seem like a huge uncertainty in our ToC. Whether our public outreach is sufficient to pressure and convince retailers is covered under different assumptions below.</p><p><i>6. Retailers consider changing their practices</i></p><p>Retailers might consider changing their practices based on their general openness (see assumption #4) or pressure generated by activists. The pressure generated by activists might not be strong enough though to incentivise retailers to collaborate before they get hit with public campaigns.</p><p>The direct impact of our outreach and campaign on retailers seems to be the most important path in our ToC, more so than the public pressure indirectly caused by our public campaign. If retailers are not willing to collaborate with us, a large amount of public pressure would be needed to get them towards a commitment, which seems hard to achieve. It therefore seems like a major uncertainty that we need to investigate, how likely it is that retailers will collaborate with us.</p><p><i>7. The public campaign leads people to actively pressure retailers</i></p><p>As written above, public pressure is an important supplement to the pressure generated by activists directly, but not strictly necessary.</p><p>Such pressure can come in many forms and barriers are relatively low for people to sign a petition or post on social media. Previous campaigns on other issues have shown that support for animal causes and the wider animal movement is strong enough to engage the public. However, it is quite uncertain whether people can be persuaded to care enough about insects to take active steps. It seems like the campaign would have to be very strong in order to ignite public pressure on such an opaque issue.</p><p>In sum, this assumption is relatively uncertain, but not the most crucial one in our ToC.</p><p><i>8. The campaign has an impact on consumer behaviour and demand goes down</i></p><p>Our assessment for this assumption is very similar as for #7 above. The assumption is very uncertain, as there is conflicting evidence from other campaigns about behavioural change and effects on consumer behaviour are usually small and short lived. However, we assume that this is not a crucial path in our ToC to influence companies via corporate campaigns.</p><p><i>9. Retailers have strong-enough incentives to make the commitments</i></p><p>The idea is that the direct action by activists and the potential public pressure generated by the campaign will lead retailers to make commitments against the use/sale of silk products. The question of whether this will be successful is probably the most crucial issue in our ToC. Without retailer commitments, most of the potential impact of our campaigns would be lost.</p><p>One important issue here is whether the (public) pressure generated via the previous steps is sufficient to drive retailers towards making commitments. This relates to the previous assumptions and it seems quite uncertain that pressure can be strong enough on a more niche issue like silk.</p><p>When asked to stop selling silk products, retailers might not just stop selling such products but might look for alternatives to replace them. For this scenario, it is highly relevant whether retailers have adequate, high-quality alternatives to use instead of silk. There seem to be some alternatives available, either cheaper (lyocell, nylon, etc.) or more luxurious new alternatives created by startups (spider silk, cactus silk, etc.), but the question of how adequate they are and whether retailers would be willing to use them instead remains uncertain. If cheaper alternatives already exist, we need to understand why corporations are not already using them and whether this indicates that silk is hard to replace. We could look into how transition from other animal materials happened in the past or why corporations might be hesitant to switch to alternatives.</p><p><i>10. Retailers have strong-enough incentives to follow the commitments</i></p><p>Once (or if) retailers have made the commitments, it is important that they also follow them in practice. This can either happen automatically (i.e. the corporations directly follow their commitments) or it may require sustained pressure on the retailers. As for making the commitments, this depends on the strength of the campaign and the retailers\u2019 initial willingness to move away from silk products.</p><p>In any case, it is important for this intervention that retailers are followed up on their commitments. This has also been an important part of corporate campaigns in different areas (e.g. cage-free eggs). Enforcement rates for those campaigns seem to be relatively strong, but we will need to analyse this further.</p><p><i>11. Reduced demand by the retailers translates into reduced production</i></p><p>Once the targeted retailers stop or reduce their use of silk, this should have an effect on production. This is predicted by economic theory and simple logic and should be somewhat uncontroversial. However, it is an important question whether the retailers we would tackle use enough silk to make a significant difference on producers. This is not a given, but since we would select the most influential retailers for our campaigns (see assumption #3), this should be the case.</p><p>Another uncertainty concerns indirect effects. If certain retailers stop selling silk products, consumers who want to buy such products might simply shift their consumption to other retailers who still offer them. This is a significant worry, but also one that is not unique to silk. Campaigns against fur products are subject to the same uncertainty. Something similar could also be said of cage-free eggs, as consumers who want to buy cheaper products (which typically come from caged farming), could shift their consumption to other companies that still source such products. The worry about such a shift occurring should be larger in the case of silk, as this concerns an outright ban of a whole category of products, which certain consumers might be actively looking for. At the same time, it also seems likely that many consumers would simply buy an alternative non-silk product, as they are not actively looking for silk products specifically and are mostly led by what is offered by retailers. Overall, this is a potential effect that needs to be closely monitored, but we do not expect effects to be massively different than for other product categories that have been the target of corporate campaigns. We therefore mostly rely on evidence from such other campaigns (cage-free, fur, etc.).</p><p>One could also argue that one retailer stopping or reducing its demand might simply lead to a decrease in silk prices, which incentivises others to increase their demand as a result. However, this argument does not seem too convincing. The increased demand from others would once again increase prices, leading to a new market equilibrium, at somewhat higher prices and lower demand. Basic economic logic of supply and demand should hold.&nbsp;</p><p><i>12. The production of silk will not be replaced by \u2018ethical silk\u2019 that has similar issues (disease) and lower yields (as it lets the cocoons hatch on their own)</i></p><p>It is conceivable that retailers are not willing to move away from silk completely, but want to switch towards more humane or sustainable methods. As outlined in&nbsp;<u>section 1.2.3</u>, the issue is that such alternatives are unlikely to lead to less animal suffering. Retailers or the public might not share our ethical assumptions though and think that what matters is only the killing of silkworms, not their farming conditions (and the suffering associated with that).</p><p>Considering the full scope of our intervention, this seems unlikely and we should be able to mitigate potential negative effects. Our campaign and outreach to retailers would make clear that other methods are not in fact an acceptable alternative.</p><p><i>13. Less silkworms being farmed is a net positive for animals</i></p><p>Finally, we need to understand whether a reduction in production would be a net positive for animals. This is only the case, if silkworms are sentient and the silkworms\u2019 lives are net negative on average. A reduction in farming might also be a positive development based on other moral perspectives.&nbsp;</p><p>This assumption seems likely to hold, given the welfare issues around silkworm farming outlined in&nbsp;<u>section 1.2.2</u>. However, as this is a crucial assumption for our ToC, we should investigate this in more detail. There are significant uncertainties around the sentience of silkworms as well as the quality of life for silkworms that do not suffer from diseases and whether their lives might be net positive.</p><h1>3 &nbsp; &nbsp; Quality of evidence</h1><p>The assumptions highlighted in the previous section need to be scrutinised in more depth by conducting an evidence review. This section is split into two parts. First, we focus on the steps and assumptions that are mostly under the control of the organisation that is running the intervention, trying to find evidence for or against the claim that the charity can get retailers to make and uphold commitments against the use or sale of silk. Second, we analyse the next steps that result from these commitments, investigating the assumptions that need to hold in order for the implemented commitments to have the intended positive impact.</p><h2>3.1&nbsp; &nbsp; Evidence that a charity can make change in this space</h2><p>When trying to assess the evidence that a charity can achieve the desired change, i.e. getting retailers to make and implement commitments, we need to investigate assumptions #1 to #10 in our ToC. In order to focus our evidence review on the key questions that need to be investigated, we decided not to analyse every assumption separately, but rather to aggregate or group assumptions together wherever this seemed helpful. The table below gives an overview of the different assumptions and how we decided to aggregate and address them in this section.</p><p><i>Table 3: Assumptions and crucial considerations on whether the charity can get retailers to make and implement commitments</i></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;width:100px\"><strong>Number</strong></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Assumption</strong></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>High-level question</strong></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Priority</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">1</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">There is information about which are the most important silk product retail markets</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" rowspan=\"2\">Can we find promising countries to focus our campaign on?</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" rowspan=\"2\">Not reviewed here, as this will be tackled in&nbsp;<u>the geographic assessment in section 5</u></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">2</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">There are indicators that allow us to evaluate which countries provide a good environment for running corporate campaigns</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">3</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Information about the main retailers of silk exists and is easy to find.</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" rowspan=\"2\">Can we find the main retailers to target (based on their amount of silk sales and expected willingness to change)?</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" rowspan=\"2\">Relatively low uncertainty, thus low priority;

We decided to do this in chronological order instead of priority, as this should make it easier for readers to follow the process through our ToC.</p><h3><strong>3.1.1 Finding retailers to target</strong></h3><p>The first uncertainty we are trying to resolve in this evidence review is whether an organisation that wanted to implement the intervention could identify promising retailers it should target. To maximise the expected impact with its intervention, the organisation should focus on retailers that sell large amounts of silk products and seem like they could be convinced to change their attitudes towards these sales.</p><p>An interesting data point here could be how the Open Wing Alliance (OWA) selects the companies it targets with its corporate campaigns for cage-free eggs, as such campaigns have been very successful (Bollard, 2017) and bear similarity to our intervention. Unfortunately, we could not find any public statement on the OWA\u2019s approach in selecting companies. However, from The Global Manufacturers Report released in 2023, it is apparent that OWA\u2019s targets are among the largest companies worldwide, suggesting that they target companies based on their size and influence in the industry (Open Wing Alliance, n.d.).</p><p>The significance of targeting large retailers is further supported by campaigns against fur farming. In one of their research newsletters, Open Philanthropy analysed the fight against fur farming and also stated that \u201cadvocates do best when they focus on the few hundred retailers that sell most animal products\u201d (Open Philanthropy, n.d.).</p><p>More detailed evidence on how companies are selected for corporate campaigns comes from PETA, one of the most experienced campaigners in the fashion space. PETA is known for their on-the-street campaigns, associated with throwing paint at fur-coat wearers, but their tactics have changed in the last decade or two, focusing more on corporate outreach and collaborations with brands. Their strategy involves identifying industries or suppliers engaging in malpractices, then researching their clientele and supporters. When selecting which companies to target, they consider factors like the amount of the animal-derived material sold by the company, whether this company is likely to influence other companies, and whether the company\u2019s customer base feels strongly about animals (for example young female customers typically care more about animal issues). For instance, in 2019, when an investigation into alpaca wool revealed horrifying welfare concerns, PETA identified brands (H&amp;M, Gap, Anthropologie) that are both large and influential and likely to consider an alpaca ban, based on their previous promise to stop selling mohair products during a campaign. (Testa, 2020)</p><p>Summarising the evidence from corporate campaigns in related areas (cage-free eggs, fur, alpaca wool, and other campaigns run by PETA), we find that there is an established way of finding retailers to target.</p><p>This seems highly applicable to anti-silk campaigns. As our research for this report did not yield any strong and useful statistics on who the biggest sellers of silk products are, PETA\u2019s approach outlined above should be the best approach, starting with producers and suppliers (primarily in China and India) and understanding who their biggest customers are. Key market players are highlighted in reports like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/silk-market\"><u>this one</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.databridgemarketresearch.com/reports/global-silk-market\"><u>this one</u></a>. Talking to industry experts should also be a promising avenue for finding out who the key retailers are. The research conducted for this report suggests that the key targets might simply be the biggest retailers of apparel, home decor, and similar key uses for silk. While these retailers are not exclusively focusing on silk products, they are so large that the amount of silk sales and their influence on other companies probably make them more promising targets than smaller retailers that might specialise in silk or luxury products in general. Broad-market retailers also seem more likely to agree to switching away from silk products, as silk is not as vital to their business. Even though this path is suggested by our research here, we are uncertain of this claim and suggest that a potential charity running this intervention investigate in more depth which companies use and sell the largest amounts of silk. Some more insights on the question of whether to focus on broad-market or luxury retails are also given in&nbsp;<u>section 3.2.2</u> and are discussed in our interviews with&nbsp;<u>Jonas Becker</u>,&nbsp;<u>PJ Smith</u>, and&nbsp;<u>an expert</u> on fashion campaigns. For now, it seems likely that top targets will come from lists like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbcommerce.eu/blog/2022/09/15/top-20-fashion-retail-europe-report-2022/\"><u>this one, showing the top 20 fashion retailers in Europe</u></a>. A quick sanity check revealed that the majority of such retailers should be selling silk products (e.g. Zara, H&amp;M, Zalando) (H&amp;M, n.d.; Zalando, n.d.; Zara, n.d.), with companies that have already pledged to stop silk sales, like Asos (The Guardian, 2018), being exceptions rather than the norm.</p><h3><strong>3.1.2 Engaging the public to pressure retailers</strong></h3><p>The second uncertainty we are trying to address here concerns the \u201cupper path\u201d of outputs and outcomes in&nbsp;<u>our visual ToC</u>, namely if and how strongly a campaign against the use/sale of silk can leverage public pressure to secure the desired commitments. Corporate campaigns usually involve a mixture of direct contact with the companies, and public campaigns to enhance the pressure on those companies. The public-facing part of corporate campaigns is usually driven by activist groups, but leverages the general public to exert greater pressure on the targeted companies. Our ToC shows two ways in which the public can pressure companies: Either via direct action that threatens the companies\u2019 image or by changing their demand behaviour.</p><p>Our evidence review finds that changes in demand caused by the campaigns are very likely not a significant factor in convincing companies to make commitments. For instance, boycotts, which can be seen as a specific form or part of corporate campaigns, have been shown to have negligible effects on revenues (Institute for Policy Research, 2017). Analyses and explanations on the key mechanisms of corporate campaigns by groups like the OWA and PETA did not mention demand as a significant factor (Beck, n.d.; Testa, 2020). While the voluntary commitment of Asos to ban mohair, cashmere, and silk seems to be based on gradually shifting attitudes and demand patterns of consumers, and thereby shows that demand does play a role on companies\u2019 decisions, demand changes do not fit with the short timelines and intense pressure which usually characterise corporate campaigns (The Guardian, 2018). We therefore did not investigate the likelihood of assumption #8 (that the campaign has an impact on consumer behaviour and demand goes down) to hold true, as we generally expect this not to be a major factor.</p><p>The much more important way in which the public can be leveraged is direct action against the companies\u2019 public image. \u201cWhile boycotts rarely hurt revenues, they can threaten a company\u2019s reputation, especially by generating negative media coverage\u201d (Institute for Policy Research, 2017). Bollard (2017) highlights that engaging public pressure via social media, online petitions, calls, or street protests is an important part of campaigns when companies do not collaborate or make commitments. The same is highlighted by Testa\u2019s (2020) analysis of PETA\u2019s campaigns, as PETA can draw on the backing of millions of followers and supporters. It thus seems very likely that support from a broad group of people from the general public boosts public campaigns. However, all of these pressure tactics are usually planned and coordinated by the campaign team. It does not seem to be an important aspect of the ToC that public groups organise themselves \u2018organically\u2019 to put pressure on the companies, but rather that they align themselves with the existing campaign (Beck, n.d.).</p><p>Applying these tactics to the case of silk retailers should be straightforward, using a public campaign to leverage the public to exert pressure on the companies. However, one key uncertainty is whether the public cares enough about silk production issues to raise their voices. While support for cage-free vs. caged egg production seems to be strong across a majority of countries (Sinclair et al., 2022), we could not find opinion polling data on public attitudes towards silk. One positive piece of evidence for consumers caring about insects comes from a 2012 controversy around Starbucks using cochineal as a red rye in its drinks. As the company faced negative publicity, it was willing to move away from the use of this animal-derived ingredient. However, it is important to note that the strength and success of public pressure in this case might have come from people\u2019s disgust reaction to consuming insects more so than actual welfare concerns (Shute, 2012; Witrak, 2012). Similarly, a campaign against silk products could broaden its messaging beyond the mere animal welfare concerns and also highlight the human-welfare concerns related to silk production (e.g. modern-day slavery) (Rowe, 2021). In general, it seems very unlikely though that silk campaigns can garner similar levels of support as cage-free campaigns, due to the generally lower levels of moral concern for insects (Faunalytics, 2016).&nbsp;</p><p>In sum, public support and backing has been an important part of pressuring companies, using tools like direct emailing or social media. However, a new organisation running campaigns on a more niche issue like silk might not have enough followers or public reach to exert strong pressure on companies. It might be that such an issue would be better fitted within a bigger organisation that is able to mobilise its supporters for this issue. While specialisation is usually a plus for charitable programmes, this is a watchout here and we need to consider whether this intervention might be better placed within a larger organisation that addresses animal farming for fashion generally, like PETA. We further explore this topic again in&nbsp;<u>section 9</u>.</p><h3><strong>3.1.3 Convincing retailers to sign commitments</strong></h3><p>The previous question on whether public support would be strong enough to put sufficient pressure on companies leads directly into the next and largest uncertainty in the ToC: Can we get retailers to adjust their stance on silk and sign commitments? As outlined in the ToC, this depends both on the direct cooperation with retailers (\u2018good cop\u2019 strategy) and the effect of pressure campaigns (\u2018bad cop\u2019 strategy).</p><p>To understand the likelihood of convincing retailers to make commitments, we want to look at the success rates of previous corporate campaigns and adjust these rates based on the specific factors related to silk products. Unfortunately, we could not find any numbers on success rates in the literature. However, we were able to use some of the expert interviews we conducted for this report (see&nbsp;<u>section 4</u>) to come to a prior estimate for success rates that we could then update based on further research. So in this specific case, we decided to already apply insights from a later part of the report to this earlier section, as other evidence for base rates was hard to come by.</p><p>Jonas Becker, the expert we consulted about corporate campaigns for broiler chickens, was able to provide us with highly relevant insights on this issue (see&nbsp;<u>section 4.2</u> for the full notes from this interview). He noted that all of the campaigns that they have run over the last years in Germany have at least resulted in a compromise. When asked to give an estimate of success rates, he said that 50% would be a good conservative estimate for the broiler chicken campaigns. While silk is a very different product from chickens when it comes to the production process and animal welfare concerns involved, we use this estimate to inform our prior here, in the absence of better evidence. Given that his estimate is a conservative one and that all campaigns ended at least in a compromise, his statements suggest a prior likelihood of success around 60%. Our interview with a fashion campaign expert provided an additional perspective that we used to inform our prior (see&nbsp;<u>section 4.3</u> for the full notes from this interview). This expert was reluctant to give a quantitative estimate of success rates. However, their experience from the fashion industry seemed less optimistic than what Jonas reported and from their remarks it seems unlikely that they are able to convince more than half of the companies they target. Combining these two perspectives, we decided to set our prior estimate for the probability of success at 40%.</p><p>This prior needs to be updated based on further considerations and pieces of evidence that seem relevant for corporate campaigns against the use/sale of silk products. The table below lists all of the most important factors we found and how they update our estimate, while the remaining part of this section describes our perspective on each of them in detail. We then conclude with our updated numerical estimate of the likelihood of success.</p><p><i>Table 4: Crucial considerations for the likelihood of success of corporate campaigns and their impact on our prior estimate</i></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"background-color:#cccccc;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Factor</strong></th><th style=\"background-color:#cccccc;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Update</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#e06666;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Lack of public concern for silkworms</td><td style=\"background-color:#e06666;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>----</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#b6d7a8;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Success of other fashion campaigns</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#b6d7a8;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>++</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Success of other corporate outreach tactics for less charismatic animals</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>+</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Existing initiatives by retailers to shift away from silk</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>+</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Public support for other insect issues</td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>+</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Potential to use related issues in campaigns</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>+</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#eb8d8d;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Lack of good alternatives</td><td style=\"background-color:#eb8d8d;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>---</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><i>Lack of public concern for silkworms</i></p><p>The most important difference between corporate campaigns focused on silkworms and chickens is probably the difference in moral concern assigned to these two animal groups. As Faunalytics (2016) highlights, insect suffering has not been widely acknowledged as morally relevant yet. In the case of silk, the lack of empathy-provoking footage to use in public campaigns might be a huge impediment. For cage-free campaigns, \u201cadvocates created YouTube and Facebook videos to alert companies\u2019 consumers to the suffering of hens in their supply chains. This tactic worked especially well because the reality of hens\u2019 treatment conflicted with the images that companies had portrayed, leading consumers to feel deceived\u201d (Bollard, 2017). Employing such video footage will likely be much less effective in the case of silk production. The lack of moral concern for the suffering of silkworms and the difficulty of inciting such concerns is thus the major factor we consider in our update here. (----)</p><p><i>Success of other fashion campaigns</i></p><p>Next to the corporate cage-free campaigns, we have also found positive pieces of evidence on corporate campaigns that different organisations have run in the fashion space. PETA reports that their campaigns against angora wool have been successful, where their eyewitness video footage of rabbits screaming while their wool gets ripped out led to over 400 brands to ban angora wool, with many major international brands among them. PETA has also run campaigns against alpaca wool with major companies like H&amp;M, Gap, and Anthropologie (PETA, n.d.-a). An article by The New York Times illustrates PETA\u2019s approach and the companies\u2019 responses, but does not provide good evidence on the success of these campaigns (Testa, 2020). It suggests though, that corporate campaigns are a promising way to get commitments from fashion retailers. Next to PETA there are other organisations pushing for better animal welfare in fashion, such as The Humane Society (Humane Society International, n.d.; The Humane Society of the United States, n.d.), Four Paws (n.d.) and the Fur Free Alliance (2023). The fight against fur is a particularly insightful example that can act as a relatively good analogy to silk (despite obvious differences in the kinds of animals and farming practices involved). Fur production has been declining over the past years, with production down by 60-70% in most regions between 2014 and 2021, and many retailers have stopped selling fur products (Humane Society International, 2023). The Fur Free Alliance (2023) has coordinated the work of a wide variety of organisations on this issue, also running a programme directly targeted at retailers, called Fur Free Retailers (2023). Open Philanthropy has argued that corporate campaigns against fur have been successful and played a major role in this development (Open Philanthropy, n.d.). In sum, the evidence from other fashion campaigns seems very positive. Even though Faunalytics (2016) writes that silk might be the new fur, given the differences between those previous campaigns and the cause of silk, we only take this as a medium positive piece of evidence. (++)</p><p><i>Success of other corporate outreach tactics for less charismatic animals</i></p><p>There is evidence that business-oriented tactics can work in other, less obvious areas as well. Other organisations working on less salient issues, like shrimp welfare, have also found corporate engagement and outreach to be promising (Boddy &amp; Jimenez, 2023). As we have not evaluated these approaches rigorously though, we only take this as a weak positive update. (+)</p><p><i>Existing initiatives by retailers to shift away from silk</i></p><p>Outside of campaigns, some retailers have already voluntarily shifted away from silk based on welfare concerns. One of the biggest examples is Asos, who pledged to stop sales of mohair, cashmere, and silk products from 2019 (The Guardian, 2018). This provides at least an anecdotal piece of evidence that the public and retailers can be motivated to care about silkworm welfare. (+) This example also suggests that it might be more cost-effective to run campaigns that push for banning all animal materials, instead of narrowly focusing on silk. We are very uncertain about this, as \u201cfocusing on a single issue\u201d has been found to be important factors contributing to the success of cage-free campaigns (Bollard, 2017). This is a question that could be explored further.</p><p><i>Public support for other insect issues</i></p><p>There are some scattered data points from other insect issues that can also provide relevant insights on the likelihood of success of corporate campaigns against silk. As mentioned in the previous section, cochineal use in Starbucks drinks has been an issue that received strong public attention and motivated Starbucks to change their policies. However, the difference between food and clothing is highly relevant here, as the disgust element that was present in the Starbucks case could not be leveraged for silk campaigns. Other insights can come from campaigns aimed at helping bees, like a UK government campaign to get people to take action to help these insects. While this does count as some evidence that society cares about insects and successful campaigns could be run, it is important to note that bees are a very different case from silkworms, as they are wild animals that have become a relatively beloved species among parts of the public (Lockwood, 2022). In general, most evidence we could find was on organisations or individuals advocating for wild insects, like Somerset Wildlife Trust (n.d.). Given that these other insect issues are quite different from silk production, we only take this as a weak positive factor. (+)</p><p><i>Potential to use related issues in campaigns</i></p><p>Campaigns against silk do not have to be restricted to a focus on animal welfare issues. The campaigns could still be effective, even if the public does not care about the welfare of silkworms. Rowe (2017) writes:&nbsp;<i>\u201c</i>One notable reason silk bans and commitments to end the use of silk have been successful is that the silk industry frequently is accused of having violated human rights, through human health issues, child labour abuses, and slavery on factories\u201d. Leveraging these issues should increase the chances of success for corporate campaigns and we assign a weak positive effect to this factor. (+)</p><p><i>Lack of good alternatives</i></p><p>In any case, if retailers are supposed to shift away from silk products, they will need to have good alternatives. Highlighting lessons learned from the fur-free fight,&nbsp;Open Philanthropy describes how important it has been for companies to be presented with good alternatives:</p><blockquote><p><i>\"Giorgio Armani, Anna Sui, and Michael Kors all cited innovation in faux fur as a reason to drop fur, just as Dunkin' cited plant-based meat innovation in adding Beyond Meat\u2019s sausage to its menu. Alternatives seem like an especially promising approach in China, which accounts for about 57% of global fur sales and 40% of all farm animals confined globally. A new group, the Material Innovation Initiative, wants to promote technological alternatives to fur and other animal-based fabrics, as GFI and PBFA are doing for alternatives to meat, eggs, dairy, and fish\"\u2019&nbsp;</i>(Open Philanthropy, n.d.).</p></blockquote><p>Many synthetic silk replacements already exist, either in the form of more expensive novelty alternatives such as artificial spider silk and cactus silk, or in the form of cheaper replacements like rayon, viscose and lyocell. Silk is considered a luxury material and even though cheaper alternatives have existed for a while, they do not seem like a possible replacement for more expensive luxury products (Hayden Hill, 2023). The Material Innovation Initiative describes the situation around silk alternatives as follows: \u201cSilk alternatives currently in the marketplace, such as polyester, viscose/rayon, and nylon, often fall short in terms of aesthetics, performance, and sustainability. Although a number of next-gen silk innovators exist, few are available at commercial scale\u201d (Material Innovation Initiative, 2021). It appears that current alternatives are either not popular at the luxury product market, or not commercially developed. For that reason it might make more sense to focus on decreasing production rather than fully replacing it. The lack of very strong alternatives provides a medium negative update to our estimate on the chances of success. (---)</p><p><i>Further aspects</i></p><p>While we think that we have covered the most important factors in this section, there are more potential aspects to consider when it comes to estimating the likelihood of success of corporate campaigns against silk. Open Philanthropy lists a wide range of factors that have been drivers of success in cage-free campaigns (Bollard, 2017). A detailed analysis of all of these factors was out of scope for this report, but could be a fruitful avenue for future research. While some of the listed factors (e.g. the use of social media to pressure companies and providing technical support to companies in implementing their commitments) could be replicated for corporate campaigns against silk, others will probably be less replicable and might lead us to lower the expected likelihood of success.</p><p><i>Conclusion</i></p><p>Summarising the evidence gathered in this section, it remains uncertain whether corporations can be convinced to drop silk products from their offerings. On the positive side, evidence from other corporate outreach tactics (on other fashion topics and other \u2018non charismatic\u2019 species) is mostly positive and we found pieces of evidence that support the claim that consumers and retailers can be made to care about insect welfare and other issues related to silk production. However, we remain very sceptical about the moral consideration that people will attribute to insects and it also seems like there is a lack of fully adequate silk alternatives for retailers to shift towards. In sum, these aspects lead us to update our prior in a slightly negative direction (-), adjusting from 40% to 35%. Based on our significant uncertainty, we assign a relatively wide symmetric interval from our most pessimistic to most optimistic scenario and thus estimate the likelihood of success to lie between 10% and 60%</p><h3><strong>3.1.4 Getting retailers to follow through on commitments</strong></h3><p>Once the retailers commit to a ban, restriction, or phase out of silk products, the next important question is whether this commitment will be fulfilled as promised, and how long that will take. Our campaign cannot stop at the point where retailers make their commitments, but needs to make sure that we follow up on the implementation, as this has been an important part of other corporate campaigns.</p><p>To estimate the likelihood of the retailers following through on their commitments, we have looked at data from previous campaigns. Most available data on this specific issue comes from cage-free and broiler campaigns, which should be taken into consideration as we might expect there to be differences between campaigns for different species and the food and fashion industries.</p><p>Simcikas (2019) has reported on the impact of corporate campaigns, and they make a prediction on the follow-through rates for cage-free (48%-84%, mean 64%) and broiler commitments (1%-94%, mean 24%). Their report mentions estimates made by other researchers in the space, generally with 30-60% follow-through rates (AGuesstimate, n.d.). Looking at historical evidence of previous campaigns, an EA forum post titled \u2018Will companies meet their animal welfare commitments?\u2019 shows that most welfare commitments were met, but several were broken (Sainsbury\u2019s broiler commitment), and several companies (such as Burger King) pushed their commitments back from the original timeline (Saulius, 2019). Another issue that was mentioned is the commitments being vague enough to give companies \u2018wiggle room\u2019 and avoid going through with the commitment as intended.</p><p>Looking at examples from the fashion industry, the reporting on follow-through rates is a little less clear. PETA for example has reported on many of their campaigns and then on the resulting sales ban or welfare commitments, but there does not seem to be an easily accessible database of commitments and their follow-through rates. Looking through individual reports of different brands, it seems like a significant number of the commitments went through (we would not expect follow-through rates to be significantly lower than in the case of the above-mentioned chicken commitments). After the angora wool campaign by PETA, over 400 brands committed to banning this material and followed through on the ban and a quick search on websites of some of these brands confirmed that no angora products were being sold (PETA, n.d.-b). Historically successful fur campaigns also caused some of the largest companies to stop selling fur (usually easily verifiable through a search of products on their websites). The RSPCA (n.d.) led a campaign with Humane Society International for a fur-free Britain, and some of the largest companies have stopped selling fur (Adidas, M&amp;S, H&amp;M, ASOS and others). It also seems that many companies are inclined to commit to welfare improvements and avoid specific suppliers, rather than fully ban a specific material, such as ASOS in the case of leather and wool (ASOS, n.d.), or H&amp;M and Gap committing (Testa, 2020) to not use a problematic alpaca wool supplier. In the latter case neither of the brands committed to banning alpaca wool right away and claim to only source from good farms going forward.</p><p>Overall, the follow-through rate is not likely to be very low. Especially in the fashion industry, it is more easily verifiable whether the commitments are being kept by checking retailers\u2019 product offerings. Our best estimate for follow-through rates is between 30% and 60%. The charity\u2019s sustained pressure and follow-up work with the companies should ensure that enforcement rates are not lower than those known from other campaigns.</p><h2>3.2 Evidence that the change has the expected effects</h2><h3><strong>3.2.1 Replacement of silk by worse alternatives</strong></h3><p>Some retailers might want to explore welfare commitments where traditional silk is replaced with \u2018ethically\u2019 harvested silk, where the moths are allowed to hatch and cocoons are processed afterwards. This kind of silk is called \u2018Ahimsa\u2019 silk and comes with a variety of welfare problems, as described in&nbsp;<u>section 1.2.3</u>.</p><p>While the majority of silk comes from China (~80% in China, ~18% in India) (Rowe, 2021), it appears that Ahimsa silk is predominantly produced in India, where it was created by Kusuma Rajaiah (House of Wandering Silk, n.d.). The exact numbers of Ahimsa silk made by domesticated mulberry silk worms and wild silk produced by other species of silkworm are not easily available. It is possible that wild silk causes less harm to the silkworms compared to farmed silk (both Ahimsa and non-Ahimsa), as the non-domesticated species can have higher survival rates and are free to reproduce. However, there is little data available on the details of wild silk production and the amount of wild silk is low compared to farmed silk (Wikipedia, 2022).</p><p>The use of Ahimsa silk has been on the rise since when it was first commercialised in the 1990s. It is especially popular in the Global North (USA, Europe, Australia, Japan). While many sources talk about Ahimsa silk becoming more popular, finding its exact market share and history of growth seems difficult (Aishwariya, 2020). On the positive side, if this is true, it shows that consumers in those countries care about welfare issues of silkworms. However, it seems unlikely that Ahimsa silk could replace a significant share of the silk market, since the production process is less cost effective, with Ahimsa silk costing around double the price of conventional silk and the material also being lower quality. (Ganguly, 2008)</p><p>The issue of Ahimsa silk potentially replacing traditional silk seems like a moderate uncertainty. While the demand for Ahimsa silk is growing due to animal welfare concerns, it still constitutes a small share of the silk market. Moreover, if companies decide to commit to moving away from silks and cooperate with animal welfare groups, they can be steered away from Ahimsa silk. The issues surrounding Ahimsa silk can also be included in the campaign to bring awareness to the reality of the animal cruelty involved. Overall, we should be able to mitigate this issue.</p><h3><strong>3.2.2 Lowering production with lower demand</strong></h3><p>The global silk market makes up only 0.17% of the whole fibre market (Morletto, 2023). Market research estimates the size of the global silk market at ~$15 billion in 2021, projecting it to grow by 7.5-8% and reach $34 billion by 2031 (Allied Market Research, 2022). While we think that market research firms tend to overestimate growth rates, this at least provides an indication of the market\u2019s general tendency for future growth.</p><p>The impact of the campaigns is dependent on whether the targeted brands make up a significant portion of the silk market and are therefore likely to influence production. Brands targeted in fashion campaigns in the Global North are usually larger companies ranging from affordable (H&amp;M, Gap) and mid-range (Calvin Klein, Zara) to luxury brands (Gucci, Prada).&nbsp;</p><p>There is data available on the largest exporters of raw silk (China, India), and on the largest importers (Japan, Italy, France, United States, Germany) (Global Commodities, n.d.). However, it seems more difficult to find what share of processed silk products are sold in which countries and through which brands. We checked the top ten European largest fast fashion brands (by revenue) and found that besides sportswear-focused brands and Primark, the famously low-tier brand, only ASOS did not sell silk (public commitment made in 2019) (Statista, 2020). Among the fast fashion names involved in silk were H&amp;M, M&amp;S, Zara, Next, and Debenhams (Statista, 2020). It is not clear how much of their product range includes silk, or how much of the silk market is taken up by these brands. However, we can easily conclude that fast fashion brands do provide affordable silk products and that targeting them would cover at least one part of the silk product market.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at the global leaders among luxury brands, silk products are sold by all top ten (LV, Dior, Gucci, Chanel, Rolex, Versace, Michael Kors, and others) (Thomas, 2023). Looking at the revenue brought in by fast-fashion vs. luxury brands, it appears they are around the same order of magnitude, with Zara bringing in over \u20ac23 billion in 2022 (Statista, 2023) and Louis Vuitton $18 billion in the same year (Thomas, 2023). We can assume that luxury brands sell significantly fewer products as their prices are much higher. This could mean that fast fashion brands sell a larger proportion of silk on the market, or at least cover a non-negligible share. If that is true, targeting them for corporate campaigns would mean targeting a significant share of the market and therefore any bans on sale would be more likely to impact (decrease) the production. However, silk products probably make up a larger share of total revenue for luxury brands. In general, there is still a lot of uncertainty about how much silk is actually sold by which brands and in which countries.</p><p>There is data available on the impact of fur sale bans on the production. A report from Open Philanthropy titled \u2018What can we learn from the fur-free fight?\u2019 came to the conclusion that banning sales is much more effective compared to banning production:</p><blockquote><p><i>\"Ban sales, not production. European fur production bans have done little to suppress supply or demand. But after the EU banned the sale of seal fur in 2009, the number of Canadian seals killed annually fell threefold, to fewer than 100K. Since the WTO upheld that sales ban, the EU could likely legally ban the sale of other cruelly produced goods. Advocates should push it do so, starting with eggs, meats, and furs that don\u2019t meet the EU\u2019s existing animal welfare standards\"&nbsp;</i>(EA Forum Archives, 2019).</p></blockquote><p>Other examples (McFetridge, 2022; The Humane League, n.d.), this time from cage-free hens, show that corporate campaigns and the resulting commitments increased the share of cage-free hens in egg production. These interventions have clearly led to a decreased production or a wider change in welfare standards. While this does not automatically mean that any campaign can achieve this, there are clear precedents that it is possible.</p><p>A study done by Norwood and Lusk calculates how exactly the decrease by one unit of consumption translates into production (Norwood &amp; Lusk, 2011). They found that not consuming one lbs of an animal product (various meats, eggs, milk) led to a 0.56-0.9lbs decrease in production. This further helps to show that reducing consumption can have a significant impact on production.</p><p>Overall, reductions in consumption seem to have a clear effect on production volumes. Based on the evidence collected here, especially the quantitative estimate given by Norwood and Lusk, our best guess is that production is reduced by 50-90% of the consumption volumes that are reduced by the targeted retailers.</p><h3><strong>3.2.3 Higher animal welfare with lower production</strong></h3><p>The question whether lower silk production then leads to less animal suffering hinges on the assumption that farmed silkworms lead net negative lives. There is a lack of empirical data that would allow us to assess the capacity of silkworms to suffer with great confidence. However, several attempts have been made to try to gather the available data and estimate the sentience of silkworms.</p><p>Rethink Priorities\u2019 Welfare Range Estimate assessed several different species and their range of experiences, compared to humans. Silkworms were estimated to have 0.2% of the welfare range of a human (5th percentile 0, 95th percentile 0.073), when adjusted for their probability of sentience (Fischer, 2023).</p><p>Rethink Priorities\u2019 report on silkworms concludes that the main source of suffering (if silkworms are sentient) is not caused by the death by boiling, but rather by the prevalent diseases, which can also cause 10%-47% mortality (Rowe, 2021). It seems like a lot of treatment with disinfectants and possibly antibiotics is already utilised, but there might be possibilities for improvement. It is likely that the intensity of disinfection is already high as farmers want to avoid costly losses (Tayal &amp; Chauhan, 2017). We should consider that lives of silkworms that do not suffer from diseases might be net positive though:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIt\u2019s also worth noting that silkworms who survive to slaughter could live otherwise positive lives. While there isn\u2019t much research into silkworm quality of life, they mostly seem to live on beds of mulberry leaves eating prior to slaughter, with minimal disturbance that might lead to stress. However, a caveat is that research into nonlethal disease and injury on silk farms is basically nonexistent, since it is typically unrelated to commercial success\u201d</i> (Rowe, 2021).</p></blockquote><p>Still, averaged across all farmed silkworms (those that do and do not suffer from diseases), we expect their experiences to be net negative (if sentient). In order to compare the cost effectiveness among different interventions, we conducted a welfare point estimate (available&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18v1dh5E9HzNHvid_q8BpRLG6ZK5TpK2h-2y3iPAdwgQ/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>here</u></a> for interested readers). We followed the report template used by Charity Entrepreneurship (CE) and estimated different characteristics of farmed silkworms to get to a welfare score on a scale from -100 (worst welfare possible) to +100 (best welfare possible). The welfare points of silkworms were estimated to be -19/100, meaning their experiences were overall slightly negative. However, many assumptions are included in the estimate and a lot of evidence is missing that could significantly impact the estimate. We are 70-80% confident that silkworms have net-negative lives on average.</p><p>If the production of silk went down, the worms would be unlikely to procreate successfully and survive on their own long term (Rowe, 2021). Therefore we do not have to consider whether the moths would be better or worse off in the wild, as that is very unlikely to happen. In this case we are then considering only two scenarios - one is replacing the silk production with a different farming style (Ahimsa silk, addressed in&nbsp;<u>section 3.2.1</u>), and the other is production of silk decreasing. If we take on the assumption that silkworm lives are net negative (based on our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18v1dh5E9HzNHvid_q8BpRLG6ZK5TpK2h-2y3iPAdwgQ/edit?usp=drive_link\"><u>welfare point estimate</u></a>), then lowering production should lead to less animal suffering, the ultimate goal of the intervention.</p><p>Depending on different moral philosophies, reducing the numbers of farmed animals can be seen as a positive improvement even if the lives of silkworms were on average net positive. Some views place more value on avoiding suffering (more important to prevent 10% of diseased silkworks from suffering than to keep 90% of net positive silkworm lives), and many people in the animal rights movement hold the opinion that any animal use is exploitative and inherently wrong.</p><p>In sum, reducing the number of silkworms in farming seems more likely to be a net positive than negative for animals, since farmed silkworm lives should be negative on average. However, this is conditional on the assumption&nbsp; that these animals are sentient. There is a significant chance that silkworms are not sentient, such that our intervention would not have any effect on their welfare. We cannot resolve this uncertainty here, but account for it in our cost-effectiveness estimate for this intervention.</p><h2>3.3 Summary of the evidence</h2><p>This evidence review has clarified many uncertainties that emerged from our ToC and its assumptions. We list our main findings below:</p><ul><li>It seems unlikely that people can be convinced to care enough about insect welfare in order to drive strong public pressure against retailers. However, there might be potential in including concerns around human rights and other issues related to silk production in the campaign. Also, the majority of commitments in other areas have been won by direct collaboration with companies and without the need for a public campaign. This means that commitments might still be won, even without widespread public support.</li><li>Our research suggests that current alternatives to silk are not adequate for retailers to shift towards them directly. Retailers would have to be asked to drop silk products from their offering without replacing them by products of similar quality.</li><li>The likelihood of success for corporate campaigns against retailers of silk products still seems relatively high. Corporate campaigns have a strong record of success in other areas and we do have some indications that they might also work in the case of silk. However, important negative factors are a potential lack of public support and alternative materials, as described above. Aggregating these different perspectives, we think that corporate campaigns against retailers of silk can have a success rate between 10% and 60%.</li><li>Enforcement rates of commitments should also be relatively high. Follow-through from previous corporate campaigns seem relatively strong and we do not have good reasons to believe that they would be lower in the case of silk. Our best estimate is thus for enforcement rates to be between 30% and 60%. The charity would have to do the necessary follow-up work though to make sure that this holds true.</li><li>There is a lot of uncertainty around the sentience and potential experiences of silkworms. We think that there is a non-negligible likelihood of silkworms being sentient. Based on the available evidence, we also think that the lives of farmed silkworms are net negative on average, mostly because of the strong prevalence of diseases.</li><li>We have good evidence from previous campaigns (cage-free eggs and fur), that corporate commitments have a significant impact on production. We estimate that for each unit not consumed, production falls by 50% to 90%.</li><li>It is unclear whether broad-market or high-end retailers would be a better choice as targets for our campaigns. We lean towards targeting the former, as those companies should be more willing to move away from silk and sales volumes might be comparable. The implementing charity would have to speak to industry experts to understand better who the biggest users/buyers of silk are.</li><li>Ahimsa silk is an alternative that has been branded as being more sustainable. However, the evidence suggests that this kind of silk is not in fact better in terms of animal welfare. The campaigns would need to ensure that the issues with Ahimsa silk are clearly described and that retailers understand that we will not accept this as an alternative.</li></ul><p>While these findings seem highly relevant and have clarified many of the uncertainties from our ToC, we acknowledge limitations:</p><ul><li>Our evidence review was relatively shallow, as we only spent ~50 hours on it in total.</li><li>Most of the evidence comes from successful cases like cage-free and fur campaigns, which might lead to our perspective being positively biassed. While we tried to account for differences between those cases and silk, it is possible that we have missed some crucial considerations.</li></ul><p>The biggest remaining uncertainties revolve around the following issues:</p><ul><li>The sentience and experiences of silkworms<br>-&gt; This is something that we cannot fully resolve in this report</li><li>The most promising retailers to target with campaigns<br>-&gt; Market research and insights from industry expert should help here</li><li>The most promising countries to target with campaigns<br>-&gt; Our geographic assessment in&nbsp;<u>section 5</u> will tackle this issue</li></ul><p>In the next sections, we will add further perspectives that should complement the picture that has emerged from this evidence review.</p><h1>4 &nbsp;Expert views</h1><p>Following our evidence review, we identified a variety of areas where it seemed promising to receive inputs from experts to deepen our understanding. The most important topic for us was to better understand the lessons learned from corporate campaigns in related areas (e.g. cage-free eggs, fur, angora wool) and how these might translate to silk. Another relevant issue to understand better was the availability of good alternatives to animal-based silk products. These topics are covered by the four expert interviews outlined in the following subsections. Two of these interviews (<u>Nicole Rawling</u> and&nbsp;<u>PJ Smith</u>) were conducted by CE previously and we could use these for our purposes. The other two (<u>Jonas Becker</u> and a&nbsp;<u>fashion campaign expert</u>) were conducted specifically for this report. We also considered including expert views from Rethink Priorities on silkworm sentience and welfare (e.g. Abraham Rowe). However, since our background and evidence sections already cited their work in depth, we decided against rehashing this content here.</p><h2>4.1&nbsp; Nicole Rawling, Material Innovation Initiative</h2><p>Nicole Rawling from Material Innovation Initiative was previously interviewed by CE and we were provided with the recording and notes from that call. The interview focused both on the availability and development of suitable silk alternatives, and more generally on the potential for companies to move away from silk products.</p><p>Nicole acknowledged that the fashion industry currently lacks suitable alternatives to silk due to performance and aesthetic standards. She also opined that the main motivation for brands wanting to switch from silk is its significant environmental impact. Some options like polyester and rayon have gained popularity but come with environmental issues during production and disposal. For instance, polyester is often not viewed favourably due to petrochemical origins and the growing anti-plastic and anti-synthetic sentiment within the fashion industry. Nicole brought attention to synthetics' largely unrecognised impact on animals, particularly microplastics - suggesting that replacing silk with synthetics could potentially be net-negative for animals, although this is very uncertain.</p><p>This highlights the need for better alternatives that balance environmental and animal welfare concerns. MII is actively working to fill this gap by supporting the development of new animal-free and more sustainable silk materials. Drawing from her extensive experience in the for-profit sector, Nicole stressed the importance of possessing industry knowledge when attempting to bring about change in the fashion industry. She further pointed out the significant financial challenges faced by companies attempting to produce ethical alternatives to silk, including high R&amp;D costs, challenging fundraising environments, and the cost of setting up new production facilities. As a result, it is difficult to say when the creation of a viable alternative to silk would happen.</p><p>Consumer demand for cruelty-free and sustainable silk could drive investment and innovation in alternative materials. However, Nicole also highlighted that consumer awareness about these issues is uncertain, suggesting a need for better education and awareness-raising campaigns. She suggested that promoting awareness of these harms could be a viable approach for a charity. Previous campaigns against the fashion industry, like PETA's, have focused on animal cruelty. Nicole sees potential in expanding these campaigns to highlight environmental and labour rights issues. However, the effectiveness of such strategies remains uncertain, particularly in the context of fast fashion brands, which remain profitable despite widespread knowledge of their use of slave labour or poor working conditions. Nicole also touched upon the cultural challenges in convincing people to switch to alternative materials, especially in regions where silk production is deeply ingrained in the culture and viewed as a luxury. She highlighted that lower-end and mid-tier brands have shifted from silk for cost reasons already, but luxury brands have not due to limited consumer concern about insect welfare.</p><p>Finally, Nicole acknowledged the large potential in silk campaigns. She emphasised the potential impact of even a minor reduction in silk demand, stating that even a 1% decrease could save a significant number of silkworms from the estimated 1 trillion killed annually for silk production.</p><h2>4.2&nbsp; &nbsp; Jonas Becker, Albert Schweitzer Foundation</h2><p>Jonas Becker brings nearly five years of practical experience in corporate campaigns to the table, with a specialisation in broiler chicken welfare in Germany in association with the Albert Schweitzer Foundation.</p><p>In discussing the key components that contribute to a campaign's success, Jonas emphasised the importance of consumers having the choice and flexibility to switch brands based on ethical grounds such as animal welfare or sustainability. Another critical element is the gap between consumer expectations and the harsh realities of product manufacturing. This discrepancy can serve as a powerful lever to gain public support. Jonas also noted that the first step in any campaign should be corporate outreach, stating that public pressure campaigns are often secondary but become important if companies are not ready to commit to ethical practices.</p><p>Regarding the potential for a campaign against silk products, Jonas expressed a cautiously optimistic outlook. While acknowledging a general public indifference toward silkworm welfare, he mentioned that public opinion is malleable, pointing out how campaigns have successfully shifted attitudes towards chickens over the past decade. Jonas thinks that the brutal realities of silk production, where silkworms are boiled alive, can serve as a shocking revelation to the uninformed public. This 'shock factor' can be further supplemented by adding layers of human rights and sustainability issues related to silk production. However, even without public pressure, campaigns can often be successful. In his experience with chicken welfare campaigns, Jonas found that most successes came from direct corporate outreach without the need for public pressure.</p><p>When it comes to selecting which companies to target in a campaign, Jonas advised that the first targets should be retailers for which the likelihood of a successful campaign without public pressure is high. Such \u201ceasy wins\u201d could provide crucial momentum for further campaigns. Market leaders, who may control up to 20% of the market, should be among the targets, but should be tackled only when there is a reasonable chance of success, since the outcome of those cases will heavily influence the ultimate influence of silk campaigns. He also leaned towards a focus on companies serving a broader market as opposed to niche luxury brands, explaining that silk will not be as costly for them to give up and that these companies have more to lose from negative publicity. Targeting companies is a sequential process, with the choice of the next target often depending on the success or failure of previous ones.</p><p>On the subject of commitments from retailers, Jonas explained that all campaigns that they have run have at least resulted in a compromise and that campaigns need to be run until this point. This can last from a few weeks to several years, but a good conservative estimate for duration would be around six months. Speaking from his experiences, Jonas suggested that a 50% success rate should be the minimum target to maintain the campaign's credibility. He also clarified that while the final commitments can be global, they are more likely to be concentrated in countries where the campaigns exert the most pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, Jonas expressed concern about the potential negative impact of launching a new silk-focused campaign on ongoing campaigns. He stressed the importance of evaluating the current status of existing campaigns, such as those focused on fur, to determine whether resources can be reallocated to a new issue like silk.</p><h2>4.3&nbsp; &nbsp; PJ Smith, The Humane Society of the United States</h2><p>PJ Smith is the Fashion Policy Director at The Humane Society of the United States. He was previously interviewed by CE and we were provided with the recording and notes from that call.</p><p>PJ underscored the powerful intersection of animal welfare and the broader sustainability movement. By aligning the campaign with environmental sustainability, it might be possible to generate more substantial corporate and consumer buy-in.</p><p>He thinks that education and awareness are significant factors. There's currently a lack of public awareness about the environmental and welfare issues associated with silk production. By educating consumers, it might be possible to change attitudes and increase demand for silk alternatives. However, PJ also warned about the challenges of promoting vegan fashion choices, which might be harder to sell to consumers due to less obvious animal welfare implications compared to vegan dietary choices.</p><p>Reflecting on the role of activism, PJ mentioned that sustained campaigns against companies selling fur had been effective, but long-term campaigns without progress might lead to resistance. He highlighted the importance of starting a dialogue with companies regarding their use of animal-derived materials, starting with less controversial issues before escalating to more significant commitments, as seen in fur-free campaigns.</p><p>A key component of any successful campaign will be the development and promotion of innovative, environmentally friendly alternatives to silk. Companies have shown an openness to explore such alternatives, but they need to be scalable and capable of replicating silk's specific properties. Thus, the development of innovative, scalable alternatives to silk could drive significant change.</p><p>PJ highlighted the role of high-profile fashion brands in promoting change within the industry, as seen when Gucci announced its transition to fur-free products. A similar high-profile declaration might be necessary to stimulate significant reductions in silk use.</p><p>Another key topic was the interplay of corporate behaviour and politics. PJ suggested that success at the corporate level could eventually lead to changes in public policy, as seen with bans on fur sales following successful fur-free corporate policies. The industry also needs to consider the potential impact of policy-driven changes, such as environmental taxes on companies with high ecological footprints, which could influence the use of silk.</p><p>In terms of future direction, PJ shared that the Humane Society plans to continue its policy advocacy work, with a focus on promoting alternatives and public education once fur is off their agenda. Finally, he urged for a stronger focus on fashion in animal welfare campaigns, given the industry's potential to significantly affect animal welfare.</p><p>In sum, the insights from this interview suggest that while there are challenges, a charity focusing on the reduction of silk use might be viable and could potentially have a significant impact on animal welfare and environmental sustainability. A charity focused on silk use reduction could potentially make an impact by employing strategies similar to successful fur-free campaigns, creating and promoting innovative silk alternatives, raising public awareness, and engaging in policy advocacy.</p><h2>4.4 Interview with an expert on corporate campaigns in the fashion industry</h2><p>We also interviewed an expert with decades of experience working on corporate campaigns against fashion brands. Due to their preference, this expert will remain unnamed in this report and their experience summarised briefly. The main takeaways from the interview were used to inform our decisions the same way as the other interviews.</p><p>The expert suggested possible campaign strategies, including focusing on the unnaturalness of the silkworms\u2019 lives, disturbing images of boiled cocoons, using the existing public concern about bees and focusing on the environmental impact of silk.&nbsp;</p><p>When selecting a campaign target, they consider it crucial to keep in mind the following:</p><ul><li>Look at companies with strong environmental commitments and highlight the dissonance between their commitments and practice.</li><li>Look who the target consumers of the brands are (e.g. young people tend to care more).</li><li>Focus on individual brands instead of high street vs luxury. It might be easier for high street brands to reduce silk as it is in fewer of their products, but there are luxury brands like Gucci that appeal to young people and sell vegan-leather handbags.</li><li>There are some old-fashioned companies that do not have any bans and do not seem open to them at all, so it seems best not to waste time on them (e.g. Louis Vuitton).</li><li>Remember that brands often change strategy and managers and can completely change their commitments.</li><li>It might make sense to start with a collaboration (such as a new range of luxury silk alternatives) and if that works continue to push for more.</li><li>Strong commitments from industry leaders bring momentum, reframe the question (other brands suddenly have to answer why they are still using silk), and can lead to a tipping point.</li></ul><h2>4.5&nbsp; &nbsp; Key takeaways from expert interviews</h2><p>Aggregating the insights from our expert interviews, we highlight ten key takeaways below. In parentheses, we indicate which interviews these insights are taken from.</p><ol><li><strong>Lack of suitable alternatives to silk:</strong> There is a current lack of alternatives to silk that meet both aesthetic and performance standards, with existing options like polyester and rayon facing environmental issues (Nicole Rawling).</li><li><strong>Environmental impact as a motivation for change:&nbsp;</strong>The significant environmental impact of silk production is a major motivation for brands considering a switch from silk. This factor is a potential focal point for campaigns (Nicole Rawling, PJ Smith).</li><li><strong>Consumer demand and awareness:</strong> Raising consumer awareness about silk's environmental and ethical issues is important to drive demand for alternatives. Current awareness levels are low, suggesting the need for educational campaigns (Nicole Rawling, PJ Smith).</li><li><strong>Financial and cultural challenges in producing alternatives:</strong> High R&amp;D costs, fundraising challenges, and the cost of setting up new production facilities are significant barriers to creating ethical silk alternatives. Cultural challenges also exist, particularly in regions where silk is ingrained in the culture (Nicole Rawling).</li><li><strong>Campaign strategies and public perception:&nbsp;</strong>Campaigns need to emphasise the harsh realities of silk production and can benefit from adding layers of human rights and sustainability issues. Public perception of silkworm welfare is malleable and can be influenced by campaigns (Jonas Becker).</li><li><strong>Targeting and sequential approach in campaigns:</strong> Campaigns should initially target market leaders and companies serving broader markets. The choice of the next target often depends on the success of previous campaigns (Jonas Becker).</li><li><strong>Importance of corporate outreach and dialogue:&nbsp;</strong>Engaging in dialogue with companies about their use of silk and starting with less controversial issues can be an effective strategy. This approach has been successful in past campaigns (Jonas Becker, PJ Smith).</li><li><strong>Role of high-profile brands and consumer choice:</strong> High-profile fashion brands can play a significant role in promoting change within the industry. Consumer flexibility to switch brands based on ethical grounds is also crucial (PJ Smith, Jonas Becker).</li><li><strong>Potential negative impact on ongoing campaigns:</strong> Launching a new campaign on silk might affect ongoing efforts in other areas, such as fur campaigns. It's important to assess the current status of existing campaigns before reallocating resources (Jonas Becker).</li><li><strong>Future directions and policy advocacy:</strong> Continued focus on promoting alternatives, public education, and policy advocacy can help drive change in silk use and production practices. Success at the corporate level could eventually lead to changes in public policy (PJ Smith).</li></ol><h1>5 &nbsp; &nbsp; Geographic assessment</h1><p>When planning the practical implementation of corporate campaigns against silk use, a charity would have to focus on certain retailers, as described in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.1</u>. Just as importantly however, the charity would also have to focus its campaign on a certain country or group of countries. Even if a targeted retailer is active globally (i.e. in a wide variety of countries), the charity will not be able to challenge it in every one of these countries due to clear practical ba\u0192rriers (lack of resources, cultural and language differences, different regulatory environments, etc.). Instead, it will need to focus on those countries where the intervention is likely to have the biggest impact, which are probably the retailer\u2019s home country or largest and most important strategic markets.</p><p>For retailers that are active in many different markets, it is an open question whether a campaign in one or few select countries could lead the retailer to adjust its policies on silk products across its whole operations, or if it would only affect operations in the campaign countries. Such questions have to be considered carefully when deciding on the exact retailers and countries to focus on. In general, the combination of retailers and countries should be chosen in a way that maximises expected impact.</p><p>It seems most promising to us to focus campaigns on a smaller number of countries, maybe even only one country, and then address multiple retailers operating there. This should allow the charity to make use of economies of scale and run a more efficient campaign. In the next section, we thus conduct a geographic assessment in order to identify highly promising countries. The implementing charity could take these recommendations as a starting point to identify corporate targets in those countries. However, it also could be fruitful to start with identifying retailers that seem like promising targets and then decide in a second step in which countries they should be targeted. In general, it will be important to consider the interplay between retailers and countries when it comes to defining the focus on campaigns.</p><h2>5.1&nbsp; &nbsp; Geographic assessment</h2><p>As specified in our&nbsp;<u>description of the intervention\u2019s scope</u>, our geographic assessment is restricted to countries of the Global North. We follow UNCTAD\u2019s definition of the Global North, which states that \u201cNorth refers to developed economies, South to developing economies\u201d (UNCTAD, 2022). In accordance with this definition, we use the countries that they list as developed in their classification (UNCTAD, n.d.). From this list, we remove minor countries that do not seem relevant for our purposes (e.g. Andorra, Liechtenstein, etc.) to arrive at a final set of 45 countries in scope.</p><p>Our geographic assessment is based on a weighted factor model, combining ten variables that seem relevant for gauging the promisingness of different countries. The full set of variables, their weights, data sources, and the countries\u2019 detailed scoring can all be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jw4ki1ujw3hmqA62kIo2U2_3Mv4FVY4VDEwrOz2fJQE/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>this spreadsheet</u></a>. Interested readers are invited to read this spreadsheet in more detail, as we will only summarise the most important aspects of our assessment here.</p><p>The most important variables for our model were a country\u2019s</p><ul><li>market size for apparel,</li><li>amount of money spent on clothing per household,</li><li>number of farmed animal advocacy organisations per million inhabitants,</li><li>ranking in global silk product consumption, and</li><li>index of global influence/presence.</li></ul><p>The detailed reasoning behind those different variables and their weights can be found in the spreadsheet.</p><p>Our model estimates that the most impactful countries for running corporate campaigns against retailers of silk products are the United States, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. Further potential targets include Italy, France, and Ireland. It is out of the scope for this report to provide a detailed analysis for each of these countries and why their score might or might not be justified. We also did not research which are the most important retailers per country, something that would be crucial to analyse when deciding on the specific campaign targets. Here, we decided to only provide some preliminary thoughts as an input for further investigation.</p><ul><li>Based on its huge market size and strong global influence, the United States would be a natural choice for corporate campaigns. \u201cThe United States is one of the world\u2019s largest importers of silk garments and interior decoration fabrics and accessories\u201c (Global Commodities, n.d.). Consumption of finalised silk products is more important in the U.S. than the import and processing of raw silk.</li><li>Switzerland stands out with macroeconomic conditions and a large demand for luxury products. However, it is a relatively small market and might be too small to be a proper target for campaigns. A campaign in Switzerland might be combined with concurrent campaigns in Germany and France (see below), due to the close proximity in terms of culture, language, and geography.</li><li>Germany and the UK are both large and strong European economies and markets. Campaigns in those countries would affect large quantities of silk products and could also have significant spillover effects to other markets.</li><li>Japan is the only Asian country among our highest-rated countries, benefiting from a strong economy and large market for silk products.</li><li>Italy and France are both major European markets for silk, just as Germany and the UK. However, these two countries play a stronger role as processors of raw silk and less so as markets for sales to end consumers. For instance, Italy dominates raw silk imports to Europe because of its fashion industry (Blanchard, 2009; Global Commodities, n.d.). Since we care about end-consumer retailers though, this should not be the most important factor in our country selection and industries with a strong commercial interest in silk products might in fact hinder our chance of success.</li><li>Ireland is a smaller market and should probably be of lower priority than the countries named above. However, it could be a target for campaigns that jointly focus on the United Kingdom and Ireland.</li></ul><h2>5.2&nbsp; &nbsp; Where existing organisations work</h2><p>To our knowledge there are no existing campaigns against silk retailers in countries of the Global North (and South). PETA and some other organisations have some content on silk production, but it does not seem like they are actively running campaigns on the topic (PETA, n.d.-c).</p><p>We still think that there are organisations that could be interested to take on this topic and run campaigns against silk in the future. To identify which countries such organisations work in, we have used the members of the Fur Free Alliance (2023) as a proxy. We see that Bulgaria, Germany, Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and the United States are the countries with the most organisations in the Fur Free Alliance. The full list of countries and number of organisations can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jw4ki1ujw3hmqA62kIo2U2_3Mv4FVY4VDEwrOz2fJQE/edit#gid=984053046\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><h1>6 &nbsp; Cost-effectiveness analysis</h1><p>Our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mi-o54ijtj9JJOC0cBM-RgwPvek2WLjuwLSCt5lJpwY/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>cost-effectiveness estimate</u></a> shows a model of a charity running two corporate campaigns per year (an assumption we took based on&nbsp;<u>the expert interview with Jonas Becker</u>), for ten years in total, targeting retailers who sell silk products in countries in the Global North. The estimate includes a projection for the silk production for the next ten years (until 2034), which is assumed to correlate with the number of farmed silkworms. The benefit is expressed as the improvement in welfare points, achieved through a reduction in silk production. The numbers of farmed silkworms are based on a report by Rethink Priorities (Rowe, 2021). The impacts of the intervention itself are modelled from 2025, because of the expected delay between campaigning, commitments, and change in practice.</p><p>The lower bound value for cost effectiveness of our intervention is 0.1 WP/$, the upper bound value is 1,311 WPs/$. The geometric mean cost effectiveness is 12 WPs/$.</p><h2>6.1&nbsp; &nbsp; Effects</h2><p>There is one primary effect of the intervention that we explored in our CEA, namely the reduction in the amount of farmed silkworms. As our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18v1dh5E9HzNHvid_q8BpRLG6ZK5TpK2h-2y3iPAdwgQ/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>welfare point estimate</u></a> for silkworms shows, the expected welfare of farmed silkworms is negative, mostly due to the prevalence of diseases. With a decrease of silkworm farming, we expect improvements in welfare points. This was discussed in more detail in&nbsp;<u>section 3.2.3</u>. The effects are modelled over ten years from starting the intervention, which is the usual time period used in these assessments. This is probably on the pessimistic side, since it excludes a lot of the impact of the campaigns that start in the later years of running the charity and does not consider long-term effects.</p><p>To estimate the scale of the effects, we assume we can reach 0.1-1% of the global silk market when running one campaign. The estimate for how much of the global silk consumption we can influence is based on our understanding of the fashion industry. There are major retailers who have a large share of the market (~10%) in some countries and countries who are major consumers of silk should have a similarly large share of the global market. Assuming that the intervention will select for the most promising retailers and countries, we think we can reach around 1% of the global market in the best case scenario. There is also the potential that we can get the retailers to implement their commitments in multiple countries, not only the main targeted one(s), which adds to the potential share. In that sense, the upper bound should be realistic. The lower bound of 0.1% accounts for the fact that we might not be able to find such optimal scenarios (see uncertainties described in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.1</u>) and that such big targets might be rare and we might run out of them over time.</p><p>We then multiply this share per retailer by two (assuming two campaigns per year, as described above) and discount the market share targeted based on the following factors:</p><ul><li>The likelihood of success (10-60%, discussed in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.3</u>)</li><li>The follow-through rates after commitment (30-60%, discussed in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.4</u>)</li><li>The translation rate between decrease in consumption to decrease in production (50-90%, discussed in&nbsp;<u>section 3.2.2</u>)</li><li>An annual discount of our impact (1-10%, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mi-o54ijtj9JJOC0cBM-RgwPvek2WLjuwLSCt5lJpwY/edit?usp=drive_link\"><u>the spreadsheet</u></a> for our reasoning)</li></ul><p>Aggregating all of these factors, we estimate the share of the global silk production we expect our campaigns to reduce in a certain year. Welfare point estimates are then used as described in&nbsp;<u>section 3.2.3</u>. The welfare points are discounted using Rethink Priorities\u2019 welfare range estimate, which includes the likelihood of sentience in silkworms. The total amount of discounted welfare points (WPs) this intervention could bring is between 1.4 million and 2.8 billion in total between 2025 and 2034.</p><p>There is a possibility that the campaign could have other benefits that we did not include in our estimate. We think that running the first successful corporate campaign for insects could be a meaningful step encouraging further interventions in the space. It can also contribute towards more concerns among the public around insect welfare and possibly moral circle expansion. If this intervention proves feasible, it can be expanded to more retailers and more countries.</p><h2>6.2&nbsp; &nbsp; Costs</h2><p>The total costs include a fixed cost to set up and run a charity for one year and the campaign costs itself. Our cost estimates are informed by previous interventions. The costs of the campaign are based on data from The Humane League, who have published their campaign budget over the last decade and include the number of staff working on the campaigns and the commitments won. Based on this, we assume a lower-bound cost of $100,000 and an upper-bound cost of $700,000 for one campaign.&nbsp; Extrapolating these costs to 20 campaigns (two per year for ten years, as described above) and adding fixed start-up costs of $100,000, we arrive at a total cost estimate between $2.1 and $14.1 million.</p><p>One further consideration that might be worth exploring is if subsequent campaigns might have lower costs that the initial ones, since the strategy, messaging and background research might be reused.</p><h1>7 &nbsp; &nbsp; Decision</h1><p>In order to summarise the extensive research conducted for our report in a reader-friendly format, we decided to provide a table with a short Q&amp;A, addressing the most relevant issues that emerged from our research and how we think about them.</p><p><i>Table 5: Summary of important questions and answers</i></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;width:200px\"><strong>Question</strong></th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Answer</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">What is the life of farmed silkworms like and would lower production volumes be a net positive?</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">There is a lot of uncertainty around the sentience and potential experiences of silkworms. Based on the available evidence, we tentatively think that the lives of farmed silkworms are net negative on average, mostly because of the strong prevalence of diseases. Our CEA discounts for uncertainties around silkworms\u2019 welfare ranges, including their probability of sentience.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Does the public care enough for insect welfare?</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">It seems unlikely that people currently care enough about insect welfare in order to drive strong public pressure against retailers. However, public perception has been successfully targeted and shifted by previous campaigns and some of the experts we interviewed seemed cautiously optimistic about this. The image of silkworms being boiled alive could be leveraged for the campaign. There also seems to be strong potential for including concerns around human rights and environmental issues related to silk production in the campaign.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Is public pressure strictly necessary to win commitments?</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Pressure campaigns are an important tactic of corporate campaigns overall. However, the majority of commitments in other areas have been won by direct collaboration with companies and without the need for a public campaign. This means that commitments might still be won, even without widespread public support.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Are alternative materials readily available?</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Our research suggests that current alternatives to silk are not adequate for retailers to shift towards them directly. Retailers would have to be asked to drop silk products from their offering without replacing them by products of similar quality. There are ongoing efforts to develop better alternatives though.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">What is the likelihood of winning commitments from targeted retailers?</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Corporate campaigns have a strong record of success in other areas and we do find some indications that they might also work in the case of silk. However, important negative factors are a potential lack of public support and alternative materials, as described above. Aggregating these different perspectives, we think that corporate campaigns against retailers of silk can have a success rate between 10% and 60%.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">How likely are retailers to stick to their commitments?</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Enforcement rates from previous corporate campaigns seem relatively strong and we do not have good reasons to believe that they would be lower in the case of silk. Our best estimate is thus for enforcement rates to be between 30% and 60%. The charity would have to do the necessary follow-up work though to make sure that this holds true.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">How would changes in demand by retailers influence production?</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">We have good evidence from previous campaigns (cage-free chickens and fur), that corporate commitments have a significant impact on production. We estimate that for each unit not consumed, production falls by 50% to 90%.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Which retailers should the campaigns focus on?</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">It is unclear whether broad-market or high-end retailers would be a better choice. We lean towards targeting the former, as those companies should be more willing to move away from silk and sales volumes might be comparable. The implementing charity would have to speak to industry experts to understand better who the biggest users/buyers of silk are.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Which countries are most promising for the campaigns?</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">The most promising countries seem to be the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. France and Italy also could be valid targets. Switzerland and Ireland are countries that could be targeted as part of campaigns in their neighbouring culturally-similar countries.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">What is the estimated cost effectiveness of such an intervention?</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Our cost-effectiveness analysis yields a broad range of outcomes, between 0.1 and 1,311 WP/$. The geometric mean cost effectiveness is 12 WP/$. These estimates are likely to err on the conservative side.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Are there any more \u201csustainable\u201d silk production methods that retailers might want to focus on instead of a ban?</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Ahimsa silk is an alternative that has been branded as being more sustainable. However, the evidence suggests that this kind of silk is not in fact better in terms of animal welfare. The campaigns would need to ensure that the issues with Ahimsa silk are clearly described and that retailers understand that we will not accept this as an alternative.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">How promising do corporate campaigns against silk retailers seem compared to other interventions to help insects?</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">We did not look at other insect interventions in enough detail to be able to compare them. This might be an avenue for further research. Rowe (2021) thinks that \u201cwhile there are promising interventions to reduce the suffering of silkworms, marginal resources in the insect space might be better spent in other areas, such as reducing the painfulness of pesticides, reducing the number of insects farmed for animal feed, and reducing the harms of cochineal farming. That being said, given the scale of silk farming, advocacy on this issue could plausibly be highly cost-effective when compared on a species-neutral basis to interventions to reduce vertebrate farmed animal suffering.\u201d</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Based on these considerations, we think that this intervention idea has enough promise to be considered further for implementation. However, in order to fully recommend this idea, we would need better information about the silk market shares of different retailers that could be targeted by the campaigns. For obtaining this information, we suggest further collaboration with experienced players like PETA, outreach to industry experts and stakeholders, and/or commissioning market research.</p><p>Conditional on the findings of such further research showing that there are highly promising retailers to target, it seems valuable for a charity to run a pilot intervention on this. The campaigns have quick and strong feedback loops (see&nbsp;<u>section 8.2.3</u>) and there should be strong learning value in running a first corporate campaign on an insect farming issue. The intervention could be shut down again fairly quickly, if the pilot does not prove to be promising.</p><p>In the following two sections, we explain what such an intervention could look like in practice and which crucial aspects need to be considered. We also make a recommendation on whether the intervention should be taken on by an existing organisation or whether a new charity should be started specifically for this topic.</p><h1>8 &nbsp; &nbsp; Implementation of a new idea</h1><p>In this section, we provide some more practical information that would be relevant for the implementation of this intervention idea.</p><h2>8.1&nbsp; &nbsp; What does working on this idea look like?</h2><p>The way in which corporate campaigns are typically implemented has been described in&nbsp;<u>section 2.1</u>. The causal chain outlined in&nbsp;<u>section 2.2</u> should also give a good overview of the steps involved. More details on corporate campaigns and how and why they work are given by Founders Pledge (2018) and Bollard (2017). The New York Times also provides a detailed account of PETA\u2019s work with corporations in the fashion industry (Testa, 2020). Interested readers are encouraged to consult these resources to understand what implementing this intervention would look like in practice.</p><h2>8.2&nbsp; &nbsp; Key factors&nbsp;</h2><p>When implementing corporate campaigns against retailers in practice, we need to consider some crucial factors that might hinder our work. This section summarises our concerns (or lack thereof) about different aspects of a new charity putting this idea into practice. They only provide first indications and thoughts and should not be seen as in-depth research or advice.</p><p><i>Table 6: Implementation concerns</i></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"background-color:#ffffff;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;width:300px\"><p>Factor</p></th><th style=\"background-color:#ffffff;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;width:300px\"><p>How concerning is this?</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Talent&nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Low Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Access to information</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#fff2cc;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Moderate Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Access to relevant stakeholders</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#fff2cc;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Moderate Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Feedback loops</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Low Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Funding</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#fff2cc;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Moderate Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Scale of the problem</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Low Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Neglectedness</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Low Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Execution difficulty/tractability</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#fff2cc;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Moderate Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Positive externalities</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Low Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Negative externalities</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#f4cccc;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>High Concern</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3><strong>8.2.1 Talent</strong></h3><p>The main roles required for this intervention if a new charity gets started would be:</p><ul><li>Founder(s)/director(s) to run the charity</li><li>Campaign manager to plan and manage the campaigns</li><li>1-3 employees to run the campaigns</li><li>External contributor, such as consultants on different topics</li></ul><p>The roles do not need any rare skills and there is quite a large group of organisations working on similar organisations who train and hire people with such skills. A lot of the training can be done on the job.</p><p>Specific skills that might depend on the geographical location are language skills. For this, either a translator can be hired or the employees working on the campaign can be hired directly in the targeted countries. Local animal welfare organisations can be contacted for advice and collaboration.</p><h3><strong>8.2.2 Access</strong></h3><p><strong>8.2.2.1 Information</strong></p><p>There are some areas where the access to information appears to be limited. Specifically, finding data on the amount of silk products sold by country and retailer seems difficult (see&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.1</u>), which impedes our ability to find the most relevant targets for campaigns. This can reduce the overall impact of campaigns and it might be hard to more accurately quantify the amount of silk products and therefore silkworms impacted by this intervention. Our experts explained ways in which this information gap could be circumvented though.</p><p><strong>8.2.2.2 Relevant stakeholders</strong></p><p>One type of stakeholders are mission-aligned people and organisations that we could collaborate with or learn from. This includes organisations with experience in the fashion industry like PETA and Four Paws or with experience in corporate campaigning in other areas like those associated with the Open Wing Alliance. Access to these stakeholders should be easy, as we are working together on the same mission and knowledge-sharing is generally an important norm in the animal advocacy movement.</p><p>The public is another stakeholder we need to consider. They should be easily targeted by public campaigns, since advertising and marketing resources can simply be bought and other organisations have successfully targeted the public with their campaigns.</p><p>The hardest stakeholders to reach are probably those that are the target of our campaigns, the retailers of silk products.&nbsp;<u>An expert on fashion campaigns</u> described significant difficulties in getting some companies to cooperate.&nbsp;<u>Jonas Becker</u> seemed somewhat more optimistic. The fact that previous corporate campaigns have overall been quite successful makes us somewhat optimistic about this, but this needs to be considered carefully.</p><p>Another group of stakeholders to consider might be producers of raw silk or silk products. As described in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.1</u>, we might want to contact such producers in order to learn more about the largest consumers of silk products and thereby identify the most promising targets for our campaigns. How willing and able such producers would be to talk about their customers and the destinations of their products is unclear and there might be significant barriers (e.g. non-disclosure agreements or business secrets).</p><h3><strong>8.2.3 Feedback loops</strong></h3><p>Corporate outreach and communication can be easily measured by the direct response and engagement (or lack thereof) of the targeted retailers. We can track their attitudes and the kind of commitments they are willing to make. Tracking follow-through rates on their commitments is significantly easier for the ban of silk products than for other campaigns that focus on welfare requirements (like cage-free eggs), as it can more easily be verified whether retailers are offering a certain product compared to checking the conditions in their supply chain. On the big picture level, we can also monitor the industry through revenue numbers and any commitments or sales restrictions imposed by retailers that were not the targets of our campaigns.</p><p>Trying to measure the impact of public awareness about the welfare issues around silk is more difficult, but also doable. We can measure the reach of different media and any signs of public pressure increase on the retailers.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>8.2.4 Funding</strong></h3><p>The funding for insect welfare is generally very limited. We have identified that Open Philanthropy has given out multiple grants to insect research and welfare, with $980,000 to insect sentience research in 2023 (Open Philanthropy, 2023a), $470,000 to Rethink Priorities for insect welfare research in 2021-22 (Open Philanthropy, 2022b), and further $270,000 for insect welfare field building in 2023 (Open Philanthropy, 2023b). The Wild Animal Initiative (WAI) has funded two insect initiatives with $63,000 and $58,000 respectively (Kerr, 2023). WAI is also funded by Open Philanthropy. Rethink Priorities launched two new initiatives in 2023, the Insect Welfare Research Society and the Insect Institute, both funded by Open Philanthropy grants (Insect Welfare Research Society, 2023; The Insect Institute, n.d.).</p><p>In the EA space, most if not all insect welfare and research funding thus comes from Open Philanthropy. Outside of this space, there are other broader funding streams. For example, PETA is the biggest campaigner against animal materials in fashion, and their funding comes mostly from individual donations. PETA gives out grants, but from the information available on their website, it appears that they mostly work on interventions and campaigns in house and only write out the occasional targeted grant, for example for specific research proposals.&nbsp;</p><p>Open Philanthropy is also a major funder of corporate campaigns for farmed animals, with over $12 million given to Mercy for Animals over several years (Open Philanthropy, 2022b), $820,000 given to Equalia (Open Philanthropy, 2022c), $2.8 million to Animal Equality and with many more examples available on the Open Philanthropy website (Open Philanthropy, 2022d).&nbsp;</p><p>In sum, most of our research directed us to Open Philanthropy, but there might be other funding sources that we are not aware of. Given the size of grants given out by Open Philanthropy to insect welfare causes and to corporate campaigns aimed at other animals, it seems like a corporate campaign against silk fits within their scope.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on our cost-effectiveness analysis, we expect the annual costs to be between $200,000 and $1.4 million. The total funding requirements in our estimate are quite large due to the expectations of multiple campaigns in the projected ten-year span. However, based on other examples of Open Philanthropy\u2019s funding, the scope of the interventions and the costs would be comparable with other grants given out to similar interventions. It might also make sense to start around the lower bound (less staff, one campaign initially) and increase the scope later.</p><p>Given the limited funding streams, there is a reasonable concern about obtaining funding, as it appears that without Open Philanthropy on board, this initiative might be difficult to fund. Gauging their interest in funding this intervention could be an important step when moving this idea forward.</p><h3><strong>8.2.5 Scale of the problem</strong></h3><p>The proposed intervention would only be able to target a small proportion of the whole silk market. As we are focusing on high-income Global North countries, the part of the problem the intervention can target is limited by excluding silk markets in other regions. The data to assess how much of the silk product market is covered by a specific retailer in a specific country is hard to access and more research into this would be beneficial for a more accurate CEA.&nbsp;</p><p>The total scale of the problem is significant though and is projected to grow, with 420 billion to 1 trillion silkworms currently farmed per year, projected to grow to 750 billion to 1.8 trillion annually by 2034. Even accounting for the uncertainties around silkworms\u2019 sentience and experiences (see&nbsp;<u>section 3.2.3</u>), the scale of the problem is large.</p><p>There is plenty of space to work on this issue, especially with no existing interventions targeting silk, and starting now can prevent more growth of the industry.</p><h3><strong>8.2.6 Neglectedness</strong></h3><p>As described in&nbsp;<u>section 5.2</u>, we are not aware of any organisations conducting corporate campaigns against silk. Insect welfare is generally a very neglected issue, as described in&nbsp;<u>section 1.1.1</u>. In total, silkworm welfare is thus a very neglected issue.</p><h3><strong>8.2.7 Tractability</strong></h3><p>Crucial considerations around tractability and likelihood of success are discussed in section&nbsp;<u>3.1.3</u> (and also to some extent in sections&nbsp;<u>3.1.2</u> and&nbsp;<u>3.1.4</u>). We show that this idea seems tractable, but also highlight some concerns.</p><p>To summarise, we find that similar interventions in the fashion industry and other areas have been run with success and there seems to be a general public understanding that \u2018there is something wrong with silk production\u2019. Many retailers have transitioned away from other animal materials and some even from silk. There are other arguments in favour of stopping silk sales that can be used in the campaigns, such as the environmental footprint and forced labour. However, there are valid concerns around the lack of public concern for the welfare of insects and the lack of good alternatives to silk as a material.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>8.2.8 Externalities</strong></h3><p><strong>8.2.8.1 Positive externalities</strong></p><p>In the fashion industry, often convincing one large retailer leads to a shift in the industry and in the mindset. Especially based on the information by&nbsp;<u>an expert</u> on fashion campaigns, the targeted brands are often selected by their influence on other brands and not necessarily by the amount of the animal material products sold. There could be a positive \u2018cascading effect\u2019 impacting the whole industry in multiple countries.</p><p>Another positive externality can be to have a first successful corporate campaign directed towards insect welfare. This can encourage campaigns aimed at insects farmed for food and animal feed and be the catalyst for more interventions.</p><p>In addition, reducing silk consumption and thereby production can mitigate the negative environmental and human rights issues associated with silk production.</p><p><strong>8.2.8.2 Negative externalities</strong></p><p>A major potential negative externality lies in the uncertainty around silkworm sentience. If silkworms are not sentient, any resources dedicated towards the issue are wasted and would be better employed elsewhere.</p><p>Relatedly, there is some uncertainty around whether the lives of farmed silkworms are net negative on average. While we do think that this assumption is true (as described in&nbsp;<u>section 3.2.3</u>), we are far from certain. If farmed silkworms\u2019 experiences are indeed more positive than we assume (either roughly neutral or even net positive), our campaigns could have no or even a negative impact.</p><p>Despite planning to include the issues of \u2018ethical\u2019 silk in our campaigns, retailers could still choose to transition to \u2018ethical\u2019 silk instead of finding other replacements or reducing silk product offering. This could lead to more silkworms farmed, as more worms are needed to produce the same amount of silk.</p><p>In addition, there can be negative consequences for other existing corporate campaigns in related areas. Attention is sparse and by asking retailers to commit to a ban of silk sales, we might lower the chances of success for other campaigns (against wool, leather, etc.).</p><p>Finally, if there is a strong counter campaign, silk could also be more strongly marketed (for example as a sustainable material), leading to a more positive image and increased demand for silk. It seems unlikely though that the counter campaign could be stronger than the anti-silk campaigns.</p><h1>9 &nbsp;Directing funding towards and existing entity&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1><p>Outside of the EA space, PETA stands out as a prominent charity with decades of experience in fashion campaigns. Some of the drawbacks of their campaigns are that they do not appear to focus on quantifying their impact and optimise based on that. The advantages of PETA are its massive public presence, decades of experience, and thorough understanding of the fashion industry. We have not looked into whether PETA are open to working on specific projects, if given funding. However, this is probably not the most promising strategy, as their methodology and values diverge in certain aspects from the EA approach. Similar considerations apply to organisations like Four Paws or any other larger not specifically EA-aligned organisations with experience on fashion topics.</p><p>Out of the existing organisations in the EA space, The Humane League and Mercy For Animals are among the largest and best known campaigners. Their focus lies mostly in farmed vertebrate animals, with most of the commitments focusing on cage-free and broiler campaigns. While they have the campaigning experience and knowledge, both the fashion industry and silkworms as insects seem out of their current scope and strategy. They would probably be open for consultations around this topic, but directing funding from their campaigns and venturing into a different industry and species does not seem easier or better than setting up a new organisation. The same should apply to other EA-aligned organisations working on corporate campaigns, for instance as part of the Open Wing Alliance.</p><p>To summarise, there are no currently existing organisations that seem well suited to include silk campaigns in their scope. Starting a new charity to focus on this intervention should make more sense and it is likely that the existing charities are open to share their expertise, if useful.</p><h1>10 &nbsp; Conclusion and next steps</h1><p>Based on the findings of our research and after a decision-making meeting and discussion with other researchers in the animal welfare space, we slightly lean towards recommending this idea for a newly incubated charity (~3.7 on a scale from 1 (not recommend) to 5 (recommend)). The quite low cost effectiveness estimate and some major remaining uncertainties mean that we cannot confidently recommend this intervention at this point yet.</p><p>Instead, we have identified several promising next steps that could help reduce those uncertainties and lead to a stronger conclusion towards (not) recommending this intervention further. Firstly, we should commission a market study or talk to fashion industry experts to identify the exact silk market share of specific retailers in specific countries. Secondly, we should talk to PETA or other established players in the fashion space to learn more in depth about which specific retailers are more likely to collaborate based on their reactions to previous campaigns. This should give us a clearer idea of the market share we can target and therefore the cost effectiveness of this intervention. Another uncertainty we could address is funding availability. We could contact Open Philanthropy to gauge their interest in potentially funding corporate campaigns against the sale of silk products.</p><p>Conditional on the findings of such further research showing that there are highly promising retailers to target and funding streams available, it seems valuable for a charity to run a pilot intervention on this. The campaigns have quick and strong feedback loops and there should be strong learning value in running a first corporate campaign on an insect farming issue. The intervention could be shut down again fairly quickly, if the pilot does not prove to be promising.</p><h1>References</h1><p>Aishwariya, S.

Maybe I'll update this page at some point, but for now, here's a quick summary of my current views.</p><p>In terms of maximizing expected suffering reduction over the long-run future, my top recommendation is the <a href=\"https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/\">Center for Reducing Suffering</a> (CRS), closely followed by the <a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/\">Center on Long-Term Risk</a> (CLR). (I'm an advisor to both of them.) I think both of these organizations do important work, but CRS is more in need of funding currently.</p><p>CRS and CLR do research and movement building aiming to reduce risks of astronomical suffering in the far future. This kind of work can feel very abstract, and it's difficult to know if your impact is even net good on balance. Personally I prefer to also contribute some of my resources toward efforts that more concretely reduce suffering in the short run, to avoid feeling like I'm possibly wasting my life on excessive speculation. For this reason, I plan to donate my personal wealth over time toward charities that work mainly or exclusively on improving animal welfare. (I prefer welfare improvements over reducing meat consumption because the sign of the latter for wild-animal suffering is unclear.) The <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/why-i-support-the-humane-slaughter-association/\">Humane Slaughter Association</a> is my current favorite. A decent portion of the charities granted to by the <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/animal-welfare\">EA Funds Animal Welfare Fund</a> also do high-impact animal welfare work. I donate a bit to <a href=\"https://www.animal-ethics.org/\">Animal Ethics</a> as well.</p></blockquote><h2>Summary</h2><p>This piece describes my views on a few charities. I explain what I like about each charity and what concerns me about it. Currently, my top charity recommendation for someone with values similar to mine is the <a href=\"http://foundational-research.org/\">Foundational Research Institute</a> (an organization that I co-founded and volunteer for).</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/spreading-google-grants-with-caution-about-counterfactuals/\">Spreading Google Grants with Caution about Counterfactuals</a></h1><p>By Brian Tomasik</p><p>First published: 2014 Feb 04. Last nontrivial update: 2016 Nov 09.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>If you find an effective charity, write to them to ask whether they use Google Grants, and if not, suggest they sign up. Google Grants offers the prospect of immense returns for a small amount of labor, although one needs to be careful about not competing with other effective organizations and choosing keywords that draw in new people rather than preaching to the choir.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Update (2015 Sep)</strong>: Having used Google Grants for the last 1.5 years for several organizations, my conclusion is that the value of AdWords is modest. None of my organizations has found via AdWords a major donor or a promising future employee, even though our websites get high traffic volume from ads. Maybe part of the reason is that the best people don't click on ads much? Another reason is that the best people tend to be concentrated in dense social clusters, so that networking can be more effective.</p></blockquote><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/the-haste-consideration-revisited/\">The Haste Consideration, Revisited</a></h1><p>By Brian Tomasik</p><p>First published: 2013 Feb 03. Last nontrivial update: 2018 Apr 19.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Internal rates of return for charity are high, but they may not be as high as they seem naively. Haste is important, but because long-term growth is logistic rather than exponential, it's less important than has been suggested by some. That said, if artificial general intelligence (AGI) comes soon and exponential growth does not level off too quickly, naive haste may still be roughly appropriate. There are other factors for and against haste that parallel donate-vs.-invest considerations.</p><p><i>Restating the summary in simpler language</i>: Movements should saturate or at least show diminishing returns at some point, so that movement building sooner amounts to either just a few more years of the movement existing or only modest marginal increases in the movement's size. These impacts could still matter\u2014they're just not as extreme as in a naive model in which, if it takes 2 years to create a hard-core altruist, then starting 2 years earlier doubles the long-term number of altruists.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/quantify-with-care/\">Quantify with Care</a></h1><p>By Brian Tomasik</p><p>First published: 2013 Feb 23. Last nontrivial update: 2016 May 20.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Quantification and metric optimization are powerful tools for reducing suffering, but they have to be used carefully. Many studies can be noisy, and results that seem counterintuitive may indeed be wrong because of sensitivity to experiment conditions, human error, measurement problems, or many other reasons. Sometimes you're looking at the wrong metric, and optimizing a metric blindly can be dangerous. Designing a robust set of metrics is actually a nontrivial undertaking that requires understanding the problem space, and sometimes it's more work than necessary. There can be a tendency to overemphasize statistics at the expense of insight and to use big samples when small ones would do. Finally, think twice about complex approaches that sound cool or impressive when you could instead use a dumb, simple solution.</p><h1><a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/charity-cost-effectiveness-in-an-uncertain-world/\">Charity Cost-Effectiveness in an Uncertain World</a></h1><p>29 August 2015 | by <a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/author/brian-tomasik/\">Brian Tomasik</a></p><p>First written: 28 Oct. 2013; last update: 4 Dec. 2015</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Evaluating the effectiveness of our actions, or even just whether they're positive or negative by our values, is very difficult. One approach is to focus on clear, quantifiable metrics and assume that the larger, indirect considerations just kind of work out. Another way to deal with uncertainty is to focus on actions that seem likely to have generally positive effects across many scenarios, and often this approach amounts to meta-level activities like encouraging positive-sum institutions, philosophical inquiry, and effective altruism in general. When we consider flow-through effects of our actions, the seemingly vast gaps in cost-effectiveness among charities are humbled to more modest differences, and we begin to find more worth in the diversity of activities that different people are pursuing. Those who have abnormal values may be more wary of a general \"promote wisdom\" approach to shaping the future, but it seems plausible that all value systems will ultimately benefit in expectation from a more cooperative and reflective future populace.</p><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/why-charities-dont-differ-astronomically-in-cost-effectiveness/\">Why Charities Usually Don't Differ Astronomically in Expected Cost-Effectiveness</a></h1><p>[This post <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jYT6c8ByLfDpYtwE9/why-charities-usually-don-t-differ-astronomically-in\">has</a> been <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8yDsenRQhNF4HEDwu/link-posting-is-an-act-of-community-service\">crossposted</a> to the EA Forum.]</p><p>By Brian Tomasik</p><p>First published: 2014 Jan 05. Last nontrivial update: 2017 Sep 16.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>I think some in the effective-altruism movement overestimate the extent to which charities differ in their expected marginal cost-effectiveness. This piece suggests a few reasons why we shouldn't expect most charities to differ by more than hundreds of times. In fact, I suspect many charities differ by at most ~10 to ~100 times, and within a given field, the multipliers are probably less than a factor of ~5. These multipliers may be positive or negative, i.e., some charities have negative expected net impact. I'm not claiming that charities don't differ significantly, nor that we shouldn't spend substantial resources finding good charities; indeed, I think both of those statements are true. However, I do hope to challenge black/white distinctions about effective/ineffective charities, so that effective altruists will see greater value in what many other people are doing in numerous places throughout society.</p>", "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}, {"_id": "Dytsn9dDuwadFZXwq", "title": "Fundraising for a School in Liberia", "postedAt": "2024-01-29T09:22:01.102Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hello!

It is fair to admit that extinction of the whole Homo sapiens species may happen only within coincidental conjunctions of catastrophes, and events that would lead to a disruption of global affairs universally. Existential risks may thus be single events, as these events alone may cause enormous destruction that could contribute to a cessation of existence of the human race. Other existential risks are deemed to be combinations of various threats to our existence. The onset of these disasters is supposed to be gradual and chronological in order for the damage to be apocalyptic, leaving humanity in a dystopian reality.\nGiven these factors, estimating the probability of such destruction should not be deemed as necessary to counteract, as it is improbable. However, that does not imply that we should not be prepared for a sudden deterioration of current affairs. Progress in this regard does not merely signify rapid developments and new innovation, but also the prevention of large-scale catastrophes and the mitigation of crises that trigger or stress the worst of outcomes.</p>\n<p>Generational wisdom</p>\n<p>Among our major responsibilities as a species, preserving wisdom and knowledge generated throughout our existence is a vital measure to preserve mankind. Most individuals are taught to value such knowledge from an early age, and throughout their life, they are working to improve this knowledge and innovate existing, as well as introduce new ones. Following this system we may find ourselves at the pinnacle of civilisation which we are indefinitely striving to.\nAn unprecedented catastrophe may disrupt this cycle altogether. As a result, our civilisation may not fulfil its purpose in guarding and preserving all milestones of progress made by humanity in the past and deprive future generations of their contributions. It is not only the whole of mankind that is at stake upon emerging civilisational threats, but all the previous generations. At the point of a catastrophe, previous generations may as well not have existed, since all their efforts that lead to global prosperity would be at the point of vanishing completely.</p>\n<p>What is within humanity\u2019s control</p>\n<p>Individuals find themselves at the pinnacle of their potential once placed in a socioeconomic, ethnic, religious, or an another social group. The cohesive entity that humanity is, is represented by cooperation. Hence, it is questionable how we can individually powerful enough in front of an existential risk. In truth, once faced with a lethal natural disaster, humans are helpless and alone, unable to rely on habitual systems. Our globalised society, while resilient, is unable to withstand global catastrophically that produce unbearable catastrophes. As in Thomas Hobbes\u2019 state of nature, we may find ourselves as helpless as in the dawn of civilisation.\nHow is it then possible to alleviate large-scale destructive events?\nNaturally, as much as humans aim to control our environment, some geological processes cannot be monitored and the forthcoming events cannot be accurately determined. However, given the recent development in science during the last century, some discoveries made a man-made life-threatening event ostensibly more likely. Biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons have possess the potential to contribute to the extinction of our species more than floods, volcano eruptions, earthquakes. Furthermore, man-made crises like wars, pandemics( COVID-19?) and genocides, persecution, authoritarian regimes, and hunger. have claimed countless lives throughout our history.\nAs such, given the potential for the disruption of our civilisation to pre-dawn times that these factors carry, global policy makers, as always, should be responsible for mitigating risks, resolving international tensions and conflicts, and fund the healthcare system.\nAs for most of the natural disasters, humanity has mostly encountered relatively small-scale natural disasters that, while lethal, have not claimed as many lives as man-made disasters.\nAs a result, one of the most valued ethical principles of our civilisation is self-preservation in a prevention of conflicts and preserving our environment. As our technological progress is increasing, our capabilities to cause disasters may leave us no option for safety than self-limitation. Wide conflicts and a limitless exploitation of resources in abundant quantities can no longer be afforded merely for the interest single nations. Instead, it is the globalised society that is responsible for the repercussions of unwise decisions. This globalised society is then in charge of preventing everything man-made.</p>\n<p>Effective Altruism and Existential Risks</p>\n<p>Effective Altruism provides useful examples of the potential of existential catastrophes. Toby Ord has compiled a table that contains the probability of catastrophic events that would endanger the existence of multiple species on the planet. Among these, hypothetical scenarios including human activity indicates are more probable, and their potential for destruction is just as great. An armed conflict that includes a global exchange of nuclear missiles might lead to the same outcome as a volcanic eruption leading to cessation of existence for many species. But since the probability of many of the natural disasters is comparatively low, then the conclusion of the higher potential of human-made or human-influenced disasters becomes evident.\nEA provides insight in the potential of disasters and they the ways with which they may be overcome. This leads to a global network of new independently developed ideas. EA consists of multiple other projects and companies that bring further knowledge into the risks associated with human activities. It is the critical assessment of our current situation that gives remarkable insight from different perspectives that is useful within Effective Altruism.</p>\n<p>As such, it is necessary to use facts, information, and data wisely to envision the potential for crises. Effective Altruism as an organisation may have an important role in this endeavour, and look for reasonable solution that could alleviate global concerns.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Danteniel Lawthrone"}}, {"_id": "SnGqab3noXLmJzQCs", "title": "Lower-suffering egg brands available in the SF Bay Area", "postedAt": "2024-01-31T05:45:31.570Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>(Disclaimer: I am not an animal welfare researcher or expert.

I like eating eggs, and it seems possible to raise laying hens in a humane and low-suffering way, so I looked into whether I could purchase eggs from brands that treat their chickens well (or at least, less badly).&nbsp;</p><p>TL;DR: See <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SnGqab3noXLmJzQCs/lower-suffering-egg-brands-available-in-the-sf-bay-area#Recommended_egg_brands\">here</a> for egg brands I recommend that are sold in the Bay Area. If you're not based in the Bay Area, I recommend <a href=\"https://www.cornucopia.org/scorecard/eggs/\">Cornucopia's Egg Scorecard</a> tool and the <a href=\"https://agreenerworld.org/directory/\">Animal Welfare Approved store locator</a> to find low-suffering eggs in your market area.</p><h2>What does \"lower-suffering\" mean?&nbsp;</h2><p>I don't know how to tell whether a hen's life is \"overall happy\" or \"net-positive\" (or if that's even a coherent way to think about this question). Instead, I looked into common industry practices that are harmful to laying hens, and tried to find brands that avoid those practices. To do this, I used the qualifying criteria for A Greener World's <a href=\"https://agreenerworld.org/certifications/animal-welfare-approved/\">Animal Welfare Approved (AWA)</a> certification, which I've personally heard animal welfare researchers speak highly of.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, very few egg brands (and none available in my current city) have an AWA certification, so rather than relying on certification status, I evaluated each brand on a per-criteria basis.</p><p>Based on the <a href=\"https://agreenerworld.org/certifications/animal-welfare-approved/standards/laying-hen-standards/\">AWA standards for laying hens</a>, my criteria included:</p><ul><li><strong>No physical mutilation. </strong>This includes debeaking (removing the whole beak), beak trimming (removing the sharp tip of the beak that the hen uses to forage and groom), toe-trimming (removing the hen's claws), etc. The AWA certification forbids all physical alterations.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>No forced-molting. </strong>This involves starving hens for 1-2 weeks, which forces them into a molt (losing feathers), resetting their reproductive cycle so that they can restart egg production with higher yields. AWA forbids this.</li><li><strong>Access to outdoor space and foraging. </strong>AWA mandates that outdoor foraging is accessible for at least 50% of daylight hours, and that housing is designed to encourage birds to forage outdoors during the day. The outdoor space must be an actual nice place to forage, with food and vegetation to provide cover from predators, and not just a dirt field. Indoor confinement is prohibited.</li><li><strong>Age of outdoor access for pullets (young hens). </strong>Many farms keep pullets indoors for their safety even if adult hens forage outdoors. If you keep pullets indoors for too long, it seems that they became scared to go outside. AWA's standard is 4 weeks; many standard farms don't allow outdoor access until &gt;12 weeks (if outdoor access is provided at all).</li><li><strong>Indoor space</strong>. The hens' indoor housing or shelter must have at least 1.8 square feet per bird, unless they only return to their indoor housing to lay and sleep and spend the rest of the time outdoors.</li><li><strong>Smaller flock size. </strong>AWA has no strict requirements here, but recommends a flock size of &lt;500 birds, and notes that the birds must have a stable group size and be monitored to minimize fighting. This is much smaller than standard farms, which often have flock sizes of 10,000+ hens.</li></ul><p>(The AWA certification has a ton more requirements than just this, but I limited my criteria to ones that I could easily check using online materials).</p><h3>Is this enough?</h3><p>I'm not sure. I've sometimes thought that avoiding industry-standard factory farms is like avoiding using prisons that violate the Geneva Convention: it prevents the worst atrocities, but by no means guarantees a good life. At other times, I read about the hens at the farms I buy from and think they sound like they're having a pretty good time. The standards mentioned above, while fairly minimal, are already very different from industry standard practice, and my guess is that if a farm is willing to implement them, they're probably much more likely to care about their birds' wellbeing. Some of the top brands I mention below go above and beyond the minimal criteria listed above.</p><p><i>Edited to add: </i>Some criteria that I would like to use when comparing farms, but couldn't find enough data on:</p><ul><li>Whether the farm uses heritage breeds: my understanding is that heritage breeds lay fewer eggs, but have healthier genetics and fewer chronic health issues.</li><li>How the farm handles male chicks: I'm pretty sure that male chicks are always killed (or sold to be killed), but I don't know if some farms do this more humanely than others. Even AWA does not forbid male chick culling, sadly, so it's probably the default practice until the US adopts in-ovo sexing.</li><li>How well the farm cares for the health of its hens: Farm chickens face many common diseases and health issues, such as bone fractures from insufficient calcium (eggshell production requires a lot of calcium, leaving less for healthy bone growth). I don't have the expertise to evaluate how well a farm mitigates this, or how well they care for injured or sick hens.</li></ul><h2>Recommended egg brands</h2><p>Most recommended, but not widely available:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://fifthcrowfarm.com/\"><strong>Fifth Crow Farm</strong></a><strong> </strong>is Animal Welfare Approved, and sells at <a href=\"https://fifthcrowfarm.com/farmers-markets/\">farmer's markets in SF and the South Bay</a>, as well as via farm pickup. They use heritage breeds, have a limited quantity of eggs available per year, and typically run out by the end of the laying season. They seem to really care about their chickens.</li></ul><p>I found several other farms that aren't AWA-approved, but score well on the welfare criteria I mentioned above, and are more widely available at standard grocery stores:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://alexandrefamilyfarm.com/\"><strong>Alexandre Kids</strong></a>, available at Whole Foods, Berkeley Bowl, and Andronico's, as well as other grocery stores across the West Coast;</li><li><a href=\"https://burroughsfamilyfarms.com/products/organic-eggs\"><strong>Burroughs Family Farms</strong></a><strong>, </strong>available at Whole Foods locations in Berkeley;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.pcfma.org/vendors/stueve-organic\"><strong>Stueve Organic</strong></a><strong>, </strong>occasionally available at Whole Foods and Berkeley Bowl;</li><li><a href=\"https://stjohnfamilyfarms.com/\"><strong>St. John Family Farms (branded as \"Outdoor Hens\")</strong></a>, occasionally available at Berkeley Bowl.</li></ul><p>In general, higher-welfare farms seem to be much lower volume, and typically only sell at a few grocery stores. This makes sense since chickens benefit from smaller flock sizes and fewer laying cycles, but it also means that it's harder to find stores that carry these brands. In my experience, Alexandre Kids is the most widely-available of the top brands I recommend.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're not based in the Bay Area, or can't find the above brands at your local grocery store, I recommend using <a href=\"https://www.cornucopia.org/scorecard/eggs/\">Cornucopia's Egg Scorecard</a> tool to find brands that sell in your market area, or using the <a href=\"https://agreenerworld.org/directory/\">Animal Welfare Approved store locator</a> (which is unfortunately a bit janky, but still works).</p><h2>Dis-recommended egg brands</h2><p>In researching this, I also found that many farms that brand themselves as humane or \"pasture raised\" but seem likely to be high-suffering.

bias, and happy bias", "postedAt": "2024-02-02T14:20:41.040Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Introduction</h1><p>While many types of biases are more commonly known and accounted for, I think there may be three especially tricky biases that influence our thinking about how to do good:</p><ol><li><strong>Human Bias</strong><ol><li>We are all&nbsp;<i>human</i>, which may influence us to systematically devalue nonhuman sentience.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Existence Bias</strong><ol><li>We all&nbsp;<i>already exist</i> as biologically evolved beings, which may influence us to systematically overvalue the potential future existence of other biologically evolved beings.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhoccugaiqu\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhoccugaiqu\">[1]</a></sup></span></li></ol></li><li><strong>Happy Bias</strong><ol><li>We are&nbsp;<i>relatively happy</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyvinooci07\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyvinooci07\">[2]</a></sup></span>\u2014or at least we are not actively being tortured or experiencing incapacitating suffering while thinking, writing, and working\u2014which may influence us to systematically undervalue the importance of extreme suffering.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqkhvjy8l2z\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqkhvjy8l2z\">[3]</a></sup></span></li></ol></li></ol><p>Like other biases, these three influence our thinking and decision making unless we take steps to counteract them.</p><p>What makes these biases more difficult to counter is the fact that they are universally held by every human working on doing good in the world, and it\u2019s difficult to see how anyone thinking about, writing about, and working on issues of well-being and suffering could&nbsp;<i>not</i> have these qualities\u2014there is no group of individuals&nbsp;without these qualities who can advocate for their point of view.</p><p>The point of this post is not to resolve these questions, but rather to prompt more reflection on these tricky biases and how they may be skewing our thinking and work in specific directions.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref79p5pqdblxi\"><sup><a href=\"#fn79p5pqdblxi\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p>For those who are already aware of and accounting for these biases, bravo! For the rest of us, I think this topic deserves at least a little thought, and potentially much more than a little, if we wish to increase the accuracy of our worldview.
