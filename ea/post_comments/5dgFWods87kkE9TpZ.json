Regarding your calculation, a few of these factors are non-independent in a way that favors space colonization. Specifically:</p><p>\n<em> Speeding up and slowing down are basically the same, so you should just treat that as one issue.\n</em> Fitting everything you need into the spaceship and being able to build a civilization when you arrive are very closely related.\n<em> Having your stuff survive the voyage and being able to build a civilization in a hostile environment are closely related. I would expect that if you can build a civilization when you get there, you can make sure your equipment functions during your voyage.\n</em> Having the capacity to overcome the above problems and the non-existence of a presently unknown fatal obstacle is related to people later deciding whether to do this.</p><p>I also think they're positively related in a more subtle way. There are people who know more about this than you or me who are saying that all these obstacles can be overcome. Conditional on one of these obstacles being possible to overcome (as they say), I have more confidence in their judgment, which makes me more confident that the other obstacles can be overcome.</p><p>Re: space cities, I haven't looked into it much personally. Much of the discussion seems to assume building your civilization on a planet.
