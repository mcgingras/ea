What stuff like this would you predict from text-to-image diffusion models?</p><blockquote><p>So, what justifies this casual dismissal of the entertainment value of text-to-image models?</p></blockquote><p>We don't. We argue that it's unlikely to outweigh harms.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Your primary conclusion is that \"the AI research community should curtail work on risky capabilities\".</p></blockquote><p>I wouldn't say this is our primary conclusion. See my first response above. Also, I don't think this is obvious.

We do not advocate for government bans. My answer to this is essentially what we wrote in the \"The role of AI governance.\" I don't have much to add beyond what we already wrote. I recommend rereading that section. In short, there are regulatory tools that can be used. For example, the FTC may have a considerable amount of power in some cases.</p><blockquote><p>Are we talking about 100 people a year being victimized?

In the post, we cite one <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90414116/there-are-almost-15k-deepfake-videos-out-there-and-96-of-them-are-porn\">article</a> about a study from 2019 that found &nbsp;~15,000 deepfakes online. That was in 2019 when image and video generation were much less developed than today. And in the future, things may be much more widespread because of open-source tools based on SD that are easy to use.</p><p>Another really important point, I think, is that we argue in the post that trying to avoid dynamics involving racing toward TAI, copycatting, and open-sourcing of models will LESSEN X-risk. You wrote your comment as if we are trying to argue that preventing sex crimes are more important than X-risk. We don't say this. I recommend rereading the \"But even if one does not view the risks specific to text-to-image models as a major concern...\" paragraph and the \"The role of AI researchers\" section.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, and I want to put a star on this point -- we all should care a lot about sex crime. And I'm sure you do. Writing off problems like this by comparing them to X-risk &nbsp;(1) isn't valid in this case because we argue for improving the dev ecosystem to address <i>both</i> of these problems, (2) should be approached with great care and good data if it needs to be done, and (3) is one type of thing that leads to a lot of negativity &nbsp;and bad press about EA.&nbsp;</p><p>I think this is probably even more &nbsp;true for your comments on entertainment value and whether that might outweigh the harms of deepfake sex crimes. First, I'm highly skeptical that we will find uses for text-to-image models that are so widely usable and entertaining that it would be commensurate to the harms of diffusion-deepfake sex crime. But even if we could be confident that entertainment would hypothetically outweigh sex crimes on pure utilitarian grounds, in the real world with real politics and EA critics, I do not think this position would be tenable. It could serve to undermine support for EA and end up being very negative if widespread.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "NFAigaxwKzMRLNp9H", "user": null}, {"_id": "XrYoSNomrAAMvhgp5", "postedAt": "2022-11-08T01:11:45.551Z", "postId": "Bnp9YDqErNXHmTvvE", "htmlBody": "<p>I think the core takeaway, at least from my end, is that this post <i>elucidates a model , and tells a more concrete story, for how proliferation of technologies of a certain &nbsp;structure and API (e.g., general-purpose query-based ML models) can occur, and why they are dangerous.</i> Most importantly, this entails that, <i>even if you don't buy the harms of DALLE-2 itself </i>(which, we have established, you should, in particular for its potential successors), this pattern of <strong>origination -&gt; copycatting -&gt; distribution &nbsp;-&gt; misuse</strong> is a typical path for the release of technologies like this. If you buy that a dangerous capability could ever be produced by an AI model deployable with an API of the form query -&gt; behaviour &nbsp;(e.g. by powerful automatic video generation from prompts, &nbsp;powerful face-editing tools given a video, &nbsp;or an agent with arbitrary access to the internet controlled via user queries), this line of reasoning could therefore apply and/or be useful. This informs a few things:</p><ol><li>Technologies, once proliferated, are like a Pandora's Box (or indeed, a slippery slope), and so therefore <i>the very coordination problem / regulatory problem you speak of&nbsp;</i> is most easily solved <i>at the level of origination. </i>This is a useful insight now, <i>while many of the most dangerous AIs to be developed are yet to be originated</i>.</li><li>The potential harms of these technologies <i>come from their unbounded scope</i>, i.e. from the generality of function, lack of restriction of user access, or from the parameter count of these models being so large as to make their behaviour inherently hard to reason with. All of these things make these kinds of models more particularly amenable to misuse. So this post, in my mind, also takes a view on the <i>source</i> of capabilities risk from these models: in their generality and open scope. This can therefore inform the kinds of models / training techniques that are more dangerous: e.g. that for which the scope is the widest, where most possible failures <i>could </i>happen because the <i>right</i> behaviour is more nebulously defined.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>In general, I would urge you to consider this paragraph (in particular point (3)), the argument there seeming to be the bulk of your criticism.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Overall, the slippery slope from the carefully-guarded DALLE-2 to the fully-open-source Stable Diffusion took less than 5 months.

In particular, OpenAI and DeepMind both express that they want to race to generate highly transformative intelligent systems. The goal they both profess is to be the first to develop them so that they can exercise responsible stewardship and ensure that it is as aligned and beneficial as possible. This is a benevolent form of what Nick Bostrom refers to in Superintelligence as gaining a \u201cdecisive strategic advantage\u201d which may make the first developer of particularly transformative AI too powerful to compete with. There are many problems with this strategy including: (1) It is entirely based on racing to develop transformative AI, and faster timelines exacerbate AI risks. This is especially perverse if multiple actors are competitively racing to do so. (2) Nobody should trust a small set of people like Sam Altman and Demis Hassabis to unilaterally exercise benevolent stewardship over transformative AI. Arguably, under any tenable framework for AI ethics, a regime in which a small technocratic set of people unilaterally controlled transformative AI would be inherently unethical. Meaningful democratization is needed. (3) OpenAI\u2019s approach to DALLE-2 should further erode confidence in them in particular. Their overly-convenient technical report on risks that failed to make any mention of copycatting combined with how quickly they worked to profit off of DALLE-2 are worrying signs. (4) Copycatting makes racing to build transformative AI strictly more risky. Even if one fully-trusted a single actor like OpenAI or DeepMind to exercise perfect stewardship over transformative AI if they monopolized it, how quickly DALLE-2 was copycatted multiple times suggests that copycatting may undermine attempts at benevolent strategic dominance. Copycatting would most likely serve to broaden the set of technocrats who control transformative AI but still fail to democratize it. So if a company like OpenAI or DeepMind races to build transformative AI, and if it is still copycatted anyway, we get the worst of all worlds: unsecure, non-democratized, transformative AI on a faster timeline.
