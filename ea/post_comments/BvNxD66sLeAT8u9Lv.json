I agree that to get a complete picture, we would need to consider impacts past 2100, but we can still learn a lot from models that only go to 2100. Moreover, it would be practically impossible to build a useful complete climate-economy model running eg 1 million years into the future. It is more informative to explore how climate change might affect proxies of things that might have long-term import such as the risk of civilisational collapse or extinction.

In short, your response worries me. I have tried to keep the prose below inoffensive in tone, but there is a trade-off between offensive directness and condescending obfuscation. I hope I have traced the line accurately.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>You may not think significant discussion of cascading risks would change the fundamental conclusions of your report, but many researchers, often those with considerably more experience and expertise in climate risk (e.g. the IPCC), do: strongly so. Surely in a book-length report there is room for a few pages?</li><li>If you have refuted arguments, is it not academic best practice to cite the papers you respond to? In any case, if you know of and have read the papers, are we to understand that you believe many (if not most) peer-reviewed papers on Global Catastrophic and Existential climate risk are not worth mentioning anywhere in 437 pages of discussion?</li><li>This response causes me the most concern. That is simply not what complex systems theory is. Either you are aware that this characterisation is highly inaccurate and unfair, or you are not. If the former, I am disappointed by your (apparent) dismissiveness and willingness to mischaracterise. If the latter, I wonder how you could have done anything close to sufficient research into one of the foundational components of many studies of climate risks.</li><li>It is true that there are many conceptual frameworks for climate risk, and in a study of any topic you are generally expected to state, explain, and justify your conceptual framework. This is especially true when the framework you use (i.e. that of the Techno-Utopian Approach) has been strongly critiqued, for instance in Democratising Risk (Cremer and Kemp, 2021), another highly consequential paper you do not appear to have engaged with or cited. The dichotomy of 'direct' and indirect' risks may be exhaustive, but this is not the only criterion for an adequate theoretical framework. To be somewhat, but logically coherently glib, we could make the same argument for categorising phenomena according to whether their names contained an odd or even number of letters.</li><li>I also disagree with this point, especially the final sentence, but there is little to engage with: simply assertions. Let us agree to disagree.</li></ul><p>Beard et al. and Kemp et al. are each less than 5% of the length of your piece. Of course they cover less ground. There is a difference between a 10- or 20-page paper not mentioning every single caveat in every single work they cite, and one (1) failing to substantively engage with or even cite almost all GCR-specific climate research, (2) not explicitly stating nor justifying one's methodology in the face of strong critique, and (3) disregarding (in complex systems studies) a massive component of studies of climate risk, wider GCR (e.g. Fisher and Sandberg 2022), and the studies of Earth-system dynamics in general without explanation or justification.<br><br>Do you expect to subject this work to peer-review, and if not, why?</p>", "parentCommentId": "sCjjqSx6fJgoJzRQ2", "user": {"username": "A.C.Skraeling"}}, {"_id": "9Kr8nP3tDr4kmF5ML", "postedAt": "2022-08-26T17:59:46.555Z", "postId": "BvNxD66sLeAT8u9Lv", "htmlBody": "<p>I wouldn't characterise it as dismissing out of hand.</p>", "parentCommentId": "zkiRLknMNomvZPRLK", "user": {"username": "Stefan_Schubert"}}, {"_id": "P6KLydaiPc7YJNx7h", "postedAt": "2022-08-26T18:03:46.532Z", "postId": "BvNxD66sLeAT8u9Lv", "htmlBody": "<p>What would you call it?</p><p>I suppose all I have to say is that I often see very reasonable critiques downvoted through the floor without explanation worryingly often.<br><br>I haven't theorised very much about the cause, but the phenomenon correlates suspiciously well with substantive or strong criticism of prominent figures within EA.</p><p>If this perception is accurate, it does not seem like good epistemic practice.</p><p>(This one has 14 points from 3 votes?

I appreciate the structure of your report, by the way, it lets a reader quickly drill down to sections of interest. It is clearly written.&nbsp;</p><p>At the moment, I am considering your analysis of permafrost and methane contributions to GAST changes. I have a larger number for total carbon in permafrost than you, 1.5Tt carbon, but now have to go through references to reconcile that number with yours. Your mention of an analysis from USGS deserves a read through articles from the reference you gave, and I am attempting that now.&nbsp;</p><p>There are several parameters involved (only some independent), to do with:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;source type (anearobic decomposition, free gas deposit, methane hydrate dissolution),</li><li>&nbsp;source size,&nbsp;</li><li>source depth and layering,&nbsp;</li><li>rate of release (obviously dependent on other parameters)</li><li>geographic location (gulf of mexico versus arctic ice shelf),&nbsp;</li><li>temperature gradient (at a location),&nbsp;</li><li>water column height (near-shore vs slope),&nbsp;</li></ul><p>in deciding whether methane (edit:carbon in methane) reaches the atmosphere as methane, carbon dioxide, or not at all, and over what time period. &nbsp;</p><p>The significance of field observations over the last 10 years, and differences between particular regions (eg, Arctic seas), should be taken into account. Before reviewing counterarguments, I tend to take specialist claims about conclusions that factor in these parameters uncritically, but now that you've mentioned one parameter, aerobic bacteria acting on methane, as implying conclusions contrary to mine, I should delve deeper into how these parameters interact.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to offer a comment about Greenland's ice sheet, and its potential contribution to sea level rise this century, I am curious to check sources with you and do more reconciling (or at least partitioning) of references. I've seen reports that changes to Greenland's ice sheet are accelerating and lead to estimates of sea level rise that are higher than, say 50 cm, more like meters, actually, over the next 80 years, but would like to know more from you.&nbsp;</p><p>In general, my observation is strong drivers of change to specific tipping points haven't found their way into climate models used by the IPCC (for example, physical processes driving some Greenland ice melt). They might at some point.</p><p>BTW, I did take a read through the comments here, and consider the the mentions of analyses of systemic and cascading risks to be useful. I hope you won't object if I ask a few questions about those risks, just to understand your perspective on those models.

My impression is that very few other EA research organizations have a very formal and legible process for prepublication reviews.</li><li>However, I think for a report of this scope, it might be valuable to have a fairly good researcher sit down and review the report very carefully, in a lot of detail.</li></ul></li><li>If this is not already done, for people who are not satisfied (or at least queasy) with the report, it might be helpful to commission 1-3 months of research critiquing and redteaming this report in a lot of detail.</li><li>I think John is understandably frustrated by the lack of technical engagement and the <a href=\"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/criticism-of-criticism-of-criticism\">overly metaness</a> (and possibly personal acrimoniousness? ) of the comments so far.</li><li>I think John has acted badly in accusing A.C.Skraeling of being a sock puppet account.</li><li>I think every loosely organized emerging research field has \"duds,\" or low-quality work that in a poorly filtered ecosystem will suck up a lot of the oxygen.<ul><li>For both politeness and practical time-constraints reasons, people tend to ignore the bad work and only engage with the good/mediocre work.</li><li>Larks is one of the few people who <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BNQMyWGCNWDdP2WyG/2021-ai-alignment-literature-review-and-charity-comparison#Poor_Quality_Research\">point out this explicitly</a> (for AI alignment).

My guess is that anyone who was convinced by earlier research by John, 80k, etc, plus the relevant research and communication into other, riskier, domains, are unlikely to change their minds by critiques of this deeper report. And anybody who wasn't convinced by the earlier reports are unlikely to be convinced by this one.<ul><li>So I don't really know the value-add of more intellectual attention into this.</li></ul></li><li>I looked into climate change for myself for several weeks in 2019 (back when I was substantially worse at both research and judgement). I think I was fairly satisfied that it should not be one of EA's top priorities, even ignoring neglectedness. My reasoning then was fairly simple.<ul><li>My main reason for thinking that climate change was a significant existential risk (or at least a GCR) was that I had the vague impression that this is a position in academia.</li><li>My main reason for not believing that was because a) weak inside views about historical resilience to temperature variability and b) other smart and thoughtful EAs didn't believe this.</li><li>Thus, the appropriate way to evaluate the evidence is to try to look at the climate change literature, in a way that does not reference past EA work (so as to not be clouded as much by biases/information cascades).</li><li>I looked at it for a while, and concluded that the literature mostly did not say that climate change was a significant existential risk (of course it was not framed in those terms).<ul><li>I thought that climate risk experts should be predisposed to overestimate rather than estimate risks, so there is additional evidence beyond just their conclusions.</li></ul></li><li>Given that my reasons for thinking climate change was a significant existential risk weren't very strong or robust to begin with, I didn't need that many bits to be convinced that the risks are low.</li><li>I think my research quality/rigor at the time was pretty meh. Still I don't think it should swing the overall conclusion.</li><li>I'm more worried about motivated reasoning/selection effects. Motivated reasoning because I felt like part of the reason for doing that research was convincing myself and others, rather than because I fully impassionately wanted to know the truth. Selection effects because I went into it using an EA methodology and ways of thinking about the world, and of course I'm selected to be one of the people who think in that way.</li></ul></li><li>Since then, I had 3 updates re: how high climate risk should intuitively \"feel\", in my head, in different directions:<ul><li>Jan-March 2020 Covid was a large update for me against a) trusting the object-level of a lot of expert modeling and b) trusting that experts will uniformly overestimate rather than underestimate risk (as opposed to \"don't panic\" justifications and conservatism bias). This caused me to worry more about climate stuff.</li><li>John/Johannes looked into and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ckPSrWeghc4gNsShK/good-news-on-climate-change\">updated in believing in lower overall climate risk</a>, with reasonable-sounding object-level reasons. This caused me to worry less about climate stuff.<ul><li>I did not look into or investigate their reasoning, and generally have not prioritized looking into climate much since 2019.</li></ul></li><li>Compared to myself in 2019, I placed relatively more trust in the relative judgement of EAs over that of external people. This caused me to worry less about climate stuff.</li><li>I think the first update is the largest.</li></ul></li><li>My understanding is that a lot of the purported value of engaging on the object-level details of climate, and of WWOTF's aims in general, is to draw in the climate change people as allies.<ul><li>I'm a bit confused about this reasoning. I think:<ul><li>the arguments for working on AI risk/biorisk over climate risks seems fairly simple to me, and resilient to a practical range of empirical disagreements within climate.</li><li>to the extent the arguments are bad or poorly communicated, I strongly suspect that they come in almost entirely because AI risk/biorisk arguments are insufficiently grounded, rather than because the climate arguments are insufficiently sophisticated.</li><li>from a persuasion perspective, I think this is maybe a bad move anyway. Maybe better to be \"yes, and\" than to explicitly and immediately tell people that the thing they've devoted their lives to is &gt;100x less important.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Given that it might not be realistic to find (and may not be very valuable) a senior-ish EA researcher to critique and red-team John's report, I'd be excited to have several junior EAs try this.<ul><li>Roughly, a summer-long project for someone of the calibre of <a href=\"https://www.camxrisk.org/\">CERI</a>/<a href=\"https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/stanford-existential-risks-initiative/content/stanford-existential-risks-initiative\">SERI</a> might be to go <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/myp9Y9qJnpEEWhJF9/linch-s-shortform?commentId=hedmemCCrb4jkviAd\">line by line in the report</a> (or pick a few chapters) to find the relevant potential mistakes/disagreements/cruxes (from an LT perspective).</li><li>This helps train critical thinking abilities and thoughtfulness.</li><li>To be clear, this is premised on domain-general critical thinking abilities and thoughtfulness being among the most valuable things for junior EAs to train.<ul><li>I'm genuinely confused about how much we want less thoughtful people as allies. I think an increasingly common position in longtermist EA nowadays is that the things that matter is AI risk and biorisk (sometimes just AI risk), and what we most/only need are people who are either extremely technically competent (for solving the technical problems) or who are very good at politics (for policy/persuasion).<ul><li>Whereas I feel like I sort of represent the older guard of people who still think that thoughtfulness is a huge asset.<ul><li>But I acknowledge that this is something I have a (large?) bias to believing is true (because I'm relatively worse at being very technical or social, compared to being thoughtful).</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Linch"}}, {"_id": "9MSSoxKWD78tppRYo", "postedAt": "2022-08-27T20:56:03.374Z", "postId": "BvNxD66sLeAT8u9Lv", "htmlBody": "<p>I think this is fair.

My impression from earlier in the chapter is that you are essentially drawing the idea you can essentially ignore other potential causes from the Precipice. Is this correct?&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, this assumption only seems true if you assume an X-Risk will come as a single hazard. If it is, say, a cascading risk, cascading to civilisational collapse then extinction, then the idea these are the biggest risks should be questioned. Simultanously, if you view it as a multi-pulsed thing, say civilisational collapse from one hazard or a series of hazards or cascades, and then followed by whatever may (slowly) make us extinct- once civilisation is collapsed its easier for smaller hazards to kill us all, then once again the primacy of these hazards reduces. Only if you take a reductive view that sees extinction as primarily due to direct, single or near single, hazards that kill everyone or basically everyone, can this model be valid.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, you do talk a little about multipulsed, subextinction risks followed by recovery being harder, but not in much detail. In particular, you claim that extreme climate change may make civilisational recovery from collapse much harder, but then don't seem to deal in detail with this question, which may be considered to be highly important, particularly if we think civilisational collapse is considerably more likely than extinction. Moreover, you suggest that \"there is some<br>chance of civilisational collapse due to nuclear war or engineered pandemics,\" essentially suggesting other causes of civilisational collapse that are less direct, and therefore could be made more likely due to climate change, are negligable.

I won't overthrow a paradigm in a single comment, and I won't even try, but do please tell me if you agree with me that this is the crux of our disagreement.

If you mean \"organizations in the EA space reject directly democratic approaches to decision-making,\" then that is largely true, but I don't think it's in any way a distinctive feature of the community. I think that almost no philanthropic foundations, anywhere, decide where to give money using anything like a popular vote; I think the same is generally true of advocacy and analysis organizations. I'd actually guess that EA organizations are actually somewhat more democratic-leaning than comparable organizations in other communities; for example, FTX's regranting program is both pretty unusual and arguably a bit \"more democratic\" than other approaches to giving away money.

A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/methane-hydrates-and-contemporary-climate-change-24314790/\">Nature paper </a>from Ruppel is a bit old, and includes discussion of deeper deposits in warmer waters much further south. The paper does make exceptions for shallower deposits, as in the Arctic sea. She notes technical difficulties in resolving the origin of the methane even in those cases, but there's been efforts to resolve the questions since then. A <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2016RG000534\">later Reviews Of Geophysics paper</a> &nbsp;confronts predictions about sources and distributions.I have to dig into that.&nbsp;</p><p>Carolyn Ruppel is also a proponent of drilling undersea methane for fuel, and has been <a href=\"https://www.loe.org/shows/segments.html?programID=12-P13-00010&amp;segmentID=2\">for the last decade</a>. Treatment of the melting arctic as a tipping point seems politically unpopular, now that various projected benefits of its melt have been identified. We can drill for natural gas or oil, fish, establish shipping lanes, or fight over sovereignty up there, but I'm not seeing much government attention on the ice-free Arctic as an actual climate problem.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, Ruppel holds an important position, and I will give her research more attention now. Thank you.</p><p>Yes, as far as sea level rise, I read the sections you mentioned, thank you. The West Antarctic is less of an immediate concern than Greenland, so I am puzzled why you haven't mentioned Greenland explicitly. Your discussion of sea level rise doesn't include Greenland's contribution, but Greenland will melt before the West Antarctic, and it holds several meters of sea level rise in its ice. I believe that Greenland's melt could shutdown the AMOC as well.</p><p>I think processes like fires on permafrost land go ignored in models of permafrost thaw, just like lubrication of the bottom of Greenland Ice goes ignored.

Perhaps it is possible to call this a politics: technocracy.</p><p>But this politics is suspicious of, or rejects, the form of politics to which most people attach enormous value: democracy. Would effective altruists attach any independent value to democracy? Given the chance to craft social and political arrangements from scratch, would effective altruists select democratic rather than technocratic rule? I suspect the answer is no, and to that extent, effective altruism is in tension with the commonplace philosophy that identifies in democracy a powerful normative force.</p></blockquote>", "parentCommentId": "ZihELNLqPicLLtkbK", "user": null}, {"_id": "QRapr3prhqjCDxtRK", "postedAt": "2022-08-29T15:27:58.428Z", "postId": "BvNxD66sLeAT8u9Lv", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>I disagree that the problem here is groupthink, and I think if you look at highly rated posts, you can't reasonably conclude that people who criticise the orthodox position will be reliably downvoted</p></blockquote><p>The highly rated posts I've seen so far, on the topic of X risk in particular, appear to me to typically be a product of group think. &nbsp; They're typically very articulate, very polished form, highly informed on details, (ie. good academic style) &nbsp;but not escaping group think.</p><p>As evidence, please direct us to the writers here who have been laser focused on the critical importance of managing the pace of the knowledge explosion. &nbsp;Where are they? &nbsp; If they exist, and I sincerely hope they do (because I don't have the authority to sell the case) I really would like to meet them.</p><p>In my opinion, group think is to some immeasurable degree built in to the fabric of academia, because academia is a business, and one does not stay in business by alienating one's clients. &nbsp;Thus, to the degree the academic depends on their salary, they are somewhat imprisoned within the limits of whoever is signing their paycheck.</p><p>Here's an example. &nbsp;</p><p>I can afford to persistently sell a \"world without men\" idea as an ambitious solution to human violence because nobody owns me, I have nothing of value at stake. &nbsp; &nbsp;Whatever the merits of such a case might be, (very clearly debatable) &nbsp;academics can't afford to make that case, because the group consensus of their community will not tolerate it. &nbsp;And before you protest, know that I've already been threatened with banning on this site just for bringing the subject up. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Academia is business, and is thus governed by fear, and that is the source of group think.</p><p>If you would, please down vote this post at least 100 times, as I believe I've earned it. &nbsp;:-)</p>", "parentCommentId": "4rHTb38uzJq4FHawX", "user": {"username": "Phil Tanny"}}, {"_id": "kckkmPSqyAqLDTxqQ", "postedAt": "2022-08-29T19:33:04.282Z", "postId": "BvNxD66sLeAT8u9Lv", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks, I'm actually surprised that members of the community have such energy around its concerns about the quality of climate change scholarship.

Basically, I think global warming is now self-amplifying. Anyway, I don't mind the lack of interest, it wasn't scholarly work. &nbsp;</p><p>The meta comments are about research process, how best to represent differing viewpoints, and whether John gave fair weight to considerations outside the point of view that John holds. I don't have a comment here, I think I'll take what was given as where to start my own learning efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;What I would like from others who post here is more engagement around specific scenarios of risk. From my review of comments made in discussions of climate change, the obstacle seems to be lack of commitment to the plausibility of specific scenarios.&nbsp;</p><p>So for example, a discussion of a multi-breadbasket failure would include a few sentences about how our civilization would respond by choosing to grow its own food, eg., in cities. I would like to see someone work that through. We're talking about locally producing calorie-dense sources of carbohydrates and proteins in a situation in which grain stocks become limited worldwide. Vegies on your windowsill won't do the job. More generally, there's a question about stocks vs flows, we have some grain reserves, but how much, and how should they be managed in case of what percentage of global crop failures? George Monbiot has some conclusions (hint, he wants to use some old NASA tech), I'm looking forward to reading his work. Then there's the reason for failure. Hurricanes inundating low-lying farm areas (like Vietnam) would have a longer impact on soil productivity than would a 6-week heat wave, or would it?</p><p>Another example would be how we handle internal and global migration, given some specific scenario. For example, a famine and water shortage in Bangladesh during a heat wave inducing power outages and heat stress enough to kill people. What does an altruistic response to that situation look like?</p><p>In any prediction where the claim goes, \"It would be very bad if....\", there's usually a discussion of 100's of millions of deaths. What does that mean? Do they die in place, suddenly, or was there a predictable build-up but no response for a long time? I see this happening with a multi-breadbasket failure, there's hardly anyone working to prevent this scenario in realtime. There's one UN organization, a small one, and then &nbsp;there's ALLfed, who seem to be focused on Nuclear Winter. And how long is realtime? There's supposed to be a network coordinated from the UN that tracks when a global famine is looming and arranges stocks and flows to prevent the worst of it. Are they funded and effective?</p><p>I have also noticed a lack of interest in the states about the impacts of small heat waves elsewhere, for example, China's recent heat wave. But these tiny examples are a good start for creating predictions. People fried eggs on city stones for fun over there (yes, the heat island effect). Bridges buckled from heat, and their hydroelectric dams are dry. The immediate predictions, sadly, are just focused on their GDP. There's not much good prediction work to explain what happens if their water and hydropower shortage continue. I know only a little, that different geographic regions have different levels of dependency on hydropower. But the industries effected are critical to some sections of the global economy, and their shutdown, long-term, should be a concern for the economics-minded. Will they turn to coal to make up the difference and does it matter (coal, btw, has an interesting silver lining, the aerosol effect)?</p><p>Then there's Britain's recent heat wave, and the heat wave in the Northwest of the US a few years ago. All quite odd, linked to the meandering jet stream. The rain on Greenland's summit, another anomaly, which sets a new precedent for Greenland melt. We don't want an atmospheric river dumping on Greenland for days on end.</p><p>Then there's the recent prediction of a historical flood of California, a recurring event, but worsened by climate change.</p><p>Yes, so there's plenty to start from, and when building a scenario, you can take what's happened, make it worse, and make it last longer or occur repeatedly. Use that to explain why climate change is bad. Conversely, to reject climate change as a catastrophic risk, explain how we go about handling these difficult situations successfully, in time to prevent risks like the deaths of 100's of millions of people.

As mentioned, the methodology was reviewed, yes. So, this is my view, having taken on significant expert input.&nbsp;</p><p>A natural question is whether my report should be given less weight eg than a peer reviewed paper in a prominent journal. I think as a rule, a good approach is to try start by getting a sense of what the weight of the literature says, and then exploring the substantive arguments made. For the usual reasons, we should expect any randomly selected paper to be false. Papers that make claims far outside the consensus position that get published in prominent journals are especially likely to be false. There is also scope for certain groups of scientists to review one another's papers such that bad literatures can snowball.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn't to say that any random person writing about climate change will be better than a random peer reviewed paper. But I think there are reasons to put more weight on the views of someone who has good epistemics (not saying this is true of me, but one might think it is true of some EA researchers) and also be actually talking about the thing we are interested in - i.e. the longtermist import of climate change. Most papers just aren't focusing on that, but will use similar terminology. e.g. there is a paper by Xu and Ramanathan which says that climate change is an existential risk but uses that term in a completely different way to EAs.&nbsp;</p><p>I will give some examples of the flaws of the traditional peer review process as applied to some papers on the catastrophic side of things.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>A paper that is often brought up in climate catastrophe discussions is Steffen et al (2018) - the 'Hothouse Earth' paper. That paper has now been cited more than 2,000 times. For reasons I discuss in the report, I think it is both surprising that the paper was &nbsp;published. The IPCC also disagrees with it.</li></ol><p>2. The Kemp et al 2022 PNAS paper (also written by many planetary boundaries people) was peer reviewed, but also contains several &nbsp;errors.</p><p>For instance, it says \"Yet, there remain reasons for caution. For instance, there is significant uncertainty over key variables such as energy demand and economic growth. Plausibly higher economic growth rates could make RCP8.5 35% more likely (27).\"&nbsp;</p><p>The cite here in note (27) is to <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1713628115\">Christensen et al (2018)</a>, which actually says \"Our results indicate that there is a greater than 35% probability that emissions concentrations will exceed those assumed in RCP8.5.\" i.e. their finding is about the percentage point chance of RCP8.5, not about an increase in the relative risk of RCP8.5.&nbsp;</p><p>Another example: \"While an ECS below 1.5 \u00b0C was essentially ruled out, there remains an 18% probability that ECS could be greater than 4.5 \u00b0C (14).\"&nbsp;</p><p>The cite here is to the entire WG1 IPCC report (not that useful for checking but that aside...) The latest IPCC report says \"a best estimate of equilibrium climate sensitivity of 3\u00b0C, with a very likely range of 2\u00b0C to 5\u00b0C. The likely range [is] 2.5\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C\" The IPCC says \"Throughout the WGI report and unless stated otherwise, uncertainty is quantified using 90% uncertainty intervals. The 90% uncertainty interval, reported in square brackets [x to y], is estimated to have a 90% likelihood of covering the value that is being estimated. The range encompasses the median value, and there is an estimated 10% combined likelihood of the value being below the lower end of the range (x) and above its upper end (y). Often, the distribution will be considered symmetric about the corresponding best estimate, but this is not always the case. In this Report, an assessed 90% uncertainty interval is referred to as a \u2018very likely range\u2019. Similarly, an assessed 66% uncertainty interval is referred to as a \u2018likely range\u2019.</p><p>So, the 66% CI is 2.5\u00baC to 4\u00baC and the 90% CI is 2\u00baC-5\u00baC. If this is symmetric, then this means there is a 17% chance of &gt;4\u00baC, and a 5% chance of &gt;5\u00baC. It's unclear whether the distribution is symmetric or not - the IPCC does not say - but if it is then the '18% chance of &gt;4.5\u00baC' claim in climate endgame is wrong. So, a key claim in that paper &nbsp;- about the main variable of interest in climate science - cannot be inferred from the given reference.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Jehn et al have published <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TxBdCp3pmDb9mySCr/focus-of-the-ipcc-assessment-reports-has-shifted-to-lower\">two</a> <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HaXxEtx4QdykBjJi7/betting-on-the-best-case-higher-end-warming-is\">papers</a> cited in Kemp et al (2022), one of which says that \"More likely higher end warming scenarios of 3 \u00b0C and above, despite potential catastrophic impacts, are severely neglected.\" This is just not true, but nevertheless made it through peer review. Almost every single climate impact study reports the impact of 4.4\u00baC. There is barely a single chart in the entire IPCC impacts report that does not report that. We can perhaps quibble over what 'severely neglected' means, but it &nbsp;doesn't mean 'shown in every single chart in the IPCC climate impacts book'. &nbsp;It is surprising that this got through peer review.&nbsp;</p><p>**</p><p>As I have said, these are just single studies. I am consistently impressed by how good the IPCC is at reporting the median view in the literature, given how politicised the whole process must be.&nbsp;</p><p>**</p><p>I also do not think there is any tendency to downplay risks in the climate science literature. If you look at studies on publication bias in climate science, they <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.1713628115\">find</a> that effect sizes in abstracts in climate change papers have a tendency to be significantly inflated relative to the main text. This is especially pronounced in high impact journals. I have also found this from personal experience. Overall, I think in some cases the risks are overstated, in some they are understated, but there is no systematic pattern.&nbsp;</p><p>Probably the best way to examine whether my substantive conclusions are wrong would be to raise some substantive criticisms/carry out a redteam - I would welcome this. I emphasise that if my arguments are correct, then the scale of biorisk is numerous orders of magnitude larger than climate change.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "spkCw2oyQ3wPWqrTj", "user": null}, {"_id": "bkZCYnkQk9czGEv8m", "postedAt": "2022-09-05T05:52:51.011Z", "postId": "BvNxD66sLeAT8u9Lv", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Writing this as a moderator, but only expressing my own view.</i></p><p>Accusing someone of acting in bad faith on a public forum can be very damaging to the person, and it's very easy to be mistaken about such a characterization.

If you can find the research about seaweed growth in lower-pH conditions with heat waves in nearshore waters, and changes in nutrient availability (probably declines), I want to know more. I think seaweed might be a good near-term choice of replacement agriculture in the next 10-20 years, but during that time, it makes sense that the world scale up the kinds of food sources that you and ALLFED explore.</p><p>2. I like dextrose monohydrate, as a food product, it's widely available and dissolves clean in water. With flavoring and in combination with whey (and of course casein, but I really favor whey), it makes a replacement milk. I understand that anhydrous dextrose has different properties in foods. What form of dextrose would paper mills produce? Are you more thinking something with less sweetness, like maltodextrin (also a possibility in a milk substitute)? Could the mills produce different types of carbs?</p><p>3. Assuming a 2400 kcal diet, what are your targets for macronutrients? Given a source of concentrated carbohydrates, people need a protein source, a fat source, and additional sources of minerals and vitamins and other compounds. I &nbsp;lik carbs (510g-450g), proteins (40g-100g), and an EFA source (1g-10g), but that's just me. Adding in fats, you need to choose a carb minimum, as I think the trade-off would be carbs for fats, not proteins for fats.&nbsp;<br>There's a variety of reasons to choose different kcalorie totals and macronutrient balances, do you have a list of your criteria and final decisions or have you looked into that in detail?</p><p>4.

It would be good to organise a meeting to chat about this at some point if your interested.</p><p>On cascading risks, I tink a good recent discussion of cascading risk is found in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25021-8\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25021-8</a> . &nbsp;A plausible causal story for how climate change leads to a cascade may be as follows. This is obviously flawed and incomplete and clearly needs more study:</p><ul><li>To respond to growing threats from climate change, adaptation measures (often technological) will be put in place. However, these adaptation measures, such as physical defences, are often very fragile. Whilst it is possible agricultural production increases, this would also likely be due to adaptation measures, with new things introduced likely to be less resilient due to lack of experience. Moreover, as certain regions get agriculture more badly hit, it is possible you see a few increasing agricultural hubs as those places less effected by climate change/could adapt quicker. This further increases vulnerability</li><li>One or a number of critical nodes in this system are hit by a hazard, either one made more likely by climate change, or by another hazard. Sychrnonous failure causes diversion of resources to these areas, and the economic shock makes it harder to sustain adaptation infrastructure, which may then start to fail</li><li>Climate impacts cause increased civil unrest. This causes greater economic and political insecurity, making greater diversion of resources away from climate adaptation and towards combating the symptomns of this. The resources exerted can't match with the pressures on them, both environmental, climatic, social, political, economic. A &nbsp;near complete collapse of a mid-sized economy ensues, with global reprucussions</li><li>Meanwhile, climate change has made an engineered pandemic more likely by increasing the number of omnicidal actors. One of these engineered pandemics occur killing 1% of the worlds population, sychronous with a major drought, causing global economic collapse. In response to the drought, a water war between mid-sized powers ensues, leading to the involvement of major powers. Sanctions and embargoes between the powers lead to further economic damage. This is combined by significant food shortages from the &nbsp;drought, and socio-economic damage from the pandemic.</li><li>Political tensions rise in &nbsp;India, leading to mass protests. &nbsp;The failure of the Indian government to relieve a Muslim majority region of the famine causes tensions, a police massacre causes this to go into outright rebellion. The Indian government collapses, with major global economic consequences.</li><li>Climate impacts continue to scale across the world, with the economic damage from the famine, pandemic and collapse of the Indian government spreading. In the subsequent economic collapse, a major economy defaults on its debts, leading to further ewconomic turmoil. Civil unrest breaks out in another major economy (say Germany), once again causing economic collapse. The new Indian government, crippled and weakened and still under pressure from the civil war, promises to defend its water resources at all costs, however China, also suffering from a drought, cuts off the source of Brahmaputra. A tactical nuclear weapon is set off. Whilst this doesn't lead to global nuclear war, in the aftermath of this, markets collapse</li><li>With a collapsing global economy and mounting climate damages, adaptation measures cannot be meaningfully carried out, as maintences can't be afforded. This causes more and more damage.</li></ul><p>This is the example of a cascade. I didn't take it all the way to collapse/ extinction, but I think you could probably carry it on yourself. This is just A scenario I just came up with. Its probably not the most plausible. But there are thousands of such scenarios, each which climate change is a key factor in causing, interacting in different ways. this is what I mean by cascade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the seperate point of your indirect vs direct framing, it seems like my issues with it are two fold. I tend to think indirect risk is just so much larger a subset of things than direct risk (involves many of the causes of hazards, as well as I assume all exposures and vulnerabilities?), and yet I don't think your treatment of it gives it this necessary depth. So maybe in theory your framework is well defined, but in practice the category of indirect risk is like \"the rest\" and so doesn't seem to give a useful structure for defining what these key impacts are. &nbsp;I think, even if unintentional, the rhetoric of employing such a device privelages direct risks hugely, which I tend to think leads nearly inevitably to your conclusion due to this privelaging.</p><p>When you say you expected other criticisms, I can understand why you may be frustrated with my focus on the meta-issues. But I broadly don't have much of a problem with what you say, and certainly don't on any areas outside my area of expertise. Its what you don't say, and the methodology you have used that lets you get there, that worries me. Thats why I have focused on these meta-issues, because in terms of where I think this piece goes substantially wrong, I think its that.&nbsp;</p><p>As I have said previously, I think what you miss out is important as you are in a really unique place in the community by no fault of your own. There are probably few people deferred to in EA more than you are, &nbsp;so the worry if you miss things out, or if your methodology is wrong (and as I am sure you will admit no one is perfect) is this will get propograted as orthodoxy through the community. I know you tend to not think of yourself as this sort of person, and I don't think these epistemically deeply unhealthy dynamics are your fault.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, sorry I couldn't do a more substantive reply, I am super busy, and it certainly doesn't seem like forum comments are the most constructive to this discussion. Would you like to have a chat about this at some point so we can really hear each others persepctives?</p>", "parentCommentId": "mELnDLZGKfAb3aMCn", "user": {"username": "Gideon Futerman"}}, {"_id": "8SvkGhpwyhK42C2du", "postedAt": "2022-09-09T18:21:13.776Z", "postId": "BvNxD66sLeAT8u9Lv", "htmlBody": "<p>About planetary boundaries:</p><p>Leaving aside the discussions on the specific value and/or variable used to measure a specific boundary -which the authors themselves caveat that may be temporal until finding better ones-, isn't most of the controversy due to critiques conflating planetary boundaries and tipping points?</p>", "parentCommentId": "QwZaZrkwAfCjAexyK", "user": {"username": "mikbp"}}, {"_id": "2Z8TMXMc9wB8vkL94", "postedAt": "2022-09-10T16:51:02.625Z", "postId": "BvNxD66sLeAT8u9Lv", "htmlBody": "<p>I am going to have a post about the risks of runaway global warming soon.</p>", "parentCommentId": "CP4stvjyA8Ckq7v3X", "user": {"username": "turchin"}}, {"_id": "BLuTYgg6mrPn6JGoG", "postedAt": "2022-09-11T19:57:55.743Z", "postId": "BvNxD66sLeAT8u9Lv", "htmlBody": "<p>here https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bdSpaB9xj67FPiewN/a-pin-and-a-balloon-anthropic-fragility-increases-chances-of</p>", "parentCommentId": "CP4stvjyA8Ckq7v3X", "user": {"username": "turchin"}}, {"_id": "Tk7uEzWQoyLXMefsh", "postedAt": "2022-09-16T10:32:39.473Z", "postId": "BvNxD66sLeAT8u9Lv", "htmlBody": "<p>That assumes a relatively happy path.

G. Schuur et al.,\u2018Climate Change and the Permafrost Carbon Feedback\u2019, Nature 520, no. 7546 (April 2015): 171\u201379,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature14338.</p></blockquote><p>In <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274698738_Climate_change_and_the_permafrost_carbon_feedback\">the Nature paper you cited</a> for a listing of permafrost carbon, you find the following quote on the same page as lists total carbon in the top 3 meters of permafrost. I &nbsp;list the geographic regions in braces for clarity:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Taken together, the known pool of terrestrial permafrost carbon in the northern permafrost zone is 1,330\u20131,580 Pg carbon, accounting for surface carbon as well as deep carbon in the yedoma region [in Siberia and Alaska] and [Arctic] river deltas, with the potential for 400 Pg carbon in other deep terrestrial permafrost sediments that, along with an additional quantity of subsea permafrost carbon, still remains largely unquantified.</p></blockquote><p>So a total amount of carbon in permafrost between 1730-1980 Pg, or 1.73-1.98 trillion tonnes of carbon, not the 1 trillion tonnes you list. This is typically described as being twice the carbon currently in the atmosphere, but how quickly it causes heating given some rate of thaw depends on whether it is released as methane or carbon dioxide. As you know, methane has 100X the heating potential of carbon dioxide, but that drops off rapidly over a couple decades, so rate of release is very important.</p><p>If you look elsewhere for amounts, you find the usual figure listed is 1.5Tt for total carbon in permafrost. I think that represents updates to estimates but have not looked into it in detail. A slight rephrase of your sentence \"About 1 trillion tonnes of carbon is stored in permafrost.\" to either mention the top 3 meters of soil explicitly for the trillion tonnes number or to use some figure closer to 1.5Tt (<a href=\"https://arctic.noaa.gov/Report-Card/Report-Card-2019/ArtMID/7916/ArticleID/844/Permafrost-and-the-Global-Carbon-Cycle\">NOAA's mid-range</a> for total northern permafrost). will bring the announced total closer to what people typically mean by total carbon in permafrost, just the permafrost in the North.<s>&nbsp;</s></p><p>Earlier in the same Nature paper, you read:</p><blockquote><p>Deeper carbon measurements were initially rare, and it was not even possible to quantify the uncertainty for the permafrost carbon pool size estimate. However, important new syntheses continue to report large quantities of deep carbon preserved in permafrost at many previously unsampled locations, and that a substantial fraction of this deep permafrost carbon is susceptible to future thaw15. The permafrost carbon pool is now thought to comprise organic carbon in the top 3 m of surface soil, carbon in deposits deeper than 3 m (including those within the yedoma region, an area of deep sediment deposits that cover unglaciated parts of Siberia and Alaska16\u201318), as well as carbon within permafrost that formed on land during glacial periods but that is now found on shallow submarine shelves in the Arctic.</p></blockquote><p>For the reference you cite, it's clear that carbon deeper than 3m is considered \"susceptible to future thaw\", and so is relevant to discussions of permafrost contribution to global warming. In fact, some existing examples of that thaw are mentioned in that 2015 paper.</p><p>I think there are numerous taking off points for discussion of the effects of permafrost thaw aside from the box 5.1 sections of the IPCC technical report that you cite.&nbsp;</p><p>The parameters deciding the effects of permafrost include:</p><ul><li>abrupt vs gradual release of carbon</li><li>carbon release as methane (CH4) vs carbon dioxide (CO2)</li><li>geological shaping of ice and organic matter within permafrost</li><li>release of ancient microbes (bacteria, viruses) and &nbsp;others (anthrax, smallpox) in the soil</li><li>subsidence rates (causing effects on current or future infrastructure)</li><li>biophysical rates of change to permafrost (ground fires and microbial action)</li><li>stored chemical release on permafrost lands (sump chemicals, other chemicals)</li></ul><p>if you decide that you want to expand on those in a later version of your research.</p><p>EDIT: I included some light edits to this to make my comment more clear. Also I would love to discuss more of the topics you raise in your research report, including the models suggesting different levels of contribution from carbon release from permafrost.&nbsp;</p><p>I noticed this quote at the end of the box highlight on \"Permafrost Carbon and Feedbacks to Climate\" in Chapter 5 of the IPCC Technical Report that you cite:</p><blockquote><p>In conclusion, thawing terrestrial permafrost will lead to carbon release under a&nbsp;warmer world (high confidence). However, there is low confidence on the timing, magnitude and linearity of the permafrost climate feedback owing to the wide range of published estimates and the incomplete knowledge and representation in models of drivers and relationships.</p></blockquote><p>And this is why considering the highs and lows in a bit of depth is worth doing.</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;It is projected that CO2 released from permafrost will be 18 (3.1\u201341) PgC /\u00b0C by 2100, with the relative contribution of CO2 vs CH4 remaining poorly constrained. Permafrost carbon feedbacks are included among the under-represented feedbacks quantified in Figure&nbsp;5.29.</p></blockquote><p>Those projections, if we accept them as accurate, do not address nonlinear release of carbon, particularly as Methane. That leaves it to you to summarize expected heating over the short term of an abrupt release of carbon involving significant amounts of CH4. As I wrote, &nbsp;CH4 has 100X the heating potential of CO2 but over the longer term of a century, that drops to 25X.&nbsp;</p><p>Would abrupt release of a large amount of CH4 create a jump in average temperature of 1-2C? What would the impact of that be? How would it amplify other feedbacks and with what consequences for humanity, give that the effect is temporary?</p><p>Your report could address those questions with more interest than it does.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "sctdhTLfJtvJyEzHY", "user": {"username": "Noah Scales"}}, {"_id": "hpdzaArdoh5oEGMcv", "postedAt": "2022-10-10T20:57:04.614Z", "postId": "BvNxD66sLeAT8u9Lv", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi John,</p><p>I would appreciate your thoughts on the shape of the relationship between existential risk due to climate change and global warming.
