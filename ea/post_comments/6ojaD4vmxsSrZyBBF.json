At the very least between the Ombudsman and the Future Commission. They would both serve as checks. I think (and am not sure whether the others in the project would agree with this), we do not need to think about all of these as a package. If I could wave a magic wand and implement a set of institutional changes, I would likely be in favour of a different package. Instead, we've recommended things that fit well together where we would be incredibly pleased if one or two would be implemented. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>One of the main things we're doing now is thinking about how to get to implementation of these recommendations. My view is that we need to keep building a coalition with other organisations (e.g. environment-focused think tanks). On top of this, we need to keep finding allies among the MPs. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I think that's a great idea! We'll likely spend the next few months taking a step back and deciding on how we're gonna be pushing for our recommendations. One really simple communications tactic would likely be to do some polling. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n", "parentCommentId": "Ws5i2wD6dojPBuQuY", "user": {"username": "MarkusAnderljung"}}, {"_id": "m8cB67qc4HbgnezzX", "postedAt": "2018-08-09T08:47:59.787Z", "postId": "6ojaD4vmxsSrZyBBF", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks, David! </p>\n<p>I have not, though <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322878298_Representation_of_Future_Generations_in_United_Kingdom_Policy-Making?enrichId=rgreq-79f44f7cfcc10baafa63d26e50543351-XXX&amp;enrichSource=Y292ZXJQYWdlOzMyMjg3ODI5ODtBUzo1OTIxMzA3Mjg4MjA3MzZAMTUxODE4NjM3NTIzMQ%3D%3D&amp;el=1_x_2&amp;_esc=publicationCoverPdf\">Jones et al 2018</a> has (this is the paper written by the same people who worked to set up the APPG in the UK). They say of the Read proposal that &quot;We encountered several ideas which we do not include above, for various reasons. One of these is the proposal for a \u201cthird house of parliament\u201d, or \u201cGuardians\u201d, made by Rupert Read (Read 2012). Under Read\u2019s proposal these Guardians, appointed randomly amongst citizens on the same principle as juries, would have the power to (a) veto new legislation that threatened the basic needs and fundamental interests of future people, and (b) force a review of any existing legislation that threatens such needs and interests. He also suggests similar structures within local governments. As we found previously, institutions with veto powers did not last long, and as such we do not think this \u201cthird house of parliament\u201d would be workable. In addition, we share concerns raised by Michael Bartlet about the proposed method of selection by lot (Bartlet, 2012).&quot;</p>\n<p>To give some context on veto powers not lasting long, the Hungarian Commissioner was removed with four years and the Israeli commissioner lasted about five years. Both of these had quite strong powers that they actually used, which seems to have made them politically controversial and had them removed after the next election. </p>\n<p>Another crucial point here is what types of policies you think are going to be most impactful to work on. If you want to focus on environmental issues, I can see the allure of institutions that are given a lot of power. The bottleneck is not agenda-setting but rather closer to the right bills not being voted through. If you're more concerned about other GCRs, institutions or tweaks focusing on agenda-setting will be more interesting, such as the APPG. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "toY5eNCssALJKq6Ls", "user": {"username": "MarkusAnderljung"}}, {"_id": "YcjmKiCT68oFq8XWm", "postedAt": "2018-08-09T23:50:32.857Z", "postId": "6ojaD4vmxsSrZyBBF", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for your replies. </p>\n<p>[Warning: musings ahead.]</p>\n<p>Re your reply on 2, I found it interesting that overall you seem focused on working with *insiders8  --- people already quite involved and invested in the political system --- rather than aiming for uptake in the population at large, and then to use that as leverage on politicians (which is what I had been musing about when thinking about how to cause political change).
