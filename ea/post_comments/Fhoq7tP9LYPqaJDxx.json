Similar to findings previously reported by <a href=\"https://perma.cc/L6E9-F4WJ\">Waldhorn (2019</a>; see also <a href=\"https://perma.cc/2RXZ-6TDR\">Waldhorn et al., 2020</a>), these studies concluded that there is substantial, although limited, evidence that decapods might be sentient.</p></blockquote><p>For this information about the pain experience of shrimp to even be relevant, you must first argue that ability to feel pain necessitates having moral value. I strongly disagree with this point. I believe it is the social relations between thinking beings that is the basis of morality.</p>", "parentCommentId": "8qRa8GhXeDXfpFF2r", "user": {"username": "brighter_future"}}, {"_id": "wvAioMK9cCycavnAg", "postedAt": "2023-12-22T20:58:35.355Z", "postId": "Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx", "htmlBody": "<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wPiPg8qTAuoTKbzzA/new-trolley-problem\">Here's my take on this issue. </a>I think that mistaking pain sensation for moral worth is a big problem, and leading to significant moral costs in our community. I believe that we need to reevaluate what neural structure &amp; function (or other compute substrate) qualifies for moral worth, and to what degree. This should be an empirical study of the physical properties of the system, as well as a philosophical discussion over what attributes matter.</p><p>As a starting point, I suggest we use the presence of a social contract between sapient beings capable of verbally communicating preferences.

In the lack of any sort of abstract communication, I think we should be extremely suspicious of the entity involved having sufficient computational complexity to have moral worth.</p>", "parentCommentId": "NGhMCDevyza7BMfgm", "user": {"username": "brighter_future"}}]
