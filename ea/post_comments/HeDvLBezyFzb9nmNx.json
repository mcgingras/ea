Thanks for the great question! There are several government actors, like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dtra.mil/\"><u>DTRA</u></a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://minerva.defense.gov/Research/Research-Priorities/\"><u>Minerva Research Initiative</u></a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stratcom.mil/Academic-Alliance/USSTRATCOM-Academic-Alliance/\"><u>STRATCOM Academic Alliance</u></a>, that play an important role in the non-governmental nuclear security space, including with funding. Then there are the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/national-laboratories\"><u>National Labs</u></a> as well as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federally_funded_research_and_development_centers\"><u>FFRDCs</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_Affiliated_Research_Center\"><u>UARCs</u></a> that receive government funding and often work on relevant issues. Then there are defense contractors that will provide funding to think tanks and organizations that just so happen to support the latest weapons systems.&nbsp;</p><p>But that funding isn\u2019t really optimized for reducing risk from nuclear weapons. I also think it isn\u2019t (as some advocates would have us believe) the evil plans of crazy war-mongers. Rather, it\u2019s just bureaucratic actors pursuing their bureaucratic incentives, and the result is kind of muddled work that mostly just supports programs of record and the conventional wisdom.&nbsp;</p><p>So I think that\u2019s where private philanthropy can really do a lot of good. I really like this quote from the recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/4/23819209/nuclear-war-philanthropies-oppenheimer-united-states-china-russia-cold-war-existential-risk\"><u>Vox</u></a> piece that Matt Gentzel and I wrote:</p><blockquote><p>As James Scouras, a senior expert on the risk of nuclear war at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory recently wrote in response to the<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Sops0AM_kTvsKEHnFmwSCbI3pufTujOI9kjUxyDHvQY/edit#heading=h.wvh8mrk9otqr\"><u> Founders Pledge report</u></a>, philanthropy can help challenge \u201cunimaginative, even wrongheaded and dangerous, government policies.\u201d Nuclear risk, he writes, is \u201cfar too important to leave to the generals.\u201d&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>also:</p><blockquote><p>Philanthropists can devote resources to policy interventions intended to bear fruit beyond the current election cycle and to protect people regardless of what side of an international border they\u2019re on. Without careful philanthropy, policy influence outside government becomes a contest between defense industry lobbying and under-informed activism.</p></blockquote><p>This is the part that I think is in a sorry state. The MacArthur Foundation \u2014 previously the biggest funder in nuclear security \u2014 withdrew what amounted to about 32% of the field\u2019s total funding, distributing the final grants this year. That leaves the field with funding somewhere around $30-$40 million a year. (The exact numbers here are less important than the order of magnitude \u2014 compare it to the numbers on any other major global problem, or even to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://screenrant.com/oppenheimer-movie-christopher-nolan-genre-trick-exciting/\"><u>$100 million budget of the Oppenheimer movie</u></a>). This is all happening against the background of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/07/28/nuclear-experts-russia-war-00108438\"><u>aging field and small talent pipeline</u></a>, as well as new risks on the horizon (like China potentially quadrupling its arsenal). Then within that, the large funders are fairly homogenous in their worldviews,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/research/philanthropy-to-the-right-of-boom\"><u>leading some very important issues to be doubly neglected</u></a>.</p><p>I think there\u2019s a general perception that nuclear security is highly professionalized and well-funded compared to other global catastrophic risks, and that had been&nbsp;<i>partly</i> true for a long time. For various reasons, I wouldn\u2019t argue that nuclear security should receive more funding than biosecurity and risks from transformative technologies, for example. But we\u2019re now in a place where a single wealthy donor could double the philanthropy on nuclear issues, and yet no one has stepped in! So all the changes to the risk landscape are going un-studied and I think we will look back with regret if this funding does not increase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hope this answers your question!</p>", "parentCommentId": "DqMyFaEibevjowWtf", "user": {"username": "christian.r"}}, {"_id": "7FXZhLAyjtMA3jveN", "postedAt": "2023-09-29T14:51:45.861Z", "postId": "HeDvLBezyFzb9nmNx", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for the question, Johannes! My best elevator pitch is roughly an ITN case that starts with neglectedness:</p><p>The biggest funder in nuclear security just withdrew from the field, leaving only ~$32 million/year in philanthropic funding.

This is a huge blow to a field that's already small and aging, and would leave defense contractors and bureaucrats to determine nuclear policy. But it's also an opportunity to reshape the field for the better to deal with new challenges: unravelling arms control agreements, emerging technologies and new weapons systems, and a new world where there are three nuclear superpowers (two of them revisionist authoritarian states). Best of all, there are cheap funding opportunities! For example, $500,000 lets you <i>triple</i> the number of backchannel diplomatic exchanges between the U.S. and China on strategic nuclear issues.
