I'll mainly speak to our (Impact Academy) approach to impact evaluation but I'll also share my impressions with the general landscape.<br><br>Our primary metric (*counter-factual* expected career contributions) explicitly attempts to take this into account. To give an example of how we roughly evaluate the impact:&nbsp;<br><br>Take an imaginary fellow, Alice. Before the intervention, based on our surveys and initial interactions, we expected that she may have an impactful career, but that she is unlikely to pursue a priority path based on IA principles. We rate her Expected Career Contribution (ECC) to be 2. After the program, based on surveys and interactions, we rate her as 10 (ECC) because we have seen that she\u2019s now applying for a full-time junior role in a priority path guided by impartial altruism. We also asked her (and ourselves) to what extent that change was due to IA and estimate that to be 10%. To get our final Counterfactual Expected Career Contribution (CECC) for Alice, we subtract her initial ECC score of 2 from her final score of 10 to get 8, then multiply that score by 0.1 to get the portion of the expected career contribution which we believe we are responsible for. The final score is 0.8 CECC. As an formula: 10 (ECC after the program) - 2 (ECC before the program) * 0.1 (our counterfactual influence) = 0.8 CECC.<br><br>You can read more here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pb1HeD362xX8UtInJtl7gaKNKYCDsfCybcoAdrWijWM/edit#heading=h.vqlyvfwc0v22<br><br>I have the sense that other orgs are quite careful about this too. E.g., 80,000hours seems to think that they only caused a relatively modest amount of significant career changes because they discovered that the people had updated significantly due to reasons not related to 80,000hours.<br><br>&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "tCRtAmacgcgFYuL4W", "user": {"username": "SebastianSchmidt"}}]
