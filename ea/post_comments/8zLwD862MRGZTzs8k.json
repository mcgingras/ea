I maintain the fact that the timeframe doesn\u2019t help him, as the apology is so clearly motivated by the threat of bad PR surfacing 26 years later, but the timeframe itself doesn\u2019t make it inadequate.</p>\n<p>The content of Bostrom\u2019s statement informs my position here, where he expects people to believe that he didn\u2019t endorse the position <em>even then</em>\u2026 I don\u2019t need to explain this.</p>\n<p>My view is not: Bostrom\u2019s statement was inadequate purely because it came 26 years later.</p>\n<p>In the case of the 26-year-later apology, the timeframe is salient to me because it represents the point at which Bostrom realised the risk that he might be exposed.</p>\n<p>This compromises how seriously I take the apology.</p>\n<p>If you found my OP unclear, I apologise, but stand by its content - I make it clear at the end that I think he could\u2019ve apologised successfully 26 years later, but this wasn\u2019t the solution. My post was originally motivated by finding the apology ultimately unsatisfactory (which I still do), and I remain angry with Bostrom for reasons I consider legitimate.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "RomJwxXsMNqhwnhdE", "user": null}, {"_id": "Lcs2HBZquMHZQGkwr", "postedAt": "2023-01-14T09:32:09.134Z", "postId": "8zLwD862MRGZTzs8k", "htmlBody": "<p>But true racists are essentialists!
