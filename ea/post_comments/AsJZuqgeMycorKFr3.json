(2009)</a> which asked sufferers, ex-sufferers and never-sufferers of depression to rate the badness of different levels of depression. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WEWMzwGzPtRarLOyeTEVqlNAUSexQBajA_B03nVCrmY/edit?usp=sharing\">My analysis</a> of the data suggests that sufferers rate depression to be approximately 20% worse than a typical person would. Interestingly, this phenomenon of rating your own condition worse than others would does not seem to hold for most health conditions (see <a href=\"https://cdn.who.int/media/docs/default-source/gho-documents/global-health-estimates/ghe2019_daly-methods.pdf\">Pyne et al., 2009</a>).</p><p>I also tried to model the DALY burden that comes from the additional suicide risk associated with depression, and reached an estimate of 0.066 DALYs for each year of depression.

The idea of explicitly adding in suicide risk is an interesting direction for the analysis, it sounds like good work. When you publish your paper, I'll be interested to consider whether the underlying estimates of the badness of depression (perhaps implicitly) already reflect the suicide angle.</p><p>At some point it might be useful to do a more careful compare and contrast between your method (using Pyne et al's paper) and our method (using the Sanderson paper).
