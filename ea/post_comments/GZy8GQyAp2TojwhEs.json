However, my guess is that you would get way more responses if you did a smaller e.g. 15 min survey even it had no monetary incentive. I also wonder whether the responses would be more accurate, because 90 min is so much time that people may start to give inaccurate responses. Alternatively, assuming I am not unusually slow, people may give rushed responses in order to finish the survey in 90 min.</p><p>In general, I also felt like many questions were overly similar. I appreciate some of this may be needed for internal validity purposes, but I would say the trade-off as the survey stands is not great.</p><p>Sorry if my comments come across as harsh.

It allowed us to examine the response quality and ensure the consistency and validity of our measures, aligning with well-established findings in relevant literature.</p>\n<p>This survey marks our initial foray into this research area.
