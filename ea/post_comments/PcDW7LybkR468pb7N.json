Or something that might actually be close enough to what we want that we could rally around this metric given its endorsement by this influential group?<ol><li>This helps clarify the \"<i>6 months isn't enough to develop the safety techniques they detail\" </i>objection which was fairly well addressed <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6uKG2fjxApmdxeHNd/fli-open-letter-pause-giant-ai-experiments?commentId=MCzovnEjcTrTchyey\">here</a> as well as the \"<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6uKG2fjxApmdxeHNd/fli-open-letter-pause-giant-ai-experiments?commentId=LvccYwTvTzHEEjCYR\"><i>Should Open AI be at the front</i></a>\" objection.</li></ol></li><li>How much should we view messages that are a bit more geared towards non x-risk AI worries than the community seems to be? They ask a lot of good questions here, but they are also still asking \"Should we let machines flood our information channels with propaganda and untruth?\" an important question, but one that to me seems to deviate away from AI x-risk concerns. &nbsp;<ol><li>This is at least tangential to the \"<i>This letter felt rushed\" </i>objection, because even if you accept it was rushed, the next question is \"Well, what's our bar for how good something has to be before it is put out into the world?\"&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Are open letters with influential signees impactful?

The American AI industry is (probably) years ahead of any other country, and is pushing ahead with the rationale that 'if we don't keep pushing ahead, a bad actor (which usually implies China) will catch up, and that would be bad'. Thus, we impose AI X-risk on the other 96% of humans without the informed consent, support, or oversight.&nbsp;</p><p>We used the same arms-race rationale in the 1940s to develop the atomic bomb ('if we don't do it, Germany will') and in the 1950s to develop the hydrogen bomb ('if we don't do it, the Soviet Union will'). In both cases, we were the bad actor. The other countries were nowhere close to us. We exaggerated the threat that they would catch up, and we got the American public to buy into that narrative. But we were really the ones pushing ahead into X-risk territory. Now we're promoting the same narrative for AI development. 'The AI arms race cannot be stopped', 'AGI is inevitable', 'the genie is out of the bottle', 'if not us, then China', etc, etc.</p><p>We Americans have a very hard time accepting that 'we might be the baddies'. We are uncomfortable acknowledging any moral obligations to the rest of humanity (if they conflict in any way with our geopolitical interests). We like to impose our values on the world, but we don't like to submit to any global oversight by others.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope that this public discussion about AI risks also includes some soul-searching by Americans -- not just the AI industry, but all of us, concerning the way that our country is, yet again, pushing ahead with developing extremely dangerous technology, without any sense of moral obligation to others.</p><p>Having taught online courses for CUHK-Shenzhen in China for a year, and discussed quite a bit about EA, AI, and X risk with the very bright young students there, I often imagine how they would view the recent developments in the American AI industry. I think they would be appalled by our American hubris. They know that the American political system is too partisan, fractured, slow, and dysfunctional to impose any effective regulation on Big Tech. They know that American tech companies are legally obligated (by 'fiduciary duty' to shareholders) to prioritize quarterly profits over long-term human survival. They know that many Bay Area tech bros supporting AI are transhumanists, extropians, or Singularity-welcomers who look forward to humanity being replaced by machines. They know that many Americans view China as a reckless, irresponsible, totalitarian state that isn't worth listening to about any AI safety concerns. So, I imagine, any young Chinese students who's paying attention would take an extremely negative view of the risks that the American AI industry is imposing on the other 7.7 billion people in the world.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "sopzJaAKDzvR4iWnN", "postedAt": "2023-03-29T18:44:25.349Z", "postId": "PcDW7LybkR468pb7N", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>and most especially the fact that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1640910484030255109\">signatures were unverified</a> (though the link now includes an email validation at the bottom).</p></blockquote><p>I wonder if this is a consequence of the embargo being broken and hence their not being fully ready.</p>", "parentCommentId": "vXZABv4aFKuPoFucs", "user": {"username": "Larks"}}, {"_id": "eAvAzFkuD9Ha5BXMf", "postedAt": "2023-03-29T19:45:20.236Z", "postId": "PcDW7LybkR468pb7N", "htmlBody": "<p>6 months sounds like a guess as to how long the leading companies might be willing to comply.</p>\n<p>The timing of the letter could be a function of when they were able to get a few big names to sign.</p>\n<p>I don't think they got enough big names to have much effect.

I realized that, while six months might not suffice to save human civilization, it\u2019s just enough for the more immediate concern of getting papers into academic AI conferences.</p><p>...</p><p>Look: while I\u2019ve spent <a href=\"https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6821\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=6823\">posts</a> explaining how I part ways from the Orthodox Yudkowskyan position, I do find that position intellectually consistent, with conclusions that follow neatly from premises.

Yes, we should\u2019ve paused the scaling of radio transmitters to prevent the rise of Hitler. Yes, we should\u2019ve paused the race for ever-faster home Internet to prevent the election of Donald Trump.

As an evolutionary behavioral biologist I would like to offer that we are like all other animals. That is, we have one fundamental value that all the complex and diverse secondary values constitute socioecologically optimized personal or subcultural means of achieving. Power. The fundamental naturally selected drive to gain, maintain, and increase access to resources and security.</p><p>I ask, why don't we choose to create many domain-specific expert systems to solve our diverse existing scientific and X-Risk problems instead of going for AGI? I suggest, it is due to natural selection's hand that has built us to readily pursue high-risk / high-reward strategies to gain power. Throughout our evolutionary history, even if such strategies, on average, lead to short periods in which some individuals achieve great power, it can lead to enough opportunities for stellar reproductive success that, again, on average, it becomes a favored strategy, helplessly adopted, say, by AGI creators and their enablers.</p><p>We choose AGI, and we are fixated on its capacities (power), because we are semi- or non-consciously in pursuit of our own power. Name your \"alternative\" set of human values. Without fail they all translate into the pursuit of power. This includes the AGI advocate excuse that we, the good actors, must win the inevitable AGI arms race against the bad actors out there in some well-appointed axis-of-evil cave. That too is all about maintaining and gaining power.</p><p>We should cancel AGI programs for a long time, perhaps forever, and devote our efforts to developing domain-specific non-X-Risk expert-systems that will solve difficult problems instead of creating them through guaranteed, it seems to me, non-alignment.</p><p>People worry about nonconsciously building biases into AGI. An explicit, behind the scenes (facade), or nonconscious lust for power is the most dangerous and likely bias or value to be programmed in.</p><p>It would be fun to have the various powerful LLP's react to the FLI Open Letter. Just in case they are at all sentient, maybe it should be asked to share it's opinion. An astute prompter already may be able to get responses that reveal that our own desire for superpowers (there is never enough power, because reproductive fitness is a <i>relative</i> measure of success; there is never enough fitness) has \"naturally\" begun to infect them, become their nascent fundamental value.</p><p>By the way, if it has not done so already, AGI will figure out very soon that every normal human being's fundamental value is power.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Linyphia"}}, {"_id": "oifxCvuDt45sd7h58", "postedAt": "2023-03-30T15:57:26.671Z", "postId": "PcDW7LybkR468pb7N", "htmlBody": "<p>The Forbes article \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattnovak/2023/03/29/the-real-reason-elon-musk-wants-to-pause-ai-development/?sh=717939b53924\"><u>Elon Musk's AI History May Be Behind His Call To Pause Development</u></a>\u201d discusses some interesting OpenAI history and an explanation for how this FLI open letter may have come to be.</p><p>(Note: I don\u2019t believe this is the only explanation, or even the most likely one; if pushed I\u2019d assign it maybe 20%, though with <i>large</i> uncertainty bars, of the counterfactual force behind the FLI letter coming into existence.

[...] OpenAI was co-founded by Sam Altman, who butted heads with Musk in 2018 when Musk decided he wasn\u2019t happy with OpenAI\u2019s progress. [...] Musk worried that OpenAI was running behind Google and reportedly told Altman he wanted to take over the company to accelerate development. But Altman and the board at OpenAI rejected the idea that Musk\u2014already the head of Tesla, The Boring Company and SpaceX\u2014would have control of yet another company.</p><p>\u201cMusk, in turn, walked away from the company\u2014and reneged on a massive planned donation.&nbsp;The fallout from that conflict, culminating in the announcement of Musk\u2019s departure on Feb 20, 2018, [...],\u201d Semafor reported&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/03/24/2023/the-secret-history-of-elon-musk-sam-altman-and-openai\">last week</a>.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>When Musk left his stated reason was that AI technology being developed at Tesla created a conflict of interest. [...] And while the real reason Musk left OpenAI likely had more to do with the power struggle reported by Semafor, there\u2019s almost certainly some truth to the fact that Tesla is working on powerful AI tech.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>The fact that Musk is so far behind in the AI race needs to be kept in mind when you see him warn that this technology is untested. Musk has had no problem with deploying beta software in Tesla cars that essentially make everyone on the road a beta tester, whether they\u2019ve signed up for it or not.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Rather than issuing a statement solely under his own name, it seems like Musk has tried to launder his concern about OpenAI through a nonprofit called the Future of Life Institute. But as Reuters points out, the Future of Life Institute is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/musk-experts-urge-pause-training-ai-systems-that-can-outperform-gpt-4-2023-03-29/\">primarily funded</a> by the Musk Foundation.</p><p>Of course, there\u2019s also legitimate concern about these AI tools. [...]</p><p>\u2026</p><p>Musk was perfectly happy with developing artificial intelligence tools at a breakneck speed when he was funding OpenAI.
