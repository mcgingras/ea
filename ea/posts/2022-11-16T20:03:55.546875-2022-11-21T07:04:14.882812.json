Around 84% of the burden is health related, while 16% is economic in nature.</li><li>Neglectedness: Whatever governments/charities/businesses are doing to solve this problem (e.g. labelling laws/providing low sodium food in food banks/developing new hypertension drugs) may be making a difference, since age-standardized DALYs lost are falling, but (a) attribution is hard, and structural factors (e.g. more educated populations eating and exercising better, or economic development expanding access to healthcare) will also be behind the decline; and (b) all this is&nbsp;<strong>insufficient&nbsp;</strong>all the same, with population growth and ageing driving an increase in DALYs lost over time for the coming decades.</li><li>Tractability: A&nbsp;<strong>moderately tractable solution</strong> in the form of sodium taxes is available. This is highly effective if and when implemented, but there is of course considerably uncertainty as to whether advocacy for taxes on food \u2013 which are highly unpopular \u2013 can succeed.</li></ul><p>Further Discussion</p><ul><li>This is a highly promising cause area that CEARCH will be conducting deeper research into, but it is important to note that early stage CEAs tend to be overoptimistic, and it is likely that this initial x300 GiveWell estimate will be revised downwards after more research and greater scrutiny, possibly extremely substantially (e.g. a one or two magnitude downgrade in cost-effectiveness).</li><li>DALYs lost to hypertension have grown tremendously (43.5%) from 1990 to 2015, and it is certainly not just a rich world problem \u2013 over that same period, DALYs lost to hypertension in LMICs exploded (45% increase in high-middle income countries, 72% increase in middle income countries, 94% in low-middle income countries, and 86% in low income countries); and of the large countries, Bangladesh notably saw a fairly staggering near-tripling of DALYs lost.</li><li>Growth in DALYs lost is driven not just by population growth and ageing, but also by urbanization and corresponding lifestyle changes (e.g. excessive dietary sodium, stress, sedentary lifestyle etc).</li><li>Note that the analysis here does not model income effects from the tax (i.e. reduced purchasing power causing less consumption of healthy food) or substitution effects, whether positive (e.g. reducing sugar and fat consumption from food \u2013 such as junk food \u2013 that is high in not just salt but also sugar and fat) or negative (i.e. causing people to switch to low-salt high-sugar food or drinks); the analysis here also does not model the impact of industry reformulating food products in response to a sodium tax. My sense is that these balance out to some extent, but it is very hard to say.</li><li>There is extremely high uncertainty over the calculations over how the problem will grow or shrink in the coming decades. This is certainly an area where expert advice and expert epidemiological modelling would be extremely valuable, and is something that CEARCH will pursue at deeper research stages.</li><li>We underestimate the economic burden insofar as it focuses on the burden from hypertension (i.e. SBP of &gt; 140 mm Hg) even though high systolic blood pressure (i.e. SBP of &gt; 110-115 mm Hg) has adverse health consequences and presumably negative economic effects as well.</li><li>The estimate of the degree to which an average 1 mg reduction in sodium consumption reduces incidence of high systolic blood pressure in a single country and hence the global disease burden of hypertension, relies on an extremely long and complicated chain of calculations \u2013 there is hence a high degree of uncertainty here.</li><li>I do not model the cost of the tax in terms of reduced freedom of choice, because the disvalue of reduced freedom typically ends up as a rounding error in CEAs of policy interventions \u2013 except in cases where we're considering banning consumption altogether; there freedom of choice tends to outweigh the remaining marginal health benefits not yet already captured by high taxes.</li><li>Further, I do not model the cost of the tax in terms of reduced pleasure/subjective well-being from less eating of saltier (and presumably tastier) food \u2013 on the presumption that excessive consumption of sodium leads to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/of-all-the-flavors-in-the-world-we-choose-salty-and-thats-not-good-2017052511732\"><u>desensitization</u></a>, while a reduction reverses such desensitization (parallel to how fruits taste sweeter after artificial sugars are cut out from a diet). Hence, there is no real counterfactual loss in subjective well-being expected from the sodium tax and the consequent dietary changes.</li><li>Intensely promising results are driven by heavily discounting the value of the average government's spending relative to EA funding, but even if this were not the case, the intervention would still be in the range of one magnitude more cost-effective than top GiveWell charities \u2013 not particularly surprising, for low-probability but high-impact policy interventions.</li><li>Results are also sensitive to the number of years a charity will be operating in a single country (until it either succeeds or concludes that it has failed).</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>Expected Benefit: Improved Health from Eliminating Hypertension</u></strong></h1><p>The primary expected benefit from eliminating hypertension is improved health, in terms of fewer deaths as well as less disability and suffering. Overall, around&nbsp;<strong>1.08 * 10<sup>10</sup> DALYs</strong> are at stake here, with this benefit is modelled in the following way.</p><p><strong><u>Moral Weights &amp; Scale</u></strong>: Hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure of &gt;140 mm Hg, but high systolic blood pressure of even &gt; 110-115 mm Hg is detrimental to health, and the overall expected disease burden for 2023 \u2013 using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/\"><u>2019 figures</u></a> as a baseline and projecting forward using a multivariate regression model \u2013 is around&nbsp;<strong>2.43 * 10<sup>8</sup> DALYs</strong>. The modelling will be discussed in greater detail subsequently.</p><p><strong><u>Persistence</u></strong>: The problem of high systolic blood pressure is likely to persist, and eliminating it will bring benefits not just for one year but across multiple years. In terms of how this multi-year benefit is calculated:</p><p>Firstly, I discount for the probability of our solution not persisting (i.e. a sodium tax being reversed). There are few instances of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32561920/\"><u>existing taxes on sodium</u></a>, and the few that exist have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/9789240049543\"><u>not&nbsp;</u></a>been reversed, yielding a 0% reversal rate \u2013 which will be inaccurate, not just because there is a priori at least some chance of reversal, but also because this probability could be fairly high given the unpopularity of food taxes. Instead, I look at the rate of policy reversal on sugary drinks as a proxy of probable reversal on a potential sodium tax, by taking the country-years in which repeal occurred and dividing by the country-years in which the tax existed and repealed could have occurred (whether or not it did). This yields a reversal rate of 0.4% per annum.</p><p>Secondly, I model the proportion of disease burden remaining after being counterfactually solved (i.e. hypertension declining due to the intervention of other actors or else due to structural changes). In fact, unlike most other problems CEARCH has examined, high systolic blood pressure as a problem is likely to grow, at least for some time. To model such growth and the problem subsequently fading away, and on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2596292\"><u>understanding</u></a> that total DALYs lost is a function of age-standardized DALYs lost per capita, population size as well as population age, I:</p><ol><li>Regress DALYs from 1990-2019 on age-standardized DALYs lost per capita, population and median age to estimate the relevant linear coefficients.</li><li>Use projected future age-standardized DALYs lost per capita, projected future population, projected future median age and the relevant linear coefficients to project future DALYs lost; and</li><li>Calculate the size of the disease burden for each year from 2023 to 2089 (after which the disease burden finally shrinks to zero) relative to the 2023 baseline.</li></ol><p>Conceptually, the role of agents (e.g. governments, charities and businesses) in solving the problem is accounted for via the variable of age-standardized DALYs lost per capita, since anything these agents do to solve the problem (e.g. governments expanding food labelling laws to discourage sodium consumption, or funding access to hypertension drugs; or charities ensuring that the food they distribute via food banks are low in sodium, or providing hypertension treatment in the nonprofit hospitals they run; or businesses doing their part, however little, like food companies reformulating food to appeal to health-conscious consumers, or pharmaceutical companies developing new hypertension drugs to meet market demand), will affect the extent of hypertension in an age-standardized population and the extent to which such hypertension translates to actual death, disability or suffering. To the extent that such efforts by agents to combat the problem is increasingly (or decreasingly) successful over time, that shows up in a decline (or increase) in age-standardized DALYs lost per capita.</p><p>Meanwhile, in terms of the role of structural factors \u2013 obviously, demographic variables are accounted for through population size and age structure, but cultural and economic factors are also accounted for, through the variable of age-standardized DALYs lost per capita. To the extent that cultural trends affects hypertension DALYs (e.g. as the world becomes increasingly educated, eating/exercise habits improve), and to the extent that economic trends do the same (e.g. as the world gets richer, access to healthcare improves, as does improving technology increases the effectiveness of frontier healthcare treatment for hypertension), that shows up as a decline (or increase) in age-standardized DALYs lost per capita.</p><p>The projected growth and eventual decline of DALYS lost due to high blood pressure given counterfactual solution, is shown in&nbsp;<strong>Diagram 1</strong>.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/G3DJ2qsZiZjdvmgSv/bvvylvcwu6t5gxnhbihf\"></p><p><strong>Diagram 1</strong>: Remaining DALYs lost to high blood pressure after counterfactual solution</p><p>Thirdly, I discount for the probability of the world being destroyed anyway (i.e. general existential risk discount). Here, I take into account the probability of total nuclear annihilation, since the benefits of saving people from death from hypertension in one year is nullified if they had already died in a previous year. For the exact risk of total nuclear annihilation, I take it to be one magnitude lower than the risk of nuclear war itself, since nuclear war may not kill everyone. For the probability of nuclear war, I use the various estimates on the probability of nuclear war per annum collated by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KJNrGbt3JWcYeifLk/p/PAYa6on5gJKwAywrF\"><u>Luisa</u></a>, but with accidental nuclear war factored in, and then calculate a weighted average that significantly favours the superforecasters. The reason for this is that (a) the estimate of the probability of intentional nuclear war based on historical frequency is likely biased upwards due to historical use being in a MAD-free context; (b) the probability of accidental nuclear war based on historical close calls is highly uncertain due to the difficulty of translating close calls to actual probabilities of eventual launch; and (c) experts are notoriously bad at long-range forecasts, relative to superforecasters. Meanwhile, I do not take into account other existential risks like supervolcano eruption and asteroid impact, since the chances of those occurring at all is very marginal per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Feeding-Everyone-Matter-What-Catastrophe/dp/0128044470\"><u>Denkenberger &amp; Pearce</u></a>, let alone the chances of such events killing everyone and not just most people. Overall, therefore, I treat the general existential risk discount to be just the risk of nuclear war but adjusted a magnitude down (i.e. 0.07% per annum).</p><p>Fourthly, I apply a broad uncertainty discount of 0.1% per annum to take into account the fact that there is a non-zero chance that in the future, the benefits or costs do not persist for factors we do not and cannot identify in the present (e.g. actors directing resources to solve the problem when none are currently doing so).</p><p>Overall, by taking the remaining DALYs lost to high blood pressure after counterfactual solution, and discounting each year's DALY burden using the other per annum discounts (i.e. solution reversal discount, existential risk discount, uncertainty discount), the total amount of DALYs available for a sodium tax to counterfactually avert is shown in&nbsp;<strong>Diagram 2</strong>.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/G3DJ2qsZiZjdvmgSv/hzuz2uj21nhxspccj1le\"></p><p><strong>Diagram 2</strong>: DALYs available for a sodium tax to counterfactually avert</p><p><strong><u>Value of Outcome</u></strong>: Overall, the raw perpetual value of improved health from eliminating hypertension is&nbsp;<strong>1.08 * 10<sup>10</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p><strong><u>Probability of Occurrence</u></strong>: Unlike longtermist problems, there is no uncertainty as to whether hypertension is a problem \u2013 indeed, in 2010, high blood pressure&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30398584/\"><u>emerged&nbsp;</u></a>as the leading single risk factor for the overall global burden of disease, surpassing diseases like diarrheal illness and pneumonia. Consequently, I assign a&nbsp;<strong>100% chance</strong> to hypertension being an actual problem that harms people.</p><p><strong><u>Expected Value</u></strong>: Hence, the expected value of improved health from eliminating hypertension is&nbsp;<strong>1.08 * 10<sup>10</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>Expected Benefit: Increased Economic Output</u></strong></h1><p>Beyond the health benefits, there are also economic benefits to eliminating hypertension. Around&nbsp; <strong>2 * 10<sup>9</sup> DALYs</strong> are at stake here, as calculated in the following manner.</p><p><strong><u>Moral Weights</u></strong>: I take the value of doubling consumption for one person for one year to be&nbsp;<strong>0.21 DALYs</strong>. This is calculated as a function of (a) the value of consumption relative to life from GiveWell's IDinsight survey of the community perspective, as adjusted for social desirability bias, and (b) CEARCH's estimate of the value of a full, healthy life in DALY terms. For more details, refer to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j67pOUpC5vhC1-H516PAj2-4Fvm5rxJhZNeBVav3kik/edit\"><u>CEARCH's evaluative framework</u></a>.</p><p><strong><u>Scale</u></strong>: I start by calculating the economic burden of hypertension relative to annual income per hypertension (i.e. SBP of &gt; 140 mm Hg) sufferer, using three separate estimates to do so.</p><p>The first estimate is Wierzejska et al's. I take this estimate of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7444692/\"><u>global cost per hypertension sufferer</u></a> (inclusive of both direct and indirect costs, where direct costs are costs related to treatment and care, while indirect costs are economic costs caused by decreased productivity and reduced labour hours from illness-induced absenteeism and premature deaths); then I divide through by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD\"><u>global GDP per capita</u></a> (using PPP given that is what the authors calculate, and also using the authors' year of calculation); and this yields an estimate of the economic burden of hypertension relative to annual income per hypertension sufferer.</p><p>The second estimate is Druss et al's. I take this estimate of US cost per hypertension sufferer, as a function of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/epdf/10.1377/hlthaff.20.6.233\"><u>total costs</u></a> divided by estimated number of sufferers (itself a function of population prevalence and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=US\"><u>US population</u></a>), and divide through by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=US\"><u>US GDP per capita</u></a> (using the year of data collection), to estimate the economic burden of hypertension relative to annual income per hypertension sufferer.</p><p>The third and final estimate is Cai et al's. I take this estimate of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-3156.2012.03087.x\"><u>Chinese cost per hypertension sufferer</u></a>, and divide through by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=CN\"><u>Chinese GDP per capita</u></a> (using the authors' year of calculation), to estimate the economic burden of hypertension relative to annual income per hypertension sufferer</p><p>In terms of how these three estimates of the economic burden of hypertension are weighed, I penalize Druss et al and Cai et al given that they are single country estimates, unlike&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7444692/\"><u>Wierzejska et al's</u></a> global, 15-country analysis. This in turn yields the degree of consumption doubling per hypertension sufferer if their hypertension is prevented. And factoring in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension\"><u>global number of hypertension sufferers</u></a>, we get 213 million doublings in consumption from hypertension being resolved.</p><p><strong><u>Persistence</u></strong>: The same per annum discounts and the same projections of the disease burden (and hence economic burden) over time, as discussed in the previous section, are used here as well.</p><p><strong><u>Value of Outcome</u></strong>: Overall, the raw perpetual value of increased economic output is&nbsp;<strong>2 * 10<sup>9</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p><strong><u>Probability of Occurrence</u></strong>: Same probability as before is applied.</p><p><strong><u>Expected Value</u></strong>: All in all, the expected value of increased economic output is&nbsp;<strong>2 * 10<sup>9</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>Tractability</u></strong></h1><p>To summarize our tractability findings: we can solve 0.00002 of the problem with a USD 137,000 investment into sodium tax policy advocacy, which means the proportion of the problem solved per additional USD 100,000 spent is around&nbsp;<strong>0.0000149</strong>.</p><p>A sodium tax is chosen over other potential interventions because: (a) as far as dietary factors go, control of sodium intake seems&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejm200101043440101\"><u>especially important</u></a> for healthy blood pressure levels; (b) as for other lifestyle interventions (e.g. exercise, reduction in life stress), there does not seem much that external agents can do to change things; and (c) medications, will by their nature be more expensive as an intervention than policy change. In terms of the specific structure of the sodium tax, I consider a tax calibrated to the level of salt content (a type of \u201cnutrient-specific\u201d tax) as these deliver the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002232&amp;type=printable\"><u>strongest results</u></a> in terms of reduced salt intake, largely due to their broad application. And in particular, the tax under consideration is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.exchangerates.org.uk/AUD-USD-spot-exchange-rates-history-2017.html\"><u>USD 0.23</u></a> (or AUD 0.3) per gram tax on sodium in excess of national health authorities' maximum recommended levels, excluding fresh fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy products, as based on what&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002232&amp;type=printable\"><u>Cobiac et al (2017)</u></a> modelled - thus avoiding what would be a political nonstarter (i.e. increasing taxes on basic foodstuffs).</p><p>In terms of the theory of change:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Lobby a government to implement a tax on sodium</li><li>Step 2: Sodium tax reduces average daily sodium consumption.</li><li>Step 3: The reduction in sodium consumption reduces incidence of high systolic blood pressure in that single country, and hence reduces the global disease burden of hypertension</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Step 1: To estimate the probability of successfully lobbying a government to implement a tax on sodium, I take both an outside and inside view.</p><p>For the outside view, I consult three reference classes.</p><p>The first reference class is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nephrothai.org/\"><u>Thai NGO's</u></a> long-running efforts in advocating for a sodium tax. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/jch.14147\"><u>Nephrology Society of Thailand</u></a> and its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.nationalhealth.or.th/pushing-for-a-policy-to-reduce-salt-consumption-to-lower-ncds/\"><u>Thai Low Salt Network</u></a> campaign seemed to have started pushing for a sodium tax as early as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.nationalhealth.or.th/pushing-for-a-policy-to-reduce-salt-consumption-to-lower-ncds/\"><u>2015</u></a>, and it appears that the tax was to be implemented in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kasikornresearch.com/en/analysis/k-social-media/Pages/Salt-FB-10-01-2022.aspx\"><u>2022</u></a>, before being&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationthailand.com/in-focus/40012547\"><u>delayed&nbsp;</u></a>in view of the weak economy. With the economy projected to grow&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/world-bank-forecasts-thai-gdp-growth-31-this-year-2022-09-27/\"><u>stronger</u></a>, with 4.1% GDP growth in 2023 vs 3.1% in 2022, we might expect the tax to be implemented in 2023, though of course there is considerable uncertainty, with this having been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1746589/tax-on-high-salt-content-dusted-off\"><u>planned before and going nowhere</u></a>. Hence, I assign only a 50% probability that the tax actually takes place in 2023.</p><p>The second reference class involves looking at countries that have introduced a sodium tax as a proportion of those that have a national salt reduction strategy.&nbsp; I take the number of governments that have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26201031/\"><u>implemented</u></a> a tax on sodium, and divide by the number of governments trying to reduce salt consumption; the latter indicates intra-government efforts to control salt, as a proxy for external efforts.</p><p>The third reference class is the probability of success for tobacco taxation lobbying efforts. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://3394c0c6-1f1a-4f86-a2db-df07ca1e24b2.filesusr.com/ugd/26c75f_2081c09f8f20405e89105ac88c01ec6d.pdf\"><u>data here</u></a>, as collected by Charity Entrepreneurship, is fairly comprehensive, and is relevant to the extent that this is another health policy intervention that involves lobbying governments to introduce or raise taxes on a consumption good.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of weighing the various reference classes to produce an average outside view estimate, it is important to note that all the reference classes have their flaws. The Thai NGO case study focuses on a single country and is hence potentially unrepresentative if there are country-specific factors that bias the estimates (e.g. political conditions are reasonably favourable towards the tax, which is why advocates managed to get it seriously considered and the government seems about to implement it). Meanwhile, the base rate analysis (i.e. sodium taxes introduced as a proportion of all national salt reduction strategies) is flawed because intra-government lobbying is not especially representative of external lobbying efforts - it skips the first step in any policy advocacy theory of change (i.e. securing internal champions for your position). Finally, for the tobacco taxation case study analysis \u2013 obviously, there is unrepresentativeness insofar as this is not about a sodium tax at all, and indeed, since tobacco is not seen as a luxury (and is not something literally everyone consumes), the success rate here likely overstates the probable success rate for equivalent lobbying in the salt case. Overall, these flaws balance out, and I weigh the three reference classes equally \u2013 yielding a probability of advocacy success of 12%.</p><p>For the inside view, I reason as follows. The fact that a salt tax polls at around 42.2% in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ucd.ie/nnsc/t4media/Perspectives%20of%20the%20public%20on%20reducing%20population%20salt%20intake%20in%20Ireland..pdf\"><u>Ireland&nbsp;</u></a>and that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/32063\"><u>Tonga</u></a> has imposed taxes on unhealthy food suggests that successfully advocating for a sodium tax is not extremely improbable (i.e. &lt;=10%). That said, the tax polling underwater and people raising concerns about the impact of such taxes on the poor suggests that successful advocacy is still fairly improbable, and I assign about a 17% chance that advocacy efforts are successful.</p><p>Overall, aggregating the outside and inside views, and giving more weight to the former given that the latter is subject to the usual worries about inferential uncertainty, this yields about a 13% chance of advocacy success.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Step 2: I rely on an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32561920/\"><u>external empirical estimate</u></a> to calculate the degree to which the sodium tax reduces average daily sodium consumption in mg. In particular, (a) Cobiac et al's (2017) modelling study shows that an A$ 0.30/g tax on sodium in excess of Australian maximum recommended levels, excluding fresh fruits, vegetables, meats and dairy products, reduced salt consumption by 67mg/day, while (b) Waterlander et al's (2019) experimental study shows that a NZ$ 0.02/100mg and NZ$ 0.04/100 mg tax lead to a 10.7g mean decrease in salt purchased weekly for a household (as averaged across both modelled taxes). To translate the latter into daily reduction in sodium consumption per person, I divide by the average NZ household size of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/els/family/47710686.pdf\"><u>2.65</u></a>, then divide by 7 days, and then factor out the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajae.12036\"><u>31.9%</u></a> of food that is purchased but not subsequently eaten. The Cobiac et al (2017) study has the flaw of inferential uncertainty, but the Waterlander et al (2019) study have the flaws of laboratory behaviour not necessarily translating to the real world, serious inferential uncertainty over translating reduced weekly household purchase of sodium in food to actual reduction in daily sodium consumption per person, and concerns over external validity (if the evaluated sodium tax is on sodium in excess of recommended levels while excluding conventionally healthy food) \u2013 hence, I penalize the latter by three magnitudes. Overall, I estimate that the sodium tax in question (USD 0.23/AUD 0.3 per gram of sodium) will reduce sodium consumption by 67.33 mg per day.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Step 3: To estimate the degree to which an average 1 mg reduction in sodium consumption reduces incidence of high systolic blood pressure in a single country and hence the global disease burden of hypertension, I rely on a baseline empirical estimate and an accompanying long chain of calculations.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/full/10.1161/01.HYP.35.2.544\"><u>He et al (2000)</u></a> found that a low sodium diet where urinary sodium excretion decreased by 33.3 mmol/24h saw a reduction of cumulative incidence of hypertension from 9.76% to 6.06%. With sodium having an atomic weight of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.angelo.edu/faculty/kboudrea/periodic/structure_mass.htm\"><u>22.98977 g/mol</u></a>, this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_(unit)\"><u>means</u></a> urinary sodium excretion decreased by\u202d 0.7655593\u202c g/24h.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030843/\"><u>93% of dietary sodium</u></a> is excreted by urine, so this means that the associated dietary reduction in sodium consumption was 0.8231821 g/24h. Meanwhile, the associated reduction in hypertension from baseline rates is given as 9.76% less 6.06% (i.e. 3.7%) divided by 9.76%, which is 37.91%. Taking the reduction in sodium consumption and the associated reduction in hypertension from baseline rates, this yields a reduction in hypertension from baseline rates of 0.0004605 per 1 mg reduction of daily sodium consumption, in the country where a sodium tax is advocated for and subsequently implemented. Taking that country to be average in population size (i.e. the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL\"><u>global population</u></a> divided by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/about-us\"><u>193 countries</u></a>), and assuming that reduction in hypertension and high systolic blood pressure not amounting to hypertension is proportional to each other, this yields the fraction of the total problem plaguing the global population, as solved by a 1 mg reduction in sodium consumption in a single country, to be 0.00000\u202d2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, the proportion of disease reduction from sodium tax policy advocacy to control hypertension \u2013 as a function of (a) the probability of success in persuading a government to pass a tax on sodium, (b) a sodium tax reducing sodium consumption in a country, and (c) reduced sodium consumption in a single country reducing the incidence of high systolic blood pressure in that country and hence the global disease burden of hypertension \u2013 is ultimately 0.00002.</p><p><br>Meanwhile, on the costing side, we have to be concerned with both the cost of advocacy (for a nonprofit working on the matter) and the cost of regulation (for the government).</p><p>To estimate the cost of advocacy, I take both an outside and inside view. For the outside view, I look at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.worldactiononsalt.com/\"><u>World Action on Salt, Sugar and Health (WASSH)</u></a>, which appears to be a decently successful and well-networked NGO working on salt (and sugar) reduction, and take its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://register-of-charities.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-search/-/charity-details/4000145\"><u>annual income in FY 2020-21</u></a> in GBP and multiply it by the average 2020 GBP-USD&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.exchangerates.org.uk/GBP-USD-spot-exchange-rates-history-2020.html\"><u>exchange rate</u></a>. Moreover, I assess that around 1 year of operations is a reasonable timeframe for the charity to lobby/prepare supporting research reports on the health and economics benefits of the tax/do public polling to show public support/construct a coalition of NGOs and advocates in support and hence succeed (in which case it can pivot to a different country) or judge that policymakers are just not receptive and that its efforts have failed (in which case it can pivot or else shutdown).</p><p>For the inside view \u2013 my sense is that this is doable by a 2 person EA charity in the style of Charity Entrepreneurship incubatees. I assume funding of around USD 50,000 per team member per annum, in line with past CE incubatee expenditures (covering not just salaries but other costs like office rental, lobbying expenditures etc), and again assume 1 year of operations, for reasons aforementioned.</p><p>In aggregating the outside and inside views of advocacy costs, I use equal weightage \u2013 while the inside view is subject to the usual worries over inferential uncertainties, an EA or EA-identified organization will almost certainly be more cost-effective than WASSH. Overall, this yields an expected cost of USD 123,000 for advocacy in a single country.</p><p>As for the cost of regulation \u2013 per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002232&amp;type=printable\"><u>Cobiac et al (2017)</u></a>, the cost of implementing new taxation and subsidy interventions for foods in Australia is upfront and about AUD 22 million per a 2009 estimate, in 2010 dollars, which translates to a one-time regulatory cost of \u202daround USD 0.93 per person given the size of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=AU\"><u>Australian population in 2009</u></a> as well as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.exchangerates.org.uk/AUD-USD-spot-exchange-rates-history-2010.html\"><u>exchange rate in 2010</u></a>.

Methods like randomized control trials (RCTs) were popularized to compare interventions, but they were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/09/trials\"><u>far from perfect</u></a>. Even with a singular standard\u2014save the most lives, or quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), per dollar\u2014EAs hotly debated which charities were most deserving of cash.&nbsp;</p><p>Today many other causes beyond global poverty are considered viable EA interventions. These interventions are extremely different from each other. Some are near-term; some are long-term; some are still measured in QALYs; some are based on the probability of human extinction. This means that already difficult resource allocation decisions have gotten much, much harder. In fact, I think that in today\u2019s EA landscape, making these resource allocation decisions requires abandoning some of the philosophical underpinnings of EA.</p><p>Revising the ethical backbone of a movement so deeply rooted in philosophy is scary and challenging. Most of you know all too well that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-goods/23451761/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-bankrupt-binance-bitcoin-alameda\"><u>Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s recent actions</u></a> have prompted the beginnings of a reckoning within the EA community. Although the news about FTX is timely, this post has little to do with Fried\u2014in fact I wrote it before FTX crashed. Instead of specifically reacting to that news, I seek to make the broader claim that long before crypto fortunes were bankrolling billion-dollar EA foundations, there was reason to change EA\u2019s dogma.</p><p>In this post, I claim that the maximalist \u201cdo the most good\u201d credo is no longer viable to sustain EA as a socio-political movement.&nbsp;<strong>Instead, I argue that \u201cdo a lot of good\u201d is a more logical and more effective rallying cry for modern EAs.</strong></p><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1><strong>Part 1: \u201cDo a lot of good\u201d is a&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>logical</strong></i><strong> rallying cry: The new quantification problem</strong></h1><p>The first part of this post is dedicated to showing that \u201cdo a lot of good\u201d is logical and in-line with EA\u2019s overall mission. This line of reasoning is not new. Holden Karnofsky recently&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/T975ydo3mx8onH3iS/ea-is-about-maximization-and-maximization-is-perilous\"><u>made the argument</u></a> that the EA community is better off jettisoning the maximizing principle and embracing more&nbsp;<i>moderation&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>pluralism</i>.</p><p>Let\u2019s dive in with a very old argument against maximization:</p><ol><li>Ought implies can.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefy0wf70du8wm\"><sup><a href=\"#fny0wf70du8wm\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Or, in other words, if an agent is morally required to perform some action, that action must be possible for the agent to perform.</li><li>So, in order to \u201cdo the most good\u201d, we must know what action contributes to the most good getting done.</li><li>It is impossible to know what action contributes to the most good.</li><li>Effective altruists should not always try to perform actions that do the most good, but instead perform actions that they can be reasonably sure do a lot of good.</li></ol><p>Premises 1-3 of this argument form the commonly articulated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/utilitas/article/epistemic-problem-does-not-refute-consequentialism/07062C7F906AFF983792EC85426DD8AB\"><u>epistemic problem with consequentialism</u></a>. Premise 4 is what I seek to prove in this section. However, before I get there, I\u2019d like to rehash and expand on some evidence for premise 3.</p><p>Early critiques of EA\u2019s global poverty strategy prompted skepticism that EA methodology could accurately determine what causes generate the most welfare per dollar. These critiques included problems with RCTs; the fact that EA ignored smaller, grassroots organizations and longitudinal data; and the argument that it is impossible to quantify quality human well-being. EAs, in large part at GiveWell, debated the legitimacy of these concerns. I do not need to rehash these debates to prove my point that deciding which cause(s) to focus on (tropical diseases or cash transfers or deworming or funding PSAs to go to the doctor) was extremely difficult, even with one, near-term, shared goal and decently trustworthy data.</p><p>Today, based on the content of this forum alone, it\u2019s clear that much of the EA community has expanded its goals beyond ending extreme poverty and preventable death from tropical diseases. Increasingly,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9Y6Y6qoAigRC7A8eX/my-take-on-what-we-owe-the-future\"><u>AI alignment</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/existential-risk\"><u>existential and/or extinction risk</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Geh9DFZQnj9s5HjoW/the-hundred-billion-dollar-opportunity-that-eas-mostly\"><u>U.S. foreign policy</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/united-states/\"><u>poverty relief in the U.S.</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23066877/carrick-flynn-effective-altruism-sam-bankman-fried-congress-house-election-2022\"><u>political campaigns</u></a>, and many other domains have garnered serious attention from EA.&nbsp;</p><p>Discussion around these topics is markedly different from early EA debate chiefly because it is less focused on measuring aggregate welfare increases per dollar. Faced with the decision to support, for example, extinction threats or animal welfare, you cannot perform a simple comparison of QALYs saved. There is no easy way to correlate the aggregate welfare increase brought about by a marginal increase in our asteroid deflection technology to that of saving 100,000,000 male chicks from being ground up at a factory farm. I came up with three main reasons why quantification is more difficult in today\u2019s EA cause landscape:</p><ol><li>Disparate causes do not necessarily share common metrics.</li><li>Longtermist outcomes are inherently difficult to measure.</li><li>Institutional change involves ripple effects that elude both prediction and causal determination.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>This list is not mutually exclusive. Comparing disparate causes (reason 1) is often difficult&nbsp;<i>because</i> it involves comparing a long term possibility to a near term certainly (reason 2) or comparing direct relief to institutional change (reason 3). Regardless, I\u2019d like to expand on each reason in turn.&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Lack of common metrics:</u></h3><p>Perhaps the best example of lack of common metrics is one I have already mentioned: comparing animal welfare to human welfare. Our current understanding of psychology hardly allows us to measure what makes human lives go well. Comparing animal lives to human lives involves a level of understanding of &nbsp;psychology far beyond the limits of modern science. To get around this, EAs have proposed new frameworks to compare causes. For example, Holden Karnofsky suggests that we use three metrics\u2014<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework\"><u>importance, tractability, and neglect</u></a>\u2014to prioritize issues. This framework is undeniably insightful and should be consulted as we make resources allocation decisions. However, the importance and tractability inputs are often impossible to compare across today\u2019s EA priorities. Is pandemic preparedness more important than AI alignment? Similarly, is it tractable to prepare ourselves for a lab-grown super bug or ensure AI doesn\u2019t turn against us? I\u2019ve yet to learn of a framework that allows for comparison of efficacy across new EA causes.&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Longtermism:</u></h3><p>All of this gets even more complicated when one considers \u201clongtermist\u201d interventions. Consider again Karnofsky\u2019s importance metric. Is 8\u00b0C of global warming more&nbsp;<i>important</i> than inequitable values being \u201clocked-in\u201d for centuries? I don\u2019t know. In&nbsp;<i>What We Owe The Future</i>, William MacAskill proposes we consider significance, persistence, and contingency as the three main factors for longtermist issues.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyf4c138p1hr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyf4c138p1hr\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Although many EA thought leaders exude some epistemic confidence in determining the significance and contingency of longtermist issues, I\u2019m less sure. Toby Ord sets the probability of an extinction-level engineered pathogen this century at 3%.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1zllj932675\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1zllj932675\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Even if this prediction was made with full omniscience of the present and past, I hesitate to give it much credence. Today, we\u2019ve identified&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021Icar..36514452H/abstract\"><u>98% of extinction-threatening asteroids</u></a>. If you asked the world\u2019s best astrophysicists in 1920 the chances humanity would accomplish this feat within a century, I\u2019d guess many of them might have said 0%.</p><h3><u>Institutional reform:</u></h3><p>The global poverty debate generally steered clear of&nbsp;institutional<i>&nbsp;</i>reforms (i.e. reforms that address the so-called \u201croot causes\u201d of poverty). This facet of EA has changed dramatically in the last few years. Today, most preferred EA interventions are deeply institutional (e.g. changing the United States\u2019 international aid priorities). This is a sensible shift in strategy, especially because much early criticism of EA was that it ignored the power of institutions.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx13nwd0sbaj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx13nwd0sbaj\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, embracing institutional change comes at a cost. Distributing bed nets, deworming children, and initiating cash transfers are deeply simple interventions. Success can be quantified in basic terms (# of nets, # of children treated, $ transferred). Success at lobbying the US government to change foreign aid policies cannot be quantified in the same way. Sure, changes in the amount and allocation of aid are plain to see, but it's next to impossible to determine the causal structure of those changes.&nbsp;<i>Did&nbsp;</i>my<i> advocacy change the minds of the C-suite of Tyson Foods or was it that NYT article last week? &nbsp;</i>This inability for causal determination means that institutional interventions often elude quantification. In other words, in today\u2019s EA landscape, many actors don\u2019t know the amount of good they are doing or what alternative work could do more good.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There are two ways we might go about solving this newly-complicated quantification problem:</p><blockquote><h3>The weak (or thin) conclusion:</h3><p>EAs ought not compare the effectiveness of interventions that do not share common goals (i.e. saving farm animals versus preventing human extinction) and instead allocate resources to the proven \u201cbest\u201d intervention within a set of goals determined to be extremely important.&nbsp;</p><h3>The strong (or thick) conclusion:</h3><p>EAs should focus much less on impact measurement (even to compare strategies that share a common goal) and instead allocate resources more widely to many interventions they believe (given their epistemic position and personal circumstances) do a lot of good.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I will not endorse either of these conclusions in this piece, but they both merit serious consideration. Having already given what I think is a provocative case for either conclusion in this section, I\u2019ll turn to some counterarguments.&nbsp;</p><h3><br><u>Possible counterarguments:</u></h3><p><u>#1</u>: EA is, at its core, about impact measurement. Even if it\u2019s extremely difficult in the new landscape, we still must quantify the efficacy of various possible interventions to allocate resources.&nbsp;</p><p>I agree that impact quantification is indeed the primary differentiator of EA versus other philanthropic movements. But I also think that asking people to \u201cdo a lot of good\u201d aligns with this guiding principle. Peter Singer\u2019s early arguments for reform in the philanthropic space were effective in showing many folks that donations to large university endowments or well-established&nbsp; arts programs did not, in fact, do very much good at all. Although I argue that the good done by researching AI alignment strategies cannot be compared to the good done by lobbying against inhumane farming practices, I am quite sure they both have the potential to do a lot of good. Moreover, if, during the course of one\u2019s efforts in either of these spaces, she determines that her work is not doing much good, she ought to stop and try something else. In essence, I think the \u201cdo a lot of good\u201d approach allows for evidence-centered work with proven impact without the need to constantly justify why one is working in her chosen space and not for some other cause.&nbsp;</p><p><br><u>#2</u>: If we accept the weak conclusion, what tools can we use to make resource allocations across disparate causes?</p><p>I will leave this as an open question. While it\u2019s true that billionaire EA philanthropists like Cari Tuna and Dustin Moskovits have to grapple with this objection to the weak conclusion, most of us don\u2019t. We each have a certain set of opportunities to do good (based on our material and epistemic circumstances) and given those, we can choose our own altruistic journey. Most of us do not have copious amounts of extra money or time to give to EA causes, so we can use our narrow slice of the pie to chip away at an important, neglected problem and let the large research teams at organizations like Open Philanthropy decide how the rest of the pie is divided.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><u>#3</u>: If we accept the strong conclusion, resource allocation will be impossible without comparing efficacy. We would be returning to the dark ages of philanthropy when money was given seemingly indiscriminately and unworthy organizations were granted billions.&nbsp;</p><p>I do not think that this follows from the strong conclusion. A wider and wider range of causes and intervention methods is accepted into the EA umbrella every year. (Most EAs used to only give to GiveWell\u2019s 9-or-so recommended charities\u2014that's just not true anymore).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrf00vf3mk7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrf00vf3mk7\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If you are cynical about impact quantification, you probably consider this intellectual and moral progress. I believe that we, as a community, can allocate resources to a large number of impact-centered organizations without dolling out billions to unproven, inefficient organizations with reckless abandon. In short, we no longer need the extremely demanding \u201calways do the most good\u201d criterion to prevent unworthy interventions from creeping into the EA space.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Part 2: \u201cDo a lot of good\u201d is an&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>effective</strong></i><strong> rallying cry: How to grow a social movement for good</strong></h1><p>In my opinion, \u201cdo the most good\u201d is less effective rhetoric than \u201cdo a lot of good\u201d. This claim is based more on my intuitions than science, but here is my basic reasoning.&nbsp;</p><p>One interesting feature of consequentialism is that, in an effort to actualize the best outcome (fulfill the most preferences, generate the most utils, etc.), actors ought not always preach what they practice. Imagine your friend is choosing between option A, B, and C. In your consequentialist analysis, A is the most moral action, C is the least, and B falls somewhere in between. If you were in your friend\u2019s shoes, you would choose A. However, your friend assures you that she will not choose A. In this case, all else being equal, you should try to convince her to choose B. This is a strange conclusion. Under a deontological moral theory, you would most likely try to convince your friend to perform action A regardless of whether she\u2019ll actually do it. A is, after all, the right thing to do, and most deontological theories advocate for preaching moral rightness no matter what. Consequentialists, though, in an effort to actualize the best possible outcome, base their preaching on the probabilities that certain outcomes occur given their actions.&nbsp;</p><p>The conclusion that consequentialists sometimes ought to preach less than perfectly moral actions is important in EA. Consider two other movements:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org\"><u>Giving What We Can</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mondaycampaigns.org/meatless-monday/about\"><u>Meatless Monday</u></a>. William MacAskill, following Peter Singer et al., surely thinks that the extremely rich should give much more than 10% of their income to be perfectly moral. Under his moral calculus, they should probably give almost everything away. However, telling people to give away 99% of their income is not likely to catch on. Instead, MacAskill and others at Giving What We Can chose to advocate for giving&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/how-much-money-should-we-donate-to-charity\"><u>10% of one\u2019s income</u></a>. This was a position that both sounds reasonable to a large audience and would assuredly change the world if broadly accepted.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, many vegetarians and vegans tell their friends and coworkers to try \u201cMeatless Mondays\u201d. Most of these animal rights advocates wish that everybody would avoid meat altogether, but asking their friends and coworkers to go cold turkey (literally) would have less impact than first asking for a more modest reduction in meat consumption.&nbsp;</p><p>The EA movement was founded on radical ideas that came out of consequentialist reasoning. Although many current members of the movement do not consider themselves hardcore consequentialists, outcome-oriented analysis is still a key tenet of EA. That outcome-oriented thinking should not be limited to deciding what actions we make ourselves. We must also consider the consequences of our private and public rhetoric.&nbsp;</p><p>Effective altruists often say things like, \u201cgiving to community theater is less effective than giving to global poverty relief, so giving to community theater is wrong\u201d. I suspect that this rhetoric generates little change in the general populace compared with \u201chere are 10 reasons why you should give more to global poverty relief\u201d. Most people, especially people who don\u2019t study philosophy, don\u2019t like being told that their actions are wrong. Telling somebody that an act of kindness (like making frequent donations to a community theater) is actually immoral is likely to end a conversation before any change can be made.</p><p>In my analysis, our community has generally adopted this vein of thinking. Most EAs realize that if we want to gain wider reach, we cannot tell people they should live in poverty because they donate so much to Against Malaria. However, as new causes enter the EA space, we\u2019ve been slow to apply this reasoning to our new resource allocation debates. It is not very useful to tell somebody who is passionate about AI alignment that worrying about animal welfare is more effective, so researching AI alignment is immoral. I know that most EAs aren\u2019t actually saying this aloud, but it is frequently implied.</p><p>We should continue to debate how resources should be allocated. We should continue to persuade people to donate their time and money to effective interventions. But we should also continue to seek to grow the EA movement. Doing so requires that we accept varying levels of commitment to EA and a wider number of activities that we consider candidates for doing good effectively. Asking folks to \u201cdo a lot of good\u201d accomplishes these goals without losing sight of EA\u2019s core mission.&nbsp;</p><h1><br><br><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p>My argument does not imply that everybody in the EA community is an \u201cineffective altruist\u201d because nobody can prove her chosen intervention is best. In fact, I believe it does the opposite. If we accept that we can\u2019t know for certain how to do the most good, an effective altruist is somebody who\u2014given her epistemic position and individual circumstances\u2014frequently chooses actions (big and small) she reasonably believes do a lot of good on aggregate.</p><p>I suspect that some of you are frustrated by this conclusion. If you read this forum, you likely have an EA cause that you think ought to be prioritized. And I do agree that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5Xio8uECTH3GqYARc/we-re-still-extremely-funding-constrained-but-don-t-let-fear\"><u>EA is still extremely funding constrained</u></a>. Therefore, you might be tempted to argue: \u201cwell even if I can\u2019t know that my cause does the&nbsp;<i>most good</i>, it does&nbsp;<i>more good</i> than cause X\u201d. This is an unfortunate response for two reasons: 1. it involves a level of epistemic certainty about the future that I think is unfounded<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefccrm77uj4fk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnccrm77uj4fk\">[6]</a></sup></span>; and 2. it implies that other EAs are dedicating their lives to unworthy causes.</p><p>I\u2019ll close by saying that I think the EA community is unique and fantastic in many ways. However, just like all other organizations, we ought to work towards a culture of inclusivity. The increasingly broad focus of the movement coupled with scarce resources have the potential to pit us against ourselves. But a broader focus also allows us the opportunity to grow our community and proliferate our shared mission of improving the lives of people and animals. EAs now appreciate that the world faces a wide array of big problems.

I recently resigned from the partnership of a big international law firm based in the US so I could take some time off. During my 16ish-year career as a big firm lawyer, my practice often focused on plaintiff-side restructuring-related litigation, including cases stemming from some of the biggest financial blow-ups in US history. Early in my career, I worked on litigation about deceptive lending practices at Enron. I then spent the better part of a decade working on litigation against the big money center banks by creditors of Lehman Brothers. I was also involved in litigation against the banks by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, after it took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p><p>I\u2019ve been what I\u2019ll call EA-adjacent for a long time, but I\u2019ve recently gotten more involved. For the past few months during my time off, I\u2019ve been meeting as many lawyers and other mid-career folks in the EA community as I can (hi to those I\u2019ve met!), and I\u2019ve pitched in on a few projects led by others. I was informed on November 2 that I would receive funding for my own project from the FTX Future Fund. I obviously don\u2019t expect to see that funding now. I\u2019m upset and sad about that. I\u2019m really excited about the project, and while I can do some of it by donating my time to it, some of it really does require a bit of funding that I\u2019m not sure I can get now. That sucks, and I\u2019m still working out how I feel about it.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Obligatory \u201cthis is not legal advice\u201d throat clearing</u></p><p>I\u2019m not acting as anyone\u2019s lawyer here, and I don\u2019t want to (at least right now with respect to these issues). Nothing in this post is legal advice. This is just my two cents, off the top of my head, based entirely on my experience and no research at all.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Why it\u2019s best for folks not to comment on the FTX/SFB situation, and not just for their own sake</u></p><p>I don\u2019t know anything about the FTX/SBF situation other than what\u2019s in the public record, which I\u2019ve been following closely as it develops. My thoughts here are inspired a bit by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Et7oPMu6czhEd8ExW/why-you-re-not-hearing-as-much-from-ea-orgs-as-you-d-like\">this post</a> by Shakeel Hashim and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qFEwQbetaaSpvHm9e/my-takes-on-the-ftx-situation-will-mostly-be-cold-not-hot\">this one</a> by Holden Karnofsky, and the comments to each, but it\u2019s also a response more generally to frustration I've seen here and on Twitter about the fact that many public figure EAs and senior folks at EA institutions are not directly addressing the FTX/SBF situation as much as some would like.&nbsp;</p><p>Lawyers almost always advise both individual clients and folks representing client entities not to speak to anyone, including friends and family, about ongoing litigation or any facts and circumstances likely to lead to litigation, including bankruptcy proceedings. People often feel frustrated by being \u201cmuzzled\u201d in this way\u2014especially where a narrative is establishing itself publicly that they see as casting them in a negative light. I suspect many are feeling that way right now about FTX/SBF and how the press is reporting on it. But smart people will continue to follow their lawyers\u2019 advice. There are good reasons for this, including many that go beyond self-interest.&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019ve seen most of the self-interest angles addressed elsewhere, but I\u2019ll say a bit about it just to drive the point home. Being involved in litigation, even as a totally blameless witness\u2014or even a perceived witness who in fact has no relevant knowledge at all\u2014is expensive, time consuming, emotionally taxing, and unpleasant. Even cheap lawyers cost hundreds of dollars an hour these days and often bill in increments of .1 hours for their time. Anyone who gets caught up in court proceedings can expect to pay such a lawyer (or have their employer do so) for many hours of time to help them produce documents and communications (or formally object to having to do so) and then prepare them to be grilled for many more hours by another well-paid professional interlocutor with goals and motives at best orthogonal to their own, if not outright hostile. And that\u2019s often the best-case scenario for someone who piques the interest of one of the many professionals who will be scouring the record in a case like this. It goes downhill from there. The best way to avoid all of this is to say as little as possible and stay off the radar as much as possible.</p><p>This unpleasantness is magnified greatly in situations where one of those professionals finds something someone has said that is (even innocently) false or misleading, or that contradicts something else the person said or did previously. And many, many experienced lawyers will be looking at basically everything everyone has said or done even remotely related to the FTX/SBF blow-up, even in private conversations, as discovery<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> in a case like this is usually broad and comprehensive. Again, the best way to handle this is to say as little as possible of any relevance to anyone, as soon as it becomes clear the situation will be under this kind of intense scrutiny.&nbsp;</p><p>People can even find themselves under a microscope not because of something they said, but because of something someone else said to or about them. This is just one of the ways that staying quiet is best even beyond self-interest. Communicating with others could lead to someone on the other end of the communication getting caught up in things more than they otherwise would have. And any public recitation of the facts that would be useful to anyone in the community would require discussing the actions of other people, including blameless people, or explaining situations in such a way that sharp people scouring the record can easily infer identities. Doing so even with perfect recollection could harm not only those individuals but people around them in ways that are impossible to predict, and nobody\u2019s recollection is perfect.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone\u2019s memory is faulty to some degree, and people talking about the past almost always make mistakes, saying things that are not entirely accurate or conflict with other things they\u2019ve said or done in other contexts. Even if such a misstatement is a totally innocent mistake, it can be made to look nefarious in the hands of a smart lawyer acting appropriately zealously in the interests of another stakeholder. There are subtler versions of this, too. Even the smartest people I\u2019ve represented often had difficulty distinguishing in their minds between (i) what they knew from direct experience during the time prior to a dispute arising and (ii) what they learned or inferred later after the issues were reported in the press. This can make even totally truthful statements about what someone \u201cknows\u201d now unintentionally misleading because it can appear someone knew fact X months or years ago, when in fact they learned it recently through the press and got it mixed up in their minds.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only can any of these circumstances (and I\u2019m sure many more I\u2019m not thinking of as I dash this off) be harmful to the person communicating or the people being communicated to or about, but there are also other, indirect potential harms worth considering. Misunderstandings can lead to wasted time by litigants and the court. This can harm creditors who already lost money by forcing them to pay professionals more than they would otherwise have to because they\u2019ll be dealing with a muddled record or following rabbit trails that go nowhere useful. And because the professionals working to administer the bankruptcy estate are paid out of estate assets, this can harm creditors even if they are not separately represented by further diminishing the assets available to repay folks through the restructuring or liquidation process.</p><p><u>How I\u2019m moving forward</u></p><p>The legal proceedings around FTX and SBF will continue, much of it in public and reported on by the press, and the story will come out. The fact finding that happens in big bankruptcies like this is imperfect, of course, but it\u2019s the system we have for a reason. All of this will happen more slowly than we\u2019d like, but it\u2019ll happen. I\u2019ll be watching and reading along with everyone else while I work with my new friends and collaborators to find alternate funding for the projects I\u2019ve been helping with that were funded by (or about to be funded by) FTX Future Fund money. And I\u2019ll be thinking about ways the EA community can prevent something like this from happening again or at least limit the harm if it does.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, the only inference I\u2019m drawing from the relative silence of public figure EAs and the big EA institutions is that they are receiving sound legal advice not to comment and are following it, as they should. I suspect many are as frustrated by receiving and following this advice themselves as others are by the resulting silence. It sucks, but that\u2019s where we are.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> \u201cDiscovery\u201d refers to the process by which lawyers for parties to litigation use court processes to gain access to relevant documents and testimony, including emails, chats, texts, and anything else that is relevant to the litigation, using the power of the court to compel production of any information not provided voluntarily.</p>", "user": {"username": "Tyler Whitmer"}}, {"_id": "sD4kdobiRaBpxcL8M", "title": "What happened to the \"Women and Effective Altruism\" post?", "postedAt": "2022-11-20T19:36:55.978Z", "htmlBody": "<p>There was a post up some time last week I wanted to read called <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NacFjEJGoFFWRqsc8/women-and-effective-altruism\">Women and Effective Altruism</a>.

Working to have more diverse funding sources for top cause areas could make highly valued work more resilient to the sudden loss of any individual funder.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>It's common in EA analysis to evaluate cause areas based on Importance, Tractability and Neglectedness. In light of the recent bankruptcy of FTX and the resulting funding crunch for several top EA causes, we might consider a fourth factor: <strong>Funding Diversification</strong>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref02p5clbtn46d\"><sup><a href=\"#fn02p5clbtn46d\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>Funding Diversification is similar to Neglectedness in that it evaluates the current resources going toward a given cause area. Except instead of considering the total amount of funding going into the cause area, it considers the diversity of funding sources the cause area draws from.</p><p>For example, if 70% of the funding for AI Safety came from the foundation of a single billionaire<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff3lolugrwr6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf3lolugrwr6\">[2]</a></sup></span>, then we would rate this cause area as having low funding diversification.</p><h3>Benefits of funding diversification</h3><p>High funding diversification is desirable because it provides financial stability in the event of a sudden loss in funding.<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block;

If it turns out the largest funder in a space committed a crime, it's a lesser crisis all around if the cause area was only 10% dependent on that funder rather than 70% dependent.</p><p>Another benefit of funding diversification is it can help with diversity of thought/approaches within a cause area. In case funders have strong opinions about how things should be done in the cause area they're funding, funding diversification provides people working in that area with more opportunity to blaze a different trail. If their current funder has a blindspot which prevents them from seeing the merits of their new intervention or research direction, they are more likely to find another funder who will support them.</p><h3>How do we increase funding diversification in a cause area?</h3><p>People working on fundraising in a given cause area could take its funding diversification into account. If their area has low funding diversification, then they could prioritize raising funds from new donors, rather than going back to the largest funder to try and raise additional funds.</p><p>Similarly, grantmakers could take funding diversification into account when they are evaluating cause areas to donate to. If there is a cause area they believe is important but which has low funding diversification and they are not currently funding, then they could see it as a benefit to fund that area in order to help increase its funding diversification.</p><h3>Arguments against</h3><p>It's hard enough just to get sufficient funding for a cause area. Sculpting the makeup of funding sources for a cause area isn't a luxury we have.</p><p>Philanthropists are looking for opportunities to stand out and build a legacy.

Desalination is nice, capturing clean water from the sea, yet it requires expensive equipment and lots and lots of energy. We can, instead, <i><strong>accelerate evaporation OUT into the air above our heads</strong></i>! We won\u2019t be \u2018capturing\u2019 that clean water \u2014 it just <i>rains-down miles away</i>. Perfect, because we don\u2019t need pipes and pumps to transport it! Using this sort of design, we can end droughts and re-take the land captured by deserts in recent decades, cheaply and quickly.</p><p><strong>The Concept</strong></p><p>Imagine you have a bowl of salty sea water, with a tiny hole at the bottom. The sea water is slowly dribbling out of that hole, into another bowl beneath, to then get pumped back up to the top. At that dribbling spout, you hang a loose, fuzzy length of yarn, straight down. The water is held against that yarn by surface tension, scuttling down along its surface.</p><p>As the wind blows past your wet-yarn-wick, it will cause evaporation from that surface, adding humidity to the air, to come back down as rain further downwind. (Place the evaporators geographically so that the wind carries the water to the general spot you plan to use.) With wide troughs, thousands of yarns packed per square yard, stacked a dozen feet high in layers, you can pump vast amounts of water into the air.</p><p>The cost of pumping sea water up onto those troughs, only a few dozen meters above sea-level, is less than 1 Megajoule per ton of water. A Megajoule generated on-site from solar, only pumping when the sun shines, costs about 1 or 2 cents, for a ton of water to evaporate and return as rain on farms and snowpack in the mountains. <strong>For anyone in Ag, this translates to \u201c</strong><i><strong>$12 per acre-foot of irrigation</strong></i><strong>, with no pumping or well-drilling, maintenance, or ditches\u2026 because it just rains.\u201d</strong> That sounds darn good to me!</p><p>Compare that to the <i>top-of-the-line</i> desalination plants, spending 10 to 20 Megajoules per ton of fresh water produced! If you want to irrigate with that, you need to pump it to the site, with the associated barrier to entry and lag to scaling, maintenance and risk, while the water itself <i><strong>still</strong></i> costs you $240 per acre-foot! Some regions of California have seen peak prices at $2,000 an acre-foot, which is crippling. At $12 a pop, we can get green again \u2014 in flora <i>and</i> finances.</p><p><strong>Getting into Details</strong></p><p>Salt, first \u2014 as you evaporate and regurgitate the water in those troughs, it becomes brine, and you pump that out. It\u2019ll only be a fraction of the original volume, and it\u2019ll be chock-full of lithium, magnesium, and potassium, so you might as well make money selling those to make batteries and feed chemical industries. The sodium salt, unfortunately, must be <i>gently</i> dripped back across the wide ocean, OR we can just pile it up to make a <strong>giant salt pyramid</strong> somewhere nearby. I favor the latter option, because it\u2019s much cheaper and it would still take ages to accumulate a pyramid that would be so large as to be an \u2018obstruction\u2019 \u2014 plus, the ocean really won\u2019t notice the salt-loss at all, being miles deep. It\u2019d also be rad to ski down and take four-wheelers up it \u2014 there are <i>tourist revenue streams</i> for such a unique oddity!</p><p>Coastline, next \u2014 you <i>do</i> need to pump the sea-water <strong>short</strong> distances, and up only <strong>short</strong> elevations, to make it cheap. So, coastlines would need tall, layered racks of troughs, stretching inland as far as elevation allows, to spread water deep to the continent. Another option, with a higher capital cost and maintenance, yet which would allow you to use this option in cases where <i><strong>the coastline is too steep or precious to locals</strong></i>: buoys floating just off-shore, where the winds are still strong!</p><p>Adding to the coastline problems: you must pick coasts where the winds pull from the sea <i>into the dry target-region</i>. California\u2019s central valley is a prime example. So are Libya and Israel, able to water deep into the dry lands. Yet, the regions receiving rain from such coasts are often a different <strong>country</strong>! That\u2019s the biggest barrier to development, and it will be difficult to get those countries to form a neighborly arrangement, <i><strong>until</strong></i> other countries have demonstrated evaporation\u2019s efficacy and value. <i><strong>Once</strong></i> other successes pile-up, the incentive to stop squabbling becomes larger \u2014 in order to cash-in on the opportunity.</p><p>Power is an issue, too \u2014 the best way to power the evaporators is with solar concentrators along that same coastline. Solar can extract hundreds of watts per square meter, which means you only use a thin ribbon of solar to pump for a wide, many-layered swath of evaporator-troughs and yarns. It\u2019ll be the most expensive capital, yet it\u2019s also a small percentage of the total area and equipment. And, by positioning the solar *up-wind* from the evaporators, you are guaranteed many days of clear skies, without your own clouds disrupting power-supplies!</p><p><strong>The Big Picture</strong></p><p>If these evaporators desalinate and transport irrigation water dozens of times cheaper, hundreds of miles inland, that makes it worth-while \u2014 <i>profitable! </i>\u2014 to convert many disregarded dry regions into crop land and pasture. That takes pressure off deforestation, much of which happens for the purpose of grazing lands. <strong>The more we green the deserts, the more native land we can return to the biome.</strong></p><p>Further, we\u2019ve been losing agricultural land, accelerated especially by desertification. This would reverse that trend in many locations, preserving what we do use. Rains are also acceptable for municipal water supplies, precious in regions without steady fresh-water reserves for drinking. And, the rain\u2019s humidity stabilizes the wild temperature-swings of deserts\u2019 day and night, protecting plants and making the region more comfortable and desirable for people to live there. (aka \u2018real estate values\u2019)</p><p>There is also a social dividend to the work: being the pioneer of it, as well as sharing rain with your neighbors. It can even be a diplomatic shield: who would attack one so <i>useful</i>, especially when that same diligent rainmaker could turn the water off? Evaporators are worth much more than lettuce!</p>", "user": {"username": "Anthony Repetto"}}, {"_id": "MrrmteC5hBQYXtqtY", "title": "Could somebody help soothe my anxiety about the future of EA? \n", "postedAt": "2022-11-20T05:51:28.159Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Ever since the fall of FTX and SBF I have been very anxious about the future of EA and have been worrying about stagnation/collapse of EA.

Integrity doesn\u2019t mean highlighting every bad faith criticism. (But also don\u2019t let the desire to protect what is valuable warp your own beliefs about the world)<ol><li>There are going to be a lot of incentives to pile on, especially if any particular narrative starts emerging, and I also want EA to be a place where you can say \u201cthis thing that looks bad doesn\u2019t seem actually object level bad to me for these reasons\u201d, or \u201cUtilitarianism is good, actually\u201d&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0y6lfnbfsyy\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0y6lfnbfsyy\">[2]</a></sup></span>or \u201cEA is/isn\u2019t worse than the reference class on this\u201d or \u201cI think the ways in which EA is different from other movements was a worthwhile bet, even if it added risk\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t think I know enough about this to have a take.\u201d<ol><li>Updating your views makes sense, but probably you for the moment have most of the same views you had two weeks ago, and overupdating also lands you in the wrong place</li><li>I would be sad if people jumped too quickly to repudiate their system of ethics, or all the unusual features of it that have let us aim at doing an unusual amount of good. I would also be sad if the vibe of our response felt disingenuous - aiming to appear less consequentialist than is the case (whatever that true case is), less willing to think about tradeoffs, etc.</li></ol></li><li>You don\u2019t even need to have one take - you can just say a lot of things that seem true to you</li></ol></li><li>I want to say things here, on twitter, out loud, etc, that are filtered by \u201cis this helping me and others think better and more clearly\u201d.

Worry, confusion, anger, stress, sadness, betrayal, are all normal, as is \u201cI\u2019m confused, I\u2019m going to not think about this for a few weeks and see what shakes out\u201d - people\u2019s emotions don\u2019t need to be changed or managed, though people might need support</p><p>8. I think honoring your own feelings - including all the above - is good, and can be done while being clear about which feelings you endorse and don\u2019t&nbsp;</p><p>9. Be honest with people, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jCgZzxsabngpnzhLQ/the-onion-test-for-integrity\"><u>meta-honesty</u></a> or meta-transparency if that makes sense (ie tell people when there are things you won\u2019t be able to talk openly about)</p><p>10. A possible failure mode is to want to throw yourself under the bus quickly - it\u2019s good to reflect on your own thoughts and judgment, but jumping too early to certainty isn\u2019t helpful even when you\u2019re the one taking the hit</p><h2>If you\u2019re trying to figure out what\u2019s true</h2><p>11. I think \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/fundamental-question-of-rationality\"><u>What do you think you know and why do you think you know it</u></a>\u201d remains a crucial question, especially since we\u2019re in a position where more information is likely to come out in the future, and much information isn\u2019t in a position to be shared. It\u2019s hard for me to think there is a person reading this who should reasonably think they have the full story. Alongside, making your epistemic status and reasoning transparent helps collaborative sensemaking happen.</p><p><u>12. </u><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/t2LGSDwT7zSnAGybG/split-and-commit\"><u>Split and commit</u></a> - when you\u2019re confused about what\u2019s true, figure out in advance what your views will be if different things turn out or you see different evidence.</p><ul><li>E.g. how will you update if enough money is raised by FTX.com to make the FTX.com customers whole? Or if it turns out there\u2019s ev<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/12/business/ftx-hack/index.html\"><u>en less than is currently though</u></a>t?</li><li>E.g. how will you update if what FTX did was unethical but not illegal? Normal in crypto world but not in normal business world? Or the biggest financial scandal since 2008?</li><li>E.g. how will you update if EAs are more furious about this than you expect? Less?</li></ul><p>13. People are going to disagree about what this situation means, how to react, how people should reflect, etc. and you get to have your own thoughts in contention with them, or rejigger your whole thinking if you get a big update. You might want to think about your models of the world, what they would have expected, what evidence is different if your model is false and what evidence is equally likely regardless.</p><p>14. It\u2019s normal for opinions to jostle a lot back and forth - notice when you\u2019re not in reflective equilibrium and be honest with yourself and others about it. I, for instance, find my orientations and feelings to this jumping around a lot, so the tone of my takes is likely to differ from day to day. I want to be really open about that and say that I, like so many others, am muddling through it, and trying to only make decisions I have agreed with for a continuous 48 hours</p><p>15. I worry about hindsight bias being very prevalent, especially in judgments of others</p><h2>I also think it is very sensible to think ahead to future difficult circumstances and try to extract a lot of learning from this</h2><p>16. How do I think the world (of communities, of crypto, of finance, of scandals, in general) works? What am I surprised by?&nbsp;</p><p>17. What predictions can I make now to see in days, weeks, months or years whether my model of the world is correct?</p><h2>Fin</h2><p>If you\u2019re feeling pressured to take some party line, the community health team would love to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJooJD0Sm2csCYgd0Is6FkpyQa3ket8IIcFzd_FcTRU7avRg/viewform\"><u>hear from you</u></a>, to support you, to get feedback and to know what\u2019s happening. CEA is giving out media guidance and plans to give out more, but in the end you will decide how you want to act and what seems right to you.</p><p>I\u2019m really motivated by a vision of supporting other people to act as they endorse in the next days and weeks and get that support myself, to get and give whatever advice and encouragement makes that possible even while it\u2019s hard. I also expect to fuck up, and for other people to fuck up, and to keep trying.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnjmhunfv1yp\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefjmhunfv1yp\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;I like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FKJ8yiF3KjFhAuivt/impco-don-t-injure-yourself-by-returning-ftxff-money-for#tctoMbfgXMrmhitDY\"><u>this comment</u></a> about PR and honesty</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn0y6lfnbfsyy\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref0y6lfnbfsyy\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;I like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/11/is-the-ea-movement-dead.html?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=is-the-ea-movement-dead\"><u>Tyler Cowen\u2019s line</u></a>: \"I do anticipate a boring short-run trend, where most of the EA people scurry to signal their personal association with virtue ethics.

But we don't have to - we have tools that allow us to hear what people actually think. One is representative polling. This isn't that. Here we can do cluster analysis (not a technical term) and look at what opinions are held in common. Do those who think Longtermisms is true tend to think that certain solutions are better than others? If so, why.</p><p>It shouldn't be used to say &nbsp;X% of EAs think this. That's not what this tool is for. Instead, it should suggest interesting questions to ask in future.</p><p>It would be very easy to use the loudest voices to decided what EAs really think. But that is unwise. Instead, if we want community input we should try and understand what groups form the community as a whole and understand what underlies the desires of each group.</p><h1>Example question</h1><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668940334/mirroredImages/PtnGywLuk3Keo642c/skk80ysh4seneqe44rsi.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2f7f282cc6af9e75a36f0c442d85bbc9977be0a0bf04eb52.png/w_160 160w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2f7f282cc6af9e75a36f0c442d85bbc9977be0a0bf04eb52.png/w_320 320w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2f7f282cc6af9e75a36f0c442d85bbc9977be0a0bf04eb52.png/w_480 480w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2f7f282cc6af9e75a36f0c442d85bbc9977be0a0bf04eb52.png/w_640 640w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2f7f282cc6af9e75a36f0c442d85bbc9977be0a0bf04eb52.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2f7f282cc6af9e75a36f0c442d85bbc9977be0a0bf04eb52.png/w_960 960w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2f7f282cc6af9e75a36f0c442d85bbc9977be0a0bf04eb52.png/w_1120 1120w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2f7f282cc6af9e75a36f0c442d85bbc9977be0a0bf04eb52.png/w_1280 1280w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2f7f282cc6af9e75a36f0c442d85bbc9977be0a0bf04eb52.png/w_1440 1440w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/2f7f282cc6af9e75a36f0c442d85bbc9977be0a0bf04eb52.png/w_1588 1588w\"></figure><h1>Report</h1><p><a href=\"https://pol.is/report/r7yrwpymn6yadbzwm3iyi\">https://pol.is/report/r7yrwpymn6yadbzwm3iyi</a></p><h1>Clusters and visualisation (Coming when Polis decides to work)</h1><p>There are three clusters currently:</p><ul><li>Group A largely think this is overrated and want clear suggestions</li><li>Group B wants more robust internal mechanisms and hold EA responsible for not spotting this</li><li>Group C is similar to group A but is more likely to hold those views.

"title": "Considerations for EA Content Localisation", "postedAt": "2022-11-19T11:30:39.193Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p><i>I am grateful to Konstantin Pilz, Manuel Allgaier, Luis Costigan, Lorenzo Buonanno and Mike Pool for their insightful notes and additions (though they do not necessarily agree with/endorse anything in this post). Any errors, of fact or judgment, remain my entirely own.</i></p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>With&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CqYHPLCJaFdLn8gp6/open-phil-is-seeking-bilingual-people-to-help-translate-ea\"><u>Open Phil funding people to translate web content into non-English languages</u></a>, there has been an increase in work in this area. Instead of selecting a text and translating it, I propose taking a top-down approach and using content localisation as part of a communication strategy that starts with a theory of change.</p><p><strong>Epistemic Status</strong>: I have worked on localisation projects in the last ten years in finance and textiles. There I set up a multi-role process for localising knitting patterns from UK/US designers to German-speaking markets in the company I co-founded. However, I\u2019m no professional in this area and can only go by my experience and thinking about the subject. Feedback on the first version of this post has updated my thinking that my approach might not be worth the effort in locations with a small EA community or with few English speakers.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I wrote the first draft of this post before taking on the role of co-director EA Germany. I\u2019m writing this in a personal capacity, although discussions around this text have influenced my thinking in the professional context.</p><h1>Translation is not Localisation</h1><p>While translation tries to transpose a text into another language in a way that loses as little meaning as possible, localisation cares about how the content is received. Take this example from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism\"><u>What is effective altruism?</u></a>\u201d:</p><blockquote><p>Researchers in effective altruism argued as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/biosecurity/\"><u>early as 2014</u></a> that, given the history of near-misses, there was a good chance that a large pandemic would happen in our lifetimes.</p><p>But preparing for the next pandemic was, and remains, hugely underfunded compared to other global issues. For instance, the US invests around $8bn per year preventing pandemics, compared to around $280bn per year spent on counterterrorism over the last decade.<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism#fn-3\"><u>3</u></a></p></blockquote><p>When localising this text, several questions have to be answered:</p><ul><li>The link in the first sentence points to an English website. Should it be included in the translated text? If so, should there be a translated summary of the content? If not, should there be a footnote? Or should the text that was linked also be translated?</li><li>Should the dollar amounts be converted?</li><li>Is an example using the US appropriate for the target audience, or should a local one replace it?</li></ul><p>[Reviewers of the first draft of this post pointed out that the points above might not be crucial but gave other examples, like a text for US/UK audiences describing the readers as wealthy in global terms, which might not be the case for the target readers.]</p><p>The text also includes graphics which have to be translated and updated.</p><p>There are questions specific to the target language. One headline is \u201cHow can you take action?\u201d In German, you can use either the formal \u201cSie\u201d form or the informal \u201cdu\u201d form. I can recount that either can lead to complaints about the text being too stand-offish or unprofessional.</p><p>Another question arises around the familiarity of the reader with certain words. One example is \u201clongtermism\u201d.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/35D5NxW8uzDQkHWH8/germans-opinions-on-translations-of-longtermism-survey\"><u>Konstantin Pilz surveyed</u></a> the translation of this word into German. However, I would differentiate based on the context. Suppose readers will likely use the translated text as a stepping stone to engage further with the topic in English. In that case, it might be easier to introduce the English term (especially in languages that regularly integrate foreign words). This might be different for readers who will probably not engage in other languages. One grantee commented that they leave the English word in parenthesis, and another that they have translators and proofreaders discuss the word and link to the discussion from a glossary.</p><h1>Risks and Opportunities</h1><h2>Translations Can Be Harmful</h2><p>In \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z95TxtkjHGPq4TAqY/why-not-to-rush-to-translate-effective-altruism-into-other\"><u>Why not to rush to translate effective altruism into other languages</u></a>\u201d, Benjamin Todd argues that translations can create lock-in effects, that effective altruism is hard to translate, that existing EA material is often out of date, and that mass outreach is not the best way to promote EA in general. Instead, he is in favour of a very localised approach:</p><blockquote><p>Rather than \u201ctranslating\u201d effective altruism into new languages, it seems better to think in terms of creating a local movement from scratch that\u2019s inspired by the ideas of effective altruism, but is highly adapted to the local context. Imagine that Will MacAskill was Chinese: then what would he have written?<br>To do this well, we\u2019ll need people who are both experts in the local culture and effective altruism in the West. We\u2019ll also need people who are excellent writer and communicators in the new language.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z95TxtkjHGPq4TAqY/why-not-to-rush-to-translate-effective-altruism-into-other?commentId=Gu353LndnuYzk2D9Y\"><u>In the comment section</u></a> Jonas Vollmer, who led the EA foundation in Switzerland and Germany that translated EA content early on, agrees:</p><blockquote><p>In the early days we made several mistakes that could have been prevented fairly easily. In particular, it seems hard to correct the perception that EA is not just about donating (to GiveWell top charities). It also remains very difficult to counter the impression that EA is mainly the practical implementation of Singer's views; e.g. Singer's views on infanticide get quoted in many media articles about EA.</p></blockquote><p>He also comments on content updates:</p><blockquote><p>Quickly translating English content is easy. However, it takes much more time to ensure high quality both in terms of language and framings/nuance, and it's even more challenging to keep these translations up to date. See the \"fidelity model\" blog post referenced above for more discussion of this.</p></blockquote><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/the-fidelity-model-of-spreading-ideas\"><u>fidelity model post</u></a> referenced here argues that mechanisms like mass media outreach might lose the nuance of ideas, leading to a \u201ctelephone game\u201d effect.</p><p>Keeping these potential pitfalls in mind seems useful when considering who to reach through which medium and what content to use.</p><p>However, the commenters also pointed to errors of omission where the harm being done by being too careful might be more significant than not translating the content.</p><h2>Better Outreach</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CqYHPLCJaFdLn8gp6/open-phil-is-seeking-bilingual-people-to-help-translate-ea\"><u>Eli Rose argues</u></a> that translations of existing web content will expose more people to longtermist ideas counterfactually.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qBAbiuiWJvhb9uZPT/translating-ea-online-content-motivation-and-learnings-from\"><u>Konstantin Pilz thinks</u></a> that localised content makes community building easier, will lead to more people discovering EA by chance and will also help with misconceptions:</p><blockquote><p>Having high-quality content in the native language decreases the risk of negative or low-fidelity press coverage and provides a reference when EA topics are discussed.</p></blockquote><p>For German, he argues that there is no good description of longtermism when searching for the word on the web.</p><h2>A more strategic approach</h2><p>Looking at the discussion of the topic on the EA Forum, I feel that a more strategic approach might be helpful, especially in countries where the level of English in the target audience is relatively high and when approaching more than basic material like the EA handbook. While it is true that we might reach more people with translated texts about longtermism, we might also cause harm by selecting a specific subset of texts, making mistakes in localising and using the wrong channels to promote the texts. Focussing on the translations more than on the content distribution might also reduce the impact.</p><p>Instead, I favour starting with the impact we\u2019re looking to have. Then we can go back to see who we\u2019re looking to reach and through which channels to determine what contents to localise and how to do so.</p><h1>Localisation Strategy</h1><p>To choose the target groups, channels and contents for localisation, I propose setting goals and developing a theory of change. This might read like a very time-consuming approach. However, mapping out thoughts for a few hours might help formulate a rough strategy and processes.</p><h2>Goals</h2><p>Achieving impact through localisation can mean that people, for example,</p><ul><li>change their career plans to more impactful options</li><li>start impactful organisations&nbsp;</li><li>use their careers to yield influence in impactful ways</li><li>donate more effectively</li><li>take a donation pledge&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The goals can be used as the endpoint for a theory of change.</p><h2>Theory of Change</h2><p>Getting someone to donate effectively might be a relatively short process where someone searches for a keyword, reads an article, fills out a donation form and is finished.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, career changes might need multiple contact points over a more extended period. They may involve different channels, including external media sources, websites, newsletters, local groups and career advice. If, for example, we\u2019re doing student outreach at a university in the local language, handing out flyers that promote a website and then an introductory talk at a local group that leads to a fellowship and career research, then we already have several contact points. If it is impossible to localise the whole process, the audience must be proficient enough in English to switch languages. If this is the case, why localise the content? There might be good reasons, like getting the users' attention more quickly, placing content in external localised media channels, briefing journalists or providing content for local groups that discuss content in their language.</p><p>Still, the impact of localising different contents might differ widely, depending on the underlying theory of change and the content's role.</p><h2>Channels and Target Groups</h2><p>The intermediate outcomes in the theory of change should include channels, target groups and contents. Channels could be websites, newsletters or social media channels owned by EA organisations. Still, they could also be external blogs, podcasts, newspapers, local discussion groups, fellowships, or introductory talks. The target groups will differ based on the channel, and together they will drive the level of localisation needed. A text localised for an EA fellowship might be much closer to the original than one that briefs journalists or is on the main page of a general audience website.</p><h1>Localisation Process</h1><p>After having developed a strategy, the actual process of content localisation starts. It will differ based on the channels and contents. For example, using the content of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism\"><u>\u200b\u200bWhat is effective altruism?</u></a>\u201d on a localised EA website might include:</p><ul><li>Contacting Effective Ventures Foundation, as the owner stated on the website, and getting permission</li><li>Getting editable graphic files from EVF</li><li>Getting information about the target group, style and tone from the editor of the EA website, perhaps using personas</li><li>Deciding what examples, links and other elements to change</li><li>Selecting a glossary if one already exists</li><li>Commissioning a first translation of the content</li><li>Deciding which unique expressions to translate and how</li><li>Finalising the content</li><li>Proof-reading the content for errors and readability</li><li>Proof-reading the content by a native speaker that is an expert in the content</li><li>Making changes to the content</li><li>Changing graphics</li><li>Final correction</li><li>Publication</li><li>Monitoring the original content for changes</li><li>Re-Starting the process for any changes, based on the size</li></ul><p>As commentators on the first draft have noted that this might seem overwhelming, some of these points might not apply or be minor, depending on the project. The goal is not to show how complicated the process is but rather to help not forget any steps.</p><h2>Roles</h2><p>The localisation work includes several different roles. One or a few people might hold some or all. However, specialisation may help in scaling the process.</p><ul><li>Project owner: Overall owner of the process, makes sure that goals are set and tracked</li><li>Strategic planner: Defines goals, theory of change, channels, target groups and measurement of goals</li><li>Localisation specialist: Defines per content and channels what elements should be localised and manages glossaries (unless glossaries exist on a per-channel basis already)</li><li>Project manager (might also be the owner): Manages the overall process and interfaces with content owners and editors of channels</li><li>Translator: Translates the contents</li><li>Content expert: An expert for the specific content that can proof-read the localised version and give feedback on the accuracy of the localisation</li><li>Proof-reader: Checks the contents for mistakes in spelling, grammar as well as readability</li><li>Graphic designer: Localises graphic elements</li><li>Target Channel Editor (per channel): A person responsible for the target channel that can define the target audience, style and tone. Checks the content before publication and sets up the update process if the source content is updated. An example would be convincing 80k to add local content to their existing website or a newsletter owned by an organisation in the target country.</li></ul><p>Using the different roles can help start the process from thinking about the overall goal through fleshing out the strategy, contacting channels, and working on the contents through publication, goal measurement and revisions.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Taking a strategic approach to localising EA content can increase the chance of translation projects having a positive impact by including considerations of target groups, distribution channels, and the roles needed for the localisation process. This should consider the potential harms and mistakes in previous localisation projects. Depending on the region's size, the national organisation or community builders might be in an excellent position to coordinate and help with the strategy, staffing and outsourcing.<br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "gruban"}}, {"_id": "38LGZhQsPNEBRq5Ke", "title": "First FDA Cultured Meat Safety Approval ", "postedAt": "2022-11-19T00:09:14.745Z", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>In a major first, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration just offered its safety blessing to a cultivated meat product startup.

Could this have been prevented? What warning signs were there, and did people act on them as much as they should have? What steps could be taken to lower the odds of a similar situation in the future?\n</p>\n<p>\nI want to think hard about questions like these, and I want to have a good (and public) discussion about them. But I don\u2019t want to rush to make sure that happens as fast as possible. (I will continue to communicate things that seem directly and time-sensitively action-relevant; what I don\u2019t want to rush is reflection on what went wrong and what we can learn.)\n</p>\n<p>\nThe overarching reason for this is that I think discussion will be better - more thoughtful, more honest, more productive - to the extent that it happens after the dust has settled a bit. (I\u2019m guessing this will be some number of weeks or months, as opposed to days or years.)\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I\u2019m <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Et7oPMu6czhEd8ExW/why-you-re-not-hearing-as-much-from-ea-orgs-as-you-d-like?commentId=eCeFqu8YofsNcmhhp\">hearing calls</a> from various members of the community to discuss all these issues quickly, and concerns (from people who\u2019d rather not move so quickly) that engaging too slowly could risk losing the trust of the community.  As a sort of compromise, I\u2019m rushing out this post on why I disprefer rushing.</strong><sup id=\"fnref1\"><a href=\"#fn1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>My guess is that a number of other people have similar thoughts to mine on this point, but I\u2019ll speak only for myself.\n</p>\n<p>\nI expect some people to read this as implicitly suggesting that others behave as I do. That\u2019s mostly not right, so I\u2019ll be explicit about my goals. My primary goal is just to explain my own behavior. My secondary goal is to make it easier to understand why some others might be behaving as I am. My third goal is to put some considerations out there that might change some other people\u2019s minds somewhat about what they want to do; but I don\u2019t expect or want everyone to make the same calls I\u2019m making (actually it would be very weird if the EA Forum were quiet right now; that\u2019s not something I wish for).\n</p>\n<p>\nSo, reasons why I mostly expect to stick to cold takes (weeks or months from now) rather than hot takes (days):\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I think cold takes will be more intelligent and thoughtful. </strong>In general, I find that I have better thoughts on <em>anything</em> after I have a while to process it. In the immediate aftermath of new information, I have tons of quick reactions that tend not to hold up well; they\u2019re often emotion-driven, often overcorrections to what I thought before and overreactions to what others are saying, etc.\n</p>\n<p>\nWaiting also tends to mean I get to take in a lot more information, and angles from other people, that can affect my thinking. (This is especially the case with other people being so into hot takes!)\n</p>\n<p>\nIt also tends to give me more space for <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/minimal-trust-investigations/\">minimal-trust</a> thinking. If I want to form the most accurate possible belief in the heat of the moment, I tend to look to people who have thought more about the matter than I have, and think about which of them I want to bet on and defer to. But if I have more time, I can develop my own models and come to the point where I can personally stand behind my opinions. (In general I\u2019ve been slower than some to adopt ideas like the <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/most-important-century/\">most important century</a> hypothesis, but I also think I have more detailed understanding and more gut-level seriousness about such ideas than I would\u2019ve if I\u2019d adopted them more quickly and switched from \u201cexplore\u201d to \u201cexploit\u201d mode earlier.)\n</p>\n<p>\nThese factors seem especially important for topics like \u201cWhat went wrong here and what can we learn for the future?\u201d It\u2019s easy to learn the wrong lessons from a new development, and I think the extra info and thought is likely to really pay off.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I think cold takes will pose less risk of doing harm. </strong>Right now there is a <em>lot</em> of interest in the FTX situation, and anything I say could get an inordinate number of readers. Some of those readers have zero interest in truth-seeking, and are instead (a) looking to write a maximally juicy story, with truth only as an instrumental goal toward that (at best); or (b) in some cases, actively looking to try to harm effective altruism by putting negative narratives out there that <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/the-gloves-are-off-the-pants-are-on/\">could stick around even if they\u2019re debunked</a>.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf I wait longer, more of those people will have moved on (particularly the ones in category (a), since this won\u2019t be such a hot news topic anymore). And I\u2019ll have more time to consider downsides of my comments and find ways to say what's important while reducing those downsides.\n</p>\n<p>\nMaybe I should <a href=\"https://twitter.com/So8res/status/1593062474219401216\">not care about this</a>? Maybe it\u2019s somehow fundamentally wrong to even consider the \u201cPR impact\u201d of things I say? I\u2019ve heard this sentiment at times, but I don\u2019t really understand it. \n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>I think that overweighing \u201cPR considerations\u201d can be bad from an integrity perspective (people who care too much about PR can be slippery and deceptive) and can often backfire (I think being less than honest is nearly always a bad PR move). \n\n</li><li>But that doesn\u2019t mean these considerations should be given <em>zero</em> weight.\n\n</li><li>I occasionally hear arguments like \u201cIf person X bounces off of [important cause X] because of some media narrative, this just shows that they were a superficial person whom [important cause X] didn\u2019t need anyway.\u201d I may be missing something, but I basically don\u2019t get this point of view at all: there are lots of people who can be helpful with important causes who don\u2019t have the time or dedication to figure everything out for themselves, and for whom media narratives and first impressions matter. (I definitely think this applies to the causes I\u2019m most focused on.)\n\n</li><li>And even if I <em>should</em> put zero weight on these types of considerations, I think this is just unrealistic, akin to trying to work every waking hour or be 100% altruistic or be 100% open with everyone at all times. I <em>do</em> care about bad press, I\u2019m not going to make myself not care, and it seems better to deal with that as a factor in my life than try to white-knuckle myself into ignoring it. If I\u2019m slower and more careful to write up my thoughts, I face less of a tradeoff between truth-seeking and PR considerations. That brings me to the next point.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<strong>I think cold takes will be more open and honest. </strong>If I\u2019m rushing my writing or trying to avoid harm from bad-faith readers, these are forces pushing away from stating things as I really see them. The same applies to just being unconsciously influenced by the knowledge that what I write will have a particularly large and hard-to-model audience.\n</p>\n<p>\nTo be clear, I try to make all of my public writing open and honest, but this is a matter of effort - not just intention - and I expect to do it better if I have longer. Taking more time means I face fewer distortive forces, and it gives me more chances to reflect and think: \u201cIs this really my take? Do I really stand behind it?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>I\u2019m especially busy right now. </strong>There is an awful lot of chaos right now, and a lot of urgent priorities, including <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HPdWWetJbv4z8eJEe/open-phil-is-seeking-applications-from-grantees-impacted-by\">setting policies on funding for people affected by the situation</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mCCutDxCavtnhxhBR/some-comments-on-recent-ftx-related-events\">thinking about what our new funding standards should be generally</a>, and deciding what public statements are urgent enough to make. (I note that a lot of other people are similarly dealing with hugely increased workloads right now.) Reflecting on lessons learned is very important in the long run, and I expect to get to it over the coming months, but it\u2019s not currently the most time-sensitive priority.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Bottom line. </strong>I\u2019ll continue to put out public comments when I think there\u2019s an especially important, time-sensitive benefit to be had. And I do expect to put out my reflections on this matter (or to endorse someone else\u2019s if they capture enough of mine) sometime in the next few months. But my guess is that my next major public piece will be about AI risk, not FTX. I\u2019ve been working on some AI risk content for a long time. \n</p>\n\n<!-- Footnotes themselves at the bottom. -->\n\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr>\n<ol><li id=\"fn1\">\n<p>\n     Though I do worry that when the smoke has cleared, I\u2019ll look back and think, \u201cGosh, that message was all wrong - it\u2019s much better to rush out hot takes than to take my time and focus on cold ones.

They <i>know</i> deep in their hearts that it's hard to argue with the core EA values that we should use reason, evidence, and open debate to try to reduce suffering, and to promote a better long-term future. They've been waiting for an opportunity to attack EA as hypocritical or hyper-earnest, as hyper-rational or irrational, as hyper-nerdy or suspiciously cool, as hyper-sexual or incel-adjacent asexual -- anything they can think of. &nbsp; Just remember -- if you wouldn't have taken any misguided, uninformed, snarky critiques of EA seriously last month, don't take them seriously this week.

But these choices are rarely acknowledged or discussed by decision-makers, all of them are controversial, and they have significant implications for how resources should be distributed.</p><p>We set out two crucial philosophical issues: (A) an account of the badness of death, how to determine the relative value of deaths at different ages, and (B) locating the neutral point, the place on the wellbeing scale at which life is neither good nor bad for someone. We then illustrate how different choices for (A) and (B) alter the cost-effectiveness of three charities which operate in low-income countries, provide different interventions, and are considered to be some of the most cost-effective ways to help others: <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/Default.aspx\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>&nbsp;(insecticide-treated nets), <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/?gclid%3DCjwKCAiA68ebBhB-EiwALVC-NqHzPD-4GBxQ-_6cVv0Pb7Fk7mWVRxAIQMqTtzhkfvmlOJOAGCM41BoC4tcQAvD_BwE\">GiveDirectly</a>&nbsp;(cash transfers), and <a href=\"https://strongminds.org/\">StrongMinds</a>&nbsp;(group therapy for depression). We assess all three in terms of wellbeing-adjusted life years (WELLBYs) and explain why we do not, and cannot, use standard health metrics (QALYs and DALYs) for this purpose. We show how much cost-effectiveness changes by shifting from one extreme of (reasonable) opinion to the other. At one end, AMF is 1.3x better than StrongMinds. At the other,&nbsp;StrongMinds is 12x better than AMF. We do not advocate for any particular view. Our aim is simply to show that these philosophical choices are decision-relevant and merit further discussion.</p><p>Our results are displayed in the chart below, which plots the cost-effectiveness of the three charities in WELLBYs/$1,000.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi1xlnmdsih8\"><sup><a href=\"#fni1xlnmdsih8\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668937250/mirroredImages/JgqEqsa6iAtqGLYmw/cdpcke2c1kmuvriheps7.png\"></p><p>StrongMinds and GiveDirectly are represented with flat, dashed lines because their cost-effectiveness does not change under the different assumptions. The changes in AMF\u2019s cost-effectiveness are a result of two varying factors. One is using different <i>accounts of the badness of death</i>, that is, ways to assign value to saving lives at different ages; these three accounts go by unintuitive names in the philosophical literature, so we\u2019ve put a slogan in brackets after each one to clarify their differences: <i>deprivationism</i>&nbsp;(prioritise the youngest), the <i>time-relative interest account</i>&nbsp;(prioritise older children over infants), and <i>Epicureanism</i>&nbsp;(death isn\u2019t bad for anyone \u2013 prioritise living well, not living long). We also consider including two variants of the <i>time-relative interest account</i> (<i>TRIA</i>); on these, life has a maximum value at the ages of either 5 or 25. The other factor is where to locate the <i>neutral point</i>, the place at which someone has overall zero wellbeing, on a 0-10 life satisfaction scale; we assess that as being at each location between 0/10 and 5/10. As you can see, AMF\u2019s cost-effectiveness changes a lot. It is only more cost-effective than StrongMinds if you adopt <i>deprivationism</i> and place the neutral point below 1.</p><h1>1.&nbsp;Introduction</h1><p>How should we compare the value of extending lives to improving lives? Let\u2019s focus our minds with a real choice. On current estimates, for <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/cost-to-save-a-life\">around $4,500</a>,&nbsp;you can expect to save one child\u2019s life by providing insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Alternatively, that sum could provide a $1,000 cash transfer to four-and-a-half families living in extreme poverty ($1,000 is about a year\u2019s household income).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqqah679jzw\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqqah679jzw\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The cost of both choices is the same, but the outcomes differ. Which one will do the most good?</p><p>This is a difficult and discomforting ethical question. How might we answer it?&nbsp;And how much would different answers change the priorities?</p><p>There are various methods we might draw on to make the comparison, such as&nbsp;health measures (DALYs and QALYs), subjective wellbeing measures (WELLBYs), or combining the judgements of experts, beneficiaries, and donors (e.g. GiveWell\u2019s <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8whqn2GrJfvTjhov6/measuring-good-better-1%23What_goes_into_GiveWell_s_moral_weights__\">moral weights approach</a>). However, whichever method we use, we must make some philosophical assumptions.</p><p>There are two philosophical issues that make a significant difference to the relative value of improving lives to extending lives. Specifically, these are: (A) an account of the&nbsp;badness of death, and (B) the location of the neutral point on a wellbeing scale. How we settle these two questions can change whether it's better to extend or improve lives.</p><p>Although there is philosophical literature on these topics,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn4q3553n7zm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn4q3553n7zm\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;they have received surprisingly little attention within the effective altruism community,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3bsnzpc8hyb\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3bsnzpc8hyb\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;particularly given their potentially significant influence on decision-making. To address this issue, the charity evaluator GiveWell assigns \u2018moral weights\u2019 to deaths at different ages compared to doublings of consumption (see Figure 1). For instance, saving the life of a 5-to-9-year-old is deemed to have the same value as 134 years of doubled consumption. GiveWell derives these numbers by surveying its staff, its donors, and its beneficiaries and then weighting their answers (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hOQf6Ug1WpoicMyFDGoqH7tmf3Njjc15Z1DGERaTbnI/edit%23\">GiveWell, 2020</a>). However, there is no public discussion of why - for what reasons, on what grounds - someone might choose one moral weight rather than another. Are these weights sensible? How could we tell? Nor is there discussion of how much difference this choice makes. Do ethical choices matter, or do you get essentially the same answer whatever \u2018reasonable\u2019 theoretical position you take?<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2rxeeykdia5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2rxeeykdia5\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Figure 1</strong>:&nbsp;GiveWell\u2019s disvalue of death at different&nbsp;ages in units of doubling consumption</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668937250/mirroredImages/JgqEqsa6iAtqGLYmw/nlrhfmdd319qzc6iitaa.png\"></p><p><i><strong>Note</strong>: This graph comes from GiveWell (</i><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hOQf6Ug1WpoicMyFDGoqH7tmf3Njjc15Z1DGERaTbnI/edit%23\"><i>2020</i></a><i>).

Philosophical issues in the valuation of extending lives</h1><p>The standard metrics for combining quality and quantity of life are quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), two measures of health that were developed in the latter third of the 20th century (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/21/5/402/578296\">Sassi, 2006</a>). On the QALY model, health states are modelled as values between 0 (death) and 1 (full health). For instance, two years lived at 0.5 would have a value of 1 QALY, as would one year of perfect health, and so on. This allows different health improvements to be quantified and compared in the same units. The DALY is essentially the same, but it is a measure of loss, rather than gain: 1 represents full disability and 0 represents no disability.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj0zhyh1l27\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj0zhyh1l27\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A principal motivation&nbsp;for the DALY was the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, which sought to quantify health trends and challenges worldwide (<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)61680-8/fulltext\">Salomon et al., 2012</a>).</p><p>In the earlier (1990-2010) versions of the GBD, deaths were considered to be the worst for 10-year-olds. In the 2010-2015 version, the deaths of infants&nbsp;were considered worse than those of 10-year-olds, but stillbirths did not generate any disease burden (see <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/saving-people-from-the-harm-of-death-9780190921415?cc%3Dus%26lang%3Den%26\">Gamlud and Solberg, 2019</a>, pp. 6-12 and references therein). This raises the question, \u2018what is the worst age to die?\u2019, and highlights issues that are referred to in the philosophical literature as <i>the badness of death</i> (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2214297\">Nagel, 1970</a>; <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/11421?login%3Dfalse\">Feldman, 1992</a>; <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/weighing-lives-9780199243761?cc%3Dus%26lang%3Den%26\">Broome, 2004</a>; <a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/saving-people-from-the-harm-of-death-9780190921415?cc%3Dus%26lang%3Den%26\">Gamlud and Solberg, 2019</a>). In section 2.1, we set out&nbsp;the three main accounts - <i>deprivationism</i>, the <i>time-relative interest account</i>, and <i>Epicureanism</i> - and show how the relative values of saving a life at different ages vary substantially between, and even within, them. In section 2.2, we turn to a further issue, that of the <i>neutral point</i>.</p><h2>2.1 Accounts of the badness of death</h2><h3>Deprivationism&nbsp;(prioritise the youngest)</h3><p>The more recent version of the GBD implies a <i>deprivationist</i> account of the badness of death.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpbgp8f1ecb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpbgp8f1ecb\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;On this, the badness of death consists in the difference between the wellbeing you <i>actually</i>&nbsp;had compared&nbsp;to how much you <i>would</i>&nbsp;have had if you\u2019d lived longer. That\u2019s why it\u2019s better to save the youngest lives: they have more to lose than older ones. Two leading proponents are Broome (<a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/weighing-lives-9780199243761?cc%3Dus%26lang%3Den%26\">2004</a>) and Bradley (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/11993\">2009</a>).</p><p>Formulaically, the badness of death on<i> deprivationism</i>&nbsp;is:</p><p><i>wellbeing lost = wellbeing level x&nbsp;years of life lost</i></p><p>For example, if someone is expected to live 50 years at wellbeing level 1, then the badness of their death would be equivalent to 50 \u2018units\u2019 of wellbeing lost. We return to the issue of determining \u2018wellbeing levels\u2019, particularly in relation to a \u2018zero\u2019 level, in section 2.2.</p><p>The counter-intuitive aspect of this view is that it requires us to draw an awkwardly sharp line about the time at which death begins to be bad. If we draw the line at birth, then there would be no disvalue in ending a life immediately beforehand.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefl12yuzzg6os\"><sup><a href=\"#fnl12yuzzg6os\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This problem is not removed by putting the line elsewhere.</p><h3>The time-relative&nbsp;interest account (prioritise older children over infants)</h3><p>An alternative, <i>gradualist</i>, approach is to say that death starts to be bad at a certain age but then becomes worse and reaches its peak badness at some later stage.</p><p>In philosophy, this position is associated with the<i> time-relative interest account</i>&nbsp;(<i>TRIA</i>) of the badness of death (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/12524\">McMahan, 2002</a>). The idea behind <i>TRIA</i> is that the badness of death does not consist only of the wellbeing one would have had, but also in how psychologically connected the person is to their later self. As infants are only weakly psychologically connected to their later selves, their \u2018interest\u2019&nbsp;in living may be less than that of an adult, even though the infant has more years to live.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefflc27wjbsif\"><sup><a href=\"#fnflc27wjbsif\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This view takes inspiration from Derek Parfit\u2019s work on personal identity and his conclusion that what prudentially matters in survival are certain kinds of psychological connectedness, rather than the physical continuity of our bodies&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/12484\">Parfit, 1986</a>). <i>TRIA</i> could justify the stance taken in the earlier versions of the GBD on which saving 10-years-olds is more valuable than saving infants. It could also explain the intuitions many have that abortion is permissible - foetuses have comparatively limited interests compared to their mothers - and that earlier-stage abortions are less bad than later ones.</p><p>As we might expect, <i>TRIA</i> comes with its own theoretical challenges.</p><p>Here\u2019s one problematic case.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwkfhcckhca\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwkfhcckhca\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A woman is pregnant. She can take a drug that will treat an illness but will cause substantial birth defects (a real-life example of this would be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide\">Thalidomide</a>). According to <i>TRIA</i>, the mother would do little or nothing wrong in taking the drug because the foetus currently has quite weak interests in its own future. Intuitively, however, the mother should not take the drug.</p><p>If one accepts some sort of gradualist view, the further question is: how does it work, exactly?<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzdzbqqvdi7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzdzbqqvdi7\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As we saw in Figure 1 earlier, GiveWell - like the earlier version of the GBD - adopts <i>a</i> gradualist&nbsp;approach to saving lives, but this is not the only possible one. How much difference might it make to choose some version of <i>TRIA</i>&nbsp;relative to <i>deprivationism</i>?</p><p>We\u2019ve illustrated some simple versions of <i>TRIA</i>&nbsp;in Figure 2 below, where psychological connectedness begins six&nbsp;months after conception&nbsp;and constantly increases until the&nbsp;\u2018age of full connectivity\u2019 occurs at 5, 15, or 25, after which it stays at its maximum level. In equation form, we can present the badness of death according to <i>TRIA</i>&nbsp;as:</p><p><i>wellbeing lost = wellbeing level x&nbsp;years of life lost&nbsp;x&nbsp;TRIA discount(age of death, age of connectivity)</i></p><p><strong>Figure&nbsp;2</strong>: The badness of death at different ages&nbsp;on <i>deprivationism </i>and<i> </i>versions of <i>TRIA</i>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668937250/mirroredImages/JgqEqsa6iAtqGLYmw/s0u4x50s0wfygst6ygs4.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac898277fd1d05d5f7f449af3203ebaa84f5b2b9ff33c5bb.png/w_190 190w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac898277fd1d05d5f7f449af3203ebaa84f5b2b9ff33c5bb.png/w_380 380w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac898277fd1d05d5f7f449af3203ebaa84f5b2b9ff33c5bb.png/w_570 570w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac898277fd1d05d5f7f449af3203ebaa84f5b2b9ff33c5bb.png/w_760 760w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac898277fd1d05d5f7f449af3203ebaa84f5b2b9ff33c5bb.png/w_950 950w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac898277fd1d05d5f7f449af3203ebaa84f5b2b9ff33c5bb.png/w_1140 1140w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac898277fd1d05d5f7f449af3203ebaa84f5b2b9ff33c5bb.png/w_1330 1330w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac898277fd1d05d5f7f449af3203ebaa84f5b2b9ff33c5bb.png/w_1520 1520w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac898277fd1d05d5f7f449af3203ebaa84f5b2b9ff33c5bb.png/w_1710 1710w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/ac898277fd1d05d5f7f449af3203ebaa84f5b2b9ff33c5bb.png/w_1842 1842w\"></figure><p>As you can see, the value of saving a 5-year-old who would live 65 more years is worth 65 \u2018happy years\u2019 if the \u2018age of connectivity\u2019 (AC) is 5. However, it\u2019s only worth 21 years (2/3rds smaller) if AC is 15, and worth 12 years (over 80% smaller) if AC is 25. Hence, there can be quite substantial differences in how to value a life, even within a gradualist approach. We do not aim to settle the question of which version of this view is best here, so much as notice their importance. For a discussion of what the view should be, see Norheim (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/2706/chapter/143152005\">2019</a>), Mogensen (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/2706/chapter/143154672\">2019</a>), and McMahan (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/2706/chapter/143162226\">2019</a>).</p><h3>Epicureanism&nbsp;(prioritise living well over living long)</h3><p>The third account of the badness of death is <i>Epicureanism</i>, named after the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus, who argued that death could not be bad for those who die on the grounds that nothing can be bad for us if we do not exist (<a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Epicurus/menoec.html\">Hicks, 2009</a>). To be clear, Epicureans accept that dying can be painful and that a person\u2019s death can be bad for others; they only deny that a person\u2019s death can be bad <i>for them</i>. This view may seem implausible, given that we tend to think our own deaths would be bad for us, but Epicureans can raise three non-trivial puzzles for conventional views (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/2706/chapter-abstract/143159025?redirectedFrom%3Dfulltext\">Solberg, 2019</a>):</p><ul><li><i>Experience</i>: We often think that something cannot be good or bad for us unless we experience it. But, when we are dead, we cannot experience anything, so how can death be worse (or better) for us?</li><li><i>Time</i>: For something to be good(/bad) for us, there must be a time at which it is good(/bad) for us. But our future death is not bad for us whilst we are alive, and it is unclear how it is bad for us once we cease to exist.</li><li><i>Symmetry</i>: We don\u2019t think that our non-existence before our lives harmed us, but there is no difference between not existing before and after our lives. Therefore, our after-life non-existence is not a harm either.</li></ul><p>Philosophers disagree on whether and how these puzzles can be solved.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8pitopw87cd\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8pitopw87cd\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Although what we might call <i>strong Epicureanism</i>, the view that death is not bad at all, has few takers, there may be more sympathy for <i>weak Epicureanism</i>, where death can be bad, but relatively more weight is given to living well than living long.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2yidbs71gwu\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2yidbs71gwu\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In our later calculations, we only model <i>strong Epicureanism</i>.</p><p>The three views discussed in this section give very different accounts of the badness of death. The first two of these,<i> deprivationism</i>&nbsp;and <i>TRIA</i>, are illustrated in Figure 2 above. <i>Epicureanism</i>&nbsp;requires no illustration as there is no badness to death at any age. We will examine the implications of these views for charity evaluations in section 3.</p><h2>2.2 The neutral point</h2><p>In this section, we turn to another important philosophical choice, the location of the neutral point, the level of wellbeing that existence is neither good nor bad for someone. Why does this matter?</p><p>To compare&nbsp;life-improvements and life-extensions, we need to combine the quality and quantity of life into a single unit. We discussed how this can be done using QALYs and DALYs at the start of section 2: on the QALY, health states are usually between 1 (full health) and 0 (equivalent to death). The reason we need a measure of quality is because we\u2019re not just interested in <i>how long</i> an intervention&nbsp;benefits someone, but also <i>how much</i> it benefits them. Any measure of the quality of life must include a <i>neutral point</i>. We need this to know how much better life is than some principled zero level. If we don\u2019t know how much benefit people get from different outcomes, it\u2019s impossible to allocate limited resources to do the most good. We discuss the idea that we should ignore quality of life when saving lives in a footnote.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv401pzmcpq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv401pzmcpq\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>An initial issue with the neutral point is whether it even makes sense to say that lives can be bad. The QALY and DALY are both constructed by asking members of the public to make hypothetical trade-offs (e.g. how many years with illness X would be as good as Y years of full health?). One difference that <i>is</i>&nbsp;important, however, is that the QALY allows individuals to be in \u2018states worse than death\u2019 (SWD), whereas, on the DALY, death is the worst possible state (<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.100901.140513\">Gold et al., 2002</a>; <a href=\"https://www.valueinhealthjournal.com/article/S1098-3015(10)60046-0/pdf?_returnURL%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%252Fretrieve%252Fpii%252FS1098301510600460%253Fshowall%253Dtrue\">Weinstein et al., 2009</a>).</p><p>What\u2019s puzzling about the DALY approach is that we typically think it <i>is&nbsp;</i>possible to be in a state worse than death - a life of unrelenting misery and torture, for instance.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1lkrrrukki4\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1lkrrrukki4\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Part of the argument for legalising physician-assisted suicide is that death can, sometimes, be better for somebody. If living longer is always better, such an intervention could never be justified on cost-effectiveness grounds. By artificially inserting a \u2018floor\u2019 on how bad life can be, the DALY approach biases healthcare resources towards extending lives over improving lives.</p><p>Yet, what\u2019s unsettling about the QALY approach is this implication: if people are in states worse than death, then it is bad to extend their lives, even if those people want to keep living and we could extend their lives for free. For this reason, Scheider (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11136-021-03052-4.pdf\">2021</a>) considers the QALY objectionably \u2018ableist\u2019.</p><p>There are a couple of reasons why we might find it unsettling to say that saving lives is bad. Once we recognise those, it is easier to believe there are states worse than death.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3qh97b6qmft\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3qh97b6qmft\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>First, it seems like a double unfairness if we think that it\u2019s a bad thing to provide life-extending support to unhappy lives: not only has the person been unlucky enough to end up in an unpleasant condition, but now, because of that, they won\u2019t get life-extending medical care. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that it would still count as valuable to provide life-<i>improving</i>&nbsp;care to those in \u2018states worse than death\u2019, so the QALY approach does not flatly rule out doing anything. Indeed, we often do have the intuition, at least for those who are suffering and at the end of life, that the priority is palliative care - making them comfortable rather than prolonging their lives at any cost.</p><p>Another explanation is that we don\u2019t trust the accuracy of health measures. After all, these are typically created by asking members of the public to make hypothetical trade-offs, not by asking the people in specific health states how they feel about their own lives. For instance, Bernfort et al. (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11136-018-1848-x\">2018</a>), looking at a cohort of elderly Swedes, find that although 1.8% are deemed to be in states worse than death (because they have health conditions assigned negative QALY weights), 45% of the people in that category said they were \u2018happy\u2019 or \u2018fairly happy\u2019 (55% said they were \u2018not happy\u2019). Perhaps the problem is not with the idea that there can, <i>in theory</i>, be states worse than death; rather, the issue is that the QALY health measure does not, <i>in practice</i>, do a good job of drawing the line in the right place.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8iymx1smfww\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8iymx1smfww\">[18]</a></sup></span></p><p>An obvious solution is to use <i>subjective wellbeing</i> surveys, individuals\u2019 self-assessments of their happiness and/or life satisfaction, to work out how well or badly their lives are going. At the Happier Lives Institute, we have long argued for the use of subjective wellbeing measures, and for just this sort of reason (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dk48Sn6hpbMWeJo4G/to-wellby-or-not-to-wellby-measuring-non-health-non\">McGuire et al., 2022a</a>; <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FvbTKrEQWXwN5A6Tb/a-happiness-manifesto-why-and-how-effective-altruism-should\">Plant, 2018</a>). MacAskill (<a href=\"https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/william-macaskill/what-we-owe-the-future/9781541618633/\">2022, Chapter 9</a>) has recently argued for them too.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyp7vwbjybm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyp7vwbjybm\">[19]</a></sup></span></p><p>However, this brings us to a further challenge. It\u2019s unclear where to put the neutral point on different subjective wellbeing scales, and almost no research has been done on this topic (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/estimating-moral-weights/\">Donaldson et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"https://whatweowethefuture.com/\">MacAskill, 2022</a>). On life satisfaction scales, where 0 is typically marked as \u2018not all satisfied\u2019 and 10 as \u2018completely satisfied\u2019, there is no clear indication of what respondents should interpret as the neutral point.</p><p>Some wellbeing researchers&nbsp;are inclined to interpret 0 as the neutral point&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id%3D3590884\">Layard et al., 2020</a>), but it\u2019s unclear what the justification is for this. It runs into the same issue raised above for DALYs: it implies, implausibly, that people can only live good lives. Those who give themselves the lowest scores, 0 out of 10, would be assumed to have neutral lives.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefokdc0039iqa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnokdc0039iqa\">[20]</a></sup></span></p><p>Other wellbeing researchers, such as Diener et al. (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29592656/\">2018</a>), appear to treat the midway point on the scale as the neutral point (i.e., 5 on a 0-10 scale). This might seem the more natural interpretation, but this also yields odd results. It suggests that a&nbsp;large share of the world\u2019s population has negative wellbeing (average life satisfaction in Rwanda is <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/happiness-cantril-ladder\">around 3</a>, for example). If we think the average Rwandan lives an overall good life, that might suggest: (1) the neutral point is below 5/10 on the life satisfaction scale; (2) life satisfaction is the wrong measure of wellbeing - perhaps we believe happiness is what matters, and Rwandans are happy, but not satisfied with life<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbot9o8s684r\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbot9o8s684r\">[21]</a></sup></span>; (3) wellbeing will increase in Rwanda, so saving the average life is positive <i>in expectation</i>, even if it isn\u2019t right now;&nbsp;or (4) some combination of (1)-(3).</p><p>We might suppose, then, that the&nbsp;neutral point on the life satisfaction scale is <i>somewhere</i> between 0 and 5.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref33lki8pf39l\"><sup><a href=\"#fn33lki8pf39l\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Yet, any particular choice here seems arbitrary - why 2 rather than 3, for instance? It also implies a \u2018lop-sided\u2019 scale where the negative end of the scale is shorter than the positive end. This clashes with the intuition that the worst possible lives are worse than the best possible lives are good. See Donaldson et al. (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/estimating-moral-weights/\">2020</a>) for more details.</p><p>Empirical work on how individuals interpret the scale could be helpful but is extremely limited. A small (n = 75) survey in the UK found that respondents would choose death over life at a life satisfaction level of about 2/10&nbsp;(Peasgood et al., unpublished, as referenced in <a href=\"https://fdslive.oup.com/www.oup.com/academic/pdf/openaccess/9780192896803.pdf\">Krekel &amp; Frijters, 2021</a>). A survey of people living in poverty in Ghana and Kenya estimated the neutral point as 0.56 (<a href=\"https://www.idinsight.org/project/using-peoples-preferences-and-values-to-inform-funding-decisions/\">IDinsight, 2019</a>, p. 92; n = 70). There are also preliminary results from a sample of 600 in the USA, Brazil, and China that finds a neutral point of 25/100 (Jamison &amp; Shukla, private communication). At the Happier Lives Institute, we are currently working on our own survey to explore this topic further and hope to share our results soon.</p><p>In section 3, we do not take a position on where the neutral point is when making our calculations. Instead, we explore how different neutral points between 0 and 5 on a 0-10 scale affect the cost-effectiveness of&nbsp;life-improving and life-extending interventions.</p><p>How much difference could the location of the neutral point make if we use subjective wellbeing scales? We will say that 1 WELLBY (wellbeing-adjusted life year) is equivalent to a 1-point <i>improvement</i> on a 0-10 life satisfaction scale for 1 year. This is similar to how 1 year of life at full health is 1 QALY, except that wellbeing runs on a 0-10 scale, not a 0-1 scale. The location of the neutral point is irrelevant for improving <i>quality</i>&nbsp;of life: if Alice\u2019s quality of life increases by 1 point for 2 years that is worth 2 WELLBYs. However, suppose that we can <i>extend</i>&nbsp;Bob\u2019s life for 1 year and Bob rates his wellbeing at 6/10. If the neutral point were 5, this is worth 1 WELLBY. If the neutral point were 0, this is worth 6 WELLBYs. Clearly, this is a large difference.&nbsp;</p><p>This issue&nbsp;becomes sharper if our efforts to save lives focus on low-income countries where, as a consequence of lower prosperity, wellbeing levels are lower. Such individuals will be closer to the neutral point than those in high-income countries, and a non-trivial proportion may be below it. Although this thought is unpleasant it should not be surprising: if we aim to help those in poverty because we think poverty is very bad, then we must already accept that those in poverty have lower wellbeing.</p><p>When we\u2019re assessing the value of extending a life in terms of wellbeing, we need to consider the change in <i>net </i>wellbeing. Take our formula for <i>deprivationism</i>:&nbsp;</p><p><i>wellbeing lost = wellbeing level x&nbsp;years of life lost</i></p><p>The existence of a neutral point implies that the wellbeing level refers to<i> net</i>&nbsp;wellbeing, that is, how much higher (or lower) wellbeing is than the neutral point (wherever it is).</p><h1>3. How do philosophical assumptions change the cost-effectiveness of top charities?</h1><p>In section 2 we discussed how philosophy influences the value of extending a life. In this section, we crunch the numbers to illustrate how much difference this could make. To do this, we compare three charities which operate in low-income countries and are considered to be some of the most cost-effective ways to help others. Two are life-improving charities: <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly,</a>&nbsp;which provides cash transfers, and <a href=\"https://strongminds.org/\">StrongMinds</a>, which treats depression using group psychotherapy. The third, the <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>&nbsp;(AMF), provides long-lasting insecticide-treated nets for protection against malaria; the main benefit of this is taken to be life-saving.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0wfequ2gcmq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0wfequ2gcmq\">[23]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>We assess the cost-effectiveness of each charity using a subjective wellbeing (WELLBY) framework. We\u2019ve argued that effectiveness should be assessed in WELLBYs in general (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dk48Sn6hpbMWeJo4G/to-wellby-or-not-to-wellby-measuring-non-health-non\">McGuire et al., 2022a</a>). In this case, it\u2019s unclear how else we could capture the benefits of cash transfers, bednets, and psychotherapy in any other common unit. What would we use? Wealth? Health? Effects on wealth might be a good way to assess the impact of cash transfers, but not those of being alive or depression-free. Equally, effects on health might capture the value of bednets and therapy, but presumably, the value of alleviating poverty isn\u2019t just that it improves health.</p><p>To make this comparison, we combine and extend several earlier pieces of work. We\u2019ve already estimated the cost-effectiveness of GiveDirectly and StrongMinds in WELLBYs. First, we undertook meta-analytic cost-effectiveness assessments of cash transfers and psychotherapy (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/cash-transfers-cost-effectiveness-analysis/\">McGuire &amp; Plant, 2021a</a>, <a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/strongminds-cost-effectiveness-analysis/\">McGuire &amp; Plant 2021b</a>). We then used those results to estimate and compare the cost-effectiveness of GiveDirectly and StrongMinds, which we consider as \u2018best in class\u2019 organisations for implementing each intervention (see <a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/donating-money-buying-happiness/\">McGuire &amp; Plant, 2021c</a>&nbsp;for the original comparison and <a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/happiness-for-the-whole-family/\">McGuire et al., 2022b</a>&nbsp;for an updated version which incorporates household spillover effects). We found that GiveDirectly\u2019s cash transfers produce 8 WELLBYs/$1,000&nbsp;and StrongMinds\u2019 psychotherapy produces 77 WELLBYs/$1,000, making the latter about 10 times more cost-effective than GiveDirectly.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1fm4rywn7ke\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1fm4rywn7ke\">[24]</a></sup></span></p><p>We\u2019ve also done an initial estimate of the relative values of doubling consumption and saving the life of a 5-year-old using a WELLBY approach (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/estimating-moral-weights/\">Donaldson et al., 2020</a>). The main two additions in this report are: (1) we estimate cost as well as effectiveness; (2) we show how the results change under several different assumptions about the badness of death and the location of the neutral point.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefareow8zjwfq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnareow8zjwfq\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In other words, now we\u2019ve got some key pieces of the jigsaw puzzle we\u2019re working out, for the first time, how they fit together.</p><p>There are two key findings.</p><p>First, the philosophical factors can radically alter the cost-effectiveness of life-extending interventions. On the assumptions most favourable to extending lives, AMF is about 30% more cost-effective than StrongMinds.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq1h7vkr2p7n\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq1h7vkr2p7n\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;On the assumptions least&nbsp;favourable to extending lives, StrongMinds is around 12 times more cost-effective than AMF.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh6aeqid55it\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh6aeqid55it\">[27]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We unpack the details of this below. We consider these results noteworthy, and hopefully a useful corrective to the idea that philosophy is not an important factor in these choices.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyjjc10i3c99\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyjjc10i3c99\">[28]</a></sup></span></p><p>Second, these comparisons could be sensitive to the estimates of AMF\u2019s life-<i>improving</i>&nbsp;effects. The two we consider are: (1) averting the grief of bereaved family and friends; and (2) an income-increasing effect: a reduced incidence of malaria, particularly in childhood, may help people earn more in later life. (1) is unproblematic; we estimate this to be 2.5 WELLBYs/$1,000, a non-trivial but relatively small factor. (2) is more challenging. Taking GiveWell\u2019s income-increasing effects at face value, and converting them into WELLBYs, implies that (2) is about 17 WELLBYs/$1,000. This seems implausibly large. It implies that AMF (if we only count its income effect is 3x more cost-effective than GiveDirectly\u2019s cash transfers, which directly aim to reduce poverty. After further analysis, we think a more realistic figure of the income effects of bednets is 4 WELLBY/$1,000, about a quarter of the size.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefugtcuurlbv\"><sup><a href=\"#fnugtcuurlbv\">[29]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We explain how we reached this figure in Appendix A.</p><p>We will now show how we estimated the cost-effectiveness of AMF in WELLBYs, how this changes under different philosophical assumptions, and how it compares to GiveDirectly and StrongMinds. In the following three subsections, we consider the three different accounts of the badness of death and, where relevant, vary the neutral point.</p><h3>3.1 Deprivationism results</h3><p>We start with the simplest account, <i>deprivationism</i>. On this view:</p><p><i>badness of death&nbsp;= net wellbeing level x&nbsp;years of life lost</i></p><p>We assume that the average age of the individual who dies from malaria is 20 years old<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhw2kjk1aw8o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhw2kjk1aw8o\">[30]</a></sup></span>, they would expect to live to 70, and so preventing their death leads to 50 extra years.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpjn05e9htr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpjn05e9htr\">[31]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We estimate their average expected life satisfaction to be 4.95/10.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5qo9297i87\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5qo9297i87\">[32]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Hence, the WELLBYs gained by the person whose death is prevented is (4.95 - neutral point) * (70 - 20).</p><p>According to GiveWell, it costs $3,000 for AMF to prevent a death (on average).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe4fh9egp0h8\"><sup><a href=\"#fne4fh9egp0h8\">[33]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Before we calculate the cost-effectiveness, we must also&nbsp;add the life-improving effects of providing malaria prevention. We estimate the grief-averting effect of preventing a death is 7 WELLBYs for each death prevented (see Appendix A.2), so 2.4 WELLBYs/$1,000. We estimate the income-increasing effects to be 4 WELLBYs/$1,000 (see Appendix A.1).</p><p>We can now calculate the cost-effectiveness of AMF under different assumptions about the location of the neutral point.&nbsp;If the neutral point is zero, the value of preventing a death would become 4.95 * 50 = 247 WELLBYs; this gives a cost-effectiveness of 83 WELLBYs/$1,000. This, combined with the life-improving and grief-averting benefit of 7 WELLBYs leads to a total of 90 WELLBYs,/$1,000 which is represented in the first row of Table 1 below.</p><p>This result compares favourably to the cost-effectiveness of GiveDirectly and StrongMinds, which are 8 WELLBYs/$1,000 and 77 WELLBYs/$1,000, respectively. The interpretation of this multiple is that AMF, assuming <i>deprivationism</i>&nbsp;and a neutral point of 0, is 10.98&nbsp;times as cost-effective as GiveDirectly and 1.16 times as cost-effective as StrongMinds. We represent these as cost-effectiveness multiples in the last two columns of Table 1.</p><p>In Table 1, you can see that as the neutral point increases, the cost-effectiveness of AMF decreases considerably. At a neutral point of 5, AMF generates <i>negative</i>&nbsp;WELLBYs from its life-extending effects; the positive cost-effectiveness is driven entirely by AMF\u2019s life-improving effects.

Recall that <i>TRIA</i>&nbsp;captures the intuition that the badness of death depends, in part, on how psychologically connected someone is to their later self. This is why the deaths of very young children are less of a loss than older ones.</p><p>To produce this calculation, we need to stipulate the age that someone reaches \u2018full connectedness\u2019. In our model, we use a range of values between 5&nbsp;and 25 years. This choice makes a lot of difference in this case because many of those who die from malaria are very young (see Figure 3 below).</p><p><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Age at death from malaria using data from the Global Burden of Disease (<a href=\"http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params%3Dgbd-api-2019-permalink/2188c9ba6ba34edd5428a79ae29a216c\">2019</a>)</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668937250/mirroredImages/JgqEqsa6iAtqGLYmw/yuzbqi94mhf55iefbzb3.png\"></p><p>Although 58%&nbsp;of people who die from malaria are under five years old, due to the large number of older people who die from malaria, the average age of death is 20 (see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NMAU-a1X4vqjodjI6kf8KnUyCJaK9uyNvXWj5VetDZw/edit%23gid%3D945276981\">row 18</a>).

Instead, Table 2 displays combinations of the most and least generous assumptions about the neutral point and the age of connectivity, along with a middle option for both. As you can see, StrongMinds is more cost-effective than AMF in every case (between 1.1 to 12.5 times better) and GiveDirectly is less cost-effective than AMF except under the assumptions least favourable to extending lives.

On assumptions of higher neutral points and/or different accounts of the badness of death, AMF\u2019s cost-effectiveness drops away until it becomes about 12x less cost-effective than StrongMinds and has about the same cost-effectiveness as GiveDirectly. AMF never ends up much less cost-effective than GiveDirectly on our estimates due to the non-trivial life-improving effects of bednets from averting grief and increasing later income.</p><h1>4.&nbsp;Key uncertainties and directions for future research</h1><p>In the previous section, we showed how much difference it can make if we adopt different philosophical assumptions. This raises questions for further work.</p><p><strong>Which account of the badness of death is most plausible?</strong> We have not argued for one account in particular, so much as briefly motivated them and raised some issues. Given these are long-standing debates (again, see <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/2706\">Gamlund and Solberg 2019</a>), it\u2019s unclear how useful it would be for us to try to evaluate these views ourselves, rather than merely understand what the implications are of taking one or another position&nbsp;and communicating this to readers.</p><p><strong>Where is the neutral point?</strong> We think the neutral point is under-theorised and under-investigated. There has only&nbsp;been initial empirical work (see section 2.2) and we plan to run a larger survey (n&gt;1000) which could shed more light on how people interpret subjective scales.</p><p><strong>How&nbsp;big are AMF\u2019s life-improving effects?&nbsp;</strong>As flagged several times, these could be quite large, and our investigation into them has only been fairly shallow. However, we\u2019re unsure how much to prioritise this, given they are a relatively smaller issue than the philosophical ones.</p><p><strong>How should we deal with moral uncertainty?</strong> We\u2019ve shown that the philosophical assumptions matter and we expect readers are unlikely to be 100% confident in a single approach. How should we account for this uncertainty? \u2018Moral uncertainty\u2019 is a new, important, and complicated topic at the frontiers of academic philosophy. We don\u2019t have space to get into this in any depth here, but we will sketch the three approaches that seem to be on the table. We intend to return to this and write some guidance for donors and decision-makers.</p><ol><li><i>My Favourite Theory:</i> Choose the action recommended by which moral view you have the most credence (i.e. confidence). If you had, say, the greatest credence in <i>deprivationism</i>&nbsp;and a neutral point of 0/10, then you should choose whatever is best given those assumptions: in this case, AMF.</li><li><i>Maximise Expected Choiceworthiness:</i> Construct a weighted average of each option based on your credences in the different views and how good the option is on each view; you then choose the option that maximises expected chioceworthiness. In this case, you would award 100% of your resources to whichever life-improving or life-extending option was best. We don\u2019t run any numbers here: it should be clear from Figure 1 that the top life-improving option will be better unless one has the overwhelming weight of one\u2019s credences in both <i>deprivationism</i>&nbsp;and a very low neutral point.</li><li><i>Worldview Diversification&nbsp;</i>(<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/worldview-diversification/\">Karnofksy, 2016</a>): Divide your resources across different theoretical \u2018buckets\u2019 in proportion to your confidence in each theory, then choose the best option for each \u2018bucket\u2019. For example, if you have 30% credence in <i>deprivationism</i>&nbsp;and 100% credence that the neutral point is below one, you should award 30% of your resources to AMF and the rest to StrongMinds.</li></ol><p>(1) and (2) are discussed at length in the existing philosophical literature (<a href=\"https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phc3.12408\">Bykvist, 2017, </a><a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/moral-uncertainty-9780198722274?cc%3Dus%26lang%3Den%26\">MacAskill, Bykvist, Ord 2020</a>), whereas (3) has received little attention (see <a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/internal-bargaining/\">Plant, 2022b</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/property-rights/\">Lloyd, 2022</a>&nbsp;for explorations and tentative defences).</p><h1>5. Conclusion</h1><p>Two key philosophical issues seem to have barely featured in discussions about whether resources do more good if we prioritise extending or improving lives. They have, however, been there all along. And they can make a big difference to cost-effectiveness calculations and our conclusions about what the overall priority is. It\u2019s reasonable to disagree about these theoretical issues, so it\u2019s essential to bring these underlying assumptions to the surface. We do not have simple answers to the problems we raise - nor do we think there are any - but we hope we have clarified them and set the stage for further work.</p><h1>Appendix A:&nbsp;Estimating the life-improving effect of bednets</h1><p>In this appendix, we explain how we estimate the SWB life-improving benefits of malaria from increased incomes for the recipients of bednets and averted grief for their loved ones.</p><h2>A.1 Converting from economic benefits to WELLBYs</h2><p>To estimate the effects of malaria prevention on subjective wellbeing (SWB), we would like to use direct evidence of the causal effect of malaria prevention on SWB but we found no reliable data for this.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9zj9zgf8l0b\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9zj9zgf8l0b\">[35]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The data used in some of the causal studies of malaria prevention\u2019s effect also includes SWB variables (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hec.3781\">Shih &amp; Lin, 2019</a>; <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/684965\">Rawlings, 2016;</a> <a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695880\">Mora-Garci\u0301a, 2018</a>; <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22906550/\">Venkataramani, 2012</a>).&nbsp;However, we have not found an SWB analysis that uses these datasets.</p><p>Instead of using SWB evidence directly, we convert from malaria prevention\u2019s estimated economic benefits to WELLBYs. GiveWell estimates that spending $1,000 on AMF\u2019s malaria prevention programme increases economic benefits by 18 log-units&nbsp;(or about 13 doublings of income, row 247, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NMAU-a1X4vqjodjI6kf8KnUyCJaK9uyNvXWj5VetDZw\">\u201cModified\u201d tab</a>). McGuire et al. (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/a-dozen-doubts-about-givewell-s-numbers\">2022c</a>)&nbsp;explains how GiveWell arrived at these figures and argues why these effects on income are likely to be smaller and less certain than GiveWell\u2019s estimates.</p><p>We translate the economic benefits into WELLBYs by estimating what a log-unit increase in economic benefits predicts in WELLBYs. To estimate this figure, we&nbsp;use the model in our cash transfers meta-analysis&nbsp;where we moderate the SWB effect of cash transfers by the relative size of the transfer compared to previous income (Model 2 in Table 2 of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01252-z\">McGuire et al., 2022d</a>). We calculated the total benefits in SD-years using the \u2018area of the triangle\u2019 formula as illustrated and described in Figure 1 of McGuire and Plant (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/cash-transfers-cost-effectiveness-analysis/\">2021a</a>). Since a 1-unit increase in log-economic benefits is approximately a 70% increase in household income, plugging a 70% increase in income (1 log-unit) into Model 2 from Table 2 (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01252-z\">McGuire et al., 2022d</a>) leads to a 0.6 SD-year increase in SWB (row 23, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrBuiPVgL-t8hlr6EqkqABiaqdHMGkpvfeiqiiX49LU\">\u201cInputs\u201d tab</a>). To convert from SD-years to WELLBYs we multiply the SD-years by the average SD of life satisfaction (2.17, see row 8, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrBuiPVgL-t8hlr6EqkqABiaqdHMGkpvfeiqiiX49LU\">\u201cInputs\u201d tab</a>), which results in 0.6 x 2.17 = 1.3 WELLBYs.&nbsp;If we take these numbers at face value, $1,000 donated to AMF\u2019s malaria prevention programme creates 18&nbsp;x 1.3 = 23&nbsp;WELLBYs due to income-increasing effects. Note that this includes household spillovers because GiveWell includes household spillovers in their figure. In GiveWell\u2019s analysis, non-recipients receive a benefit that is 25% of the benefit received by the recipient. This is equivalent to GiveWell\u2019s 2x household multiplier for households of four&nbsp;(row 120, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NMAU-a1X4vqjodjI6kf8KnUyCJaK9uyNvXWj5VetDZw\">\u201cModified\u201d tab</a>).</p><p>However, there\u2019s a key difference between the way that cash transfers and malaria prevention increase incomes. When it comes to increases in income, part of the SWB benefit may be due to a comparison effect - comparing yourself with others and finding yourself better or worse off (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvd58t1t\">Clark et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-61962-6\">Easterlin, 2021</a>).&nbsp;Comparison effects apply to cash transfers, but they probably do not apply to malaria prevention. With mass distribution of bednets, the benefits accrue to everyone in an area, while cash transfers are only sent to the poorest. We estimate that these comparison/relative income effects comprise 26% of the total income effect.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjxyah713ef\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjxyah713ef\">[36]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Including this adjustment discounts the life-improving effect of malaria prevention from 23 down to 17 WELLBYs.</p><p>The final step is to incorporate various further discounts to AMF\u2019s income effects that we proposed in our recent essay critiquing GiveWell\u2019s CEAs (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/a-dozen-doubts-about-givewell-s-numbers\">McGuire et al., 2022c</a>). We won\u2019t restate all those details here, but the short version is that we identified several issues with GiveWell\u2019s calculations. We estimate that, cumulatively, this leads to a 75% reduction in the income effect relative to what GiveWell estimates (row 35, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrBuiPVgL-t8hlr6EqkqABiaqdHMGkpvfeiqiiX49LU\">sheet \u201cInputs\u201d</a>), or a (1 - 0.75) x 17 = 4 WELLBY effect. To frame this effect, we compare it to the other charities we\u2019ve analysed in Figure A1 below.</p><p><strong>Figure A1</strong>:&nbsp;Life-improving effect of charities in WELLBYs</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668937250/mirroredImages/JgqEqsa6iAtqGLYmw/zhf8ceyxamzurijsg78n.png\"></p><h2>A.2 Grief spillovers</h2><p>We do a shallow calculation for grief in the same way we did in Donaldson et al.

The best estimate we found is from Oswald and Powdthavee (<a href=\"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/52349/1/iewwp396.pdf\">2008</a>): a panel study in the UK which finds the effect on life satisfaction due to the death of a child in the last year as being -0.72 (adjusted for a 0-10 scale).&nbsp;According to Clark et al. (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvd58t1t\">2018</a>), the duration of grief is ~5 years. Based on <a href=\"https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/data/household-size-and-composition\">data from the UNDP</a>, we calculate that the average household size across the beneficiary countries (excluding the recipient of the nets) is 4.03 people (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NMAU-a1X4vqjodjI6kf8KnUyCJaK9uyNvXWj5VetDZw\">row 16</a>). Hence, an overall effect of grief per death prevented is (0.72 x 5 x 0.5) x 4.03 = 7.26 WELLBYs. However, we think this is an upper bound because it doesn\u2019t account for the counterfactual grief averted. If you avert the death of someone, they will still die at some point in the future, and the people who love them will still grieve.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn4vngdbp8bpr\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref4vngdbp8bpr\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Michael Plant originated the idea, undertook the philosophical research and wrote the final draft.

If we think it\u2019s better to save someone in their 20s than in their 70s, then we already think it\u2019s correct to account for the quantity of life. Presumably, we also agree it\u2019s better to cause a bigger increase in quality of life than a small one. So, how can it be consistent to value quality when improving lives, and quantity when extending lives, but not quality when extending lives?</p><p>The QALY and DALY frameworks combine quantity and quality into a single figure because the aim is to cause the largest benefit with the available resources. What\u2019s more, if we ignore quality of life when valuing the extension of life, that will lead to other problems. If something extends someone\u2019s life <i>and </i>improves their quality of life, e.g. a surgery to remove a painful tumour, what is the value of that? Do we ignore the improvement to quality of life? How would we compare the value of that to a similar surgery, that only improved quality of life?</p><p>Another important point to make is that, in saying it\u2019s better to save one life than another, we are not saying one person has greater <i>intrinsic worth</i>&nbsp;than another. Rather, the claim is that the people have the same intrinsic worth, but one gets a greater benefit than the other, and that\u2019s what matters. It\u2019s better to alleviate two days of pain for Alice than one day for Bob because Alice and Bob have the same moral worth, but Alice benefits more.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn1lkrrrukki4\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref1lkrrrukki4\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;In a survey of 667 Irish respondents, 67% disagreed with the statement \u201cIf I were severely ill with no hope of recovery, I would want to be kept alive at all costs\u201d (<a href=\"https://cora.ucc.ie/bitstream/handle/10468/475/McCarthy_Weafer_Loughrey_Irish_views_on_death_and_dying_a_national_survey_JME_2010.pdf?sequence%3D1\">McCarthy et al., 2010</a>).

Both papers argue from correlational evidence that this appears to be through an increase in mosquito-borne diseases (such as malaria). But neither of the studies pin down a causal link that runs through malaria prevalence. But according to Oheneba-Dornyo et al. (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10666-022-09817-6\">2022</a>), for every 1 mm increase in rainfall, there's an additional case of malaria two months afterwards. If rainfall increases by 79 mm (the SD of rainfall in Ghana) the predicted increase in the population with malaria cases will only be 0.1%. Also, rainfall seems too weakly related to malaria to be a primary driver of this effect, so we are very uncertain about this evidence. That seems insufficient to explain the rainfall shocks as a malaria story.</p><p>The second source of evidence we considered involves cerebral malaria. In ~1% of&nbsp;malaria cases, the malaria attacks the brain (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3056312/\">Idro, 2010</a>), which can result in mental debilitation. There\u2019s correlational evidence on small sample sizes that ~1 year after being infected with malaria, children with cerebral malaria have a greater likelihood of showing signs of a behavioural disorder (odd ratio: 8.5, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/trstmh/article-abstract/109/4/233/2461663\">Christensen &amp; Eslick, 2015</a>) or a mental disorder when compared to a control group of healthy kids (<a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/pediatrics/article-abstract/138/5/e20161965/60667/Long-term-Behavioral-Problems-in-Children-With?redirectedFrom%3Dfulltext\">Ssenkusu et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-10-334\">Bangirana et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09297049.2018.1451497\">Boivin et al., 2018</a>). But due to cerebral malaria\u2019s rarity, we think that preventing this would only constitute a small benefit. Neither of these separate strands of evidence update us much about the plausibility of the SWB effect of malaria exposure in childhood.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnjxyah713ef\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefjxyah713ef\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;The approach we took to estimate the importance of relative income effects was to see how much the magnitude of the absolute income coefficient decreases when you introduce a relative income coefficient (comparing yourself to your peers) to the equation.

And that means that community dynamics are incredibly important in shaping both the people involved, and the ideas. Healthy communities can make people happier, more effective, and better citizens locally and globally - but not all communities are healthy. A number of people have voiced concerns about the EA community in the recent past, and I said at the time that I think that we needed to take those concerns seriously. The failure of the community to realize what was happening with FTX isn\u2019t itself an indictment of the community - especially given that their major investors did not know - but it\u2019s a symptom that reinforces many of the earlier complaints.</p><p>The solutions seem unclear, but there are two very different paths that would address the failure - either reform, or rethinking the entire idea of EA as a community. So while people are thinking about changes, I\u2019d like to suggest that we not take the default path of least resistance reforms, at least without seriously considering the alternative.</p><h2>\u201cThe community\u201d failed?</h2><p>Many people have said that the EA community failed when they didn\u2019t realize what SBF was doing.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SP3Hkas3jo6i2cmqb/who-s-at-fault-for-ftx-s-wrongdoing\"><u>Others have responded</u></a> that no, we should not blame ourselves. (As an aside, when&nbsp;<i>Eliezer Yudkowsky</i> is telling you that you\u2019re overdoing heroic responsibility, you\u2019ve clearly gone too far.) But when someone begins giving to EA causes, whether individually, or via Founders Pledge, or via setting up something like SFF, there is no-one vetting them for being honest or well controlled.&nbsp;</p><p>The community was trusting - in this case, much too trusting. And people have said that they trusted the apparent (but illusory) consensus of EAs about FTX. I am one of them. We were all too trusting of someone who, according to several reports, had a history of breaking rules and cheating others, including an acrimonious split that happened early on at Alameda, and evidently more recently&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/geoffanders/status/1590932949461266434\"><u>frontrunning</u></a>. But the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xafpj3on76uRDoBja/the-ftx-future-fund-team-has-resigned-1?commentId=NbevNWixq3bJMEW7b\"><u>people who raised flags</u></a> were evidently ignored, or in other cases feared being pariahs for speaking out more publicly.</p><p>But the idea that I and others trusted in \u201cthe community\u201d is itself a problem.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/txGgPvKgZFpphdkHe/my-reaction-to-ftx-appalled\"><u>Like Rob Wiblin</u></a>, I generally subscribe to the idea that most people can be trusted. But I wasn\u2019t sufficiently cautious about how trust that applies to \u201cyou won\u2019t steal from my wallet, even if you\u2019re pretty sure you can get away with it,\u201d doesn\u2019t scale to \u201cyou can run a large business or charity with effectively no oversight.\u201d&nbsp;<br><br>A community that trusts by default is only sustainable if it is small. Claiming to subscribe to EA ideas, especially in a scenario where you can be paid well to do so, isn\u2019t much of a reason to trust anyone. And given the size of the EA community, we\u2019ve already passed the limits of where trusting others because of shared values is viable. &nbsp;</p><h3>Failures of Trust</h3><p>There are two ways to have high trust: naivety, and sophistication. The naive way is what EA groups have employed so far, and the sophisticated way requires infrastructure to make cheating difficult and costly.</p><p>To explain, when I started in graduate school, I entered a high-trust environment. I never thought about it, partly because I grew up in a religious community that was high trust. So in grad school, I was comfortable if I left my wallet on my desk when going to the bathroom, or even sometimes when I had an hour-long meeting elsewhere in the building.&nbsp;</p><p>I think during my second year, someone had something stolen from their desk - I don\u2019t recall what, maybe it was a wallet. We all received an email saying that if someone took it, they would be expelled, and that they really didn\u2019t want to review the security camera footage, but they would if they needed to. It never occurred to me that there were cameras - but of course there were, if only because RAND has a secure classified facility on campus, and security officers that occasionally needed to respond to crazy people showing up at the gate. That meant they could&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust,_but_verify\"><u>trust, because they can verify</u></a>.</p><p>Similarly, the time sheets for billing research projects, which was how everyone including the grad student got paid, got reviewed. I know that there were flags, because another graduate student I knew was pulled in and questioned for billing two 16-hour days one week. (They legitimately had worked insane hours those two days to get data together to hit a deadline - but someone was checking.) You can certainly have verifiably high trust environments if it\u2019s hard to cheat and not get caught.</p><p>But EA was, until now, a high-trust group by default. It\u2019s a huge advantage in working with others. knowing you are value aligned, that you can assume others care, and that you can trust them, means coordination is far easier. The FTX incident has probably partly destroyed that. (And if not, it should at least cause a serious reevaluation of how we use social trust within EA.)&nbsp;</p><h3>Restoring Trust?</h3><p>I don\u2019t think that returning to a high-trust default is an option. Instead, if we want to reestablish high trust throughout the community, we need to do so by fixing the lack of basis for the trust - and that means institutionalization and centralizing. For example, we might need institutions to \u201ccredential\u201d EA members or at least institutions, perhaps to allow democratic control, or at least clarity about membership. Alternatively, we could double-down on centralizing EA as a movement, putting even more power and responsibility on whoever ends up in charge - a more anti-democratic exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>However we manage to rebuild trust, it\u2019s going to be expensive and painful as a transition - but if you want a large and growing high trust community, it can\u2019t really be avoided. I don\u2019t think that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11214\"><u>what Cremer and Kemp suggest</u></a> is the right approach, nor are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y9opezUk9_JNQBYCAmHoERiqlaf2HmashQQ_ydGwyRY/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>Cremer\u2019s suggestions to MacAskill</u></a> sufficient for a large and growing movement, but some are necessary, and if those measures are not taken, I think that the community should be announcing alternative structures sooner rather than later.</p><p>This isn\u2019t just about trust, though. We\u2019ve also seen allegations that EA as a community is too elitist, that it\u2019s not a safe place for women, that it\u2019s not diverse enough, and so on. These are all problems to address, but they are created by a single decision - to have an EA community at all. And the easy answer to many problems is to have a central authority, and build more bureaucracy. But is that a good idea?</p><p>The alternative is rethinking whether EA should exist as a community at all. And - please save the booing for the end - maybe it shouldn\u2019t be one.</p><h2>What would it mean for Effective Altruism to not be a global community?</h2><p>Obviously, I\u2019m not in charge of the global EA community. No one is, not even CEA, with a mission \u201cdedicated to building and nurturing a global community.\u201d Instead, individuals, and by extension, local and international communities are in charge of themselves. Clearly, nobody needs to listen to me. But nobody needs to listen to the central EA organizations either - and we don\u2019t need to, and should not, accept the status quo.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to explore the claim that trying to have a single global community is, on net, unhelpful, and what the alternative looks like. I\u2019m sure this will upset people, and I\u2019m not saying the approach outlined below is necessarily the right one - but I do think it\u2019s a pathway we, yes, as a community, should at least consider.</p><p>And I have a few ideas what a less community-centered EA might look like. To preface the ideas, however, \u201ccommunity\u201d isn\u2019t binary. And even at the most extreme, abandoning the idea of EA as a community would not mean banning hanging out with other people inspired by the idea of Effective Altruism, nor would it mean not staying in touch with current friends. It would also not mean canceling meet-ups or events. But it does have some specific implications, which I\u2019ll try to explore.</p><h3>Personal Implications&nbsp;</h3><p>First, it means that \u201cbeing an EA\u201d would not be an identity.&nbsp;</p><p>This is probably epistemically healthy - the natural tendency to defend an in-group is far worse when attacks seem to include you, instead of attacking a philosophy you admire, or other individuals who like the same philosophy. I don\u2019t feel attacked when someone says that some guy who reads books by Naomi Novik is a jerk<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvyqfbdabot\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvyqfbdabot\">[1]</a></sup></span>, so why should I feel attacked when someone says a person who read and agreed with \u201cDoing Good Better\u201d or \u201cThe Precipice\u201d is a jerk?</p><p>Not having EA as an identity would also mean that public relations stops being a thing that a larger community cares about - thankfully. Individual organizations would, of course, do their own PR, to the extent that it was useful. This seems like a great thing - concern about community PR isn\u2019t a good thing for anyone to care about. We should certainly be concerned about ethics, and not doing bad things, not the way it looks.</p><h3>Community Building Implications</h3><p>Not having EA as a community obviously implies that \u201cEA Community Building\u201d as a cause area, especially a monolithic one, should end. But I think in retrospect, explicitly endorsing this as a cause to champion was a mistake. Popularizing ideas is great, bringing people with related interests is helpful, but there are some really unhealthy dynamics that were created, and fixing them seems harder than simply abandoning the idea, and starting over.</p><p>This would mean that we stopped doing \u201crecruitment\u201d on college campuses - which was always somewhat creepy. Individual EAs on campus would presumably still tell their friends about the awesome ideas, recommend books, or even host reading groups - but these would be aimed at convincing individuals to consider the ideas, not to \u201cjoin EA.\u201d And individuals in places with other EAs would certainly be welcome to tell friends and have meet-ups. But these wouldn\u2019t be thought of as&nbsp; recruitment, and they certainly wouldn\u2019t be subsidized centrally.</p><h3>Wouldn\u2019t this be bad?</h3><p>CEA\u2019s web site says \u201cEffective altruism has been built around a friendly, motivated, interesting, and interested group of people from all over the world. Participating in the community has a number of advantages over going it alone.\u201d Would it really be helpful to abandon this?</p><p>My answer, tentatively, is yes. Communities work well with small numbers of people, and less well as they grow. A single global community isn\u2019t going to allow high trust without building, in effect, a church. I\u2019m fairly convinced that Effective Altruism has grown past the point where a single community can be safe and high trust without hierarchy and lots of structure, and don\u2019t know that there\u2019s any way for that to be done effectively or acceptably.</p><p>Of course, individuals want and need communities - local communities, communities of shared interest, communities of faith, and so on. But putting the various parts of effective altruism into a single community, I would argue, was a mistake.</p><h3>More Implications, and some Q&amp;A</h3><p><strong>Would this mean no longer having community building grants, or supporting EA-community institutions?</strong></p><p>First, I think that we should expect communities to be self-supporting, outside of donor dollars. Having work spaces and similar is great, but it\u2019s not an impartially altruistic act to give yourself a community. It\u2019s much too easy to view self-interested \u201ccommunity building\u201d as actually altruistic work, and a firewall would be helpful.</p><p>Given that, I strongly think that most EAs would be better off giving their 10% to effective charities focused on the actual issues, and then paying dues or voluntarily contributing other, non-EA-designated funds for community building. That seems healthier for the community, and as a side-benefit, removes the current centralized \u201ccontrol\u201d of EA communities, which are dependent on CEA or other groups.&nbsp;</p><p>There are plenty of people who are trying to give far more than 10% of their income. Communities are great - but paying for them is a personal expense, not altruism. And from where I stand, someone who is giving half their salary to the \u201caltruistic cause\u201d of having community events and recruiting more people isn\u2019t effective altruism. I would far rather have people giving \u201conly\u201d 10% to charity, and using their other money for paying dues towards hosting or helping to subsidize fun events for others in their community, or paying to work in a EA-aligned coworking space.</p><p>Similarly, college students and groups that wanted to run reading clubs about EA topics would be more than welcome to ask alumni or others to support them. There is a case to be made for individuals spending money to subsidize that - but things like community retreats should be paid for by attendees, or at most, should be subsidized with money that wasn\u2019t promised to altruistic causes.</p><p><strong>What about EA Global?</strong></p><p>I think it would mean the end of \u201cEA Global\u201d as a generic conference. I have never attended, but I think having conferences where people can network is great - however, the way these are promoted and paid for is not. Davos is also a conference for important people to network - and lots of good things are done there, I am sure. We certainly should not be aiming for having an EA equivalent.</p><p>Instead, I would hope the generic EA global events are replaced by cause and career specific conferences, which would be more useful at the object level. I also think that having people pay to attend is good, instead of having their hotel rooms and flights paid for. If there are organizations or local groups that send people, they would be welcome to pay on behalf of the attendees, since they presumably get value from doing so. And if there are individuals who can\u2019t otherwise afford it, or under-represented groups or locations, scholarships can be offered, paid for in part by the price paid by other attendees, or other conference sponsors. (Yes, conferences are usually sponsored, instead of paid for by donations.)</p><p><strong>Wouldn\u2019t this make it harder for funders to identify promising younger values aligned people early?</strong></p><p>Yes, it would. But that actually seems good to me - we want people to demonstrate actual ability to have impact, not willingness to attend paid events at top colleges and network their way into what is already a pretty exclusive club.</p><p><strong>Wouldn\u2019t this tilt EA funders towards supporting more legibly high-status people at top schools?</strong></p><p>It could, and that would be a failure in design of the community. And that seems bad to me, but it should be countered with more explicitly egalitarian efforts to find high-promise people who didn\u2019t have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/07/harvards-freshman-class-is-more-than-one-third-legacy.html\"><u>parents who attended Harvard</u></a>. But that isn\u2019t what paid and exclusive conferences will address. Effective Altruism doesn\u2019t have the best track record in this regard, and remedies are needed - but preserving the status quo isn\u2019t a way to fix the problem.</p><p><strong>Should CEA be defunded, or blamed for community failures?</strong></p><p>No, obviously not. This post does explicitly attack some of their goals, and I hope this is taken in the spirit it is intended - as exploration and hopefully constructive criticism. They do tons of valuable work, which shouldn\u2019t go away. If others agree that the current dynamics should change, I am still unsure how radically CEA should change direction. But if the direction I suggest is something that community members think is worth considering, CEA is obviously the key organization which would need to change.</p><p><strong>Is this really a good idea?</strong></p><p>It certainly isn\u2019t something to immediately do in 2023, but I do think it\u2019s a useful direction for EA to move towards. And directionally, I think it\u2019s probably correct - though working out the exact direction and how it should be done is something that should be discussed.</p><p>And even if people dislike the idea, I hope it will prompt discussion of where current efforts have gone wrong. We should certainly be planning for the slightly-less-than-immediate term, and publicly thinking about the direction of the movement. We need to take seriously the question of what EA looks like in another decade or two, and I haven\u2019t seen much public thinking about that question. (Perhaps longtermism has distracted people from thinking on the scale of single decades. Unfortunately.)</p><p>But rarely is a new direction something one person outlines, and everyone decides to pursue. (If so, the group is much too centrally controlled - something the founders of EA have said they don\u2019t want.) And I do think that something like this is at least one useful path forward for EA.&nbsp;</p><p>If EA individuals and groups take more of this direction, I think it could be good, but details matter. At the same time, trajectory changes for large groups are slow, and should be deliberated about. So the details I\u2019ve outlined have been trying to push the envelope, and prompt consideration of a different path we could take than the one we are on.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnvyqfbdabot\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefvyqfbdabot\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;I <i><strong>promise</strong></i> I picked this as an example before Eliezer wrote his post.

Most guaranteed income proposals in developed nations top out at $1,000 per month, enough to get basic needs, reduce stress levels, and break down harmful stereotypes about people living in poverty, but not enough to live comfortably.</p><p>Essentially, funding guaranteed income is the way to spend money to help people in developed developed countries. Here's the situation (Focusing on the U.S. first). There are two important categories of guaranteed income: <strong>policy, and the nonprofit industry.</strong></p><h2>Guaranteed Income (Universal Basic Income) Policy</h2><p><a href=\"https://economicsecurityproject.org/work/guaranteed-income/\"><u>50% of Americans don\u2019t have $400</u></a> in cash on hand to deal with an emergency. That\u2019s a crazy but true statistic, so a national guaranteed income policy would do a massive amount of good. This was proven when the expanded child tax credit (a temporary UBI for families with kids) briefly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/policymakers-should-expand-child-tax-credit-in-year-end-legislation-to-fight#:~:text=The%20Child%20Tax%20Credit%20expansion,data%20released%20last%20week%20show.\"><u>drove child poverty down by over 40%</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/10/24/universal-basic-income/\"><u>great article by the Washington Post</u></a> laid out what\u2019s going on from a policy (government funding) approach in the guaranteed income movement.</p><p>\u201cIf empirical evidence ruled the world, guaranteed income would be available to every poor person in America, and many would no longer be poor. But empirical evidence does not rule the world.\u201d</p><p>Guaranteed Income has a long and storied history in the U.S., which I will quickly skim over as it is not what this post is about. Regarded by historians as the Father of the American Revolution, Thomas Paine, advocated unsuccessfully for a form of universal cash payment in&nbsp;<i>Agrarian Justice</i>. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. advocated it as the only obvious solution to truly ending poverty right up until his assassination. President Nixon nearly passed a Universal Basic Income but was thwarted ironically by a democratic senate that wanted larger payments and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thecorrespondent.com/4503/the-bizarre-tale-of-president-nixon-and-his-basic-income-bill/173117835-c34d6145\"><u>a 200-year-old fraudulently administered study</u></a>. Guaranteed Income then lay mostly dormant until presidential candidate Andrew Yang decided to make a Universal Basic Income his #1 policy priority.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, a ton of publicly and privately funded guaranteed income pilots have proven just how powerful and effective guaranteed income is at helping people. Unfortunately, it seems like getting a guaranteed income passed federally or in any state is highly unlikely for now.</p><p>Several organizations exist to push guaranteed income policy, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://economicsecurityproject.org/\"><u>Economic Security Project</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayorsforagi.org/\"><u>Mayors for Guaranteed Income</u></a>, so we\u2019ve decided to pursue a different neglected route to proliferating guaranteed income.</p><p>Our work won\u2019t get roadblocked by politics and presents an opportunity with a very high chance of success. As we scale, our work will accelerate the progress of all the existing organizations working towards a guaranteed income policy.</p><h2>Our Focus: The Nonprofit Industry</h2><p><strong>The Guaranteed Income Movement is living in Pilotland.&nbsp;</strong>Over&nbsp;<a href=\"https://basicincome.org/news/2022/10/100-u-s-mayors-100-pilots-guaranteed-income-now/\"><u>100 guaranteed income pilots</u></a> have recently been announced or completed in cities across the U.S. There\u2019s a problem though. As new pilots get announced, old pilots end and fizzle out. We keep seeing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/10/24/universal-basic-income/\"><u>the same cycle across the country:</u></a></p><ol><li>A new pilot is announced</li><li>The pilot reports amazing results with a huge impact</li><li>The pilot ends, often without renewal or expansion</li></ol><p>There are few if any cases of pilots leading to the establishment of long-term guaranteed income programs. This is a shame because guaranteed income has proven much more consistently impactful than all other anti-poverty interventions.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nptrust.org/philanthropic-resources/charitable-giving-statistics/\"><u>Americans gave $484.85 billion in 2021</u></a>. The nonprofit industry brings in hundreds of billions of dollars each year. Not governments, just private foundations, corporations, and philanthropists.&nbsp;</p><h3>Why aren\u2019t they spending their money on guaranteed income?</h3><p>The clearest answer is that they do when given the chance. But that only happens when there is a guaranteed income pilot in their area. Most nonprofits and funders in general have geographic limits on where they spend their money. Many also have limits on the sorts of people they are allowed to help (youth vs LGBTQ vs African American vs veterans, etc...). If there isn\u2019t a guaranteed income pilot in a specific town, none of the funders that live there will be spending any of their money on guaranteed income.</p><p>They are not free to spend their money on whatever thing, anywhere on earth, has the largest impact potential. They can only spend money within their limits, and guaranteed income will almost always be the most impactful thing they could spend it on because almost all of them are limited to developed nations.</p><p>Imagine you\u2019re a funder living in Pilotland, where tons of varying experiments are going on all over the place. If you\u2019re looking to make an impact, the odds are strong that there are not any guaranteed income pilots within your geographic limits helping the people you exist to help. You can either create a program yourself or deal with the less effective options on your plate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Our Big Idea: Building a platform to unleash the massive anti-poverty potential of guaranteed income.&nbsp;</h1><p>Although there are logistical complications, cash is easier to administer than any other intervention, enabling us to create a platform for fundraising, and disbursing guaranteed income within all geographic areas and for many kinds of populations in need. The idea is two-fold.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Empower as many funders to fund guaranteed income as possible.</strong> Funders often have geographic limits and/or population limits, so we will build a donation platform that empowers them to spend their funds on guaranteed income within their limits. Doing so maximizes their potential for impact, and also enables us to construct an incredibly powerful fundraising machine. Since guaranteed income is proven to be the most effective (not to mention dignified and empowering) anti-poverty intervention in developed nations, our fundraisers will&nbsp;<ol><li>Know that the money they are asking for could, literally, not be spent better. This should be extremely motivating and fulfilling (from personal experience, it is).</li><li>Have the strongest data-backed solicitations in the fundraising industry. Combining powerful evidence with highly motivated fundraisers (that are treated well and paid fairly) should result in a world-class fundraising machine.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Disburse guaranteed income as effectively as possible.</strong> Luckily, organizations such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aidkit.com/\"><u>AidKit have already built most of the infrastructure needed to disburse cash at scale</u></a>. This should be the easy part. As funding rolls in from various places and with various limitations, we will open highly automated online applications for guaranteed income. Guaranteed income will become available (with limits automatically applied) as soon as enough funding rolls in to provide guaranteed income in each location. We will ensure that follow-ups, audits, and rigorous Randomized Controlled Trials (RTCs) are baked into the platform. This creates a win-win-win for:<ol><li>Funders that want to maximize their impact against poverty and get detailed impact reports they can trust.</li><li>Fundraisers that want to maximize their impact</li><li>People in need. They will be empowered to fulfill their basic needs, regain dignity, and pursue fulfillment.</li></ol></li></ol><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672807355/mirroredImages/HYRfAGwNc6jzKkWt7/knyjpomseh4ybyyiaotn.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672807356/mirroredImages/HYRfAGwNc6jzKkWt7/yov3i3yqihkucmyq2gpc.png 130w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672807356/mirroredImages/HYRfAGwNc6jzKkWt7/ppjylgxhj0rmgutn1nfp.png 260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672807356/mirroredImages/HYRfAGwNc6jzKkWt7/grn2tarwidyu1ff1ewhl.png 390w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672807356/mirroredImages/HYRfAGwNc6jzKkWt7/ixsavrkkkphinpfavrq5.png 520w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672807356/mirroredImages/HYRfAGwNc6jzKkWt7/uqmvr5tnawf2olmvlwsn.png 650w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672807356/mirroredImages/HYRfAGwNc6jzKkWt7/dj3eha5vubceqvenoc5v.png 780w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672807356/mirroredImages/HYRfAGwNc6jzKkWt7/fcclaxivzaiwxbufinoj.png 910w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672807356/mirroredImages/HYRfAGwNc6jzKkWt7/opo8m8r4szesohajhecl.png 1040w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672807356/mirroredImages/HYRfAGwNc6jzKkWt7/nplhuuimdehsudp9apy9.png 1170w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672807355/mirroredImages/HYRfAGwNc6jzKkWt7/d7jjnuzmr8i4k3z2tnmr.png 1280w\"></figure><p>As the scale of guaranteed income programs increases, each incremental staff member can manage more and more participants.&nbsp;A $100M program, for example, funding 4,166 participants at $1K per month for two years -- with automation -- should require less than 1 staff hour spent per incremental participant. That equates to less than 1 full-time worker over 2 years. The vast majority of that time is required right at the beginning, however, so onboarding participants must be effectively spread out over time. As such, a reasonably sized team with staff specializing in specific roles could manage well over 1,000 additional participants per incremental staff member.</p><p>One lean team of ~20 could, we believe, manage to disburse $100M+ a year. At that scale, the bank interest from funds pending disbursement could theoretically exceed the amount needed to operate the platform.&nbsp;</p><p>Many details are still in development, and we will publish \u201cFoundation\u2019s Basic Income Network Whitepaper\u201d when it is ready. We have had this concept reviewed by over a dozen nonprofit and financial professionals, so we are confident that it is likely to work. If we can get it off the ground (&lt;$5M we estimate), it should be able to unleash the massive anti-poverty potential of guaranteed income.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Why should we be the ones to build this?</h3><p>We started a new nonprofit to exclusively focus on this for a few reasons. First, I realized that while GiveDirectly could build the platform, it might go against their #1 value of \"putting the poor in control of how aid money is spent\". If we want to maximize funders, we have to work within their bounds, and I think GiveDirectly might not be ok with sending money to people that are not desperately poor.&nbsp;</p><p>And that could be a very good thing! GiveDirectly probably should focus on international cash transfers, because building this platform would quickly make their <strong>extremely important global poverty and crisis response work a very tiny fraction of their overall funding</strong>. Such a situation could lead to GiveDirectly (unintentionally, of course) losing focus on eliminating global desperate poverty and crisis response. They are doing fantastic work developing crisis response, and our platform won\u2019t be designed for that sort of need.</p><p>I think it would be better for us to focus entirely on developed countries ourselves (with <a href=\"https://aidkit.com\">Aidkit</a> or some other infrastructure contractor),&nbsp;<strong>sending all funds that we get from funders without geographic limits to GiveDirectly (after fully funding GiveWell's top charity fund)</strong>. Doing so would enable us to focus on the platform, and help accelerate GiveDirectly\u2019s work. That said, we would love to collaborate with them on fundraising and improve our system with their experience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Our&nbsp;<strong>Theory of Change.&nbsp;</strong>How can we scale to the levels needed to meaningfully reduce poverty and end homelessness?</h1><h2>Personal Note</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GzdBtv2gXKrcf2uvW/michael-simm-introducing-myself\"><u>I posted a blog last week introducing myself</u></a> and where my expertise lies.

We'll have to convince lots of donors and funders of all kinds of the accurate but (potentially) counter-intuitive notion that directly giving cash to people in need is an extremely effective way to help them. Although we have overwhelming evidence, age-old misconceptions about the lazy or undeserving poor may make our expansion plans underperform.

And above the arbitrary federal poverty line, there are far more negative opportunity cost impacts that dwarf the 1 Trillion per year figure. While the official poverty rate is 11.6%,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/70-americans-are-struggling-financially/\"><u>7 in 10 Americans struggle with at least one aspect of financial stability, and 40% are struggling to pay for basic needs</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, a surprisingly large amount of Americans have very unpredictable changes in fortune year after year. More than half of the population experiences&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/70-americans-are-struggling-financially/\"><u>a median swing of 7.5 points</u></a> (out of a 100-point score of financial health). Rob Levy, vice president of research and measurement at the Financial Health Network said, \"We didn't think people's lives would change that much,\" but it turns out that, \u201cmost Americans' financial prospects are \"like a game of 'Chutes and Ladders,' which has implications for stress.\u201d&nbsp;</p><h3>Tractability (Solvability)</h3><p>The large-scale interventions we\u2019re currently using (the welfare system and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/giving101/Social-Programs-That-Just-Dont-Work\"><u>a fractured assortment of low-impact nonprofits</u></a>) are not effectively reducing poverty. We need to leverage the most effective intervention against poverty that is also highly impactful at any scale.</p><p><strong>Essentially, guaranteed income can solve poverty</strong>. Research by Karl Widerquist of Georgetown University shows that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.georgetown.edu/news/less-than-3-percent-of-gdp-could-end-u-s-poverty-new-research-shows/\"><u>it would cost only $539 Billion, less than 3 percent of the U.S. GDP, to permanently end poverty with Universal Basic Income</u></a>. Widerquist says the $539 billion per year is 2.95 percent of America\u2019s GDP is about one-sixth of the cost of commonly circulated estimates, and that this amount is less than 25 percent of current entitlement programs.</p><p>Widerquist\u2019s research used U.S. Census Bureau data for 2015 to examine an estimated poverty-level UBI of $12,000 per adult and $6,000 per child. It also found that some 43.1 million people (including 14.5 million children) would benefit from this increased income, reducing the poverty rate from 13.5 percent of the population to zero.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, driving policy change is difficult, so guaranteed income likely won\u2019t happen until the political will exists among special interests and major political donors.&nbsp;Sadly,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tu32CCA_Ig&amp;t=2s\"><u>the preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.</u></a></p><p>Without relying on finicky government policy to proliferate guaranteed income, we believe that our platform can empower the nonprofit industry to fund guaranteed income at scale, ending the homelessness crisis and taking a decent % chunk out of poverty. Over time, should the government fail to pass guaranteed income policy, our platform could be able to reach the total scale of poverty in the U.S.&nbsp;</p><p>Should the government succeed, we'd still be able to do a great deal of good by making the nonprofit industry spend its aid money on (extra) guaranteed income.</p><h2>Neglectednesss</h2><p>There are a lot of organizations and people working to reduce poverty, and trillions are spent each year fighting it. Of course, our focus is on the neglected intervention with the potential to solve it.</p><p>There are a few guaranteed income organizations already dedicated to creating the policy change that could establish a Universal Basic Income. It seems that almost all organizations in the guaranteed income movement are focused exclusively on policy change, one niche community, or one niche population in need. That\u2019s not to say policy change funding isn\u2019t neglected, just that there are already many organizations and people working on that.&nbsp;</p><p>There are no other organizations, however, with the vision to build what we want to build. All nonprofit guaranteed income providers in the developed world seem to be limited by geographic region, the population they are focused on helping, or some combination of the two.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Unleashing the full existing funding potential for guaranteed income is a completely neglected yet important part of the solution to poverty</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>The implications of guaranteed income for humanity and the Effective Altruism Movement.</h1><p>We believe the growth of our guaranteed income platform in the medium term could have very large positive impacts against poverty and for the EA movement such as</p><ul><li>Over time, we will establish guaranteed income (direct cash) as the baseline for all interventions looking to help people.

It would change power dynamics, enabling victims to escape abusive relationships and workers to escape exploitative jobs.</li><li>Reducing poverty at a large scale would free millions of poor people to do things other than work to survive day-to-day (such as seek out impactful careers). At the same time, our plan, growth, and hopeful success should be extremely newsworthy.

Leveraging funders we find that don\u2019t have geographic limits, we access enough money to fully fund all Givewell\u2019s interventions, and enable GiveDirectly to end desperate poverty globally.</li><li>Expanding guaranteed income globally could materially improve international relations and thus reduce some existential risks.&nbsp;<ul><li>If guaranteed income was spread out internationally, it could reduce tensions, and mitigate the risk of <strong>global nuclear annihilation</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>The same could be true for&nbsp;reducing <strong>global catastrophic biological risks</strong>. Not only could reducing international tensions reduce the incentives for governments to develop bio-weapons, but guaranteed income would also greatly increase the resilience of society to future pandemics. Guaranteed income as a safety net would be extremely resilient against pandemics, so it could be very important for enabling us to make it through a worse future pandemic.</li><li>As guaranteed income generally improves quality of life, we could have a lot more time, energy, and capability to focus on reducing all of the existential risks we are aware of. This is a likely result of significant EA Movement expansion.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The likelihood of this? Given the research, I've outlined, and the input that I've received from a bunch of unbiased professionals in the nonprofit industry, I think the <strong>likelihood is closer to 40% if we do not get any support from EA, and over 70% if we do get tons of support.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Longtermist implications of guaranteed income&nbsp;</h1><p>This is the most speculative part of the post, so it may be best to just skip it.&nbsp;</p><p>Guaranteed income at scale, universal basic income (UBI), could be the logical foundation (see what we did there), for human civilization. If money remains a thing and capitalism continues to look like the most efficient system for getting people the things they want, then guaranteed income should be one of the fundamental positives in the long-term future of humanity. Think of all the impacts outlined in the above sections, but repeated for tens, or thousands of generations to come. Global (or civilizational, should we escape Earth) guaranteed income could be an important part of permanently ending resource-based conflict and enabling humans to become more aligned.&nbsp;</p><p>In the same vein, establishing UBI as a human right could make it much harder for a (non-AI) actor to enslave humanity forever, reducing several S-risks. Given the dispersed power that UBI distributed evenly across society, people would be much more prepared for and highly resilient to malicious actors looking to entrench power.</p><p>If the disruption enabled by guaranteed income is inevitable. Our impact could therefore be accelerating the disruption while ensuring that guaranteed income isn\u2019t used for negative purposes. Dictatorial governments could, for example, tie social credit scores to the amount of a basic income. In the wrong hands, guaranteed income could be an extremely powerful tool to entrench social stratification. We can help to ensure that the growth of basic income is safe, effective, and dignified.</p><p>We also have an idea for a Basic Income Endowment, which would enable funders to generate guaranteed income in perpetuity. It would be the most impactful way of establishing a meaningful permanent legacy for any wealthy person. Over time, it could become very large, perhaps large enough to provide guaranteed income to all of society.</p><p>This potential future excites me, and I\u2019d like to see what other longtermist effective altruists think about it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Our Startup Plan: Maximum Impact in Developed Nations.</strong></h1><p>We've found a niche opportunity to build the most cost-effective anti-poverty program in America (an ~$50M opportunity before cost-effectiveness starts to decrease).

There's tons of local funding available which we intend to pursue, so&nbsp;<strong>EA capacity-building funding would result in 10X the impact of spending on the intervention</strong>.

Compared to the other effective intervention against homelessness, housing first (which is theoretically 100% effective), guaranteed income experiments have demonstrated &gt;66% housing success rates at a tiny fraction of the cost per beneficiary (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2022/08/24/in-los-angeles-governor-newsom-announces-694-million-in-homekey-awards-to-create-more-than-2500-new-homeless-housing-units-statewide/\"><u>California\u2019s $694M program</u></a> that costs $50,000 to $277,000 per person).

Of course, a lot more research needs to be done before rolling out guaranteed income as a drug abuse reduction intervention.</p><blockquote><p>It's important to note that the studies are based on surveys given to the participants.

We judge ourselves and our friends at a lower standard than we do people forced to live on the streets. Furthermore, there's a big difference between drug use and drug addiction, and drug use, in moderation, is not inherently negative. Finally, it's nearly impossible to accurately determine who does how many drugs without extremely invasive, undignified, &amp; expensive oversight that would result in few participants wanting to engage in the program. The best way to measure whether participants are spending their money 'right', is by recording their quality of life before, during, and after guaranteed income.&nbsp;</p><p>We\u2019ve spoken with local advocates from groups such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.feedphoenix.org/\"><u>FeedPhoenix</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.arizonajewsforjustice.org/az-hugs-for-the-houseless.html\"><u>AZ Hugs for the Houseless</u></a>, representatives from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://guaranteedincome.us/\"><u>groups studying guaranteed income</u></a>, a wide range of unbiased nonprofit professionals (Stuart Turgel, Carol Farabee, Rodney Houston, etc...), and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forsocialchange.org/the-research\"><u>organizations doing research</u></a> into this intervention.

We chose 24 because it resulted in the smallest budget where we could still send 80% of the budget directly to people in desperate poverty. This assistance will greatly help nearly every participant over the first year, and our goal is to help at least 50% of the participants achieve permanent housing stability. We consider this to be a conservative goal because&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thelogicalfoundation.org/pilot.jsp\"><u>every homelessness cash-assistance pilot to date</u></a> has helped at least 66% of participants achieve stability.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Facts</h2><p>living in homelessness reduces one's QALY (quality-adjusted life year) from 1.0 to 0.434, so helping someone stay out of homelessness would save 1 - 0.434 = 0.566 QALYs per year they would otherwise be homeless. (Academic Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34629422/\"><u>https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34629422/</u></a>)</p><p>According to William MacAskill in<i> Doing Good Better, </i>Health economists estimate that the benefit of \u201cpreventing a preventable death\u201d is equivalent to saving 36.5 QALYs.&nbsp;</p><p>With approximately 8% of the homeless population dying every year (7% higher than the normal 1% rate), each Participant we help will have their death likelihood reduced to the mean (by 7%) during the pilot year.

Converted into estimated QALYs, $5,000 divided by 36.5 is $136.9/QALY. $984.5 divided by $136.9 means our pilot should be about 7X less impactful per dollar. Therefore directly funding this intervention would not be a good use of EA funds.</p><p>However, capacity-building funding for us to build a fundraising team and get self-sufficient could empower us to raise $10 to $20 with every incremental dollar spent by an EA Funder.&nbsp;<strong>Given that 10-20X multiplier, helping us build fundraising capacity could legitimately outperform GiveWell\u2019s top charities.</strong></p><p>Our Conservative Assumptions:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>We have factored&nbsp;<strong>zero&nbsp;</strong>QALY<strong>&nbsp;</strong>improvements for friends, families, or anyone else that knows participants and would personally benefit from them not being homeless.</li><li>Unquestionably, the quality of life for the general public goes up as homelessness goes down. We have factored&nbsp;<strong>zero&nbsp;</strong>QALYs for this.</li><li>Quality of life while homeless in Arizona is substantially worse than in any other place in America (if not the world) because Arizona summers are hellishly hot. It\u2019s easier to warm up when cold than cool down in high heat. A more accurate QALY for homeless people in Arizona could be &lt;<strong>0.35</strong>. We went with the conservatively high QALY for homeless people on average of .434 (aka saving .566 QALYs vs. the counterfactual) because it\u2019s an official number from an academic study.</li><li>In every experiment to date, guaranteed income has&nbsp;<strong>helped at least 66%</strong> of participants regain economic stability.

Our platform's beta test will take this same intervention (with a few tweaks), and scale it up to the size of homelessness in Arizona ($50-100M). There were 13,553 homeless people in Arizona as of Jan 24, 2022. It\u2019s higher now and growing. Conservatively, here\u2019s&nbsp;<strong>how many QALYs are on the table for $984.5 per QALY</strong> (if we only succeed in helping solve 50% of homelessness in AZ, and don\u2019t account for the efficiency benefits from scaling).</p><p>184.6/24= 7.7025 QALYs per person&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned above, there are 13,553 people (and growing) homeless in Arizona as of 2022.</p><p>13,553 * 7.7025=&nbsp;<strong>104,391.98 Quality-Adjusted Life Years</strong></p><p>Since the crisis is growing quickly, and our estimates are conservative, the counterfactual damage from homelessness in AZ could be much worse. Our pilot will be crucial for enabling our expansion, so some fraction of the QALYs from enabling future impacts have to be factored in... right?&nbsp;</p><p>Even a 5% allocation would make our pilot potentially more impactful per dollar than any GiveWell top charity (before considering the 10-20X fundraising multiplier).</p><p>$182,000 / (104,391.98 * 5%)&nbsp; =&nbsp;<strong>$34.87/QALY</strong></p><p>I could easily go a lot further by considering expansion beyond Arizona and just homeless people. We could greatly reduce poverty and homelessness overall in the U.S. and among all developed nations by realizing our vision. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Realizing our vision could meaningfully improve the prosperity of human civilization, generating nearly incalculable impacts for early growth accelerators.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>My recommendation?</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Effective Altruists should strongly consider helping us grow.</strong></h1><h1>How can the EA community increase our chances of success and help us make this massive impact happen?</h1><p><strong>I do not think that large quantities of general EA funding should be diverted toward guaranteed income in developed countries.</strong> Money sent to developing nations simply has a greater impact at scale.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We only need help from EA groups to get off the ground</strong> because we plan to bring in funding from sources that would otherwise generate much less impact than through guaranteed income. Almost all of our funding sources long term will not be funding sources that could otherwise spend money on Effective Altruism cause areas, and therefore&nbsp;<strong>we will not be diverting funds that could be spent better</strong> on global poverty or other EA cause areas.</p><p>Here are some potentially powerful actions that I believe EA organizations and effective altruists should strongly consider.</p><ul><li><strong>Charity Entrepreneurship</strong> (the EA nonprofit) should strongly consider us for their incubation program to help us get off the ground. I applied to be a part of their 2023 pool, and I think it could be incredibly helpful to help us further improve our strategy, establish a strong team, and help fund our pilot.</li><li>I am going to apply for the&nbsp;<strong>EAGX conference in Berkley</strong> this December and the EAGlobal conference early next year. Helping me go to those conferences and make connections could be highly impactful.</li><li><strong>Fundraising professionals</strong> that want to have a large impact should consider reaching out to me. We anticipate raising money for guaranteed income could likely be an extremely impactful career path. Our work in Arizona should save QALYs for under $1k each, and professional fundraisers can each bring in over $500K per year.</li><li><strong>EA Funders</strong> such as EA Grantmakers, and Effective Altruists that have decided to earn to give should strongly consider helping us get off the ground by providing up a few million dollars one time. I do not think that millions of dollars of EA funds are necessary (though millions would certainly help accelerate our progress), as we could become baseline self-sufficient with $300K-$500K to build a strong fundraising team and get to work. At this early stage, helping us grow could be more impactful than any other intervention period. As we grow, we will divert non-limited funds to GiveDirectly or other globally impactful nonprofits.</li><li>Funders that are&nbsp;<strong>limited to spending in the U.S.</strong> should be very excited. If there are EA-oriented funders (philanthropists or organizations) dedicated to maximizing impact specifically in the U.S., our work in Arizona is likely the best opportunity for impact per dollar in the U.S.</li></ul><p><strong>I\u2019m looking for funders and passionate co-founders with expertise in fundraising.

I've researched disruptive systems, guaranteed income, homelessness interventions, and talked to over two dozen unrelated experts, none of whom have strongly argued that our pilot or grand plan would not work. I\u2019m happy to discuss all points of contention in the comments and over Zoom or on Twitter spaces should there be enough interest. The goal, as always, is to make a large impact.</p><p>Contact: <a href=\"mailto:Michael@thelogicalfoundation.org\">Michael@thelogicalfoundation.org</a></p><p>Website: <a href=\"https://thelogicalfoundation.org\">thelogicalfoundation.org</a></p>", "user": {"username": "Michael Simm"}}, {"_id": "S8avTmx4YixThsqzt", "title": "How do we make EA causes relevant to minority groups ", "postedAt": "2022-11-18T01:05:33.559Z", "htmlBody": "<p>In short: <i>Making EA causes relevant to different groups of people, especially minority groups, and talking about how would some problems we discuss in the EA community impact these groups in distinct ways, could help us bring more people to work on these issues and prevent some potential from being lost.&nbsp;</i></p><p>One thing we can improve as EAs is&nbsp;<i>how</i> we communicate the issues we believe are the most important to different communities and people both inside and outside of the movement. I am running an EA Fellowship in Georgia, a war-torn country that suffers from the Russian invasion and several issues in human rights. While I am doing that, I have to think hard about how to make EA relevant to Georgians. Building an EA community here is difficult enough, and starting with issues like Artificial Intelligence safety research could further complicate the outreach work as it is not very&nbsp;<i>relatable</i> to many people in countries facing issues here and now. &nbsp;Yes, it is an important issue to cover during the fellowship, but <i>how</i> should it be covered?&nbsp;</p><p>Something similar could be said about different communities that are experiencing problems <strong>here and now</strong> due to their lack of privilege. For example, several queer community members face oppression, death threats, and other not-so-good things on a daily basis. How do we make longtermist issues relevant to them? How do we talk about some of the EA cause areas that might not be relevant to them <strong>here and now</strong>?&nbsp;</p><p>In general, we often talk about more inclusive discourse, but from personal experience, I find that often EA is still centered on a Western, straight narrative. This is a feeling, not a fact, but other people might have similar feelings and not feel included enough. They might ask why is not there more work done within EA regarding specific types of issues that underprivileged groups face. I have searched the forum and for example, found very few discussions on issues facing the LGBTQ community. I have found comparatively more discussion about women\u2019s rights, but often I also find frankly douchebag-y comments from other men and women with internalized patriarchy disregarding the experience of females who were brave enough to share their discomfort. Again, this is just an opinion and not a fact. These are some feelings here and some opinions that just pushed me to ask the question \u2013&nbsp;how do we make EA causes relevant to the groups who might not feel like they affect them as well?</p><p>On one hand, we want to maximize our impact and work on the most pressing issues. On the other hand, we can't disregard the fact that for people personally affected, for example, queer activism is a pressing issue. For people suffering from war, ending the war is a pressing issue. For people who live in areas where malaria is prevalent, malaria is a pressing issue. Not all people have the capacity to think about issues they are not facing right now. And maybe, instead of asking them to do so, we could make the first step.&nbsp;</p><p>If we don\u2019t proactively try to include people, by also making major existential risks and causing areas relevant to their community, we might lose some potential that wouldn\u2019t otherwise be lost. I think that one thing that could help us spread the EA principles and talk about some of the issues like AI or other longtermist issues is making these problems&nbsp;<i>relevant</i> and&nbsp;<i>relatable</i> to the target audience.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me demonstrate this using one example. Artificial intelligence could be dangerous for everyone. If it is dangerous for everyone, it is also dangerous for groups of people. If you are already an underprivileged group of people, AI could potentially make things worse for you in a distinct way. Let\u2019s take a look at the sexual orientation algorithm and why we, the queer community, could care about AI.&nbsp;</p><p>Wang &amp; Kosinski (2017) demonstrated that deep neural networks can differentiate between straight and gay faces in 81% of cases in men and 74% of cases in women. They do this by using facial features. Humans can only differentiate straight and gay men by their faces in 61% of cases and women in 54% of cases. This (already existing) algorithm could pose safety and privacy risks to the queer community, especially if certain authoritarian governments (most notably Russia, China, and the Gulf states) decide to employ such networks for their causes. Private entities employing these algorithms to influence people could have severe consequences even in countries without such a severe negative record on human rights.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, I am currently doing some research on the effect of masculinity vs femininity on perceived competence in people's faces. Preliminary results are that people are biased to think that more feminine male faces are likely less competent (even if they belong to actual politicians who won elections and were previously judged as competent). So people with feminine faces could already be judged as less competent by other humans, and if the AI algorithm learns such bias from humans, people with specific appearances could be in an uncomfortable situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Going back to the Wang &amp; Kosinski study, the AI algorithm that already exists can impact the lives of millions of queer people whose lives are already impacted by the systematic oppression they face. Millions of other, non-queer people with specific facial appearances could also be impacted negatively by AI. AI could impact everyone negatively, but there might a specific way in which it negatively affects <i>your</i> group. And humans care about <i>their</i> own groups more than about outsiders sometimes. Surely, in this case, working on AI safety could be an area worthy of your time even if you are less concerned with other groups outside of your circle. Even if you found that AI is far from your interests and you were interested mostly in queer advocacy. Advocating for safer AI that doesn\u2019t expose the sexual orientations of people is <i>also</i> queer advocacy.&nbsp;</p><p>My point here is that we could reach more people if we tried to make EA causes more relatable to them. To do that, we have to think about how a specific EA cause affects different groups of people (or individuals) differently. For example, even without a remote existential threat of AI, today this specific AI algorithm discussed here is already a potential threat to the queer community. The development of AI today affects straight people and queer people differently, and it is possible that in the future it will affect all of us negatively but in distinct ways. Seeing how there could be distinct ways of negative impact on different communities could help us bring these communities to work on these causes.&nbsp;</p><p>This way, we could also understand that there are minority groups that experience things differently from the majority group. Taking an individualized outreach approach to these groups could make them more included and heard. But this is just my thought.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Davit Jintcharadze"}}, {"_id": "T7aDsCYSaBufSBBhj", "title": "FTX Open Thread", "postedAt": "2022-11-18T01:00:27.959Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>TLDR: Post your thoughts on FTX here if you don't think it's worth making a top-level post or if you're worried we're hyper-focusing on this issue.

For example the cost of housing is a drag on fertility so we must provide more low cost housing. However women who pursue a career or go through higher education are not going to be interested in public housing. The root cause has been completely ignored, the price of housing is high largely because of dual income couples which in turns self perpetuates the problem by driving more women into the workforce for longer. Offering more public housing is never going to make any sort of impact until the cause is addressed which are bad value lock ins.</p><p>The price of housing is determined by demand and the more prosperous and educated women are, the more they contribute to higher housing prices.</p><p>The only viable solution is to roll back the many bad values that have been locked in which are principally gender equality and the idea that woman must have the same roles in life as men, no fault divorce, abortion on demand and the current fad of driving teens into same sex relationships.</p><p>Ideology acts as blinkers on people's viewpoints and what is interesting is that almost no one questions the root causes of low fertility instead pointing to numerous other minor factors.</p><p>The irony is that those most obsessed about sustainability are in fact the same people who are the least concerned about the most important sustainability of all, the sustainability of civilisation itself.

Many cognitive scientists thought that connectionism is limited and it is highly unlikely that we can actually assimilate the functions of human minds by imitating the neural circuitry of the human brain.&nbsp;</p><p>Characteristically, Steven Pinker in \"The Blank Slate\", published in 2002, criticized connectionism arguing that</p><blockquote><p>\u201cHumans don\u2019t just loosely associate things that resemble each other, or things that tend to occur together. They have combinatorial minds that entertain propositions about what is true of what, and about who did that to whom, when and where and why. And that requires a computational architecture that is more sophisticated that the uniform tangle of neurons used in generic connectionist networks\u201d (Pinker 2002, 79).&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Pinker goes on to expose the limitations of connectionism that derive from this not-sufficiently-sophisticated computational architecture of neural networks. All this is to show that a complete human thought cannot be represented in a generic network that is used in machine learning.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, neural networks would not be able to distinguish between kinds and individuals, have thoughts that aren\u2019t just a summation of smaller parts (compositionality), play with logical quantification, embed one thought in another (recursion), and reason categorically. Given all these limitations, it would be surprising for connectionism to find any success.&nbsp;</p><p>Richard Sutton, in his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~eunsol/courses/data/bitter_lesson.pdf\">Bitter Lesson</a>\u201d (2019) remarks that when Kasparov was defeated in 1997, researchers were not accepting that exceptional chess-playing skills were a matter of the leveraging of computation. Instead, it was widely believed that the methods that would win would be based on human input.&nbsp;</p><p>This, however, was not the case; as Sutton writes, \u201ca simpler search-based approach with special hardware and software proved vastly more effective\u201d, &nbsp;and that was not only surprising for researchers at the time, but also disappointing. They couldn\u2019t predict that less human knowledge and more computation combined with large training sets, once more data became available, would produce highly successful speech recognition systems.&nbsp;</p><p>The conviction behind this approach was that there is a special knowledge of how the mind works, and that knowledge, once introduced into machine learning can produce intelligence. Of course, human minds remain endlessly complex. Yet, taking advantage of compute and data has led to neural networks being highly successful.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems overall that we live in a world where intelligence isn't particularly hard to find; neural networks have sufficiently sophisticated architecture and there is good reason to think that they\u2019re very similar to human brains, or at least, that they are capable of producing behavior similar to that produced by brains.&nbsp;</p><p>More research is pointing in this direction along with the success of Large Language Models, like GPT-3 and GPT-4. For example, in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/pointeurs/TR1312.pdf\">Learning Deep Architectures for AI</a>\u201d (Bengio, 2009) the claim is that the similarity between the human brain and artificial neural networks relies on having multiple layers and each layer represents the data input at a different level of abstraction. If this is true, it becomes easier to argue that brains and neural networks share some features in their computational architecture which explains the success of the latter.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "eangelou"}}, {"_id": "7ZjJ9w2xf7Mkdofk8", "title": "Does Sam make me want to renounce the actions of the EA community?

This is a stupid question EAs keep performatively asking and answering. Everyone opposes fraud, there is no one on the other side of this issue. Sam\u2019s actions were awful and I condemn them. Do I believe we should circle our wagons and defend Sam? No. However, there is a huge difference between condemning his actions while rallying together to support one another through this <strong>awful </strong>time and what I see happening here which I believe can best be described as a witch-hunt against everything and everyone that ever intersected with Sam or his beliefs.</p><p>Over the last few days, posters on this forum, Twitter, and Facebook have used this scandal to attack and air every single grievance they have ever had against Effective Altruism or associated individuals and organizations. Even imaginary ones. <i>Especially imaginary ones. </i>This has included Will MacAskill and other thought leaders for the grave sin of not magically predicting that someone whose every external action suggested that he wanted to work with us to make the world a better place, would YOLO it and go Bernie Madoff.&nbsp; The hunt has included members of Sam\u2019s family for the grave sin of being related to him. It has included attributing the cause of Sam\u2019s actions to everything from issues with diversity and inclusivity, lack of transparency in EAG admissions, the pitfalls of caring if we all get eviscerated by a nuke or rogue AI, and, of course, our office spaces and dating habits.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Like Stop</strong>. There are lessons to be learned here and I would have been fully down for learning them and working together to fix them with *all of you.* But why exactly should I help those in the community who believe that the moral thing to do when someone is on their knees is to jump on them while yelling \u201c<i>I should have been admitted to EAG 2016!</i>\u201d? Why should I expose myself further by doing ambitious things (No I don\u2019t mean fraud- that\u2019s not an ambitious thing that\u2019s a --- <strong>criminal</strong>--- thing) when if I fail people are going to make everything worse by screaming \u201c<i>I told you so</i>\u201d to signal that they never would have been such a newb? Yeah. No. The circle I\u2019m drawing around who is and is not in my community is getting dramatically redrawn.&nbsp; This is not because one person or company made a series of very bad decisions, it's because so many of your actions are those of people I will not invest in further and who I don't want anywhere near my life or life\u2019s work. I\u2019ll keep the Julia Wises, and Cate Halls- their kindness has blown me away, I\u2019ll keep the people who are working together to fix this. The rest of you, yeah, no thanks.*</p><p>If this is a witch hunt, and based on who I\u2019m seeing burnt, and who I\u2019m seeing in the mob to quote Tay-Tay, go ahead and <strong>LIGHT.ME.UP.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><i>*(My friends say this is a minority of people in EA.

Also - though this is probably obvious - I'm speaking in a strictly personal capacity.</i></p><p>Formal optimization problems often avail themselves of one solution - there can be multiple optima, but by default there tends to be one optimum for any given problem setup, and the highest expected value move is just to dump everything into that optimum.</p><p>As a community, we tend to enjoy framing things as formal optimization problems. This is pretty good! But the thing about formal problem setups is they encode lots of assumptions, and those assumptions can have several degrees of freedom. Sometimes the assumptions are just plain qualitative, where quantifying them misses the point; the key isn't to just add another order-of-magnitude (or three) variable to express uncertainty. Rather, the key is to adopt a portfolio approach such that you're hitting optima or near-optima under a variety of plausible assumptions, even mutually exclusive ones.</p><p>This isn't a new idea. In various guises and on various scales, it's called <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Parliamentary-Approach-to-Moral-Uncertainty.pdf\">moral parliament</a>, <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/update-on-cause-prioritization-at-open-philanthropy/\">buckets</a>, &nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/\">cluster thinking</a>, or even just plain hedging. As a community, to our credit, we do a lot of this stuff.</p><p>But I think we could do more, and be more confident and happy about it.</p><h2>Case study: me</h2><p>I do/have done the following things, that are likely EA-related:</p><ol><li>Every month, I donate 10% of my pre-tax income to the Against Malaria Foundation.</li><li>I also donate $100 to Compassion in World Farming, mostly because I feel bad about eating meat.</li><li>In my spare time, I provide editing services to various organizations as a contractor. The content I edit is often informed by a longtermist perspective, and the modal topic is probably AI safety.</li><li>I once was awarded (part of a) LTFF (not FTX, the EA Funds one) grant, editing writeups on current cutting-edge AI safety research and researchers.</li></ol><h3>Case study from a causes perspective</h3><p>On a typical longtermist view, my financial donations don't make that much sense - they're morally fine, but it'd be dramatically better in expectation to donate toward reducing x-risk.</p><p>On a longtermist-skeptical view, the bulk of my editing doesn't accomplish much for altruistic purposes. It's morally fine, but it'd be better to polish general outreach communications for the more legible global poverty and health sector.</p><p>And depending on how you feel about farmed animals, that smaller piece of the pie could dwarf everything else (even just the $100 a month is plausibly saving more chickens from bad lives than my AMF donations save human lives), or irrelevant (if you don't care about chicken welfare basically at all).</p><p><strong>I much prefer my situation to a more \"aligned\" situation, where all my efforts go the same single direction.</strong></p><p>It's totally plausible to me that work being done right now on AI safety makes a really big difference for how well things go in the next couple decades. It's also plausible to me that none of it matters, either because we're doomed in any case or because our current trajectory is just basically fine.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, it's plausible to me (though I think unlikely) that I learn that AMF's numbers are super inflated somehow, or that its effectiveness collapsed and nobody bothered to check. And it's plausible that in 20 years, we will have made sufficient progress in global poverty and health that there no longer exist donation opportunities in the space as high leverage as there are right now, and so now is a really important time.</p><p>So I'm really happy to just do both. I don't have quantitative credences here, though I'm normally a huge fan of those. I just don't think they work that well for the outside view of the portfolio approach - I've aggregated various stories about what matters, and the ones that smell the best get some of my resources. If I'm maximizing anything, I think maybe it's the odds that looking back in 20 years, with different social incentives and peers and information about the state of the world, I think \"yeah, some of that was really good.\"</p><h3>Case study from an activities perspective</h3><p>Another thing I want to highlight is that I'm really happy to both be doing some direct work (though not as a full time job, nor do I currently want it to be), and some donating.</p><p>Qualitatively, it seems like there are huge and hard-to-impossible-to-remove biases around something when it is one's entire livelihood. My mental health was noticeably worse when I derived most of my income from EA-adjacent sources. The biases aren't necessarily all in one direction, to be clear; I think I probably felt <i>more </i>critical of EA when my career was caught up in it to a significant degree, because career stuff going badly is just really painful, and sometimes things went badly.&nbsp;</p><p>The difference in my cognition between then and now is very difficult to properly describe - it's just that huge. I feel like my thinking is <i>much </i>clearer with a job that has nothing to do with EA than it was before. I regularly see claims about fear of professional retaliation or losing out on opportunities, and it's wonderful to just... basically not feel that stuff at all. In general, I think really great advice for people is \"If you're trying to break into a crowded, competitive field, and it goes badly and starts making you unhappy, <i>just stop</i>.\"</p><p>And on the other side, it feels good to actually spend some time engaging with EA ideas, and not simply donating money on autopilot. Being a (somewhat) active participant in the professional landscape is nice, and arguments that lending one's expertise is as much or more valuable (on average) than donating money are, indeed, pretty good.</p><p>I am not (currently) at all interested in either:</p><ol><li>Paying my bills with EA money</li><li>Channeling all my involvement with EA through donations</li></ol><p>I'm not sure how many people are in equilibria like mine, but I highly recommend it, particularly if you feel like you can't get all the way into the EA inner circle and it's frustrating you. You don't have to! You can just help out a little on the margin, and have a job you enjoy that has nothing to do with this stuff. And it's great!</p><h2>Broader, movement level notes</h2><p>I'm really happy GiveWell and Giving What We Can exist. I live in a small city. If I talk about stuff like AI Safety, people go into \"oh what an interesting boondoggle to talk about while tipsy\" mode, reliably. Even smart people. It's just not inside the culture here. I don't mind this.</p><p>In my local social scene, stuff like \"hey saving lives by donating money is actually doable; the stuff you've heard about crooked charities is true to a degree, but it isn't all of them and some people do verifiably great work\" is legible fair play. Giving What We Can is a totally fine thing to bring up occasionally as an option for people doing financially okay or better. And if things get really dodgy on the cutting edge, they're still around, reliably generating value that everyone can be super confident we'll look back on in 20 years (assuming the world hasn't ended, which okay, for some of you that might be a big if) and say \"yeah, that stuff was good\".</p><p>My status-seeking brain has the impulse to say \"let's give GWWC more attention and status\" but honestly... I don't know. Maybe it should be a small-ish outfit with a moderate degree of outreach that interested people who read Peter Singer in high school or college can organically find. That's what happened with me. Maybe it's just pretty much ideal - I certainly don't think it's mismanaged, and being way more ambitious might be a mistake. (I have a post brewing about this more specific question, too.) But I'm really glad GWWC exists in any case, and grateful to the people who run it. The top 20% or so by effectiveness of the Global Poverty and Health space is just really great, and I hope EA continues attracting people (and some their disposable incomes) to it.</p><p>I'm also really happy LessWrong exists, and that major AI labs have safety divisions now about things more foundational than algorithmic bias. It's great that we're actually making inroads in elite, hard-to-access fields. I worry there's too much of that relative to broad-base EA 101 content for ordinary people, but hey, I would, wouldn't I? I didn't go to an Ivy League school or whatever, so I have a bias against awarding mega-status to people near the very top of credential/prestige pyramids. <i>C'est la vie</i>. On the whole I'm glad we've made progress in both elite and non-elite dimensions over time, regardless of where social incentives make me want more glory on the margin.</p><p>I guess basically my feeling boils down to...</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>A lot of official communications from top-level community officials laud or defend a portfolio approach. Will's <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cfdnJ3sDbCSkShiSZ/ea-and-the-current-funding-situation\">big post</a> on (among other things) what we've accomplished, even while writing/promoting a longtermism book, touched on AMF. As a long-time donor, I appreciated that. Open Philanthropy does their bucket thing. Holden has shared really valuable models about cluster thinking, and the idea of moral parliaments (from Tobies Newberry and Ord) has been floating around for a while. There's no shortage on calls for diversification, from the very top levels.</p><p>But I think, maybe, we could take that a little more to heart? Like, it's really fine. You can care a little about a bunch of stuff. Your philanthropic interest can wander, even into territory that on certain models would be lower expected value than others. You can be partly motivated by local social gradients - just don't take it too far. You can give up if you keep shooting for the stars and getting burned. There's a lot of room on the outskirts. And having outskirts - having people, causes, organizations, that aren't trying to be at the very tip of the spear, the top of the pyramid - is actually, I think, super ecologically important.</p><p>And maybe more fun, too!</p>", "user": {"username": "Justis"}}, {"_id": "NDDujZu5F5HyKXLui", "title": "\"Pronatalists\" may look to co-opt effective altruism or longtermism", "postedAt": "2022-11-17T21:04:43.747Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Archived version: <a href=\"https://archive.ph/2wG0k#selection-1743.0-1743.242\">https://archive.ph/2wG0k#selection-1743.0-1743.242</a><br><br>Edit: this is getting lots of downvotes. I don't mind this, because the article isn't great, and probably isn't a good use of most people's time. I just thought it was a relevant article to flag, given it explicitly mentions the possibility of an opportunistic power grab in the EA space.</p><p><br>The most relevant quote:</p><blockquote><p>\"This means our faction (more conservative, pronatalist, long-termist-civilization-building-focused, likely to self fund) is now 100X more likely to become a real, dominant faction in the EA space,\" Simone wrote in a text message on November 12.</p></blockquote><p>Today, as I was doomscrolling through my favorite good-faith EA criticism from Timnit Gebru, I saw this article shared. Of course, I took the bait. It's a long article, and EA/longtermism are only mentioned a few times, but I have pasted a few relevant quotes over.</p><blockquote><p>\"I do not think humanity is in a great situation right now. And I think if somebody doesn't fix the problem, we could be gone,\" Malcolm half-shouted as he pushed his sniffling 18-month-old, Torsten, back and forth in a child-size Tonka truck.</p><p>Along with his 3-year-old brother, Octavian, and his newborn sister, Titan Invictus, Torsten has unwittingly joined an audacious experiment. According to his parents' calculations, as long as each of their descendants can commit to having at least eight children for just 11 generations, the Collins bloodline will eventually outnumber the current human population.&nbsp;</p><p>If they succeed, Malcolm continued, \"we could set the future of our species.\"</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Malcolm, 36, and his wife, Simone, 35, are \"pronatalists,\" part of a quiet but growing movement taking hold in wealthy tech and venture-capitalist circles. People like the Collinses fear that falling birth rates in certain developed countries like the United States and most of Europe will lead to the extinction of cultures, the breakdown of economies, and, ultimately, the collapse of civilization. It's a theory that Elon Musk has championed on his Twitter feed, that Ross Douthat has defended in The New York Times' opinion pages, and that Joe Rogan and the billionaire venture capitalist Marc Andreessen bantered about on \"The Joe Rogan Experience.\" It's also, alarmingly, been used by some to justify white supremacy around the world, from the tiki-torch-carrying marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting \"You will not replace us\" to the mosque shooter in Christchurch, New Zealand, who opened his 2019 manifesto: \"It's the birthrates. It's the birthrates. It's the birthrates.\"</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>While pronatalism is often associated with religious extremism, the version now trending in this community has more in common with dystopian sci-fi. The Collinses, who identify as secular Calvinists, are particularly drawn to the tenet of predestination, which suggests that certain people are chosen to be superior on earth and that free will is an illusion. They believe pronatalism is a natural extension of the philosophical movements sweeping tech hubs like the Silicon Hills of Austin, Texas. Our conversations frequently return to transhumanism (efforts to merge human and machine capabilities to create superior beings), longtermism (a philosophy that argues the true cost of human extinction wouldn't be the death of billions today but the preemptive loss of trillions, or more, unborn future people), and effective altruism (or EA, a philanthropic system currently focused on preventing artificial intelligence from wiping out the human population).</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>In February, the PayPal cofounder Luke Nosek, a close Musk ally, hosted a gathering at his home on Austin's Lake Travis to discuss \"The End of Western Civilization,\" another common catchphrase in the birth-rate discourse.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>These worries tend to focus on one class of people in particular, which pronatalists use various euphemisms to express. In August, Elon's father, Errol Musk, told me that he was worried about low birth rates in what he called \"productive nations.\" The Collinses call it \"cosmopolitan society.\" Elon Musk himself has tweeted about the movie \"Idiocracy,\" in which the intelligent elite stop procreating, allowing the unintelligent to populate the earth.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Musk was echoing an argument made by Nick Bostrom, one of the founding fathers of longtermism, who wrote that he worried declining fertility among \"intellectually talented individuals\" could lead to the demise of \"advanced civilized society.\" \u00c9mile P. Torres, a former longtermist philosopher who has become one of the movement's most outspoken critics, put it more bluntly: \"The longtermist view itself implies that really, people in rich countries matter more.\"</p><p>A source who worked closely with Musk for several years described this thinking as core to the billionaire's pronatalist ideology. \"He's very serious about the idea that your wealth is directly linked to your IQ,\" he said. The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for this article, also said Musk urged \"all the rich men he knew\" to have as many children as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Musk's ties to the EA and longtermist communities have been gradually revealed in recent months. In September, text logs released as part of Musk's legal battle with Twitter showed conversations between Musk and the prominent longtermist William MacAskill, who works at Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute, where Musk is a major donor. In the messages, MacAskill offered to introduce Musk to Sam Bankman-Fried, a <a href=\"https://archive.ph/o/2wG0k/https://www.businessinsider.com/ftx-ceo-crypto-binance-sam-bankman-fried-wealth-wiped-out-2022-11?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Insider%20Today%20-%20November%209%202022&amp;utm_term=INSIDER%20TODAY%20SEND%20LIST\">now-disgraced</a> cryptocurrency entrepreneur who had donated millions of dollars to longtermist organizations.</p><p>MacAskill has never explicitly endorsed pronatalism, and he declined to be interviewed for this article. He did, however, devote a chapter of his best-selling book, \"What We Owe the Future,\" to his fear that dwindling birth rates would lead to \"technological stagnation,\" which would increase the likelihood of extinction or civilizational collapse. One solution he offered was cloning or genetically optimizing a small subset of the population to have \"Einstein-level research abilities\" to \"compensate for having fewer people overall.\"</p><p>Malcolm said he was glad to see Musk bring these issues to the forefront. \"He's not as afraid of being canceled as everyone else,\" Malcolm told me. \"Any smart person with a certain cultural aesthetics of their life is looking at this world and saying, 'How do we create intergenerationally, durable cultures that will lead to our species being a diverse, thriving, innovative interplanetary empire one day that isn't at risk from, you know, a single asteroid strike or a single huge disease?'\"</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The Collinses worry that the overlap between the types of people deciding not to have children with the part of the population that values things like gay rights, education for women, and climate activism \u2014 traits they believe are genetically coded \u2014 is so great that these values could ultimately disappear.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>She also weighed in on the stunning implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX, which represented one of the largest financial hubs for the effective-altruism movement. The Collinses, who never directly associated with the top Democratic donor Bankman-Fried, spied an opportunity in his demise.</p><p>\"This means our faction (more conservative, pronatalist, long-termist-civilization-building-focused, likely to self fund) is now 100X more likely to become a real, dominant faction in the EA space,\" Simone wrote in a text message on November 12.</p></blockquote><p>I personally want nothing to do with a faction of people focused on genetic improvement and low birth rates in \"Western Civilization\", and I can see how longtermism rhetoric can be easily co-opted for this, and how this might implicate EA as a result. If this is a group of well-funded people who see the recent FTX events as an opportunity, that might be another reason EA/longtermism priorities might be shifted.</p><p>Can people more involved or have insight into the Austin and Bay Area EA communities give us a better sense of what this is about? And can people with a better understanding of longtermism clarify the extent of overlap here? And can Will or EA or longtermism clearly disassociate with this \"faction\" of people, if their goal is to opportunistically use EA as a way to further their means, or if there's significant disagreement in terms of values and ideology?&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "pseudonym"}}, {"_id": "CZJ93Y7hinjvqt87j", "title": "Introducing new leadership in Animal Charity Evaluators\u2019 Research team ", "postedAt": "2022-11-17T20:55:49.490Z", "htmlBody": "<h2>Introduction&nbsp;</h2><p>Hello EA Forum! As some of you may already be aware, Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) has recently expanded&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/about/contributors/meet-our-team/\"><u>our team</u></a>, most notably in Research. As such, we'd like to introduce ourselves as ACE's new Director of Research and Evaluations Program Manager and share how we intend to engage the EA community via this forum moving forward<i>.</i> We both joined ACE this summer, right as the annual charity evaluation season kicked off. Since we were hired, two new researchers, Alina Salmen,&nbsp;<i>Ph.D</i>. and Max Taylor, have joined, as well as our new Executive Director, Stien van der Ploeg.&nbsp;</p><h2>Our Backgrounds</h2><h3>Elisabeth Ormandy - Director of Research</h3><p>I have an academic background in Neuroscience (B.Sc.), Applied Animal Behaviour and Welfare (M.Sc.), and Animal Welfare and Ethics (Ph.D.). I completed a research fellowship in animal policy development for the Canadian Council on Animal Care and held a post-doctoral fellowship position at the University of British Columbia (UBC). I also taught various undergraduate courses at UBC including: Animals and Society, Animals and Global Issues, Scholarly Writing and Argumentation, and Animals, Politics and Ethics. In 2015, I opted to leave academia to co-found the Canadian Society for Humane Science\u2014I served as their Executive Director until I joined ACE. In that role, I gained experience in nonprofit management, impact assessment, and strategic planning, and learned the importance of strengthening the animal advocacy movement. Alongside my paid work in animal advocacy, I currently serve in a number of volunteer roles, most notably as a Board member for the Association for the Protection of Fur-Bearing Animals.</p><h3>Vince Mak - Evaluations Program Manager</h3><p>I have a generalist background\u2014I graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania and spent the beginning of my career in financial services. I discovered effective altruism in 2019, developed an interest in animal advocacy after reading&nbsp;<i>Animal Liberation</i> in 2020, and began doing EA-style charity evaluations across cause areas as a volunteer with SoGive in 2021. Outside of my job at ACE, I currently assist in various capacities with EA research, grantmaking, and movement building.</p><h2>ACE's Next Steps on the EA Forum</h2><h3>Our intentions</h3><p>In the past few years, ACE's activity on the EA Forum has been to provide updates on our work and share our thinking. As an EA organization dedicated to transparency and intellectual rigor, we would like to take it a step further and interact more closely with the community that shares these values. As we tinker with our evaluation methodology in the months and years ahead, we plan to invite your feedback during the intermediate stages; we do not want to just inform you, we want to be informed by you. In addition to opportunities to critique our thinking, you can also expect from ACE transparency about our processes, responsiveness to fair and genuine criticism, and a commitment to evolve our thinking in response to new evidence.&nbsp;</p><h3>Adjustments to our evaluations process so far</h3><p>This year, our research team altered the way we approach our evaluations, partially thanks to input from people on this forum in the past. For instance, we have now implemented quantitative scoring frameworks for our Programs and Cost Effectiveness evaluation criteria\u2014a marked departure from how we assessed these criteria last year.&nbsp;</p><p>We appreciate the EA community's willingness to provide constructive criticism so that we can continually refine our methods. More recently, some of you have already volunteered your time and expertise by sharing proposals for how ACE can improve. In particular, we thank&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/nunosempere\"><u>Nuno Sempere</u></a> for a thoughtful (private) proposal on how we can make more accurate impact and cost-effectiveness assessments and quantify uncertainty as part of those calculations\u2014we greatly value the time and energy you put into supporting us. Thanks also to<i>&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/eaanonymous1234\">eaanonymous1234</a> for your recent evaluation of ACE as part of the EA Criticism and Red Teaming contest. Once we have more capacity for reflection after the giving season, we will follow up with both of you to learn more and continue the constructive dialogue.</p><h3>This year's charity recommendations</h3><p>We will announce our updated list of recommended charities next week on Tuesday, November 22. In the pursuit of transparency and to make it easier for others to provide input on our methods, we now share spreadsheets that show how we prioritized interventions, calculated cost-effectiveness, and estimated room for more funding for each charity in this year's reviews. In the weeks following our recommendations announcement, we will also publish blog posts on the ACE website for each of our four evaluation criteria, which will detail what we changed this year along with the perceived limitations we aim to overcome in the future.&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>As researchers at an organization that specializes in effective animal advocacy, we feel a great sense of responsibility to do our best to identify the most effective ways to help animals and spread the word about the organizations that do this important work. It's because of these two linked concerns that we value the EA Forum; this is both a place where we can consult you about our methods as well as a space filled with people who want to stay updated on the most effective ways to improve or save animal lives.</p><p>We are excited about ACE's future as we enter a new phase of leadership. We hope you share this feeling too\u2014we think more dialogue between ACE and the rest of the EA community will go a long way toward helping the trillions of farmed and wild animals who suffer daily.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Elisabeth &amp; Vince</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "AnimalCharityEvaluators"}}, {"_id": "YBx55eMzkzpMKnyoA", "title": "What does the FTX bankruptcy affidavit tell us?

I consider methods to discourage groups from massively scaling AI systems with little regard for safety. Examining cultural, regulatory, and technological interventions, cultural approaches seem best suited to this goal in the near term.</p>\n<h2>Scale</h2>\n<p>For the purposes of this post, I am going to lump several things together when I talk about \"scale\".\nSome of the highly-scalable inputs to an AI system include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of parameters</li>\n<li>Training time</li>\n<li>Total memory</li>\n<li>Total compute</li>\n<li>Dataset size</li>\n<li>Total cost</li>\n<li>Number of researchers</li>\n<li>Total research effort</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm not particularly concerned with the specific way that these resources can be deployed to increase AI capability, rather, it's important that <strong>there are inputs that can be increased arbitrarily in exchange for higher performance</strong>.</p>\n<p>In other words, once the fundamentally-limited inputs to an AI system have been maxed out, further gains will be determined by the infinitely-scalable inputs. Things like \"better prompting\" or \"clever architectures\" can certainly increase capability, but at some point, the low-hanging fruit will be picked. In order to get higher performance, researchers will have to turn to scaling [1]. What happens when we turn these dials up to 11?</p>\n<h2>The Scaling Hypothesis</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/Scaling-hypothesis\">scaling hypothesis</a> is becoming an increasingly important view in the AI safety community; some posit that \"scale is all you need\" to create AGI.</p>\n<p>Personally, I'm uncertain whether scaling will allow us to create AGI; though the fact that transformer models demonstrate emergent capabilities when scaled is certainly suggestive.</p>\n<p>Because it's at least possible that scaling existing transformer models can lead to AGI, we should do something to prepare for the worst case scenario where the hypothesis is true.</p>\n<h2>Slowing down scaling</h2>\n<p>Assuming that the Scaling Hypothesis is true, what does it mean for AI safety? Since we don't have good solutions to the alignment problem yet, it's important to slow down scaling [2] to provide more time for alignment research, outreach, and coordination.</p>\n<p>Let's look at a couple of broad interventions that might slow down scaling.</p>\n<h3>Culture</h3>\n<p>The idea here is to \"frown upon\" groups that massively scale AI systems with little regard for safety. Cultural norms may seem like a weak method to enforce rules, but a tight-knit research community has significant power over its members. The community can punish bad actors by discouraging new researchers from joining the group, reducing collaborations, or halting the flow of tacit knowledge to the group. Researchers involved in the work might suffer reputational damage for risky work and unscrupulous companies might see lower investment. Groups with a track record for safety might see a relative increase in applicant quality and receive more support from the AI community.</p>\n<h3>Regulation</h3>\n<p>Regulation could be used to limit the scale of models that companies use to train, withhold funding for risky projects, or restrict the publication of details related to massive scaling.\nCountries could enter international agreements limiting the scale and deployment of large AI models [3].</p>\n<h3>Technology</h3>\n<p>It may be possible to guide the development of AI technology via targeted technological development. For example, it may be possible to develop training paradigms which work well for small models but do not scale to larger models. Alternatively, it may be possible to create <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/BEWdwySAgKgsyBzbC/satisf-ai-a-route-to-reducing-risks-from-ai\">satisfactory AI</a> that makes the development of more sophisticated models superfluous, guiding research towards smaller, safer models. Publishing specific open source software may help <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HsDMguLtdhFP46GQ8/how-open-source-machine-learning-software-shapes-ai\">shape AI development</a> towards less risky paradigms.</p>\n<h2>Which approach is best?</h2>\n<p>While I think that all 3 approaches should receive attention, cultural approaches seem most viable in the short term. For one, influencing culture is relatively cheap compared to conducting research or lobbying governments. Additionally, culture in a small research field can change quickly, much faster than it takes to change policy or to develop and deploy new technologies.</p>\n<p>But most importantly, culture is far more adaptive than the other approaches. For example, if regulators produced a law limiting the total parameter count, researchers might switch to higher precision floating-point numbers to squeeze more performance out of the same number of parameters. It's extremely hard to craft loophole-free regulation and legislation is produced too slowly to keep up with developments in AI.</p>\n<p>On the technology side, let's say that you invented AI accelerator hardware that can cheaply train a 10 billion parameter model, but doesn't scale well to 1 trillion parameter models. It's possible that researchers will find a way to ensemble many 10 billion parameter models to get performance equivalent to a 1 trillion parameter model. In general, it can be hard to predict how a particular technology will be used or whether it will achieve certain safety goals.</p>\n<p>But cultural is much harder to thwart. Bad actors would have deceive an entire community of savvy researchers (potentially including their own team) and stop potential whistleblowers. This isn't impossible, but the difficulty and the costs of a bad reputation may be prohibitive.</p>\n<h2>Does slowing scaling help the bad guys?</h2>\n<p>One counterargument is that slowing scaling might only work on groups that are already concerned about AI-risk. This would give unscrupulous actors an upper hand, possibly increasing risk on net.</p>\n<p>This is an important point which deserves further consideration. However, my initial guess is that efforts to slow scaling across the field will still slow unscrupulous actors. This is because research in different labs is complimentary; slowing scaling at DeepMind would also impede other  groups since they rely on each other for insights.</p>\n<p>That being said, a uniformly applied scaling slowdown may still create a relative advantage for risky researchers. Cultural approaches are best suited to deal with this problem. If a research group presses on in spite of warnings about the risk, the community can respond by discouraging new researchers from joining the offending group, halting collaborations, and limiting flows of tacit knowledge [4]. This should reduce any advantage that risky groups might enjoy.</p>\n<p>Another problem is that these techniques might be used to selectively disadvantage specific groups unrelated to their safety profile. For example, there is a long history of large companies using government regulation to raise barriers to entry in order to reduce competition. Existing AI companies could lobby for additional safety regulations in order to block new entrants. This is another reason to be hesitant about using regulations to slow AI scaling. Fortunately, it seems less likely that the other approaches can be used to gain an unfair advantage.</p>\n<p>It's unclear whether this possibility is enough to outweigh the benefits of slowing scaling, but the design of any of these methods should minimize their potential for abuse [5].</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In addition to direct alignment work, the AI safety community should consider how to slow down AI scaling  to <a href=\"https://www.greaterwrong.com/posts/BbM47qBPzdSRruY4z/instead-of-technical-research-more-people-should-focus-on\">buy more time</a>. Of the approaches listed here, developing cultural norms against reckless scaling is the easiest, fastest, and most adaptive solution.</p>\n<p>Future work should specify how to build consensus amongst the broader AI community via outreach to companies, scientists, and industry leaders. Widespread cultural norms against unsafe research practices can slow bad actors, foster coordination, and slow the development of AGI.</p>\n<p>I also implore AI researchers to frown upon massive, reckless scaling of AI systems. Public discussion of safety concerns can help to punish bad actors and establish expectations for good practices in AI research.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>This is not to say that scaling is as simple as changing the number of parameters in a Python script. Continual scaling requires new techniques and increasingly specialized researchers. Steady Moore's-law-like improvements may seem automatic from the outside, but constant growth typically requires <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/10/15/is-science-slowing-down/\">exponentially increasing resources</a> in order to combat the loss of low-hanging fruit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For the rest of this post, I'm going to ignore the possibility of stopping scaling entirely since it seems unrealistic. If you like, you can think of stopping scaling entirely as a specific type of slowdown. In general, I am <a href=\"https://harsimony.wordpress.com/2022/06/02/against-table-flipping-approaches-to-ai-safety/\">against</a> such pivotal acts, but that's a discussion for another time.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Though it may seem impossible to prevent risky research from occurring in private, there is <a href=\"https://eukaryotewritesblog.com/2017/06/30/book-review-barriers/\">some evidence</a> that requirements of secrecy halt flows of tacit knowledge and limit the development of dangerous technologies (more on this in a future post).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In the extreme, this policy would create an independent research group, ostracized from the community (though ideally major steps would be taken to avoid this outcome). At this point, cultural incentives are unlikely to have an effect. Nothing can stop completely independent actors, but the policies suggested here can still slow them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Regardless, attempts to slow AI scaling will probably not make the situation worse. Companies likely already use similar techniques to gain an advantage and it is unclear that independent efforts to slow scaling would give them a larger advantage. Even if these approaches were partially abused in order to gain an unfair advantage, they would still accomplish the goal of slowing down AI research.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n", "user": {"username": "harsimony"}}, {"_id": "xddZxe8CwroMQmJLv", "title": "Rationality Policies", "postedAt": "2022-11-17T17:39:01.142Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The rule of law is one of our most important political inventions. Written rules help address problems with biased, corrupt or otherwise untrustworthy people in power. Who shouldn\u2019t be trusted with arbitrary power? Everyone. We\u2019re all fallible.

You should want written rules to constrain and guide your actions. And you should transparently share information about what you\u2019re doing, so others can check for mistakes and hold you accountable.</p>\n<p>The basic concept of the <a href=\"https://criticalfallibilism.com/fallibilism-bias-and-the-rule-of-law/\">rule of law</a> should be used for personal rationality too. Don\u2019t trust yourself to be unbiased or rational. Expect to fail sometimes and plan for that; design policies that will reduce the harm of your failures. Write down rules for yourself, follow them, and provide transparency.</p>\n<p>Even that won\u2019t always work. This stuff is hard. Government officials abuse power often. The rule of law doesn\u2019t solve all the problems. It just makes things better. Rationality policies combined with trying your best to be rational will give you a better chance of success than trying without policies. Policies will make it harder to fail in some ways, and push you in some of the right directions.</p>\n<p>The perspective that you know you\u2019re trustworthy is a mistake. The rule of law isn\u2019t just for leaders who think \u201cI know I\u2019m trustworthy, but other people don\u2019t know it, so I have to go out of my way for their peace of mind.\u201d It\u2019s not primarily about asymmetric information. Instead, as counter-intuitive as you may find it, your perspective should be: \u201cI\u2019m fallible. I\u2019m making many mistakes that I\u2019m blind to. I have biases that I\u2019m not aware of. This applies to ideas I\u2019m highly confident about.\u201d You should do many things to counter that problem. You should expend major effort, in multiple ways, trying to deal with that difficult situation \u2013&nbsp;that you may be wrong about issues where you feel strongly confident that you\u2019re right. Rationality policies are one tool that can help, if used well. You have to know what you\u2019re doing though; not all rationality policies are beneficial; bad policies can use effort but make things worse.</p>\n<h2>Examples of Policies</h2>\n<p>These examples are intended to give people some ideas of some things that rationality policies can be like.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whenever you spend more than 15 minutes reading something (that\u2019s accessible to the general public), you must either upvote it or reply pointing out a mistake (if those features are available). Every time you do this must be documented on a public list you maintain. (Even if an upvote or reply feature isn\u2019t available, you can still put it on your own list, where you specify an upvote or include the text of your reply.)</li>\n<li>For every 5 things you upvote, you must write a reply to at least one of them.</li>\n<li>When you spend more than 8 minutes reading something, you have to write down one reason it\u2019s worth your time. For every 25 things, you must choose 5 other things you didn\u2019t read and write a reason why not. For every 100 things, you must write an analysis of how you\u2019re prioritizing your time and whether you should make any changes for the next 100 things.</li>\n<li>Debate anyone who asks.</li>\n<li>Debate anyone who asks who meets some conditions (see the \u201cExample Debate Conditions\u201d section below).</li>\n<li>Visit one new online forum per year (and look around, read some stuff, and write at least 10 posts). Optionally require it that it disagree with you in some way, or be from a subculture you\u2019re unfamiliar with, or some other condition to help make sure you\u2019re actually expanding your horizons.</li>\n<li>Before making an important decision, spend at least 5 minutes (use a timer) doing written brainstorming of ways it could go wrong. Then review your list and try to think of solutions that will prevent those bad outcomes from happening. If you can\u2019t think of at least 3 dangers plus solutions, abort the decision (unless it\u2019s extremely urgent or you\u2019ve been stuck for a long time, in which case a risky decision may be better than nothing).</li>\n<li>When you find a sentence confusing, make a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7MOFMORS1c\">grammar tree diagram</a> to figure it out. Limit: one per day. More is optional.</li>\n<li>Make at least one <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTKv5_bZRoY\">paragraph tree</a> per month.</li>\n<li>Freewrite at least twice a week.</li>\n<li>Freewrite at least 10,000 words per month.</li>\n<li>Meditate at least four times per week.</li>\n<li>Read at least two books every month.</li>\n<li>Have at least two serious, long debates per year (minimum 5,000 words written by you and also by someone else).</li>\n<li>Keep a list of ideas you encounter that dislike. Every month, pick one at random (using a computer or dice, not an arbitrary choice) and write an essay (at least 800 words) criticizing it, and put the essay on your blog. Remove ideas from the list after writing about them or when they\u2019ve been on the list for a year without being chosen. Keep the list in public with dates for when ideas are added.</li>\n<li>Allow the public to share criticism with you and vote on it. Every two weeks, you respond to the highest voted criticism and reset the voting. The same criticism may be voted to the top again later, in which case you must give a different response to it.</li>\n<li>Let people submit questions. Every week, answer one random question, one question of your choice, and one most-upvoted question. Remove questions from the queue when answered. Reset upvotes every month.</li>\n<li>When you feel confused, write down a note. Spend at least five minutes trying to understand it better, either now or later. At least once every two months, purposefully find something which is confusing and engage with it in order to have a better sense of what confusion feels like. (Danger: You might learn to recognize big confusion from the confusing stuff you seek out, which could actually bias you against noticing subtle confusion because it\u2019s different than your explicit model of confusion.)</li>\n<li>Every time you and your friend John both read the same book, compete to point out the <em>least confusing part that is confusing</em>. You go back and forth pointing stuff out until no one can think of something that is less confusing but still confusing. The goal is to get better at noticing subtle confusions, ambiguities, etc.</li>\n<li>Every day, write down one prediction involving at least one number. You should be able to check whether you were right about half of them the same day you write them (and actually do that). Predictions can involve anything you don\u2019t know (\u201cIf I look up X, the answer will be\u2026\u201d), not just future events.</li>\n<li>Before judging something is bad, write out an error in words (it disagreeing with something you think you know is not an error).</li>\n<li>Before reaching a conclusion about a field, review all well known, popular schools of thought.</li>\n<li>Give direct answers to questions. E.g. say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. Elaborating after the direct answer is fine.</li>\n<li>When confronted with complex ideas on an internet forum, ask if they\u2019re original. If they\u2019re not, ask for a link or cite to the best written version that the person knows of. Read it at least enough to write down one error. (This is often socially problematic and frequently gets negative responses and no citation or link, so I do this a lot less than I\u2019d like to. I don\u2019t know how to formulate good conditions for when to do it. I just try it sporadically.)</li>\n<li>When someone makes a factual claim that ought to be backed up by published research, and which you disagree with, ask for a link&nbsp;or cite to <em>one</em> research article (not a meta study or field review article) that they had already read before the conversation started. State that you will find an error in it or concede. If they provide exactly one appropriate article in response (which is uncommon in my experience), then find an error or concede. (I like doing this, and if you haven\u2019t done it a dozen times I highly recommend it. But you need a lot of skill. Maybe trying to do it and failing could inspire you to work on those skills. Also I don\u2019t know a great way to formulate specific trigger conditions. Also I don\u2019t always want to do it with people who don\u2019t actually care if they\u2019re wrong and who will just stop talking without learning anything. However, it can be a good way to end conversations while having the optionality that, if I\u2019ve misjudged them, a good outcome can happen. Bad people tend to opt out of discussions fast when I do things like expect them to have a citation they\u2019ve already read which I want to read, analyze and discuss. Good people would either want to do that or acknowledge that their claim isn\u2019t based on research and then talk about how they reached it.)</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t read or reply to forum posts, social media posts or news articles until after doing other more important reading and writing that day, unless you make a conscious, intentional decision and write down a reason in a personal freewrite. (If you\u2019re too busy to freewrite anything that day, you don\u2019t need to go on internet forums, social media or news sites either.) (This is a policy that\u2019s harder to provide public transparency about but still fairly easy to avoid lying to yourself about as long as your rule is <em>strictly no exceptions</em>. Basically any policy is easy to lie to yourself about if you allow exceptions instead of following it exactly and literally.)</li>\n<li>If it seems like someone might want to debate you, but they don\u2019t invoke your <a href=\"https://www.elliottemple.com/debate-policy\">debate policy</a> (and you have one), link it to them.</li>\n<li>Track daily metrics (e.g. words written, words edited, hours slept, book reading). Review metrics monthly and look for problems (and make plans for improvement if you identify problems). Some people will improve tracked metrics even without any further policies or incentives.</li>\n<li>After writing a reply to someone in a discussion, before sending it, stop and consider what your goal is in the discussion, and your goal with this specific message, and whether you think this message will actually work well to accomplish your goals.</li>\n<li>Before replying to someone, consider what achievable goal you may accomplish with the reply, then keep that goal in mind while writing the reply.</li>\n<li>Look for opportunities to use debate trees. (This is vague and doesn\u2019t work well for accountability. But it can have value as a reminder to yourself or to empower others. Someone who saw this policy might want you to use a debate tree with them and request it.)</li>\n<li>When someone baits you, wait at least an hour before replying. Also consider if it\u2019s maybe ignorable.</li>\n<li>If you get triggered or stressed by a conversation, take a break until tomorrow.</li>\n<li>If you\u2019re frustrated, tilted or upset by a conversation, wait until you\u2019re calm before responding.</li>\n<li>Meditate if you\u2019re frustrated, tilted or upset due to a conversation.</li>\n<li>If you\u2019re  frustrated, tilted or upset by a conversation, do a post mortem analysis of how and why you got frustrated, tilted or upset, what mistakes you made to let that happen, how it could have been avoided, whether there were any early warning signs, and whether any of your previous messages (before you recognized your emotional problem) had any frustration, tilt or upsetness in them (and whether any of your messages mistreated someone).</li>\n<li>Think about your conversational goals when a conversation upsets you. Are you upset due to failing at some goals? Are the goals realistic? Do you have good plans, that are worth trying, to achieve those goals? If you\u2019re following good plans, and that\u2019s productive, then why be upset?</li>\n<li>When you get frustrated, tilted or upset, analyze ways your social status may have been threatened.</li>\n<li>When you upset others, analyze ways you may have threatened their social status.</li>\n<li>At least once a month, think about your goals before <em>every single thing you say</em> in a conversation.</li>\n<li>Have at least one conversation per month where you attempt to be thoughtful about every word you write, including in terms of knowing clearly what you mean and why you included that word, and doing grammar analysis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Transparency</h2>\n<p>Most of these policies can and should have some sort of <strong>transparency</strong> mechanism added on to them. I only specified that occasionally. Basically you post the policy itself publicly, take responsibility for following it, and then also share documentation so people can see whether you\u2019re following it. Also, you should have some kind of policy related to debate or at least listening to feedback, or else the transparency might not do much good. It helps if people can criticize your policies or actions where others can see. If you have an email newsletter with 10,000 readers, and they can email complaints to you, but no one else can see any of the complaints, that doesn\u2019t work very well for transparency even if you share a bunch of documentation of what you\u2019re doing. People need some reasonable way to correct you or at least get visibility for what they say, like a public forum. And the available ways to correct you need to look fairly appealing, reliable, effective, etc., from their perspective \u2013&nbsp;a lot of people won\u2019t want to waste their time correcting you if they doubt you\u2019ll listen and you have no written policy guarantees about listening to criticism.</p>\n<h2>Policy Design Pattern</h2>\n<p>A general pattern for policies is: trigger condition + action to take + measurable metric. The policy tells you <strong>when</strong> to do it and <strong>what</strong> to do, plus it offers some <strong>measurements</strong> related to both parts. And you should document your policy and actions publicly, and allow public comments, for <strong>transparency</strong>. So there are four main design elements I\u2019m using for these policies. I bet it\u2019s possible to make a useful policy with one of these design elements missing. I also bet there are other important, reusable design elements besides these four.</p>\n<p>Measuring something helps with objectivity. You can use something pretty objective, which requires little judgment, for the starting conditions and for specifying what is doing enough of a task. When you can specify numbers or amounts, there\u2019s less judgment involved. \u201cEvery 5 books you read, write at least 5000 words of notes\u201d uses something measurable for both the starting condition and the action to be taken.</p>\n<p>\u201cEvery 5 books you read\u2026\u201d could be written in a more airtight way to avoid loopholes, but if you\u2019re trying to find loopholes you\u2019re in big trouble anyway. For example, someone could stop reading books with 1 page left so they don\u2019t count as completed books in order to avoid having read 5 books. That\u2019s an example of trying to avoid doing the policy by exploiting a technicality in bad faith. There\u2019s also a lot of room for problems that happen in good faith. Some people don\u2019t finish the majority of books they start. Maybe those people should count books if they get more than 20% of the way through or if they finish the first chapter.</p>\n<p>It can be OK to include less objective statements in policies. For example, a policy may say \u201cWhen making an important decision\u2026\u201d Which decisions are important? You have to judge that. There\u2019s no easy answer. However, some decisions would appear pretty obviously important to most people, e.g. who to hire, fire or marry. If you have transparency, people could question your judgment when you decide to discount as unimportant some decisions that they care about.</p>\n<p>Often, transparency is only partial, e.g. focused on intellectual activities or decisions that affect people who aren\u2019t your close friends or family. Decisions affecting employees might only be transparent to a subset of people at the company. Transparency about personal issues like who to marry would be unusual. I wouldn\u2019t want to dismiss it out of hand as necessarily a bad idea, but it\u2019s not what I\u2019m recommending people do. Even when you aren\u2019t transparent about something, you can often still follow your policy. If you have to write 10 paragraphs about important decisions, and you provide no transparency about your marriage, you could still see for yourself whether you wrote the 10 paragraphs or not (you could also report publicly that you did it without including the actual text). It\u2019s reasonably easy to avoid fooling yourself about simple things like whether or not you wrote 10 paragraphs, even without transparency.</p>\n<h2>Fooling Yourself</h2>\n<p>When dealing with actions like thinking about something, analyzing something, considering if you might be wrong, etc., it\u2019s hard to write rules that evaluate whether someone did a good job. So some good faith effort is needed. But we can write rules that check if we did it at all. E.g. you could require that you write at least 2 paragraphs, 1 sentence, 300 words, or 5 brainstormed bullet points . Or you could require thinking about it for <strong>5 minutes by the clock</strong>, to put it in terms Eliezer Yudkowsky recommended in <a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/\">Rationality: From AI to Zombies</a> (bold added):</p>\n<p>Page 218:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Which leads into another good question to ask yourself straight out: <em>Did I spend five minutes with my eyes closed, brainstorming wild and creative options, trying to think of a better alternative?</em> It has to be <strong>five minutes by the clock</strong>, because otherwise you blink\u2014close your eyes and open them again\u2014and say, \u201cWhy, yes, I searched for alternatives, but there weren\u2019t any.\u201d Blinking makes a good black hole down which to dump your duties. <strong>An actual, physical clock is recommended</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Page 322:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The moral is that the decision to terminate a search procedure (temporarily or permanently) is, like the search procedure itself, subject to bias and hidden motives. You should suspect motivated stopping when you close off search, after coming to a comfortable conclusion, and yet there\u2019s a lot of fast cheap evidence you haven\u2019t gathered yet\u2014there are websites you could visit, there are counter-counter arguments you could consider, or you haven\u2019t closed your eyes for <strong>five minutes by the clock</strong> trying to think of a better option. You should suspect motivated continuation when some evidence is leaning in a way you don\u2019t like, but you decide that more evidence is needed\u2014<em>expensive</em> evidence that you know you can\u2019t gather anytime soon, as opposed to something you\u2019re going to look up on Google in thirty minutes\u2014before you\u2019ll have to do anything uncomfortable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Page 1634:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When AI folk say to me, \u201cFriendly AI is impossible,\u201d I\u2019m pretty sure they haven\u2019t even tried for the sake of trying. But if they <em>did</em> know the technique of \u201cTry for five minutes before giving up,\u201d and they dutifully agreed to try for <strong>five minutes by the clock</strong>, then they still wouldn\u2019t come up with anything. They would not go forth with true intent to solve the problem, only intent to <em>have tried</em> to solve it, to make themselves defensible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(By the way, I thought that Yudkowsky mentioned <em>five minutes by the clock</em> more than three times in the book. Based on searching now, I was wrong. I over-emphasized it in my memory because I thought it was important and useful. That led me to incorrectly estimate how many times it featured in the book, which has consequences like potentially overestimating how similar my thinking is to Yudkowsky\u2019s.)</p>\n<p>(I could have written down a prediction for how many times it was mentioned in the book before I searched, and maybe I should have. I think writing down that prediction in advance is the kind of thing Yudkowsky would like. The basic point of writing the prediction down, like the point of using an actual clock for five minutes, is that you shouldn\u2019t trust yourself. Writing down a prediction also makes you be specific. I did not have in mind any particular number of times I thought it was in the book. It\u2019s hard to know what I would have guessed in advance, but possibly 6.)</p>\n<p>(In this case, I managed to avoid the primary danger that writing the prediction down is meant to combat \u2013 the danger of not realizing I was wrong \u2013 but presumably in some other cases I don\u2019t avoid that danger, so I should write down predictions more often as a general policy. A policy I do have, more consistently than writing predictions, is <em>emphasizing my errors</em>. Like I\u2019m writing this aside, and I think it\u2019s important enough to include in the article, because I care about mistakes and I routinely try to bring them up and draw attention to them. Similarly, I often do written post mortem analysis of mistakes. Whereas most people try to downplay mistakes, change the subject, not admit to having been mistaken, reduce the attention mistakes get, etc.)</p>\n<p>Measurable metrics don\u2019t prevent bad faith. You can easily time yourself for five minutes and think of nothing. You can wait and run out the clock without trying to think of anything if you choose to do that. You can also often find ways to game metrics. But metrics make it harder to be biased, especially if you\u2019re making a good faith effort. Also, I think those Yudkowsky passages, and many others, show that he sees the value in following explicit, objective policies, and using some measurable aspects to limit fooling yourself, even if he didn\u2019t explain it in the same way that I\u2019m approaching it. Although I\u2019m more influenced by other sources, and have had some of these ideas for a long time, I do think Yudkowsky\u2019s <em>five minutes by the clock</em> idea, and some of his other ideas, helped influence my ideas about rationality policies a little bit.</p>\n<p>I think people who act in intentional bad faith are basically lost causes, although the harm they do (in roles like king, president, judge, policeman, prison guard, lawmaker, accountant or CEO) can be limited if they have to publicly appear to follow written policies.</p>\n<p>My concern is primarily with people who are making some effort to be reasonable, but who sometimes fool themselves, rationalize things, are blind to their own biases, etc. Those people who want to be rational can be helped a lot with policies because they will at least partially follow the spirit of the policies in addition to the letter.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s very important to always follow your policies <em>exactly</em> as written with no exceptions whatsoever <em>and also</em> to make a good faith effort to follow the intent or spirit of the policy. <em>You need both literal rule-following and also to want and like the purpose of the policy.</em> If either is missing, it won\u2019t work well.</p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t want to follow a particular policy exactly as written, don\u2019t post it as your public policy, and don\u2019t tell people you\u2019ll follow it. Don\u2019t give and break your word. Rewrite it or consider some other policy with softer rules.</p>\n<p>If you have a policy and run into a problem, change it <em>later</em>. E.g. follow it this time, then wait a week to get some distance, then think it over, then (if you think it\u2019s best) change it for the future. Suspend it during the pause week if necessary so it can\u2019t be used again. If you violate policies when they\u2019re inconvenient, then you\u2019re breaking your word and defeating the purpose of having policies.</p>\n<p>Your policies should be fairly stable and infrequently changed. They should be written carefully and thoughtfully to enable this. Keep in mind that the public may see a policy and plan ahead. If you guarantee to debate under certain conditions, someone might spend months researching a debate topic and meeting the conditions before asking you for a debate. Your policies have to be stable on a multi-year timeframe or other people who work on long timeframes and make large efforts (in other words, some of the best people) will find you unreliable.</p>\n<p>If you want to have policies but you\u2019re unsure, <em>label them as tentative policies that you might change</em>. Say it\u2019s a beta test. If you put disclaimers on them that they\u2019re just experimental ideas that you might not follow, then it\u2019s fine to change your mind frequently. As long as you don\u2019t pretend your policies are reliable, and fool yourself or others, then it\u2019s OK if they aren\u2019t reliable. You can also write down a candidate policy privately then pay attention to what following it would be like and try following it as long as that works OK for you. That\u2019s kind of like playing the stock market with fantasy money before using real money.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good idea to start with tentative policies and beta test them. In general, you should only give your word that you\u2019ll follow policies if you\u2019ve tested them out for a significant time period first and found that they\u2019ve worked OK for you.</p>\n<h2>Example Debate Conditions</h2>\n<p>Here are some examples of conditions you might require before accepting a debate with someone, rather than accepting debates with absolutely anyone (which might be too many debates or debates which are too low quality).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>10k twitter followers or other social media metric (problematic but you could do a lot worse)\n<ul>\n<li>10 blog posts or 10,000 words written</li>\n<li>Provides real name</li>\n<li>States that they believe they have something important to say to you that you don\u2019t know</li>\n<li>States a clear thesis that they disagree with you about</li>\n<li>Speaks English</li>\n<li>Will debate in public</li>\n<li>Agrees not to misquote</li>\n<li>Agrees to only stop the debate under certain conditions, not to just randomly go silent at any moment</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example Debate Stopping Conditions</h3>\n<p>In general, any debate can stop due to unanimous consent. Taking that option away would be a special case (and would probably involve a short time limit). The stopping rules below are meant as alternatives for when unanimous consent is not achieved and someone wants to stop. More than one of these could be allowed. Also, each condition means you stop if anyone actually wants to stop. They let <em>one</em> person <em>unilaterally</em> stop the debate, but they don\u2019t require you to stop.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Advance notice 3 messages before stopping</li>\n<li>Length 5 <a href=\"https://elliottemple.com/essays/debates-and-impasse-chains\">impasse chain</a></li>\n<li>Write a final summary message explaining your perspective on the debate</li>\n<li>You believe, in your own opinion, that you either won or lost the debate (and say which and why)</li>\n<li>You\u2019ve written 10,000 words in the debate</li>\n<li>You\u2019ve replied 20 times in the debate</li>\n<li>The debate has lasted over a month (even though you\u2019ve been responsive)</li>\n<li>Debate tree reaches at least 42 nodes</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Example: Reading Other Perspectives</h2>\n<p>Policy: <em>Read one article from a rival tribe every week. For transparency, after you read an article, post a link or cite, with the date, to a public list you maintain.</em></p>\n<p>The goal is to engage with other perspectives and ideas. You could add extra detail to the policy, e.g.:</p>\n<p><em>You can\u2019t use the same tribe twice in one month.</em></p>\n<p>This would help with the concern that you find a couple rival tribes that you like and ignore other ones that challenge your perspective more. Part of the goal is to expose yourself to a wide variety of ideas.</p>\n<p>These policies aren\u2019t foolproof. You could find some loophole or follow them in bad faith. There are two things that could keep you honest. First, your integrity. Second, other people could offer criticism since you\u2019re providing transparency.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t expect this to work well unless you actually <em>like</em> the policy. If you do this policy because you feel like you \u201cshould\u201d, or because other people in your social group do it, then there\u2019s a significant risk that it won\u2019t help you (but it also might help; there\u2019s still a chance it works well). Similarly, if you read the articles begrudgingly, as a painful duty, it\u2019s not going to expand your mind well. But people occasionally start doing something with a terrible attitude and then get drawn in, so that\u2019s not hopeless either.</p>\n<h2>Warnings</h2>\n<p>It\u2019s problematic to use generic rationality policies off a list. If you\u2019re going to try to be rational and use policies to help you, you need to be actively involved in that process and have personalized, customized, individualized ideas about what will work for you. You need policies that you understand well, see the point of, care about, and will actually do. Writing your own policies is generally related to those things actually being true. If you had a personal friend, tutor or mentor who helped you write policies, that would also work much better than generic policies because they\u2019d be designed to fit your life.</p>\n<p>Generic policies can serve as examples and inspiration. You can create similar policies for yourself. You can reuse elements of generic policies. You can also look at example policies to find patterns and better understand what a policy can be like. But this topic is under-explored, so don\u2019t assume my examples cover all the types of policies that could be standard, common or useful; I don\u2019t think they do.</p>\n<h2>See Also</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7urvvbJgPyrJoGXq4/fallibilism-bias-and-the-rule-of-law\">Fallibilism, Bias, and the Rule of Law</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/o8ps3uC68AFkGivTJ/my-experience-with-my-debate-policy\">My Experience with My Debate Policy</a>.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Elliot Temple"}}, {"_id": "ddeCNBhYc2sANsixS", "title": "AI Forecasting Research Ideas", "postedAt": "2022-11-17T17:37:40.600Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Overview</strong></p><ul><li>The linked document contains a collection of AI Forecasting research ideas, prepared by some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://epochai.org/\"><u>Epoch</u></a> employees in a personal capacity</li><li>We think that these are interesting and valuable projects that research interns or students could look into, though they may vary in difficulty (depending on your background/experience)</li><li>This is the result of a quick brainstorming and curation, rather than a thorough deliberative process.

By all means read only the sections you care about.</p><h3><strong>What The Hell Happened?</strong></h3><p>Background: FTX is a crypto exchange largely owned and run by SBF. Alameda Research is a prop trading firm owned by SBF. FTT is FTX\u2019s exchange token, where they commit a portion of profits to buying back FTT. Thus, FTT is a non-registered security, functionally similar to junior non-voting stock in FTX.</p><p>The events of the past week, and the proximate cause of them, seem to have gone as follows, with some events likely slightly out of order or happening simultaneously.</p><p>Alameda Research, SBF\u2019s crypto trading firm, has its balance sheet leaked.</p><p>The balance sheet contains <i>a lot </i>of FTT, such that if FTT loses its value it is not clear that Alameda would remain solvent.</p><p>This raises questions. Some people notice. Caroline, CEO of Alameda, says this is incomplete and that Alameda is fine.</p><p>CZ, head of Binance, who had been in various battles with SBF, notices. He announces the intention to sell &gt;$500mm of FTT, but does not actually sell.</p><p>Alameda offers to buy all his FTT at $22/coin, almost full market price at the time but a deal cannot be reached.</p><p>Other people sell a lot of FTT. There are not other buyers. Alameda spends capital trying to defend the $22 price, and ultimately fails. They continue to sell everything they can to support FTT and to pay FTX depositors, but ultimately cannot keep pace.</p><p>SBF says that FTX deposits are backed 1:1, that customers are fine, everything is fine (narrator: he lied, they were not fine.)</p><p>There is a run on FTX as customers withdraw money. $5bb is taken out.</p><p>FTX is forced to pause withdrawals.</p><p>There is something set up whereby Justin Sun sets up funds to allow coins in his ecosystem, such as Tron,<a href=\"https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/10739365280276-FTX-Announcement-Regarding-the-Tron-Credit-Facility\"> to be withdrawn to outside wallets</a>, which causes the value of those coins to spike as people buy them in order to withdraw what they can.</p><p>SBF tries to raise capital from various sources. He fails.</p><p>SBF calls up CZ and asks Binance to buy FTX. CZ agrees and signs a non-binding letter of intent, subject to due diligence.</p><p>CZ looks at FTX\u2019s books, presumably in contrast to everyone else who invested in FTX in previous rounds. <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/930c6cea-5457-4dfa-9d47-666c0698c335\">Somehow they did previously have a \u2018Gaap audit\u2019 the accountants for which are now under investigatio</a>n.</p><p>CZ<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92gP2J0CUjc&amp;ab_channel=JoeDonahue\"> runs away</a>, saying FTX is \u2018beyond our ability to help.\u2019</p><p>SBF issues a Twitter apology thread and continues claiming FTX is solvent.</p><p>Later withdrawals are enabled for residents of the Bahamas and perhaps other insiders, at 100% of value.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/0xfoobar/status/1590978050950279168\"> Some people who can withdraw sell NFTs at highly inflated prices</a>, then withdraw the proceeds.<a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/186467/bahamas-regulator-ftx-claim-process-withdrawals?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\"> Bahamas authorities later claim they in no way asked for this or even find it acceptable</a>.</p><p>FTX is very much not solvent, at least in part because they stole (\u2018loaned out\u2019) ~$10bb in customer funds and used them among other things to bail out Alameda, invest in VC funds, buy a large stake in Robinhood, and so on.</p><p>We later see<a href=\"https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/29694056.70294/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnQuY29tL2NvbnRlbnQvMGMyYTU1YjYtZDM0Yy00Njg1LThhOGQtM2M5NjI4ZjFmMTg1/5b721627ecf12a5fde091cf0Bea49acdc\"> a balance sheet</a> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/kadhim/status/1591545782229925889\">this thread has a photo that\u2019s not gated</a>) and it could not be worse.<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-14/ftx-s-balance-sheet-was-bad\"> Matt Levine warns that if you look at it too long you will go insane.</a> It contains claimed billions in assets that are worthless, that they made up themselves while giving themselves most of the tokens like Serum and Maps.

This is my current understanding of the key events leading up to the events of the past two weeks. If I left something off this list, it does not mean it didn\u2019t happen or wasn\u2019t important, this is simply the events that seem salient to me as I write the list.</p><p>SBF is influenced by<a href=\"https://twitter.com/KerryLVaughan/status/1591508728255516673\"> his longtime friend Will MacAskill</a> and others by the principles of Effective Altruism. He adopts na\u00efve utilitarianism, and he decides to become a trader in order to Earn to Give.</p><p>SBF leaves his trading job to ostensibly accept a job offer from Will MacAskill to come work in Berkeley for the Center for Effective Altruism. He is on their board. An alternative possibility is that this was a cover story to throw off his former employer and protect his shot at the Japan arb.&nbsp;</p><p>SBF discovers (before or after deciding to move out to Berkeley and leaving his trading job) that you can buy Bitcoin (BTC) in America at one price, and sell it in Japan or South Korea at a different higher price.</p><p>SBF decides not to work at the Center for Effective Altruism. Arbitrage ho!</p><p>He founds Alameda Research in order to take advantage of this opportunity.</p><p>Alameda and later FTX are founded explicitly as Effective Altruist organizations, although they rely on commercial investment and seed funding. Early employees are mostly or all EAs. The hiring process filters aggressively for goodness of fit a lot of which is to what extent someone is an EA.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/violet_forest/status/1591599595855171585\"> They pitch FTX and Alameda as places to go work if you are looking to do good.</a></p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_Research#:~:text=and%20trading%20volatility.-,History,job%20at%20Jane%20Street%20Capital.\">He has at least one cofounder, Tara Mac Aulay</a>, but registers the company entirely in his name as sole owner. I do not understand how he was permitted to do this.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xafpj3on76uRDoBja/the-ftx-future-fund-team-has-resigned-1?commentId=hpP8EjEt9zTmWKFRy\">Attempts to take advantage of the South Korean arbitrage fail</a>, but attempts to take advantage of the Japanese arbitrage succeed. They make eight figures.</p><p>This money then becomes the initial capital for Alameda Research.</p><p>Alameda aggressively scales and makes markets and trades in a crypto world where the standards for trading skill are very low and there is treasure everywhere.</p><p>There is no reason why the traders involved, given their skills, could not do very well in crypto with that kind of funding. I can say based on my personal experiences that there really was treasure everywhere back then.</p><p>It is unknown how Alameda does. <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/186187/alameda-promised-high-returns-with-no-risk-in-2018-pitch\">This is their 2018 deck, which claims &gt;100% consistent annualized returns</a> (and \u2018no risk\u2019).<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xafpj3on76uRDoBja/the-ftx-future-fund-team-has-resigned-1?commentId=hpP8EjEt9zTmWKFRy\"> I have seen claims</a> they actually lost the money that was made on the Japan trade through bad trades and recklessness, and that Sam was taking insane risks all over the place, including<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xafpj3on76uRDoBja/the-ftx-future-fund-team-has-resigned-1?commentId=Ls5a3us3DnLckjkb9\"> a likely disregard for legal risks and structures</a>.

Sam uses his sole legal ownership and various other tactics, which people have claimed were gross violations of common sense ethics and very not OK, to cut those people out and retain sole ownership.</p><p>Alameda attempts to raise money at 15% interest \u2018<a href=\"https://twitter.com/mrjasonchoi/status/1592502790932156418\">with no risk.</a>\u2019 Seriously, they said \u2018no downside\u2019 and \u2018no risk.\u2019</p><p>Sam notices that all the crypto exchanges are kind of terrible and that Alameda would benefit from working with an exchange. He founds FTX.</p><p>Alameda is FTX\u2019s first customer, making markets and otherwise trading on FTX. All the lines between them are blurred from the start. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SiegeRhino2/status/1593124406121082880\">This is one of many people who report being told to deposit to FTX via sending money to an Alameda account</a>. Everybody knows that they are doing this, and that under normal financial regulations this would not be allowed, but this is crypto and it makes financial sense for both sides if handled properly (which we now know it very much wasn\u2019t).</p><p>FTX builds a pretty good product outside of the fraud and the insolvency and the stealing customer deposits, and does a lot of things very well. The competition really is pretty terrible so it doesn\u2019t take much to offer a superior product.</p><p>FTX gets initial investment from Binance.</p><p>FTX grows by leaps and bounds, gains higher valuations, gets investment from big players, and has a profitable underlying business.</p><p>FTX and Alameda were from accounts I\u2019ve seen very much move fast and break things, seat of the pants, do what a handful of people decided was right kinds of places. I can say from personal experience that was plenty good enough in 2018, but that does not mean you can get away with it in 2022.</p><p><a href=\"https://milkyeggs.com/?p=175\">Over time Alameda\u2019s market making edge degraded as competitors improved</a>, to the point where they were likely losing money on market making. They get into other things like yield farming and venture, then directional news trading.</p><p>FTX and Alameda make a lot of money by shilling coins in which insiders are granted tons of locked tokens, and thus that will inevitably later lose all value. They make <i>a lot more than that </i>on paper, but they also make real money too.</p><p>FTX and Alameda also then put endless supplies of those same tokens on their balance sheet and claim they are worth billions and billions of dollars. Whereas if they sold them they would get essentially zero dollars.</p><p>They<a href=\"https://milkyeggs.com/?p=175\"> seem to have made frequent large directional (often or always long) bets on crypto or major coins</a>,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SamoBurja/status/1592245541651755009\"> increasingly simply going long things for extended periods during a bull market</a>, which worked out in the examples we know about while being an excellent way to lose quite a lot of money when it backfires.</p><p>FTX spends big on ads. FTX Arena. FTX on MLB uniforms. Super bowl.</p><p>SBF was hanging out with Tom Brady, I mean how did we not see this coming.</p><p>FTX and Alameda make a bunch of illiquid investments, including in Sequoia Capital, Robinhood, expensive real estate, Semafor, buying Good Luck Games and so on. They do it with borrowed money against fake assets whose value they cannot allow to collapse, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coloradotravis/status/1592375386419392513\">and perhaps borrow it from Tether</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.semafor.com/article/11/13/2022/ftxs-collapse-dries-up-sbfs-funding-for-media-non-profits-and-projects\"> SBF was looking to launch a Substack competitor for some reason</a>. He tried to get in on the Twitter deal.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alyssamvance/status/1591977512694865920\"> There were billions in such investments, my current best guess from combining various sources is between 3 and 4 billion</a> with wide error bars. How much was from real profits versus investors versus stolen customer deposits is unclear,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alyssamvance/status/1592296628290875392\"> Caroline says it came from loans backed by crypto</a> but that does not tell us the origin of the crypto, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1592363292944896001\">even if it wasn\u2019t fraud it was still nuts</a>. Alameda was taking huge risks the whole way, it seems, so on the way up they might have made a ton. <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/yahoo.html\">Notice the parallels to Yahoo and the tech bubble</a>.</p><p>FTX also splurges on a whole bunch of other non-ad stuff costing billions.</p><p>SBF starts the FTX foundation, devotes eight to nine figures.

I cannot emphasize enough how little sympathy I have on that one.</p><p>In the wake of Terra-Luna, several major crypto players including Voyager and Three Arrows Capital are bankrupt. Several such players are bailed out by FTX and Alameda. The current belief is that they did this not to help the crypto ecosystem more generally or to pick up underpriced distressed assets, but rather because not doing so<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AutismCapital/status/1590953191545671680/photo/1\"> would have caused forced selling of FTT</a> that would have threatened FTX and Alameda, and that this preserved or expanded the presence of customer funds in the FTX/Alameda space that could then be stolen. This is also why various players were pressured to store their money at FTX.</p><p>It is not known whether Terra-Luna and the direct fallout also rendered Alameda insolvent without a bailout from FTX. It is still unclear to me exactly how bad things were at this time, or how dependent they were on the non-collapse of FTT and it being treated as a valuable asset.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/patrissimo/status/1591850700572872704\">FTX\u2019s financial regulator was somehow the lawyer who covered up the Ultimate Bet cheating scandal</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ColeSouth/status/1593035288980656129\">which also involved interest on deposits and information asymmetries</a>, because why not.

We know because they had a bunch of money and made a lot of money, and then Money Gone. Note that \u2018lose\u2019 is flexible here, we don\u2019t know the details.</p><p><strong>At some point, probably when their loans were recalled in early 2022, SBF started using his backdoor to send customer funds from FTX to Alameda, or alternatively was already keeping customer funds at Alameda for no good reason and then decided to let Alameda use them.</strong> It is also unclear for now exactly when customer funds started being sent to Alameda and otherwise comingled and stolen. It could be that it happened at the start, or otherwise well before Terra-Luna and that only accelerated things, or maybe not.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/alyssamvance/status/1592296628290875392\"> Caroline\u2019s story is that this happened when their loans were recalled post-Luna</a>. The default assumption is that, either way, this happened because Alameda was broke at the time or at least highly illiquid. SBF\u2019s alternative claim, in his 11/15 completely insane texts with Kelsey Piper, is that customers sent their deposits to Alameda and they simply never remembered to collect the $8bb in such funds, which ended up as \u2018poorly labeled internal fiat account\u2019 on their balance sheet, and which Alameda then used, rather than SBF doing an active transfer. At this point I suppose I can\u2019t quite rule it out.&nbsp;</p><p>SBF filmed a Master Class about trading, which is going to be epic.</p><p>Alameda investments required the target to store their funds at FTX and use FTX services. FTX deals required various entities to maintain credit lines to Alameda.</p><p>SBF was going around trying to raise money in the weeks prior to the incident, which confused a lot of people since he shouldn\u2019t have needed it.</p><p>The endgame begins, as detailed above.</p><p>Or, the short version once again.</p><p>SBF seeks to make a lot of money to earn to give, founds Alameda.</p><p>First project is the famous Japanese BTC price arbitrage, worth 8 figures.</p><p>Business is not well-run, cofounders leave because of it, SBF cuts them out.</p><p>SBF founds FTX, things initially go well, money is made.

In general the firm was structurally permanently long and unhedged.</p><p>Some bets go well, others go much less well.</p><p>In wake of Terra-Luna Alameda\u2019s loans get recalled, a lot of money is lost and various others need bailouts or there is risk of collapse of FTT, and there is opportunity to get more funds into FTX ecosystem.</p><p>SBF decides to use his backdoor to send customer funds to Alameda, (or to allow Alameda to spend customer funds they have lying around for some reason)..</p><p>Or, the shortest version:</p><p>SBF co-founds Alameda, does an arb to make money, they start prop trading.</p><p>SBF cuts out cofounders, founds FTX tightly integrated with Alameda.&nbsp;</p><p>They increasingly make naked long bets and borrow short to invest long.</p><p>When this inevitably blows up Alameda SBF steals FTX customer funds to save it.</p><h3><strong>The Kelsey Piper Interview and the Hail Mary</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23462333/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-cryptocurrency-effective-altruism-crypto-bahamas-philanthropy\">I recommend reading Kelsey\u2019s interview with SBF after it all went down</a> if you have not yet done so. Extreme candor here, unless that too is a front. Also it is completely insane.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ByrneHobart/status/1592990355255066624\"> Includes new theory</a> of \u2018no we did not send customer funds to Alameda, we had customers send their funds directly to Alameda and forgot that they still had $8 billion of it that they could use.\u2019</p><p>SBF\u2019s biggest regret? Declaring bankruptcy, if not for that everything would be fine, he says. His entire ethical persona was a lie except perhaps for the pure naive utilitarianism. Winning is what matters, ends justify means, no one cares how you got there. And he says he \u2018has two weeks to raise 8 billion dollars\u2019 to make customers whole, sticking to the story on his balance sheet.</p><p>That is very much not a story whereby someone can raise 8 billion dollars, unless the plan is \u2018drive those who look at it insane and then take advantage of their mental incapacity.\u2019 SBF knows this, he knows we know it, it is common knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>So what is going on here? What is the final play?</p><p>(None of this post, anywhere, is investment advice or legal advice.)</p><p>If SBF <i>did </i>manage to raise 8 billion dollars, how the heck did he do that?&nbsp;</p><p>He is selling things that are not on the balance sheet.</p><p>The first additional thing he is selling is confidence in the crypto ecosystem. This is why Binance was originally willing to step in before they looked at the balance sheet and ran away screaming. FTX going down took ~$200 billion off the market cap of all crypto. Spending $8 billion to undo a lot of that damage is a collective action problem. There are some very large and very long players in the crypto space.&nbsp;</p><p>This also comes with a predictable large sudden increase in crypto prices. If you were to get long now, then buy FTX while making customers whole, then sell at the new price level, you\u2019d presumably make a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>FTX could potentially have enterprise value. It was a functional exchange. It has obviously lost all customer confidence, but under new ownership that makes customers whole, who knows what might happen? Especially if the new buyer or group is either clearly safe as houses, or has a clear path to finding a whole bunch of new customers.&nbsp;</p><p>SBF is also pitching, by implication, his knowledge and the knowledge of others at FTX. They know a lot about who is in deep trouble, who is and isn\u2019t what kind of scam, and so on. A lot of people would very much like to know all that information, for many reasons.</p><p>Finally, SBF is selling SBF. If SBF were to pull off this rescue, that does not get him out of legal jeopardy or mean his reputation and wealth are not shot to hell. It does mean that he pulled off the sale of the century. Whatever you think of him, wow can that person raise money, everyone will say. What a great trader, who has both managed to lose billions - always a plus as Levine points out every so often - and also make them and raise them. Different people place different values on willingness to engage in fraud. Perhaps there are those who would like to then be in business with this person? On <i>extremely </i>favorable terms? Also with a host of evidence of numerous crimes in case he ever tries to get out from under their thumb?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I put a <i>very very low </i>probability on that working, but I realized overnight that I was wrong to put it at zero. If it <i>does </i>happen, we will learn a lot about the world we live in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Other People Explain or Have Takes</strong></h3><p>This is a compilation of other people\u2019s explanations and summaries and such.</p><p><a href=\"https://milkyeggs.com/?p=175\">Milky Eggs posts what they think happened at Alameda Research</a>.

The interesting question is working hours. There are many jobs where there are highly diminishing returns to directly working more hours, especially doing so over long periods. There still is a real sense in which being \u2018all-in\u2019 on work really does make a super-linear difference in many jobs, whether or not that takes the form of super long hours that look like work. In the jobs where I consider myself to have been the most successful, other than writing, I was able to work basically <i>all the time, </i>and I think this made a huge difference.</p><h3><strong>Here\u2019s Your Mistake Right There</strong></h3><p>To be safe, once again: Nothing anywhere in this post is investment advice.</p><p>(Section summary: Don\u2019t commit fraud or steal customer deposits, get your share of the company properly papered, don\u2019t take loans against tokens printable at will, don\u2019t mark such tokens to market, don\u2019t borrow short and lend long without being a real bank and definitely not against your own tokens, don\u2019t go permanently super long your sector with leverage, don\u2019t give your chief enemy and rival the exact ammunition to destroy you (via CZ\u2019s FTT tokens), and do not talk to the press and confess crimes).</p><p>The biggest mistake was, <i>obviously,</i> \u2018don\u2019t commit fraud, don\u2019t steal customer deposits, don\u2019t be super shady in general and lie your ass off including to Congress and all that.\u2019 The ends do not justify the means even when the ends are excellent. Even if they did initially, when you start to think the ends justify the means, the means change your ends.</p><p>This section sets that all aside. Ignore ethics and assume linear utility of capital. What if the ends <i>did </i>justify the means (which, again, they didn\u2019t and don\u2019t.)</p><p>The whole thing is still a murderer\u2019s row of <i>incredibly </i>stupid mistakes.</p><p>First, in case anyone needs to hear this, <i>get your share of the enterprise papered. </i>Do not, I repeat do not, allow someone else to own the company outright.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Founder\"> Do not do a \u2018handshake deal\u2019 for your royalties</a>. Under business norms this is essentially <i>telling them to screw you.</i></p><p>Second, how they did the accounting for \u2018Sam coins\u2019 like Serum, in addition to FTT. The \u2018market\u2019 value of their entire stash, <i>which they could mostly print at will, </i>was counted on their balance sheets. This is not how you do accounting, because this is not relevant accounting.</p><p>So what is the purpose of such an accounting or balance sheet?</p><p>If the purpose is to give you or anyone else an accurate indication of your assets, liabilities, value and future prospects, this is obvious nonsense. You are treating the balance sheet as some sort of mystical object that you placate with meaningless large numbers. To say \u2018we are solvent,\u2019 <i>which SBF was still doing on 11/15, </i>fools no one.</p><p>Unless it <i>does</i>? Presumably this is the purpose. Fraud. Who are you fooling? If the answer is \u2018investors\u2019 or anyone else who <i>gets to see the sheet, </i>it is a pure \u2018flash your fake badge and hope they don\u2019t look at it\u2019 level con. If Sequoia Capital (or Tom Brady) fell for that, I am Jack\u2019s utter lack of sympathy. If you don\u2019t show the sheet, it\u2019s lying about net worth with extra steps.&nbsp;</p><p>My presumption is that the primary goal is to borrow against the assets. This is something they did. It is deeply stupid on behalf of the lenders. Anyone actually thinking about the situation would understand that their capital is no good. If they try to liquidate it, they will not get very much even in ordinary times, and death spirals are likely. You are lending money against an asset someone can print at will and for which there is very little demand. This is crazy.</p><p>If you are Alameda, and a lender is stupid enough to give you that loan, do you take it? If your funds are all super liquid, and the interest rate is low, then I can see it.&nbsp;</p><p>That was not what happened. Alameda took out these and other loans, <i>loans that could be recalled, </i>and made long bets like venture investments.</p><p>Seriously. What. The Hell. You cannot borrow short and invest long like that if there is the risk that the loans can be recalled or not renewed, even setting death spirals and the black magic of <i>borrowing against your own stock</i> aside. If things in general are going badly, you <i>are </i>going to die to this. What are you getting in return that justifies that? Even if utility of money is linear it makes no sense.</p><p>The value of liquid capital to a firm like Alameda is super high, even setting aside the risk you run out and die, or your loans are recalled. Locking capital up for years makes no sense. Making such investments that are effectively long crypto, or long things correlated with crypto or both, makes even less sense.</p><p>That is a big danger for everyone in the crypto space. If you are in the crypto space, you are synthetically very long crypto. All your opportunities scale with price. Enterprise value scales with price. Ability to raise or borrow capital scales with price. The list goes on. Even if you don\u2019t directly profit when the price doubles, you are very long.</p><p>When you invest in <i>other crypto projects </i>like this you are getting even longer than that. When you do that by <i>borrowing against crypto collateral </i>you are getting longer still. Meanwhile, Alameda was taking explicit naked long positions in coins for extended periods. They were flat out super long, all over the place.</p><p>If this was an explicit bet that we would never again see BTC $30k on pain of death, because most potential utility of a crypto firm is in worlds like that, then\u2026 I mean, I <i>kind of </i>get that thinking once you add in all the <i>other </i>crazy thinking, yet no. There was no need to take this risk. It did not buy anything worthwhile.</p><p>All Alameda seems to have been, after a while, is a levered bet on crypto, full stop, with a lot of leaks in it and an inability to survive downturns. Why?</p><p>Then there was the decision to shift from shady activity to outright fraud. Again, even setting aside the ethics, it seems highly unlikely that this was ever going to end well.</p><p>Even if it <i>could have </i>ended well, you know what one really shouldn\u2019t be doing while doing that? Yes, the Michael Lewis thing too, but the thing where you take someone who has the power to take you down (CZ) and get into political fights with him.</p><p>The biggest WTF moment for me - I realize there are a lot of good ones and Matt Levine has his own favorites - is letting CZ/Binance get $500mm in FTT. Intentionally handing it to him. I don\u2019t care how badly you want him formally off the cap table, either pay cash or do not do this, this is insane. You are handing your enemy the power to destroy you.</p><p>Oh, also, probably not a good idea to go around confessing crimes to the press.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Ethical Lessons Learned That Generalize Beyond Trading and EA</strong></h3><p>Before we start, in case anyone thinks \u2018SBF was right except he got caught\u2019 is a strawman position:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Alex_A_Guerrero/status/1592592515139776512\"> Here is an in-the-wild example of the other perspective: philosopher at Rutgers University biting the bullet and saying the only thing SBF did wrong was get caught, ends <i>do </i>justify means, and all this talk of fraud being wrong is \u2018just PR.\u2019</a> They aren\u2019t \u2018really reckoning\u2019 with the questions here.

When you run a business that has large enterprise value and is vulnerable to crises of confidence, having marginal dollars available in an emergency can be super valuable, even if all you do is point to it so people know you have it. If people had thought FTX was solvent, it would have been, and the opportunity cost of capital in crypto is sometimes stunningly high. All of that would apply even if FTX was being fully responsible, and it goes double given all the fraud and dark magic FTX was using.</p><p>I would also disagree with Eliezer\u2019s statement that you should expect the universe to surprise you on the upside as often as the downside. You should <i>in expectation </i>be surprised in a neutral direction. However, their <i>distributions </i>are different. If from an outside perspective FTX has a 5% chance of blowing up per year, then each day you wake up to the good news that FTX has <i>not </i>blown up, so mostly the news will be good if you are counting that as news. Whereas if one would mostly say that \u2018man does not bite dog today\u2019 is <i>not </i>news, then the news about FTX blowing up is only ever going to be bad until the situation is already quite bad.</p><p>Our world is not antifragile. Mostly disorder and unexpected things are bad news, so most updates above the standard update threshold are bad news. Note the same thing in AI, where the good news is of the form \u2018we did not make any major visible progress towards ending the world today\u2019 and the bad news is of the form \u2018we <i>did </i>make such progress, look at this new result.\u2019 So every time we get surprising news things seem like they are going worse than expected, which locally they are. Things do also seem to in general be going worse than expected on that front, but it does not obviously follow. We see a similar thing with Musk and Twitter, where the hunt is on for Bad News on a fractal level, so we should expect the news reports to be Bad News even if things are going well.</p><p>With related reasoning,<a href=\"https://gideons.substack.com/p/altruism-wrap?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=307176&amp;post_id=84371532&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;utm_medium=email\"> Gideon blames the intersection of California ideology and the boiler room</a>, and he draws the obvious conclusions about the dangers of na\u00efve utilitarian thinking to cause the inversion of morality where it is immoral <i>not </i>to make as much money as possible, and then you spend that money teaching others to do the same.</p><p><a href=\"https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1590452854317514752.html\">Rao points out in this thread</a> that when you try to spend <i>large </i>amounts of money on anything, you inevitably have to do so through abstraction and bureaucracy, and anything done at scale (EA donations being only a special case of this issue) will thus tend to be all screwed up.

If you explicitly claim the customer funds are there and they are not there, if you say you will keep the client funds there in your terms of service and you do not therein keep the client funds, if you offer loans against your own token, if your balance sheet is what we have seen, yeah, sorry, it\u2019s overdetermined to be fraud, and it\u2019s willful ignorance to not understand this.)</p><p>Side note: I do think that Joshua\u2019s position on AGI risk,<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jachiam0/status/1591220715872976897\"> which is</a> that \u2018anyone who tells you probabilities are in the 5%-10% range or greater that AGI will immediately and intentionally kill everyone is absolutely not thinking clearly\u2019 is very much <i>him </i>not thinking clearly, unless the \u2018immediately\u2019 he is saying here means, like, 2023, or \u2018the first five seconds/minutes after you turn it on.\u2019 The fact that he works on AGI at OpenAI and has this attitude should <i>terrify </i>you.</p><p>If this had indeed been a tail risk, a black swan, that was highly unlikely while also being preventable with better choices, what would I think of this argument? I would say that there is reason to worry, it should <i>definitely </i>be a negative update and need to be examined carefully. Also there would be big danger of some sort of large categorization error going on here, and problems like this are hard, that is the whole point.</p><h3><strong>This Was Not a Black Swan, We Could Have Seen This Coming</strong></h3><p>However, <i>this was not a black swan and this was not a tail risk.</i></p><p>This was a white swan. It was a regular risk.</p><p>Certainly, from the FTX perspective, this was an ordinary, regular risk. If you know the kinds of things being done and the risks being taken at FTX and Alameda, under <i>any </i>possible interpretation at this point, you know there is the danger you will blow up if you miscalculate, especially if you get attacked and if people sell a lot of your token at once. Then you get into a political fight with someone who has $500mm of your token.</p><p>From the outside perspective?</p><p>There are at least two levels on which one could have seen this coming.</p><p>Alameda and FTX are taking crazy risks including being hugely synthetically long crypto, while borrowing short and investing long, so Alameda could easily blow up, and perhaps take FTX with it.</p><p>If it does blow up SBF will steal customer funds to try and prevent this.</p><p>Did we have enough information to conclude at least #1? Yes. We <i>absolutely </i>did.</p><p>Remember that SBF and Caroline were very public about being willing to take big risks, even at a planetary scale, and that he took expected value utilitarian thinking both seriously and literally. Very much an explicit bite the St. Petersburg paradox bullet when asked attitude. When someone like that blows up like this, is it ever really a tail risk? It is not even obviously a failure of risk management so much as a philosophical decision <i>to not do risk management </i>in a way we would consider proper.</p><p>This is thus very overdetermined to <i>not </i>be that surprising from the inside, it was a risk SBF and others chose to take on in order to, in their minds, increase expected value. I think that was both horrible ethics, and also horrible expected value calculation. What it wasn\u2019t was a black swan.</p><p>We also know, because they explicitly told us, that they were taking large long positions in coins while also being synthetically long in other ways, much of which was illiquid. It does not take a genius to see this could blow up. From the outside, <i>if you were paying attention, </i>it seems fair to say you still had enough evidence to know this wasn\u2019t a tail risk.&nbsp;</p><p>Most people got this wrong, some did not. That does not mean that most people in EA, or in crypto, or in general, did anything wrong in response to this level of risk. Most were not so exposed to FTX failing. Others were. I think it is fair to say that anyone who had reason to examine this, or did examine it, and did not see much risk, loses Bayes points and needs to reflect, myself and Patrick McKenzie included. I did not put the clues together.</p><p>The question is whether one should have seen <i>the stealing of customer deposits </i>coming, that the whole thing was pure fraud not simply ordinary crypto risk and fraud (which, again, is not a black swan when it blows up).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>My mistake on this was two fold. One, I had far too low a prior on SBF stealing customer funds given what I knew (and given what I could have known). Two, I reacted to SBF claiming everything was fine as thinking that was a <i>polarizing declaration. </i>Once you say that, <i>either </i>everything is fine, customer assets are backed and this will all blow over. <i>Or, </i>things are very much not fine, and FTX and Alameda are pure frauds. Middle ground becomes extremely unlikely - as Patrick McKenzie said it is strange to do the thing you do when you are Very Not Fine in that spot, although he also did not sufficiently update at the time.</p><p>In that moment, I thought \u2018surely this is not pure stealing of customer funds, SBF is neither that malicious nor that stupid, right?\u2019 rather than updating properly that this was strong evidence of the stealing of customer funds. The moment the dam broke, and it was clear things were not fine, it was clear things were probably going to get worse, although things still got worse than I was expecting from there.</p><p>What about getting to #2 in advance? Can we add in, <i>at the time,</i> all the money being spent, all the strange requests and clauses, all the risk loving, all the shots being taken, all the illiquid investments and loans (which were largely public if you looked), all the predatory \u2018Sam coins,\u2019 all the complaints from former co-founders and everything else, and conclude that this house of cards is likely based on outright fraud?&nbsp;</p><p>I do not think one can be <i>confident </i>in this. I do think that if you were <i>confident this was not true </i>after an investigation, you were making a mistake.</p><p>Note that this applies differently to VC investment (either in FTX, or by FTX) versus professional traders on the exchange.</p><p>If you are a VC investor or taking VC money, the optimal amount of fraud, from your perspective, <i>is not zero. </i>You are <i>more excited </i>to invest if you <i>suspect </i>a fraud, those kinds of founders make good and make dreams real for you. So what if sometimes it all blows up? This is a game of hits for you, and you are much more worried about being asked why you <i>didn\u2019t </i>invest in FTX than you should worry about people asking why you <i>were. </i>This goes double for crypto.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/diviacaroline/status/1592648452240216065\">Notice this VC <i>ready to invest in SBF again if he asked</i></a><i>. </i>Which, from a pure EV perspective, sure why not, same as they invested in Adam Neumann.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, I do not view \u2018the VCs didn\u2019t catch this\u2019 as much of a justification. They are not supposed to catch it. It is not their job to catch it. I mean, they are supposed to do <i>some </i>things to catch <i>this level </i>of fraud, demanding voting shares and a company board in which they have a seat and doing proper audits, but they got <i>none </i>of that, because he needed to not allow it and the pitch was so good otherwise they went along (or, they took this to mean \u2018this is a fraud\u2019 and invested anyway thinking they were not the sucker, also plausible). SBF said \u2018you can\u2019t check for fraud, invest or don\u2019t\u2019 then they are doing what they do, as much as we might hate that. Better to make that common knowledge.</p><p>The institutional traders are different. They face a different risk profile. If the exchange blows up in 10% of years that is a real drag on returns, whereas a VC expects 80% or more of their investments to go to zero, fraud or otherwise. Why did they trade?</p><p>Some of them Did Not Do the Research, no doubt. Others likely decided it was worth the risk. If FTX is an easy place to make money, because trading is very good against Alameda and generally they treat customers great, and they pay interest on USD and BTC, it is not difficult to imagine a decision that the blowup risk is worth taking, at least for some portion of one\u2019s bankroll. Or one can say that if FTX goes down everything is terrible anyway, it\u2019s already systemic risk, so assume it won\u2019t fail.&nbsp;</p><p>Another play is to hedge the risk with a short position elsewhere, and put your leveraged longs at FTX since if FTX goes broke you would have gotten liquidated at Binance anyway.</p><p>We do not know how much FTX risk reduced deposits (or depressed the value of crypto, see the last section) before the blowup. I can\u2019t blame <i>retail, </i>in some sense, for falling for all the retail advertising, and the choice to do that suggests potential comparative advantage there.</p><p>I also simply don\u2019t buy the \u2018if the smart people didn\u2019t see it you get off the hook for not seeing it\u2019 argument. I mean, sure, <i>somewhat, </i>it's a partial<i> </i>excuse, but it is very much not a full excuse. People are blind, especially when it suits their outlook and ability to pitch their business.&nbsp;</p><p>Back to the main thread of logic here.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>If you thought from the outside this was a tail risk, </i>then I think <i>very few </i>people on the outside handled it so badly. It doesn\u2019t much change what you should do unless you are reasonably central or dependent. What are you going to do, buy credit default swaps on FTX as insurance? The reason why this was handled badly is that it <i>wasn\u2019t </i>a tail risk or a black swan.</p><p>Except, when we say \u2018handle tail risks\u2019 with respect to AGI or pandemics?</p><p>Those are also not tail risks! Those are risks! Yes, they are tail risks on <i>any given day, or week, or month, or maybe year or even decade. </i>Over the long term, no. They are probably <i>inevitable </i>things we must deal with. We have model uncertainty, so perhaps not, but the chance of facing another pandemic within 100 years seems much higher than 50% (assuming otherwise normal conditions). The chance of facing an unaligned AGI within 100 years, or 50 years, or 20 years, is a matter of much debate, yet if you think the chances are all so low that they count as <i>tail risks </i>then I am confident you are being stupid about this.</p><h3><strong>The Future of Effective Altruist Ethics</strong></h3><p>SBF admitted in his interview with Kelsey Piper that a lot of his talk about ethics was fake.

FTX was in large part throwing funds at anything that had sufficiently good EA branding, and little else. The flip side of \u2018EA\u2019s cause areas and problems are everyone\u2019s cause areas and problems\u2019 is to not assume all good must be done inside the self-dealing ingroup, and making decisions based on EA\u2019s reputation does not lead down good paths. This is an excellent time to halt and catch fire, to take stock, to ask what other types of fraud or fooling ourselves were taking place. Current honesty norms are, according to Habryka and other private sources, degrading over time. There is a chance for EA to emerge from this as a <i>much better, </i>if for now less well-funded and less-liked, movement - if people take that opportunity.</p><h3><strong>Reporting Live From the EA Forum: Highlights</strong></h3><p>I pulled 20 posts from the EA Forum about FTX.

The first and most common (called a \u201cpreference claim\u201d) target transactions that happened in the 90 days prior to the bankruptcy filing. <strong>Essentially, if you received money from an FTX entity in the debtor group anytime on or after approximately August 11, 2022, the bankruptcy process will probably ask you, at some point, to pay all or part of that money back.</strong></p><p>The second clawback process (called a \u201cfraudulent conveyance claim\u201d) targets transactions that happened up to two years prior to the bankruptcy filing. The root of these claims is an allegation that the debtor moved assets out of their organization <i>for the purpose of</i> frustrating future creditor claims.

I very much wish such statements would recognize there is nothing special about EA here, and simply say here (for example) \u2018fraud is always unacceptable, period.\u2019 Yes, it is good to see everyone condemn fraud, even after it is uncovered. It is still one hell of a low bar. Most fraudulent organizations take a formal anti-fraud stand (if formal enough to have such stands at all) and few if any take the opposite position - I am curious about certain weird cases like the Communist Party, which seems to take a clear pro-ends-means position. Which is a hint. There are also a handful of <i>people </i>who endorse fraud when asked, one of whom arguably was recently president. It makes him smart.

He also needs to ask how his influence and teachings, and his personal sponsorship and advocacy for SBF, did not prevent, or even helped cause, the events in question. <i>It does not matter what one explicitly writes in books </i>if people end up taking away the opposite message when the chips are down..</p><p>It is very reasonable to take time to reflect here, as Will says he is doing.

The <i>need </i>for it is now larger, and one could say that the \u2018threshold of competence\u2019 to expect chance of success is lower. However, the whole of earning to give\u2019s results were previously mostly SBF and others at FTX, which no longer count in the win column. If they got there by fraud and insane risk taking, then lost it all, earning to give\u2019s track record and prospects going forward look much worse, even if returns are higher. This is also a warning that if you are the type to try and make billions, <i>you should worry that your ethics are vulnerable along the way. </i>Most people who make it to billionaire do not keep the values and ethics they started with, and there are signs SBF was willing to cut ethical corners from the start.</p><p>Certainly, on a personal level, I have updated <i>in favor of </i>considering trying to make a lot of money, especially if it turns out that non-profit funding is sufficiently scarce that it does not make sense for me to be raising it for Balsa.

The very good inflation number means this is more like a real ~25% decline, which still seems too low. It is crypto, so anything can happen at any time.&nbsp;</p><p>The trick: This says nothing about whether the <i>pre-blowup </i>price was accurate.</p><p>This brings us to the three hypotheses that make sense to me.</p><p>This somehow is not... that... bad? I mean, this does not <i>really </i>make sense to me. This seems really bad. Still 25% is a lot, and the decline in market value is 5x-10x the wipeout at FTX. Perhaps further contagion can be prevented and this move now makes sense.</p><p>Perhaps a lot of insiders already sold off or went short knowing this was coming (at least eventually),maybe&nbsp; some of them were super short, and it was priced in quite a bit. Given it didn\u2019t have the BTC and other coins its customers thought they had, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WilliamAEden/status/1593099639297048578\">a lot of this selling was by FTX itself</a>. That this would make FTX itself and its selling the cause of FTX\u2019s loans being recalled, at the same time they were going long in ways that didn\u2019t create market impact. Wow. Prices were already far down from their highs, so that <i>would </i>explain it. Then those insiders can cover the shorts or buy back in at a profit, taking the money from \u2018weak hands\u2019 in liquidations, same as it ever was. The cycle continues.</p><p>The other explanation is that insiders <i>simply cannot allow prices to fall further.</i></p><p>Call that last one the Rubicon theory. What happened to FTX was at least partly contagion from Terra-Luna. There is already going to be a lot more contagion from FTX. How many more players become insolvent, how many more loans get liquidated, how many more cascading disasters happen if prices fall much further? Are <i>any </i>of the major players equipped to survive in that world?</p><p>Even if you would be solvent in such a world and able to pay all your customers and debts, <i>even if you are not directly net long, </i>the enterprise value of what you have built would be crippled. This outcome is deeply terrible for you. If you are net long, and presumably most players are quite net long, things are much worse. Customers lost perhaps $15 billion directly from FTX going under, while the market value lost dwarfs that entirely even if none of it was already priced in before.</p><p>Thus, if you are Binance or another major player, this is not simply about a stabilization fund to help particular projects. It has to be <i>extremely </i>tempting to use what capital you have to go long crypto here, again even if your balance sheet is good. Which risks making it not good, and the cycle continues.</p><p>I do continue to think crypto has some real use cases that will be further explored with time. There is a reason my new game<a href=\"https://emergentstcg.com/\"> Emergents</a> is on a blockchain. None of those uses, however, can in any way substitute any time soon for the demand that has been lost in terms of prices.</p>", "user": {"username": "Zvi "}}, {"_id": "Kedw7bGPpDXHaeRPq", "title": "[Doctoral seminar] Chemical and biological weapons: International investigative mechanisms", "postedAt": "2022-11-17T12:26:38.806Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Participation in the workshop is extended to approximately 10 doctoral candidates and postdoctoral researchers who are currently conducting research in arms control, whether from legal, historical, political or theoretical perspectives.</p><p>Please email <a href=\"mailto:%20t.coventry@asser.nl\">Thea Coventry</a>&nbsp;to apply for the event by <strong>Monday 5 December</strong>, including your position, university affiliation and area of research.

Sam Bankman-Fried was a highly visible example of an \u201cEffective Altruist.\u201d He was a major donor both to the movement and to causes favored by the movement, for example committing $160 million in grants through the FTX Future Fund. Bankman-Fried also frequently boosted its ideology in press interviews and reportedly only earned money so that he could donate more of it to the cause, an ethos known as \u201cearn to give\u201d that was invented by the EA movement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Good summary of SBF political activity</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bankman-Fried has also shown a serious interest in engaging with mainstream U.S. politics. He has funded political candidates aligned with his own views in congressional primary races and ballot initiatives in California. In 2020, he became President Joseph Biden\u2019s second-largest campaign donor and, in 2022, the Democratic Party\u2019s second-largest individual donor behind only George Soros, having donated a total of $39.8 million. While other tech and crypto companies tend to do too little political lobbying for their own good, Bankman-Fried pursued the opposite strategy, with the result that he was both the highest-profile Effective Altruist and the highest-profile cryptocurrency entrepreneur in Washington.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Effective Altruism\u2019s claims to authority and legitimacy rest on the idea that the EA movement is better than others at allocating time &amp; resources towards saving &amp; improving human lives.</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With the collapse of FTX, the regulatory outlook for the cryptocurrency sector in the U.S. has become worse, and it seems unlikely that the venture capital industry will soon see a return on the tens of billions invested into cryptocurrency startups since 2020. This will reduce the financial resources and strategic autonomy available to tech elites in the near future. But it will also reduce the appeal of the fastest-rising philanthropic vehicle in Silicon Valley, which has increasingly become a cultural and even political force in its own right. As its name suggests, Effective Altruism\u2019s claims to authority and legitimacy rest on the idea that the EA movement is better than others at allocating time and resources towards saving and improving human lives. In Sam Bankman-Fried, perhaps its most visible proponent has demonstrated the opposite.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Totalising ideology provides EAs with justification to intervene in any area of human activity</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Effective Altruism has become both a cultural force in Silicon Valley and among ambitious young people in the English-speaking world, as well as a growing financial force in both global philanthropy and U.S. electoral politics. Affiliating with the EA movement is attractive not just because it offers new adherents a potentially high-status career and professional network, but because it also offers power. The totalizing ideology of EA provides a justification to intervene in any area of human activity\u2014whether electoral politics, technological development, or anything in between\u2014so long as it can be justified on the basis of altruism. This power can be used insofar as the EA movement can build up its moral authority and intellectual legitimacy, on which the power ultimately rests. Effective Altruism has been well on its way to becoming not just a charitable movement, but a numerically small yet influential political faction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Nishad Singh: Alameda \"couldn't have taken off without EA\" because \"all the employees, all the funding\u2014everything was EA to start with\"</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Bankman-Fried served briefly as director of development at the Centre for Effective Altruism before founding Alameda Research and then FTX, and has been transparent that the appeal of cryptocurrency is its ability to accumulate money fast, which, until recently, he had certainly achieved. Alameda\u2019s earliest trades were enabled by Bankman-Fried\u2019s friendships in the Effective Altruism community, through which Bankman-Fried found connections in Japan willing and able to help exploit the Bitcoin price arbitrage, as well as the funding to increase the scale of the trades. According to FTX\u2019s director of engineering Nishad Singh, Alameda \u201ccouldn\u2019t have taken off without EA,\u201d because \u201call the employees, all the funding\u2014everything was EA to start with.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>EA movement finances will be no worse than they were in 2019</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In 2022, the FTX Future Fund committed over $160 million in grants, including tens of millions to EA organizations, and the rest strongly influenced by EA ideas of effective charity. On November 10, the FTX Future Fund team resigned and announced that \u201cit looks likely that there are many committed grants that the Future Fund will be unable to honor.\u201d FTX\u2019s arrival on the scene funded a profusion of professional EA organizers and a growing patronage network of \u201cregranting\u201d funds given to respected community members to redistribute as they think best. All this is now threatened, but should these new positions evaporate entirely, the movement as a whole will be no worse off financially than it was in 2019.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>The loss of current grants and especially of expected future donations will be a blow to EA institutions, but they are in little danger of collapse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Careful observers &amp; live players will no longer take EA\u2019s claims of moral supremacy at face value, and the opinion of these groups has influence far in excess of their low numbers.</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The bigger blow to EA will be to its moral authority and intellectual legitimacy. EA has long benefited from a very strong position in ethical discourse and the presumption that its institutions are doing \u201cthe most good,\u201d especially among top intellectuals and ambitious live players making a name for themselves. EA\u2019s alliance with Bankman-Fried and his use of EA philosophy to justify his activities will make this presumption much harder to take for granted. The scandal will most likely fade from discourse over the next few months as news cycles move on and, like any scandalized movement, EAs will be especially motivated to downplay the events or simply ignore them. However, careful observers and live players will remember the relationship and will no longer take EA\u2019s claims of moral supremacy at face value, and the opinion of these groups has influence far in excess of their low numbers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Like most ideologies, Effective Altruism makes it easy for the ends to justify the means</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like most ideologies, Effective Altruism makes it easy for the ends to justify the means: if doing more good requires acquiring more money, then perhaps even questionable means of acquiring more money can be easily justified or excused as a smaller evil in the service of the greater good. The phenomenon of wealthy businessmen taking to charity to polish their image and justify questionable business practices is also not a new one. Before the liquidity crunch at FTX, this worked well for Bankman-Fried, earning him prestige, glowing media profiles, and useful allies such as EA luminary Will MacAskill.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whether or not Sam Bankman-Fried genuinely believes in Effective Altruism is ultimately moot, since his career path has been perfectly compatible with a genuine commitment to the cause. In other words, earnest intentions should not be ruled out. A genuine belief in the risks of rapid development of artificial general intelligence might well have been in part responsible for his high-risk approach to building wealth. The possibility of near-term global disaster, whether from AI or pandemics, may have represented a real imperative to grow disposable funds as quickly as possible in order to combat these immediate dangers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Effective Altruism is the rising moral and charitable vehicle in the tech culture of software engineers, venture capital-funded entrepreneurs, and the cryptorich. With his artfully sloppy t-shirts, unkempt hair, and stunts like playing video games during meetings, Bankman-Fried doubled down on membership in this culture and deyance of traditional professional culture. It is this cultural package that has him donating to EA causes instead of, for example, building a dorm at his alma mater like a traditional philanthropist might. But the collapse of FTX also reveals that Effective Altruism is in fact more similar to its philanthropic predecessors than either would like to admit: it is just as willing to convert \u201cdirty\u201d money from cryptocurrency casinos into legitimacy, in the same way universities or foundations are willing to accept large donations from Goldman Sachs or Philip Morris.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>SBF raised the status of EA, and will now lower it in the eyes of careful observers</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The legitimization also went both ways. By implicitly crediting his career path to the pure altruistic motives of EA, Bankman-Fried lent it the aura of financial success, which is a potent source of prestige and a draw for ambitious young recruits. He is a savvy and energetic self-promoter, and EA benefited from his brand-building in the news media. Before the collapse of FTX, the movement was happy to go along with his mythology and hold him up as a respected role model. The collapse of FTX and Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s fortunes will only moderately impact the material situation of the EA movement. But for careful observers it deals a serious blow to the moral authority, intellectual legitimacy, and prestige that the movement has cultivated thus far, and on which its appeal and power ultimately rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hartree"}}, {"_id": "aDNPgm2v2boBbj8wK", "title": "Deontology and virtue ethics as \"effective theories\" of consequentialist ethics ", "postedAt": "2022-11-17T09:20:34.064Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Note: this was written months ago, before the recent FTX events - so the post can\u2019t be read as a specific (over-)reaction to the FTX fiasco.

For example, it is always wrong to torture an innocent person, regardless of whether or not doing so would lead to some greater good.&nbsp;</p><p>It has been well argued already that some versions of rule-based consequentialism - where instead of assessing the consequences of individual actions, actors follow rules which are selected for their average consequences - are&nbsp;equivalent to deontology, in the sense that both theories will recommend the same actions.&nbsp;</p><p>In my view, deontology approach to ethics as a whole can often be seen as an approximate effective&nbsp; consequentialist theory in the following way:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The consequences of individual actions are often hard to compute, and hard to experimentally verify.&nbsp;</li><li>The consequences of a large number of applications of a rule are easier to compute, and easier to experimentally verify.&nbsp;</li><li>So deontology can be seen as a method of reducing the space of possible actions by eliminating some actions which are likely to have bad consequences, either on the basis of past data, or considerations about the consequences of widespread application of the rules</li></ul><p>Within a given ethical system, it is possible that some deontological rules will have worse consequences in some cases than a direct consequentialist approach. But, in general, deontological rules are much more likely to have good consequences than the actions they rule out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The normative consequentialist claim&nbsp;is something like this: because decision making based on rules is easier to compute and the effects of rules are easier to verify, a deontic decision procedure is often the optimal computation to run under some combination of bounds on computation, information, rationality and cluelessness.&nbsp;<br><br>Briefly: something like non-fanatical deontology seems like an effective first order approximation of consequentialism in at the regime of bounded rationality at human level and moderate cluelessness.<br><br>Very informal paraphrase: in practice, if you are violating some clearly sensible deontic constraint, such as 'don't lie', and justifying it with some sort of clever consequentialist argument, it's likely you are more confused and less smart than you think.&nbsp;</p><h3>Virtue ethics&nbsp;</h3><p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/\"><u>Virtue ethics</u></a> is the view that our actions should be motivated by the virtues and habits of character that promote the good life. Virtues are not intrinsically right or wrong; they are attributes that we should strive to cultivate. In classical virtue ethics, the virtuous life is seen as the purpose of humans, and of intrinsic value.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking honesty as an example virtue, we should strive to be honest, even if being dishonest would lead to some greater good.&nbsp;</p><p>In my view, virtue ethics can also often be seen as an approximate effective theory of consequentialism in the following way:</p><p>Realistically, the action we take most of the time with our most important decisions is to delegate them to other agents. This is particularly true if you think about your future selves as different (\"successor\") agents. From this perspective, actions usually have two different types of consequences - in the external world, and in \"creating a successor agent, namely future you\".&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Virtue ethics tracks the consideration that the self-modification part is often the larger part of the consequences.&nbsp;<br><br>In all sorts of delegations, often the sensible thing to do is to try to characterise what sort of agent we delegate to, or what sort of computation we want the agent to run, rather than trying to specify what actions should the agent take.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefscqhvemj8s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnscqhvemj8s\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As you are delegating the rest of your life to your future selves, it makes sense to pay attention to who they are.<br><br>Once we are focusing on what sort of person it would be good for us to be, what sort of person would make good decisions for the benefit of others as well as themselves, what sort of computations to select, we are close to virtue ethics. (Or at least to what I would call virtue ethics)</p><h3>Relations between the approximate theories</h3><p>Often, people try to understand the relationships between the theories with the help of \"credences\", or of philosophical arguments. Here I\u2019m going to offer a different approach: using physics as a metaphor for understanding the relationship between theories. The short version:&nbsp;theories often exist alongside one another.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Pareto-optimality under computational constraints</strong><br><br>In contrast to the oversimplified view sometimes presented in introductory history of science courses, it is often not the case that newer theories or paradigms wholly replace older theories. Older theories often stay pareto-optimal under particular computational constraints.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, even in predicting the motion of molecules and atoms, quantum mechanics has not fully replaced Newtonian mechanics for practical applications. While QM provides deeper understanding, in practice so-called \"force field\" simulations are common, and are basically Newtonian mechanics. Why do we use them, when we have had QM for more than a century? Because these simulations are pareto-optimal on some combination of system size, time, precision, effects studied, and available computational budget.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Perturbative expansions</strong></p><p>Another common relation between theories in physics is perturbative expansion: the harder-to-compute theory is used to generate some modifications or approximations, which are then added on top of the easier-to-compute theory in borderline cases. For example, general relativity is used to compute small deviations from Newton's law, and this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Newtonian_expansion\"><u>modified Newtonian theory is then used to do calculations</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Limiting cases</strong><br><br>Sometimes, the relation between theories in physics is that one theory can be understood to be a special or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiting_case_(philosophy_of_science)#:~:text=Technically%2C%20a%20theory%20is%20said,limiting%20case%20of%20relativity%20theory.\"><u>limited case</u></a> of another theory, for example a low-energy limit, high-energy limit, or classical limit. In these cases, the theory covering more of the territory can sometimes tell us when we can safely use the simpler, limiting case theory.</p><p><br><strong>Using the physics metaphor to reconcile ethical theories</strong></p><p>I suggest attempting to understand the relations between deontology and virtue ethics on the one hand, and consequentialism on the other, in a similar way.</p><p>In the same way that different theories in physics are pareto-optimal under different computational constraints, system sizes and complexities; deontology and virtue ethics can be pareto-optimal under different computational constraints, decision problem sizes and environmental complexities.</p><p>A lot of philosophising about ethics deals with extreme cases, improbable thought experiments, and situations that \"stretch ethical theories to the limits of their validity.\" This is often seen as a way to refute a theory or point out its weaknesses.&nbsp;From the perspective of the physics metaphor, we can see these edge cases not as refuting moral theories, but as either suggesting modifications (as when harder-to-compute theories in physics are used to generate modifications or approximations which are added on top of the easier-to-compute theory), or illustrating the limits of a moral theory\u2019s validity (as when a new theory in physics shows that an older theory is actually a limit case, and suggests where the old theory still applies).</p><p>Applying this metaphor to virtue ethics, deontology and consequentialism puts consequentialism in the role of the newer/harder-to-compute/more complete theory.<br><br>But note the other side of this view: in practice, even when you assume that consequentialism is never outside of its domain of theoretical validity, the normative theory often suggests that bounded and clueless agents should be doing something other than directly attempting to predict and compare consequences. To take another physics example: if you want to direct gunfire using a pocket calculator, your best bet is Newtonian mechanics. In practice, attempts to do the numerical calculations directly from the quantum level would fail horribly. Consequentialism understood correctly actually warns you against this sort of calculation.</p><p>This view also points to typical mistakes bounded consequentialists or local consequentialist are prone to:</p><ol><li>Mistakes from the shallow depth of evaluating plans.&nbsp;</li><li>Mistakes from not understanding the action space: when deliberative resources are spent on comparing just a few options from a huge action space.</li><li>Delegation failures: mistakes when instead of trying to specify virtues of a delegate, the naive consequentialist attempts to specify what actions should be taken.</li></ol><p><strong>Conflict of local consequentialist intuitions and virtue ethics and/or deontic rules often points to the fact that the local consequentilist calculation is actually mistaken, and a different decision procedure should be used.</strong></p><h2>Examples in practice</h2><p>How does this relate to a range of practical problems in current effective altruism?</p><h3>Fire alarms prompting people to suggest rule-violating and unvirtuous acts</h3><p>Multiple recent advances of machine learning, coupled with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j9Q8bRmwCgXRYAgcJ/miri-announces-new-death-with-dignity-strategy\"><u>sceptical takes on AI alignment progress by Eliezer Yudkowsky</u></a>, prompted some people to suggest various extreme actions which would be both unvirtuous, and rule-violating under most deontic considerations. While I won't link to specific public proposals, you can, for example, imagine actions in the space of \"sabotaging the work of others\".<br><br>In multiple cases here,&nbsp;the conflict between the alleged consequentialist value of the suggested acts, and virtuous or rule-abiding behaviour, is resolved just by reflecting for a longer time. When a less bounded consequentialist starts to consider the impacts of such non-virtuous actions on coordination, epistemics, responses from other actors in the space\u2026 the actions seem clearly bad bets. In these cases, the fact that a local bounded calculation comes apart from virtuous or deontic intuitions should be taken as an indication that the calculations may be incorrect; and just acting upon virtuous or deontic intuitions in the first place would be a better approximation of consequentialist action.</p><p>(It's probably worth noting that Eliezer Yudkowsky himself understands this and warned readers of his post against&nbsp;non virtuous, confused consequentialist actions in strong words.)&nbsp;</p><h3>Demandingness objection</h3><p>\u00cdn a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/\"><u>recent criticism of effective altruism</u></a>, Michael Nielsen eloquently raises a concern about the principle of \"doing the most good\" leading to unhealthy outcomes when taken very seriously, such as people considering whether to give up having children, converting ice cream purchases to lives saved, or working in an inadequate environment,.<br><br>Again, to me, these unhealthy outcomes seem like problems of local consequentialism.&nbsp;There are at least two things going on here:</p><ul><li>Often the action space is huge and there's lots of uncertainty about which actions are best. Even if you are willing to sacrifice your happiness for the greater good, in practice it's likely that there will be many actions in the intersection between 'could have really good consequences' and 'makes me happy'. Choosing actions from the 'makes me unhappy' part of the space often seems confused given large amounts of uncertainty, and likely negative second-order effects on your future selves.&nbsp;</li><li>We don't control our minds. Ignoring the things you actually want, care about, feel motivated by (like children or friends or art) seems empirically to make people miserable, which in turn seems to lead to bad consequences overall.</li></ul><p>Noticing the tension between these demanding lifestyles and virtues like moderation or wholesomeness can be read as a warning that there may be mistakes in the naive consequentialist calculation.</p><h3>Naive over-optimization of social interactions</h3><p>Local consequentialist group organiser may be prone to thinking about people as means to their own impact, and optimising by, for example, allocating their time based on the estimated increase of likelihood the person will become <i>'highly engaged EA'</i> per amount of effort spent on persuasion.&nbsp;</p><p>There are various problems with this approach from a deontological perspective, but a clear one is that the approach is not stable upon becoming public: some of people you would want to talk to the most would not agree to such a conversation if they understood that this was the motivation.&nbsp;<br><br>From virtues perspective, the group organizer should be worried if they are on the path to turn themselves from <i>a thinker</i> to <i>an idea salesperson</i>.</p><h3>Outreach to young people</h3><p>Some EA-motivated efforts targeting young people seem to me to be based on local consequalist calculations. Based on an intuition like \"we will need more ML engineers in 10 years\", the aim seems to be to motivate young people to move to such careers early.&nbsp;<br><br>This seems problematic from the perspective of virtue ethics, and also conflicts with deontic constraints such as \"not considering humans as just means to your impact\".&nbsp;<br><br>What might this tension point to? Plausibly, again, a problem with cluelessness. I don\u2019t know what will happen in 10 years\u2019 time.. If someone asked me to propose concrete effective altruistic actions for them to take in 2032, I would be pretty stuck. Naive consequentialist calculations may make approaches like this seem valuable - but the world is a sufficiently complex system that it seems hubristic to actually act upon them.</p><p>Approaching &nbsp;people in a more virtue ethical way seems much more robust to me:</p><ul><li>I would be much more confident in advising someone about which virtues it would be good for them to cultivate - for example scale-sensitivity, ability to think clearly, getting better at noticing inadequacies\u2026&nbsp;</li><li>Virtue-based approaches have a much better track record: decisions made by scale-sensitive people attempting to think clearly now seem much better than their speculations about specific actions from 10 years ago.</li></ul><h3>Personal addendum</h3><p><i>This part was written post FTX events.</i></p><p>In my personal experience, what's often hard about this, is, the confused bounded consequentialist actions <i>don't feel like that from the inside. </i>I was most prone to them when my internal feeling was closest to <i>consequentialism is clearly the only sensible theory here</i>.<br><br>For this reason, I also dislike the philosophical vocabulary using the term <i>naive</i> consequentialism for all related problems: the word <i>naive</i> &nbsp;subtly suggests that if you are smart, and spent few hours reasoning on something, surely you are not naive? The reality is much worse - in some sense, all consequentialism running on human brains is quite bounded, and only rarely do humans see the contours of what would the true, non-naive consequentialism imply.&nbsp;<br><br>So is dropping direct consequentialism and embracing deontology a virtue ethics the answer? &nbsp;Unfortunately, while at places this post advocates to give them a lot of weight, these theories are also not the answer. &nbsp;We are in state where everything has serious limits or is too hard to compute.<br><br>Also: we don't have some nice, simple and easy to explain meta-theory even for the effective theories of physics, ahe current state of theorizing about moral uncertainty is much less developed than that. &nbsp;In physics, we at least have many links explaining some effective theories as limit cases of stronger theories - however, in practice, physicists also rely on a lot of implicit reasoning in decisions about what you can ignore, and what models to use, and this also likely the current best option for ethics.<br><br><i>Thanks Rose and &nbsp;Gavin for help with editing various versions of this text.</i><br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn7mf0kdky41t\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref7mf0kdky41t\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I'm using <i>effective theory </i>as in physics: effective theory is a tool used to handle situations where full knowledge of a phenomenon is not available, but where partial knowledge is sufficient to make useful predictions.

I had just submitted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oeu-DDrI9HeJI8fh5qVX6o0PXsycc7o6OEnqFAWEXpo/edit\"><u>my first application</u></a> to the EAIF and been rejected with minimal feedback, so I was trying to find out how to write a better application in the future. I was looking for funds to do community building in the national group I started in Romania, so I talked to several people with relevant backgrounds (community organizers, fund managers, etc).</p><h1>What happened</h1><p>One of the people I talked to was a former fund manager who asked me some questions that I found a bit unexpected, let\u2019s call them Alice. Alice asked me for example what cause areas I wanted to focus on, what specific groups I wanted to target (students, professionals, etc), and what I thought would be most suitable goals to focus on in Romania specifically. I was a bit surprised because, although I knew the EA movement had different histories and activities in different countries, I ultimately felt community building involved largely similar goals anywhere. I said that we were a small and new national group and that I didn\u2019t think it was important to focus on particular cause areas or subgroups, so I was just planning to get more people engaged in EA in general (via virtual programs, conferences, etc). We had a short discussion about my plans and brainstormed a bit about alternatives but, even though in retrospect I realize that my plans had many flaws, I felt that, no matter what I suggested, she concluded it wouldn\u2019t be suitable to fund such a project in Romania. I started getting the message that Romania was simply not worth funding in general, and this made me realize that I had been relying on an unexamined assumption all along: that all countries had something to offer to EA and were ultimately worth funding.</p><p>Alice had a pretty straightforward communication style that I appreciated as a pragmatist, but that also made me feel slightly attacked sometimes. I knew that many members of the EA community prided themselves for their pragmatism, directness, and openness to updating their views, etc, so I tried to mirror her behavior and asked: \u201cdo you think some countries have no place in EA?\u201d From that moment onwards, I felt the discussion took a wrong turn. She seemed taken aback and said \u201cI didn\u2019t say that!\u201d, to which I responded \u201cI know, I\u2019m just asking because you made me wonder\u201d. She then said she didn\u2019t think so, but then she said that maybe, that she had to think about it. It seemed she felt cornered and uncomfortable. We moved on and continued the discussion about my project for a while, and then about 5 min before her next 1:1 she said she had to go.</p><p>It might be worth mentioning that I have ADHD and that I also score high-ish (33) on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://psychology-tools.com/test/autism-spectrum-quotient\"><u>autism spectrum quotient</u></a>, having had pretty severe social anxiety during adolescence. By my early to mid 20s, however, I had managed to improve my social skills, mask most of my autistic traits, and today I would say I am mostly functional. I generally pass as \u201ceccentric\u201d but neurotypical and only those closest to me notice my more unusual traits. Still, in situations like this I can\u2019t help but wonder if I did something weird, because it wasn\u2019t my intention to attack anybody.</p><h1>Why I think it might have affected me negatively</h1><p>Immediately after our conversation, I had a feeling that something had gone wrong. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was being anxious and paranoid, if it was all in my head, or if Alice had also felt the same. Eventually, back in Bucharest, I decided to send her a message on SwapCard:</p><blockquote><p>Hi Alice! I just wanted to thank you for the honest feedback at EAG. You gave me some stuff to think about. I\u2019m sorry the conversation ended so abruptly. Hope we get to talk again one day in a less hectic context :)</p></blockquote><p>I never heard back, but I don\u2019t know how much people use SwapCard after the events are over, so I tried to not overthink it. A few months later, however, after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/htNkiECLGHLTfAHYW/request-feedback-on-my-eaif-application\"><u>asking for feedback</u></a> on my new application draft on the EA Forum, I was contacted by somebody from CEA (let\u2019s call them Bob) who told me he had managed to have a chat with some people from EAIF and had some more feedback to give me. The feedback covered different topics (which I will address in other posts), but the one relevant here is that I was considered to be \u201ctoo confrontational\u201d, which is not an ideal trait for a community organizer. When he said that, I immediately remembered my interaction with Alice at EAG and I told him my side of the story. I asked if he had also felt I was confrontational, and to my complete astonishment he said yes. He said it was subtle and he didn\u2019t really make too much of it, but together with this other incident he could see how there could be a pattern. I asked for examples but, as far as I remember, he couldn\u2019t give me anything concrete. He said that, given this feedback, my chances of getting funded were probably very slim.</p><p>Eventually, about 5 months after my first application, I submitted my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDNDtux867QBfFa-P0_EgnFET4XSWde1KxrfXjaKVWg/edit\"><u>second application</u></a> anyway, after having worked on it with the help of many people. The application was rejected again without feedback, and this time I wasn\u2019t even invited for a video call as I had been after I submitted my first application.</p><h1>Diagnosing the problem</h1><p>My first difficulty in this situation is diagnosing the problem. Am I really confrontational or did people create a wrong image of me? On the one hand, I want to be open to criticism and take seriously the possibility that I really am too confrontational. On the other hand, I strongly believe that radical honesty is a prerequisite for genuine cooperation, so I feel it would be disingenuous of me to simply ask what I can do to become less confrontational. I feel like I would be pretending to agree with something that I don\u2019t agree with. The truth is: I don\u2019t really think I am very confrontational. At this point I have many regular members in my community in Bucharest, and after attending 4 EAG(x)s, I haven\u2019t had any other tension with anybody. I have also volunteered as speaker liaison in Berlin and Rotterdam and I don\u2019t think anybody I worked with, speaker or organizer, would say I was confrontational. I think this is a very tricky generalization to make on the basis of a single data point and this whole situation has made me quite anxious and depressed, especially since I\u2019m going through a difficult period and EA was one of the few things that got me excited.</p><h1>What can I do to fix this situation?</h1><p>That being said, if I am to approach this problem pragmatically and think of what I can do to improve things, I can think of a few questions that seem relevant:</p><ol><li>How do I figure out whether I am confrontational or not?</li><li>If I am:<ol><li>What can I do to become less confrontational?&nbsp;</li><li>How can I prove that I became less confrontational after doing what it takes?</li></ol></li><li>If I am not:<ol><li>How can I prove that I am not?</li></ol></li></ol><p>Do you have any tips on what I could do to make things better? I am really at a loss and I have been paralyzed for months so I figured I would take the risk to open up and share my story here. I hope this is a safe space where I am allowed to talk about these topics. I also want to make it clear that I\u2019m not making any accusations. I don\u2019t believe in free will and therefore I also don\u2019t believe in retribution or holding grudges. I believe in being charitable, assuming goodwill, and giving people the benefit of the doubt. I joined EA because I am passionate about spreading positive ideas and ultimately having a positive impact, and in order to do this I believe we should try to cooperate with as many like-minded people as possible. All I want is to help. This community is meaningful to me because I don\u2019t know any other movement that is so well aligned with my own personal values. It makes me sad to feel mistrusted and I\u2019m willing to work on myself to gain trust.</p>", "user": {"username": "arielpontes"}}, {"_id": "difodB6EkiuzXCcMW", "title": "[retracted] Discussion: Was SBF a naive utilitarian, or a sociopath?", "postedAt": "2022-11-17T02:51:13.770Z", "htmlBody": "<p>EDIT 17 Nov 2022: Retracted due to someone reminding me that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vjyWBnCmXjErAN6sZ/kelsey-piper-s-recent-interview-of-sbf?commentId=bYnJM7nY9D3tc8gpk\">both</a> is not merely an option, but one with at least some precedent.

This post, albeit brief, is simply meant to put these thoughts to writing in order to subject them to some intelligent scrutiny. It is not intended to argue that other cause areas should be neglected, but simply that the framework posited in WWOTF can be applied to TI, and the implications of this application are making TI a major (if not top) priority for Longermists. These thoughts were put together rather hastily, so feel free to point out any epistemic gaps etc. Also, before I get started, I would like to set an operational definition for TI. By TI, I mean \u201cthe pursuit of information that would confirm the existence of an eternal afterlife state and an eternal ultimate Creator(s) who\u2019s technological capabilities are so far beyond human comprehension they may as well be called magic.\u201d On to my point:</p><p>For those of you who haven't read WWOTF, in it Will McAskill (WM) posits three criteria to use for determining Longtermist priorities: significance, persistence, and contingency. Something is significant if it brings about a high average value to people. For example, developing a cure to cancer would have high significance. Persistence means how long a given something will affect human history. Sticking to our example of cancer, it is likely that the disease will persist in people for the duration of human existence; a cure for cancer would similarly affect humankind in the long run. Contingency refers to how contingent upon any number of factors a given priority might be. For example, a cure for cancer is highly contingent upon human scientific advancements. Without dedicated and intelligent people, cancer won\u2019t cure itself.</p><p>WM uses these criteria to support the prioritization of certain long-term causes and as the groundwork for Longtermism itself. I agree with the entire framework on principle, although personally it seems rather presumptuous without having perfected superforecasting to prioritize cause areas, since it would mean needing to constantly re-evaluate priorities based on world events (for example, I believe that current rapid advancements in laser technology will soon negate focuses on nuclear warfare, in which case a major overhaul of EA networking and placement would need to occur, but that\u2019s another discussion for another time). Even if we did have a Seldon Plan for cause areas that will have significance now and several hundred years in the future (highly persistent causes), the long-term nature of such a plan would probably make the top priorities seem quite outlandish to even die-hard EA's (just like modern biosecurity would seem far fetched in 1700 AD) and so would make garnering support rather difficult.</p><p>Regardless, as I said, I agree with the framework on principle; and by my own logic it appears to indicate that TI should be considered the most salient of potential priorities. Here\u2019s why:</p><p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TI has extremely high significance. The expected value of a discovery confirming a Creator's existence or an afterlife's reality is huge. It would answer a lot of questions about human existence which might then have a ripple effect on existing priorities. It might also bring about a shift in institutions, governments, and culture. The list goes on. I don\u2019t think anyone would disagree with my assertion that confirming the existence of a creator would have astronomical significance to the human race. Similarly, confirming definitively the nonexistence of a Creator would hold equal significance (perhaps larger, actually, since there are more theists than atheists).&nbsp;</p><p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TI has massive persistence. If definitive confirmation of a Creator's existence or nonexistence were achieved, this knowledge would likely alter our perception of the past and the future, and would likely not dissolve within a short timeframe. Speaking specifically as if the former were true, I think the epitome of persistence would be the word \u201ceternal\u201d, which is a key characteristic denoted in Creator tropes throughout all religions. Additionally, if an afterlife occurs, this would further add to TI having massive persistence since it would implicate our continuance beyond mortality, which sounds pretty persistent to me. Alternatively, if there is a confirmation of zero chance that there is an afterlife, this knowledge would have significant persistence, affecting humankind for centuries to come.&nbsp;</p><p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; TI has massive contingency. Firstly, figuring out if there is or is not an afterlife seems to be something only people can do, thus it is highly contingent on individuals. Secondly, assuming an afterlife with binary states (a heaven or hell) is real, the assignment of one individual to a specific state is highly contingent upon them and their actions in this life. To put it differently, if the suffering of insects is significant enough to garner attention in the EA-sphere, surely the suffering of individuals for an eternity in an afterlife is of worthy concern to EA's. Only humans are ever going to figure out if there is or is not an afterlife, and if there is one only humans can mitigate the suffering we might feel in that afterlife.&nbsp;</p><p>Entire holy wars have been waged, genocides have been committed, and discriminations have occurred which have all in turn perpetuated themselves throughout generations all because theological inquiry has never yielded a definitive answer. Conversely, billions have been spent of both money and time on missionary ventures, ineffective charity, and building places of worship (for example, the LDS church receives over $7 billion USD annually in just donations, is worth well over $100 billion, and is constructing some 72 new temples each of which alone is worth tens of millions of dollars). The amount of good that this is doing to many people may seem uncertain. If a their Creator is real, then they are doing immense good. If their Creator isn't real, then I would argue that this would constitute a HUGE waste.&nbsp;</p><p>The application of WM's framework as found in WWOTF bumps theological inquiry into a top tier position!</p><p>Playing devil's advocate against TI here (I thought that was clever):</p><p>One issue I see with applying MckAskill\u2019s framework to TI is the \u201cuncertainty\u201d principle that he uses as a sort of basis. He states in WWOTF that the more uncertain something is, the more deserving of our attention it is, and that the framework should be applied to that something in order to determine its saliency. Obviously, as a person of faith, I am fairly confident of a Creator\u2019s existence. Opposing viewpoints (atheists, for example), are also likely to be fairly certain of their viewpoints. So, regardless of who you ask, people feel there is a great deal of certainty with respect to the futility of further TI, which means this framework is ill suited for application. I guess this could be resolved by assigning a positive value to one side and a negative to the other\u2013canceling them both out and resulting in a \u201cvery uncertain\u201d result\u2013but that feels like a bit of a shortcut.</p><p>Another issue with applying this framework to TI is that regardless of whether or not it\u2019s right, the existence of a Creator can seem so ethereal and abstract to the vast majority of people that the framework may lose its convincing power and so ultimately become useless when applied to TI. The framework\u2019s whole point is to lay a convincing groundwork for Longtermism, but if the cause area that the framework is promoting neutralizes any persuasive power of the framework itself in the first place, then what is the point of applying it to the aforementioned cause area? Ultimately this can potentially be refuted by pointing out that climate change receives a great deal of criticism of dubiousness from a great deal of people, and even more people are unaware of it, yet it is still deserving of our attention and so the framework is applied. The same is the case for animal welfare, yet it still is a top EA priority. Just because a priority with high saliency may not gain traction easily does not mean it should be ignored altogether. Moral duty is not correlated with popularity.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the last point against the application of this framework to TI is the Creator itself. If such a Creator does exist and wants to be found out empirically, they likely would have made themselves unequivocally known at this point (although I know some people, especially Christians at least, would argue the Creator already has made itself known via Christ's birth, the seemingly statistical improbability of complex life evolving in just a few billion years, etc.). But, assuming they haven\u2019t made themselves known at this point, it could mean they (meaning the Creator) are either impossible for us to observe (which doesn\u2019t make them much of a Creator, to be honest), apathetic about being observed, or they don\u2019t want to be found out by scientific means. If the latter is true, then we may as well give up hope of making TI a top cause area because any effort to discover an omnipotent being(s) who doesn't want to be discovered would be futile! I hardly think we can expect to win a game of hide and seek when God is the one hiding. Ultimately, these all point out that application of this framework in a realistic sense as an intended impetus for reprioritization is arguably useless. I don't really see a good counterargument to this last point asides from saying people should find God viscerally, but existing churches already try to help with this and so we end up right back at square one with the uncertainty basis challenging the application of WM's framework to TI.&nbsp;</p><p>Any thoughts in favor of or against the application of WM\u2019s framework for Longtermism to TI from anyone of any background are welcome!

His latest co-authored work is&nbsp; \u2018A Vision of metascience: An engine of improvement for the social processes of Science\u2019 co-authored with Kanjun Qiu (<a href=\"https://scienceplusplus.org/metascience/index.html\"><u>open source book link)</u></a>.

Would it be better to repurpose that money into more conventional types of thing or not?\" It's difficult to know exactly how to do that kind of evaluation, but hopefully, meta-scientists in the future will in fact think very hard and very carefully about how to do those kinds of evaluation. So that's the meta-scientist research discipline.</p><p>As an entrepreneurial discipline, somebody actually needs to go and build these things. For working scientists it's often remarkably difficult to do that because it doesn't look like a conventional activity. This isn't sort of science as normally construed. Something that I found really shocking-- you may be familiar with and hopefully many listeners maybe familiar with, the replication crisis in social psychology. So this was, I guess most famously in 2015, there was a paper published in which 100 well-known experiments in social psychology were replicated. I think it was 36% of the significant findings were found to replicate and typically the effect size was about roughly halved.</p><p>So this was not a great look for social psychology as a discipline and raised a lot of questions about what was going on. That story I just told is quite well-known. What is much less well-known is that in fact going back many decades, people had been making essentially the same set of sort of methodological criticisms. Talking about the file drawer effect, talking about p-hacking, talking about all these kinds of things which can lead to exactly this kind of failure. And there are some very good papers written in-- I think the earliest I know is from the early sixties. Certainly in the 1970s and 1980s you see these kinds of papers. They point out the problems, they point out the solutions. \u201cWhy did nothing happen?\u201d \"Well, because there's no entrepreneurial discipline which actually allows you to build out the institutions which need to be built out if anything is actually to change.\"</p></blockquote><p><br>We discuss how decentralisation may help. How new institutions may help. The challenges funders face in wanting to wait until ideas become clearer.</p><p>We discuss the opportunity that developing nations such as Indonesia might have.</p><p>We chat about rationality and critical rationality.</p><p>Michael gives some insights into how AI art might be used and how we might never master certain languages, like the languages of early computing.</p><p>We end on some thoughts Michael might give his younger self:</p><blockquote><p>The one thing I wish I'd understood much earlier is the extent to which there's kind of an asymmetry in what you see, which is you're always tempted not to make a jump because you see very clearly what you're giving up and you don't see very clearly what it is you're going to gain. So almost all of the interesting opportunities on the other side of that are opaque to you now. You have a very limited kind of a vision into them. You can get around it a little bit by chatting with people who maybe are doing something similar, but it's so much more limited. And yet I know when reasoning about it, I want to treat them like my views of the two are somehow parallel but they're just not.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.thendobetter.com/arts/2022/11/15/michael-nielsen-metascience-how-to-improve-science-open-science-podcast\">Link to podcast/transcipt here.</a></p>", "user": {"username": "Ben Yeoh"}}, {"_id": "CBzn8wnZoc8z4ZhhZ", "title": "[Closing Nov 20th] University Group Accelerator Program Applications are Open", "postedAt": "2022-11-17T17:03:01.100Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>This post is a reminder that applications are open for the next round of CEA\u2019s University Group Accelerator Program (UGAP)!</strong></p><p>Are you a student at a university without a university group?

Mass media interventions have not generally been prioritized within the global health field (e.g. see GiveWell\u2019s 2012 report&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/charities/mass-media-for-behavior-change\"><u>here</u></a>), in part due to mixed RCT evidence regarding their effectiveness upon reducing mortality. In this report, I use power analyses (implemented in R, primarily via monte carlo simulations) to demonstrate that previous RCTs have been hugely underpowered to detect these effects. I therefore preferentially utilize other forms of evidence (including RCT evidence of the effect of mass media upon behavior change more broadly, which they are better powered to detect, and evidence from other forms of media such as advertising) to examine the likely effectiveness of mass media campaigns upon health and wellbeing.&nbsp; My BOTECs indicate that mass media campaigns can be extremely cost-effective (i.e. I estimate 26x GiveDirectly for a family planning campaign from Family Empowerment Media, and 31x GiveDirectly for a hypothetical initiative to reduce intimate partner violence). These values reflect that (1) mass media campaigns can be highly cost-effective at even a very small effect size, given the number of people that they can reach, and (2) information (unlike say, a bednet) does not necessarily disintegrate with time and can be freely passed onto others, and in small percentage of cases may contribute to broader changes in social norms. Overall, I think that mass media campaigns present a highly promising\u2014albeit risky, relative to other global health interventions\u2014area for philanthropic investment. I argue that (in many cases) this is a philanthropic investment worth taking. In particular, I highlight the potential role of mass media in correcting misconceptions about modern contraception, and in combating intimate partner violence.</p><h1><br>Summary&nbsp;</h1><p>The promise of mass media lies in its ability to reach a large audience, and to shift behavior by improving knowledge, awareness, and social attitudes towards particular areas of health. Mass media campaigns can operate via media including radio, TV, newspapers and the internet. They&nbsp; have been used for various purposes in high-income contexts, including reducing the use of tobacco and alcohol, promoting healthy eating, and increasing rates of cancer screening.</p><p>Estimating the potential impact of a mass media intervention involves estimating the degree to which a given media campaign changes behavior, as well as the causal effect of that behavior change upon relevant health metrics such as mortality. In this investigation, I show that (given the scale at which mass media campaigns operate) these campaigns can be cost-effective even if the expected changes upon behavior, and the corresponding effects of that behavior change upon mortality, are relatively small. I then examine the expected effect of mass media interventions upon behavior and health, primarily using existing evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in low and middle income countries (LMICs).&nbsp;</p><p>My power analyses find that existing RCTs are hugely underpowered to directly find effects of mass media upon mortality (including at effect sizes that my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW_Vptr0xLh88p4AxADyd1k5iglqdy8GZxBamlLNEs/edit#gid=748560449\"><u>BOTEC</u></a> suggests would be highly cost-effective)\u2014although many RCTs have successfully found differences in rates of health-relevant behaviors, such as rates of clinic visits or use of modern contraception, which they are better-powered to detect. My BOTECs therefore uses this evidence (alongside evidence from other sources about how changes in these behaviors affect mortality) to assess the impact of mass media interventions.</p><p>Overall, my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW_Vptr0xLh88p4AxADyd1k5iglqdy8GZxBamlLNEs/edit#gid=748560449\"><u>BOTECs</u></a> suggest that these interventions are cost effective&nbsp;&nbsp;(4x - 31x GiveDirectly), despite including large discounts&nbsp;(~40%)&nbsp;for generalisability. In addition, I also argue that there is reason to expect that a small number of mass media campaigns may generate long lasting impact, as knowledge (unlike say, a bednet) does not always disintegrate over time and can be freely passed onto others\u2014a factor that has generally not been accounted for in existing work. There may be a small number of campaigns that shift entire group attitudes and behaviors (for example, contributing towards a change in social norms about contraception, or about the social acceptability of intimate partner violence) that are hugely impactful.</p><p><br>Areas where mass media campaigns may be especially helpful include those where current misconceptions about health exist, or where unhelpful social norms persist.&nbsp; Given that current work suggests that the impact of mass media is very variable, I suggest that researchers attend to several features that have been linked to campaign effectiveness. These include cultural relevance, tackling misinformation or lack of information, and using these campaigns in areas where people have the resources to take the appropriate action. Examining these features with regards to particular campaigns may help grantmakers avoid donating funds to campaigns that are likely to have no impact.</p><p>Overall, I think that mass media campaigns are a promising\u2014albeit risky\u2014area for philanthropic donations. I am unsure about whether mass media campaigns are significantly underfunded in high income contexts, but it seems likely that they are underfunded in LMIC. Note that it is cheaper to run mass media campaigns in LMIC, where radio airtime is cheap, and there is some evidence that these interventions are especially effective in LMIC: experimental effect sizes have generally been larger in LMIC relative to HIC, despite stronger research designs in LMIC. I suspect that this is because there is \u2018low-hanging fruit\u2019 for mass media interventions in LMIC, in the sense that there are critical gaps in healthcare knowledge for many people in LMIC, who do not necessarily have easy access to high-quality healthcare information.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8f0cahmifw4\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8f0cahmifw4\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I identify several charities operating in this area, but I do not have a strong sense of their existing RFF; I recommend proceeding to investigate these charities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Background: the potential of mass media</h1><p>Mass media interventions work by exposing a large number of people to content, in the hope that they change their behavior. In high income countries, public health campaigns are routinely used by governments and health services\u2014examples include COVID campaigns, the British THINK! Campaign against drink driving, and Australia\u2019s Slip! Slap! Slop! campaign to improve sun safety behaviors. Some charities (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.familyempowermentmedia.org/\"><u>Family Empowerment Media</u></a> (FEM) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.developmentmedia.net/\"><u>Development Media International</u></a> (DMI)) conduct similar mass media campaigns in LMIC, with the hope of increasing rates of health-promoting behaviors\u2014such as using modern contraceptives, or attaining treatment for children who show symptoms that are suggestive of diseases such as pneumonia.&nbsp;</p><p>Before examining the evidence in more detail, it is useful to lay out how we can understand the effectiveness of a mass media campaign. The potential of mass media comes from its ability to reach a huge number of people at once, relatively cheaply\u2014especially in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) where radio airtime is inexpensive. This means that even if a very small percentage of people change their behavior (in a way that reduces mortality or morbidity), the intervention can be extremely effective.</p><p>To illustrate this mathematically, we can roughly model the effectiveness of a mass media intervention (that works by reducing mortality in young children) as follows;<br>&nbsp;</p><span><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"CE (cost effectiveness) = C(cost)/N (no. people reached) x B (change in behavior) x E (effect of behavior change on mortality)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em;

This is because our current bar for recommendation is to be more cost-effective than GiveDirectly: we estimate that GiveDirectly can double someone\u2019s income for an approximate cost of $299, and we value \u2018saving an under-5 life\u2019 at 129 \u2018income-doubling equivalents\u2019 (new moral weights report forthcoming).

This is the start up costs plus the average annual operational costs (Kasteng et al. 2018; see pg. 5).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhu9dqv5rnq9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhu9dqv5rnq9\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This is a cost of approximately $7 per intervention-relevant person (here, the parent of an under-5 YO or pregnant woman). Note that their cost per person is significantly lower when RCT costs are excluded (around \u00a30.11; personal communication), but I use this $7 estimate to be highly conservative.

So if the effect of the intervention upon behavior is 2% (for example, 2% of the population would newly recognise a symptom of pneumonia in their child and take them to the clinic), and the average effect of that change in behavior is to reduce mortality&nbsp; by 1% (resulting in 1% decrease of mortality, for people who changed their behavior), then this would likely meet our cost-effectiveness bar.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;A lot of the controversy around mass media interventions has come from establishing whether or not they can change behavior (B). For example, GiveWell\u2019s evaluation of DMI concludes \u2018our view is that we do not plan to prioritize additional consideration of this program, given the limitations of the evidence of the effect of DMI\u2019s media campaigns on child mortality&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?GaAhNL\">(<i>Development Media International - July 2021 Version | GiveWell</i>, n.d.)</a>.\u2019 In the following sections, I will examine whether we should predict that these mass media interventions will change behavior (and the degree to which they may do so). I focus primarily upon randomized control trials of similar interventions in LMIC contexts, but given the limitations of this data (see below) I also pull from evidence of other contexts where media aims to shift behavior\u2014such as advertising, and public health campaigns in HIC contexts. I then examine the link between behavior change and effects on mortality (E), as well as whether there is likely to be room for funding for organizations conducting these interventions.</p><h1>Can mass media successfully change behavior?</h1><p><br>&nbsp;The strongest (and most direct) evidence about mass media change from campaigns in LMIC contexts comes from a series of randomized controlled trials in Burkina Faso and other areas. Unfortunately, it is difficult\u2014but not impossible\u2014to experimentally test mass media in this way.</p><h2>Problem 1: It is difficult to randomize mass media exposure&nbsp;</h2><p>It is very difficult to control (on an individual level) someone\u2019s exposure to a mass media campaign.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdfoggjjpx4\"><sup><a href=\"#fndfoggjjpx4\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Consequently, many tests of mass media campaigns use cluster randomization, often at the level of the community or region. In this design, different groups (or \u2018clusters\u2019) are randomized to receive the intervention of not (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?LTuBHU\">Banerjee et al., 2019; Croker et al., 2012; Sarrassat et al., 2018)</a>. Clusters undergo pre-test and post-test measures of the behavior in question, to observe if there is more change within the test clusters. However, while cluster RCTs are methodologically strong, they also present several drawbacks. First, there are relatively few places where it is possible to run them; cluster RCTs are facilitated if researchers can locate distinct clusters that are broadly similar (to minimize selection effects), yet can be differentially assigned to test versus control groups with minimal spillover. Researchers have attempted to run these trials in Burkina Faso, a region where it is possible to gain a large number of clusters due to the unique set up of local radio (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?MjBMk7\">Glennerster et al., 2021; Sarrassat et al., 2018)</a>. Since there are many local languages spoken, it is possible to minimise spillover effects by running campaigns on particular radio shows (and therefore in particular languages) only. However, it is common for these local regions to vary by various socio-demographic characteristics, such as socioeconomic status and tribal group\u2014issues that can be somewhat mitigated by statistically adjusting for these confounds, but leave open the possibility of confounds (e.g. see Sarrassat et al. 2018, who suffered this issue).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Note that Family Empowerment Media (FEM) are currently developing and testing a new transmitter that can selectively transmit radio programs to different groups of people; this may help to solve the problem of effective randomisation to media exposure. FEM hope to publish a paper on their transmitter early next year.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, cluster RCTs (relative to individual RCTs) have lower statistical power. This is because in a cluster trial, the responses of individuals within each cluster are often correlated with other variables (such as socioeconomic factors, environmental factors etc)\u2014many of which may be unspecified. This leads to an increase of within-cluster correlation and between-cluster variability in terms of the specific health outcomes that are being measured. Failing to account for the effects of clustering in analysis results in inflated type 1 error rates, or false positives&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?m5z7ZE\">(Dron et al., 2021; Golzarri-Arroyo et al., 2020;&nbsp;<i>Parallel Group- or Cluster-Randomized Trials (GRTs) | Research Methods Resources</i>, n.d.)</a>. Note that the power of a cluster trial depends to a large extent on the number of clusters, not just cluster sizes\u2014I believe this is a key (and perhaps unavoidable) problem in the Sarassat et al. (2018) trial, which GiveWell\u2019s analysis of DMI critically relies upon (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SZ590oQkLYFQtU82kdtP9WBajpqcxVTVu302lYg_Eeo/edit#heading=h.fgtiiu1xrjzd\"><u>see the section about this trial).</u></a></p><p>Another RCT research design is to expose randomly-selected individuals to mass media in a controlled fashion. For example, Banerjee et al. (2019) selected individuals to watch screenings of the show MTVShuga, which educates people about HIV risk behaviors. This has the advantage of a cleaner research design, but it is very unclear whether results from this work are generalisable to mass media contexts. In the real world, there is an extremely crowded media environment: it seems very possible that people who do exhibit behavior change in response to watching MTVShuga in a controlled environment might not take the time to watch the show outside of the study context.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, there appears to be different norms about study design across research fields. Campaign research (a field within the broader topic of public health, that generally focuses upon public health campaigns in high income contexts) often uses pretest-posttest control group designs: one group is exposed to the campaign and one is not, with baseline tests of the behavior in question prior to exposure to media, and posttest tests after exposure&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?OYCvg2\">(Noar, 2009)</a>. This is clearly stronger than research designs that do not include a pretest (which are also common in this field;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?3PXleU\">Meyer et al., 2003</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?zhD0Ch\">Mohammed, 2001)</a> and are therefore vulnerable to maturation effects, or designs that do not even include a control group and are therefore vulnerable to maturation and selection effects&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?uzA3aD\">(which are also common, see Noar, 2009)</a>. However, pretest-posttest control group designs are nevertheless vulnerable to regression to the mean\u2014namely, if the two groups are nonequivalent with regards to the behavior in question at baseline. They are also vulnerable to selection effects, since the group that is assigned to each condition is not usually random, but instead a sample of convenience&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?H7oDbD\">(Hornik et al., 2002; Noar, 2009)</a>.</p><p>Other research designs that test the effectiveness of mass media include instrumental variables analysis, but there are a limited number of studies of this type. Presumably, this is because researchers have struggled to identify suitable instrumental variables that systematically vary with mass media exposure, yet are unlikely to have a causal relationship with mass media exposure\u2014but an interesting exception comes from a study that uses Rwanda\u2019s topography (since certain topographies block radio signals) to estimate the effect of radio campaigns upon participitation in the Rwandan genocide&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?19QRN1\">(Yanagizawa-Drott, 2014)</a>. Regression discontinuity designs have also occasionally been used, but primarily in high income contexts. For example,&nbsp; Spenkuch and Toniatti&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?n2BLVa\">(2018)</a> took advantage of advertising differences resulting from FCC regulations to find an effect of advertising upon US political candidate vote shares.&nbsp;</p><h2><br>Problem 2: Small effect sizes<br>&nbsp;</h2><p>The nature of mass media effects makes them difficult to experimentally examine; these effects are expected to be very small, but the power of mass media comes from its potential to expose a huge number of people at once. To the best of my understanding, many existing RCTs are hugely underpowered. For example, Sarassat et al. (2018)\u2014the largest RCT in an LMIC, and the paper which GiveWell\u2019s analysis of DMI primarily focuses upon\u2014is only powered to detect a 20% reduction in their outcome (all-cause post-neonatal under-5 child mortality), but it seems extremely over-optimistic to assume such a high effect size. Note that the \u2018benchmark\u2019 expectation for behavior change in high-income countries (in response to a mass media campaigns, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SZ590oQkLYFQtU82kdtP9WBajpqcxVTVu302lYg_Eeo/edit#heading=h.3zt5xcr06m44\"><u>this section</u></a>) is around 5%, and my BOTEC in the \u2018Background\u2019 section suggests that even effects of significantly less than &lt;5% may still be cost-effective. I cover this study in greater detail below.</p><h2><br>Problem 3: Few attempts to measure long-lasting change<br>&nbsp;</h2><p>The existing RCTs measure behavioral effects upon people who have been directly exposed to a given media campaign, usually during that campaign\u2019s duration. However, mass media interventions work by informing people\u2014importantly, knowledge (unlike say, a bednet) does not necessarily disintegrate over time. For example, if a person learns to recognise the symptoms of malaria in their child and takes them to a clinic, they are presumably more likely to repeat this behavior if they see that symptom again in a few years time. They could also potentially spread this information to other people.&nbsp;</p><p>It is extremely unclear how long knowledge gained from mass media interventions continues to exert an effect upon behavior: to the best of my understanding, we should expect these effects to be very right-skewed, with a very small number of interventions exhibiting very long-lasting effects. That is, most campaigns may shift behavior solely during the duration of the campaign\u2014for example, because the campaign works by reminding people to do things that they would otherwise forget to do. At the other end of the spectrum, behavioral effects could shift behavior throughout a person\u2019s lifetime (for example, because they learn that the behavior in question achieves their desired outcome, such as improving their children\u2019s health), or could even contribute towards shifting group norms about typical ways to behave. In the latter case, these interventions could be hugely impactful, since they would affect many more people beyond those who are directly exposed to the campaign. An example of a shifting social norm in a HIC context is that of \u2018considerate smoking behavior\u2019; over time, it has become less socially acceptable to expose others to one\u2019s own cigarette smoke&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?6yb0La\">(Nyborg &amp; Rege, 2003)</a>. Beyond smoking, social norms are also thought to be important in understanding other behaviors that impact upon health, such as violence against women&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?bo4xr1\">(Garc\u00eda-Moreno et al., 2015)</a>, and adolescent contraceptive use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?zLpljG\">(Sedlander &amp; Rimal, 2019)</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Are social norms malleable to change via mass media? At present, this is an open question. There is evidence suggesting that social mechanisms of information spread are important; Arias&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?iXo0bT\">(2019)</a> contrasted the effect of an anti-violence radio campaign that was disseminated either privately (to individuals via CD) or publicly (via radio), relative to a baseline condition in which people did not hear the campaign (the local topography prevented the transmission of this program over the radio). He found that people were less likely to report that violence against women is socially acceptable following the campaign, but only in the public condition\u2014one interpretation of this evidence is that social norms are based in part upon an understanding of what others are likely to think, given the information that they have been exposed to.&nbsp;</p><p>Vogt et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?4iAOBv\">(2016)</a> used insights from work that models the spread of social norms, in an attempt to design a mass media intervention that could shift social norms about female genital mutilation (FGM). In particular, they chose an area where there was existing difference of opinion with regards to FGM. Note that work from cultural evolution has suggested that social norms are more liable to shift in areas where there is strong disagreement; given the role of conformist transmission (where people tend to copy the behaviors and opinions of the majority in their social group), it may be especially powerful to target communities where it is possible to \u2018tip\u2019 the majority of opinion towards one direction&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?pmqJ34\">(Muthukrishna, 2020)</a>. I view this work as being in its infancy\u2014for example, I\u2019m not yet aware of any experiments which have tested participants over a significant length of time, or found an impact upon behavior\u2014but Vogt et al. (2016) were successful in designing a movie that appeared to improve attitudes towards women who do not undergo FGM. It is unclear whether this was successful in actually shifting an entrenched social norm, but I view this as an area that may be promising if there are further research breakthroughs.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Taken together, I think that CEAs examining mass media intervention should include some estimate of potential long-term effects\u2014but I think these effects should be weighted with a low probability. To give an example of this approach, my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW_Vptr0xLh88p4AxADyd1k5iglqdy8GZxBamlLNEs/edit#gid=748560449\"><u>BOTEC</u></a> for FEM<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz8k985lbu1r\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz8k985lbu1r\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;considered three scenarios. In the most likely scenario (70% probability), the benefits do not persist after the campaign ends. In the medium scenario (25% probability) the results last for 4 years in total, with strongly diminishing effects per year (60% discount rate per year). In the best case scenario (5% probability) the effects shift a social norm, so it becomes common knowledge in Kano that contraceptives are freely available and do not have significant health risks. In this scenario, I apply a low discount rate (8% per year) and assume that the benefits last 8 years\u2014after 8 years, I assume that contraceptive access and knowledge would have come to Kano without FEM\u2019s intervention. This is not meant to be a conclusive way to model potential long-term benefits (this is currently very rough and relies upon my own subjective estimates), but an illustrative exercise\u2014this places FEM\u2019s cost-effectiveness at ~27X GD.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6jy64qxv3c\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6jy64qxv3c\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><h2>Existing evidence from RCTs in LMICs</h2><p>There are a relatively small number of RCTs examining mass media effects in LMICs.

The results of this trial were written up in GiveWell\u2019s evaluation of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/DMI-July-2021-Version\"><u>Development Media International</u></a>. This is the most ambitious RCT testing mass media in an LMIC that I am aware of, and the key result is that while the trial did not find an impact upon child mortality (it was under-powered to do so: I estimate below that their power to detect a 5% effect upon mortality was between&nbsp;0.027 - 0.1), it did find an impact upon behaviors that have been linked to improved child mortality\u2014including child consultations, attendance at antenatal care appointments, and deliveries in health facilities.&nbsp; There are a number of limitations to this study (see limitations below), making it challenging to interpret. I analyse this study in more detail (relative to the other RCTs), partly because of the difficulty in interpreting it, and secondly since my understanding is that the results of this trial are a key component of GiveWell\u2019s decision not to pursue mass media interventions further: note that the endline results of this experiment were not available to GiveWell at the time of their evaluation&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?dhQKOC\">(<i>Development Media International - July 2021 Version | GiveWell</i>, n.d.)</a>.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3><i>RCT design</i></h3><p>The intervention ran from March 2012 to January 2015, and took advantage of Burkina Faso\u2019s radio topography (namely, that there are a number of different local radio stations operating in different languages) to run a cluster-randomised RCT. The radio campaign focused on getting parents to recognise signs of pneumonia, malaria and severe diarrhea in their children\u2014and seeking medical care in response to these symptoms. 7 clusters were randomly assigned to the intervention group, and 7 clusters to the control group. Household surveys were completed at baseline, midline (after 20 months of campaigning) and endline (after 32 months of campaigning), to assess under-5 mortality. Routine data from health facilities were also analysed for evidence of changes in use (namely, increases in consultations).</p><h3><i>Results</i></h3><p>Under-5 child mortality decreased from 93.3 to 58.5 per 1,000 livebirths in the control group, and from 125.1 to 85.1 in the intervention group; there was no evidence of an intervention effect (risk ratio 1:00, 95%CI 0.82-1.22). This is from the survey data.</p><p>In the first year of the intervention, under-5 consultations increased from 68,681 to 83,022 in the control group, and from 79,852 to 111,758 in the intervention group (using time-series analysis: 35% intervention effect, 95%CI 20-51, P&lt;0.0001). New antenatal care attendances decreased from 13,129 to 12,997 in the control group, and increased from 19,658 to 20,202 in the intervention group in the first year (intervention effect 6%, 95% CI 2-10, p=0.004). Deliveries in health facilities decreased from 10,598 to 10,533 in the control group, and increased from 12,155 to 12,902 in the intervention group in the first year (intervention effect 7%, 95% CI 2-11, p = 0.004). This is from the routine data from health facilities.</p><p>Note that the researchers also used self-reported health behavior; I have not used this in my analysis, as I weight the government data more than self-report due to the possibility of social desirability bias.&nbsp;</p><h3><i>Limitations</i></h3><p><i>Reasons that the study results may&nbsp;<strong>underestimate</strong> the effectiveness of mass media campaigns:</i><br>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><u>Power.</u> The power of a study is the probability that it will successfully reject the null hypothesis (here, that the mortality rate is similar across control and test groups), when the null hypothesis is false. An underpowered study is therefore liable to make a Type 2 error, where it fails to detect a real effect in the data. Sarassat et al. (2018) write that their trial may have been underpowered;&nbsp;</li></ol><p><i>\u2018The small number of clusters available for randomisation together with the substantial between-cluster heterogeneity at baseline, and rapidly decreasing mortality, limited the power of the study to detect modest changes in behavior or mortality.\u2019</i></p><p>To test this empirically, I ran a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MyW_K49eg0pT1W5qkkuUHaupLW495huq\"><u>power analysis</u></a> using cpa.binary (from the ClusterPower package in R) using their data. To account for changing rates of mortality, I used the rate of child mortality in the control group at the end of the trial as the baseline mortality. I then estimated the trial\u2019s statistical power to detect a 5% change in mortality, because I think that 5% is a realistic\u2014if still quite optimistic\u2014prediction. For example, a 5% change in mortality could occur if the proportion of parents seeking medical care in response to their child\u2019s symptoms increased by 50%, and in 10% of those cases this saved the child\u2019s life. Note that values well below a 5% decrease in mortality are still likely to be cost-effective (see Background section above). Overall, my analyses found that the study\u2019s power to detect an effect of 5% upon childhood mortality was only 0.027; it is highly unlikely that the study would have successfully identified this effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To double check this result, I also estimated power via Monte Carlo simulations (using cps.binary from the same package) and found that the power was approximately 0.1; meaning that there was only a 10% chance that the study would successfully identify a positive result upon mortality. There are several factors contributing to this lack of power, meaning that changing one factor (such as the effect size) does not dramatically change the power.&nbsp;</p><p>Why is the power of this study so low? First, there is a very limited number of clusters (14). Note that the power analysis that is within Sarrassat et al. (2018) and referenced in their pre-registration was used to determine overall sample size, but not the number of clusters. On the one hand, this is understandable since they were presumably unable to achieve a higher number of clusters; they were limited by the number of different radio stations they could work with, who operated in different local languages. However, the problem is that this is a key bottleneck; Dron et al. (2021) write \u2018a hypothetical cluster trial with hundreds of thousands of participants but only a few clusters might never reach 80% statistical power, owing to the diminishing returns that increasing participant numbers relative to increasing cluster numbers provides for cluster trials\u2019. In my power analyses, increasing sample size further does not increase power\u2014but increasing cluster numbers does.</p><p>Second, they were only powered (at 80%) to detect a 20% change in under-5 mortality\u2014but it seems very optimistic to assume a 20% change in mortality. In a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ctL62pQDcSM3p4GWj/roy-head-how-to-put-your-own-charity-to-the-test\"><u>write-up</u></a> from DMI about the trial on the EA forum, the CEO of DMI writes;</p><p><i>\u2018...there was no way of powering any study in the world better than this. With unlimited funds we could not have devised a design that would detect mortality reductions of less than 15%. It was impossible. There\u2019s no country in the world where you could do that\u2019.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Note that meta-analyses of mass media effects use a benchmark of around 5% change in behavior (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SZ590oQkLYFQtU82kdtP9WBajpqcxVTVu302lYg_Eeo/edit#heading=h.3zt5xcr06m44\"><u>this section</u></a>). Here, this would mean a 5% increase in health-seeking behaviors such as getting consultations in response to child illness, and a smaller effect upon mortality.</p><p>Third, child mortality decreased (across both control and intervention areas) through the trial\u2014effectively reducing power even further. In addition, there was substantial between-cluster heterogeneity at baseline: accounting for the analysis methods used to attempt to adjust for this means the study effectively had even less power.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Given the low power, I do not take the child mortality results very seriously; I think it is very likely that they were underpowered to capture an effect upon child mortality.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><u>Results could last beyond trial end-point.</u> Using the data about health consultations (Kasteng et al. 2018), there were increases in under-5 consultations (35%; p &lt;0.0001),&nbsp; antenatal care attendances (6%, p = 0.004), and deliveries (7%, p = 0.004) in the intervention arm relative to the control arm, in the first year. In the second and third years, the estimated effect on antenatal care and deliveries remained relatively constant, but without statistical evidence for a difference between intervention and control group for antenatal care specifically. The effect on under-5 consultations seemed to decrease over time, but evidence of an intervention effect remained (year 2: 20%, p = 0.003, year 3: 16%, p = 0.049). The degree to which these effects persist is very unclear\u2014my assumption is that they would slowly decrease year by year, rather than drop off a cliff after year 3. In my BOTEC, I average out the results across the three years and (similarly to my approach for FEM) weight three potential scenarios for the potential of long-term effects via my estimate of the probability of this scenario.</li></ol><p><i>Reasons that the study may&nbsp;<strong>overstate</strong> the effectiveness of mass media campaigns</i></p><ol><li><u>Imbalances between control and intervention arms.&nbsp;</u>The control group was \u2018better off\u2019 than the treatment group at baseline by several metrics, including child mortality rates, distance and access to health facilities, and the proportion of women giving birth in a health facility.</li></ol><p>It is difficult to know the direction in which this would bias the result, but overall I think it is more likely to contribute towards overstating the study result. Assuming regression to the mean, this would suggest that the trial results may overstate the intervention impact\u2014that is, some of the effects that were attributed to the intervention in the worse-off intervention group were actually the result of regression to the mean. But there is also reason to expect that changes to health-seeking behaviors would be strongest among people living closer to a healthcare facility (and indeed, this opinion is supported by the results that the intervention resulted in increased care seeking among families that were closer to a healthcare facility).&nbsp;</p><p>DMI ran a cluster-level adjustment for baseline levels in the analysis to adjust for these imbalances between control and intervention arms. Nonetheless, I think this is a reason to discount the study results somewhat; my BOTEC includes a discount of 30%&nbsp; to account for this and potential problems of generalizability/ p-hacking.</p><ol><li><u>Limits to generalizability.</u> The primary purpose of this trial, as I understand it, was to test whether mass media could influence health behavior rather than to provide a test of whether similar initiatives will work. They therefore used a \u2018saturation+\u2019 approach that involved broadcasting ten times a day\u2014other initiatives may be unable to have this kind of coverage. In addition, DMI did select radio stations partially on the basis of which ones allowed for promising opportunities to establish effective working partnerships; future work may be unable to find radio stations that would work as cheaply and provide as dense a coverage.&nbsp;</li><li><u>Potential for systematic differences in the children who (as a result of the intervention) are taken to the clinic, relative to other children showing symptoms of illness.</u> I think it is quite plausible that the children who are \u2018newly\u2019 taken to the clinic (i.e. as a result of the intervention, and would not have been taken to the clinic otherwise) are less likely to get severely ill than children showing these symptoms in general. That is, perhaps the children who are at higher risk of death would always have been taken to the clinic regardless, and the children who are \u2018newly\u2019 taken to the clinic are the borderline cases who are less likely to become severely ill. I included a discount of 20% in my BOTEC to account for this (when estimating the number of deaths averted as a result of the intervention).</li><li><u>Potential for p-hacking.</u> The project collected a number of different outcome measures, and the administrative data (where there was evidence for an intervention effect) is not the primary outcome.</li><li><u>Blinding.</u> The surveyors (who collected the data about child mortality) were not blinded, which could have biased the results. However, no intervention effect was observed for child mortality anyway.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><br><i>Problems which seem likely to have no effect, or it\u2019s unclear which direction the effect would go</i></p><ol><li><u>Contamination in the control group.</u> Due to a radio station that neighbored a control group area using an illegally high radio strength, there was some contamination in one of the control group clusters. Given that these results were not excluded, this could mean that the effectiveness of the campaign is underestimated; however the researchers state that excluding the data has little effect.</li></ol><h3><i>Strengths</i></h3><ol><li>This study worked in six different languages, with coverage of 63 different villages and around 480,000 under 5-YOs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?0IWKXk\">(Kasteng et al., 2018)</a>.

This suggests that the intervention was resulting in increased consultations specifically for the diseases that they campaigned about\u2014rather than increasing numbers of consultations more generally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>I think that it is likely that seeking treatment for pneumonia/ diarrhoea/ malaria improves health outcomes. For example, treatment of cerebral malaria (a severe form of malaria) with artemisinin is associated with a 78% reduction in in-hospital mortality&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?2pIY3L\">(Conroy et al., 2021)</a>. Treatment of diarrhoea with oral rehydration salts has been associated with a reduction in mortality of ~93%&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?kKPWUE\">(Munos et al., 2010)</a>. Note that I still discount these estimates in my BOTEC (because I am unsure about the quality of care may be lower in Burkina Faso); for example, I assume that attaining treatment for malaria (relative to no treatment) decreases the risk of death (0.01%, using prevalence and death data for under 5 year olds in Burkina Faso, from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/\"><u>global burden of disease</u></a>) by 70%.&nbsp;</li></ol><h3><i>Research paper authors\u2019 interpretation:</i><br>&nbsp;</h3><p>In the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.developmentmedia.net/app/uploads/2021/02/DMI_ChildSurvivalRCT_Burkina-Faso_Lancet-Global-Health_2018.pdf\"><u>original paper</u></a>, the authors state that there is no detectable effect on child mortality, and that there were substantial decreases in child mortality observed in both groups over the intervention period\u2013reducing their ability to detect an effect.

For these reasons, I think it is fair to use the data about health-seeking behaviors (rather than rely solely upon the mortality data). However, there are also a few reasons to expect that the health-seeking data may overstate the potential effect of mass media interventions upon health if similar initiatives were scaled up in different areas. This study was able to achieve a very high level of coverage; similar interventions may struggle to achieve this. In addition, there is an imbalance between the intervention and control arms at baseline; I think it is quite possible that this therefore overstates the impact of the intervention if there is regression to the mean within this group. Finally, the studied population listens to the radio, is rural and yet is close to health clinics; these characteristics may not be true of other populations that could run similar initiatives. For these reasons, I include a discount of 30% in my BOTEC (and an additional 20% discount for my estimate of deaths averted).</p><p>On the other hand, there are also reasons to expect that this study may underestimate the effect of mass media interventions in general. First, the intervention location was selected primarily because it was possible to institute an RCT here; authors such as Deane (2018) have stressed that regions should be selected because there is an opportunity to correct misinformation/ provide lacking information. In these areas, people\u2019s behavior may be more amenable to change. Second, there is (understandably) no data beyond 32 months after the intervention. Interestingly, there appears to still be an effect at this endline\u2014if there exists an effect beyond this point, the overall effect of this intervention could be large.</p><p>With regard to the LiST modelling, I do not have a strong sense of whether LiST models tend to understate, overstate or provide a realistic impact of a program\u2019s effectiveness\u2014although I note that this is a well-established tool. I therefore produced my own BOTEC that draws from the data from the RCT to estimate how health-seeking behaviors predict mortality, rather than relying upon LiST.</p><p>For all these reasons, I included heavy discounts within my BOTECs for generalizability, and I used separate data sources from LiST to assess how the extra clinic attendances were likely to have affected mortality. My own results are somewhat less cost-effective than LiST modeling suggests&nbsp; (around $250 per DALY, relative to their estimate of $99 per DALY). However, note that I used the costings from the RCT trial (rather than the per person cost in a standard context, where an RCT was not being run)- this likely made the intervention appear less cost-effective in my BOTEC. A key question is to establish the cost-effectiveness of this program for scale-up, i.e. when an RCT is not beign completed at the same time.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.developmentmedia.net/app/uploads/2021/03/The-Media-or-the-Message-Experimental-Evidence-on-Mass-Media-and-Modern-Contraception-Uptake-in-Burkina-Faso.pdf\"><u>Glennerster et al. 2021 (Family Planning, Burkina Faso, DMI)</u></a></h2><p><br>&nbsp;This is a two-level randomized control trial covering 5 million people, testing (1) exposure to mass media (with 1500 women receiving radios) and (2) the impact of a 2.5 year family planning mass media campaign (cluster trial; 8 of 16 local radios received the campaign). This trial was also completed through DMI, and is more recent than the Sarassat et al. (2018) trial. It was not available at the time of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/DMI-July-2021-Version\"><u>GiveWell\u2019s analysis of DMI</u></a>.</p><h3><i>Design</i></h3><p>1550 women (who had no radio originally) were randomly selected to receive a radio. Half of these women were within broadcast range of radio stations randomly selected to receive an intensive family planning radio campaign, and half were in regions not covered by the campaign.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Two waves of survey data were used, from 7500 women (both those with and without radios at baseline), as well as monthly administrative data on the number of contraceptives distributed by all clinics in the study areas.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h3><i>Results</i></h3><p>Modern contraceptive use rose by 5.8 percentage points (p=0.030) in women who received a radio in campaign areas, compared to women who did not receive a radio in campaign areas. In campaign areas, family planning consultations were 32% higher, injectables 10% higher, and 22% more pills were distributed. Women aged 29-40 were 10% less likely to give birth in the year before the endline in campaign areas, although this was not the primary outcome (my understanding is that the authors believed they would be underpowered to capture this result, so did not include it on pre-registration).</p><p>Interestingly, women who received a radio in noncampaign areas reduced contraception use by 5.2 percentage points (p=0.039) and showed evidence for more conservative gender attitudes, compared to women who did not receive a radio in noncampaign areas (see Fig 1). In general, exposure to mass media lowered contraceptive use.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cfFokZu7mH7SKCjwH/vfcp2ovidq8vhzascctd\"></p><p>Fig 1: impact of radio campaign on modern contraception prevalence rate (Glennerster et al. 2021)</p><h3><i>Limitations</i></h3><ol><li><u>Generalisability:&nbsp;</u>the survey results come from rural areas, without electricity access (so however people use a TV and more people rely upon radio), and where there is high contraceptive availability\u2014an area that the authors estimate is only 7% of the country. So results may only be generalizable to a relatively small number of areas. For this reason, I discounted by 50% in my BOTEC. I am unsure of this value, and would spend more time here in a longer investigation.</li><li><u>Blinding</u>: the surveyors were not blinded to treatment condition, which could have impacted the results.&nbsp;</li></ol><h3><i>Strengths</i></h3><ol><li>This is a large study that involved surveying 7,500 women (and broadcasting to around 5 million people in total). This study is sufficiently well-powered to capture changes in contraceptive use, the primary outcome of this study. Note that for this study, the outcome metric produced large changes in behavior (around 20%)\u2014even if that behavior is less closely tied to survival, relative to the outcomes of the Sarasset et al. (2018) study.</li><li>This study is pre-registered, and follows the pre-registration plan.</li><li>As well as the data about health behavior (rates of contraceptive use), survey data also indicated improved knowledge about contraceptive methods, attitudes and towards family planning, and self-assessed health and well being in intervention relative to control areas. This data aligns with the primary findings of the study.</li></ol><h3><i>Interpretation</i><br>&nbsp;</h3><p>I think this study provides the strongest available evidence for an effect of behavior resulting from media exposure, in an LMIC context. Women who received a radio increased their contraceptive use by 5.8 percentage points in campaign areas, relative to women who did not receive a radio.&nbsp;</p><h2>Banerjee et al. 2019 (HIV, Nigeria)<br>&nbsp;</h2><p>This study used an \u2018edutainment\u2019 TV series called MTV Shuga, aimed at providing information and changing attitudes and behaviors related to HIV/ AIDS. Unlike the two RCTs above, the participants were exposed to the show in an artificial experimental setting.</p><h3><i>Design</i></h3><p>Researchers visited a random selection of households, and then randomly selected one 18-25 year old in each household to be invited to an initial film screening (the film was different from MTV Shuga). The baseline survey took place at this point. Participants were randomised to treatment or control groups.</p><p><u>Control:</u><strong>&nbsp;</strong>participants watched a placebo TV series.</p><p><u>Treatment 1</u><strong>:</strong> Participants were shown MTV Shuga.</p><p><u>Treatment 2</u><strong>:</strong> Same as treatment 1, except that after the Shuga episodes, subjects were also shown video clips containing information on the beliefs and values of peers in other communities who watched Shuga.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Treatment 3</u><strong>:</strong> Half of T1 and T2 were offered the option of bringing two friends to the screenings. So T1 and T2 are randomised at cluster level, and T3 cross-cuts across T1 and T2 and is randomised at the individual level.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Results</u></h3><p>There were not many differences in baseline characteristics between T1, T2, and T3, but there were in comparing the treatment groups as a whole to the control group. People in the treatment group were 3.1 percentage points more likely to test for HIV than those in the control group. Beliefs about the acceptability of concurrent sexual relationships decreased during the treatment period in the test group, although MTV Shuga did not induce greater condom use. However, the likelihood of testing positive for Chlamydia was 55% lower for women in the intervention groups (the impact on men was in the same direction but statistically insignificant).</p><p><u>Interpretation</u></p><p>MTV Shuga worked in that it improved HIV testing rates and potentially decreased rates of Chlamydia. I view this as further evidence that mass media can successfully shift health-seeking behaviors, but I think that the generalisability of this study is very limited in the context of charitable interventions (since most charity work operates via radio/TV shows, where there are competing demands on the viewer\u2019s attention). I also note the large number of different outcomes they measured, and that they did not see consistent effects across all outcomes; the researchers did not use a bonferroni correction (or other method to account for the number of outcomes measured).</p><h2>Evidence from meta-analyses of public health campaigns</h2><p>I also looked at evidence from meta analyses of public health campaigns, for which there is a larger body of evidence. There are relatively few RCTs of public health campaigns (with the exception of those listed above, in an LMIC context)\u2014Head et al. argue that this is due to the difficulties in selectively exposing people to mass media (without spillover), at a large scale&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?wUJ63q\">(2015)</a>. Consequently, I note that I think these meta-analyses are not of an especially strong quality: they pull from papers which use weaker designs.&nbsp;</p><p>Snyder et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?NtpuCo\">(2004)</a> is especially well-cited, and includes data from 48 campaigns in the USA. Overall, they find that on average 5% of the population reached by the intervention change their behavior (for campaigns where the behavior is not enforced, for example by legal consequences)\u2014a value that (in conjunction with other work from Anker et al, 2016) has established the conventional use of a 5% behavior change benchmark, for public health researchers looking to work out adequate sample size in power analyses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?a8ILeV\">(Anker et al., 2016)</a>. However, I note that this paper does not attempt to test for or adjust for publication biases, and includes data from designs that are not low quality (e.g. pretest/ posttest without a control group). I therefore suspect that 5% is an overestimate, although I note that the RCTs in LMICs found similarly sized (or even larger) effects\u2014my suspicion is that this is an overestimate for high-income countries specifically, where the media environment is more saturated already.&nbsp;</p><p>Anker et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?uULMWN\">(2016)</a> conducted a meta-analysis of 63 mass communication health campaigns across countries (but mainly focused in high-income countries). A strength of this study is that it had stricter inclusion criteria relative to Snyder et al. (2004); in particular, the authors only included studies with a nonequivalent groups pre-test/post-test design with a control group. That is, designs where campaigns are implemented in one or more different communities, while a demographically similar community serves as a control group. These designs are weaker than cluster randomised control trials, because the groups are not randomised with respect to who receives the mass media intervention\u2014but they do at least use a control group. To be included, campaigns had to employ at least one of the following communication channels: television/ cinema, radio, billboard, magazine, newspaper and/ or advertisements on public transport. The campaigns also had to include a planned message designed for brief delivery (so long form entertainment-education programs were excluded), and campaigns that took place in a controlled setting such as a laboratory were excluded. The campaigns were across areas including nutrition, physical activity/ exercise, cardiovascular disease prevention, sexual health, cancer awareness. Campaign communities consistently demonstrated greater behavior change than control communities;&nbsp;<i>r</i> = 0.05 (95% CI 0.033, 0.075),&nbsp;<i>k</i> = 61. This is broadly congruent with the results from Snyder et al. (2004), despite being more selective about which papers they included.</p><p>Overall (and despite a weaker research design) these meta-analyses have generally suggested a smaller effect size upon behavior than the results from the RCTs in LMIC contexts (e.g. the effect of the family planning programs upon behavior was around ~20% in the Glennerster et al. trial, compared to a behavior change of around 5% in the meta-analyses listed here). My interpretation of this is that there is \u2018low-hanging fruit\u2019 within LMICs, in the sense that there are areas of considerable misinformation/ lack of information (e.g. about the use of contraceptives) that can be relatively easily addressed via mass media campaigns. I cover this in more detail in the section below. In addition, it could be the case that there is less media saturation in areas such as Burkina Faso, where people are less likely to watch TV.</p><h2>Other evidence<br>&nbsp;</h2><p>Outside of the context of public health campaigns, I note that there is strong evidence that mass media can alter behavior\u2014for example, via advertising and propaganda. Existing evidence suggests that these advertisements can alter decisions about which items we buy, as well as preferences and beliefs about particular items (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?moPucV\">Sethuraman et al., 2011</a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?NfO95p\">Kokkinaki &amp; Lunt, 1999</a>). Along similar lines, advertising can also influence voting decisions. For example, Green and Vasudevan&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?zWBUmi\">(2016)</a> ran an RCT testing the effect of a radio campaign that aimed to persuade voters not to vote for politicians who engaged in vote buying. 60 different radio stations were randomised to be either the test group (which received 60 second ads aimed to persuade voters or this) versus a control group (where there were no ads). They found that exposure to the ads decreased the vote share of these vote-buying parties by between 4 and 7, from around 4-7 percentage points. Another (more sinister) example of mass media influencing behavior comes from propaganda, where emotionally laden media is used to further a particular agenda. In particular, Yanagizawa-Drott&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?mmblfo\">(2014)</a> used information about Rwanda\u2019s topography (which affects radio reception) to estimate the effect of radio broadcasts upon participation in violence during the Rwandan genocide; he estimates that approximately 10% of the participation in the violence can be attributed to the effects of the radio. Overall, there is strong evidence that mass media can powerfully change behavior (see also;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?wsiO95\">DellaVigna et al., 2014; Duflo &amp; Saez, 2003; Gerber et al., 2011; La Ferrara, 2016)</a>.&nbsp;</p><h1>Which media campaigns tend to work?</h1><p><br>&nbsp;While meta-analyses of public health campaigns have suggested that they work, there is a significant degree of variability in how well different campaigns work&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?EMs882\">(Noar, 2009)</a>. There is a broad literature which examines the effectiveness of different mass media campaigns, usually differentiated by public health topic (e.g. drink driving;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?GLYYBt\">(Elder et al., 2004)</a>, alcohol consumption;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?GJlg4z\">(Young et al., 2018)</a>, smoking;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?LtBWOy\">(Durkin et al., 2012)</a>, family planning;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?pJ9BfB\">(Parry, 2013)</a>. Unfortunately, the key aspects of message design and coverage have not been systematically tested against each other. Therefore, my aim in this section is to highlight key features that other authors have identified as being important towards determining the power of a mass media campaign.</p><h3>Resources to take the necessary actions</h3><p>Clearly, behavior change cannot be large if the resources to take the necessary actions (such as the presence of local clinics to seek healthcare from, or free contraceptives) are not available. This point has been stressed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gh.bmj.com/content/3/5/e001222\"><u>commentary</u></a> surrounding the Sarrassat et al. 2018 trial; \u2018demand-side interventions [such as DMI\u2019s trial, which encouraged parents to take their child to a clinic] are not a substitute for health systems strengthening or other supply-side interventions\u2019&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?ba6vg6\">(<i>The Legitimacy of Modelling the Impact of an Intervention Based on Important Intermediate Outcomes in a Trial | BMJ Global Health</i>, n.d.)</a>. It is&nbsp; vital that the necessary resources are in place (such as contraceptive access or functioning clinics) prior to a mass media intervention.</p><h3>Tackling misinformation/ lack of information</h3><p>I note that the three mass media campaigns in LMIC have tackled topics where there is&nbsp; \u2018missing information\u2019 for an area where the listeners are highly motivated to improve health. For example, DMI provides information to improve children\u2019s health (to recognise particular symptoms, and take a child to the doctor in response), and FEM provides information about contraceptives (to tackle misinformation about their health risks, and generally to make contraceptives more socially acceptable). In contrast, a campaign that appears to have failed according to RCT results (the UK\u2019s \u2018Change4Life\u2019 campaign;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?7atE2w\">Croker et al., 2012)</a> provided information that people may have known about already\u2014such as that there are health benefits to eating 5 fruits or vegetables a day.</p><p><br>&nbsp;I suspect that there is \u2018low hanging fruit\u2019 in the context of LMIC, in the sense that there may be particular areas where people are very motivated to act once they are given the correct information. I think this is especially likely in regions where people have poor access to health information (i.e. where people cannot necessarily google WebMD or NHS direct).</p><h3>Cultural relevance</h3><p>I think we should be skeptical of any media campaigns that don\u2019t have strong input from local advisors and writers\u2014note that FEM uses local writers, and DMI works with local people to design their campaigns. There are many aspects of local context (e.g. nature of misinformation about contraceptives) that are barriers to behavior change, and would be difficult to ascertain without input from local people. Second, local people are likely best-placed to provide the message, due to their social standing as a trusted source and in-group member. For example, FEM were able to get a local religious leader to talk on one of their radio shows, which they suspect was a highly persuasive part of their campaign.</p><h3>Social desirability</h3><p>Many programs that have been very successful have used social desirability to their advantage For instance, one successful example of public health communication comes from the \u2018truth\u2019 campaign that was first conducted by the Florida Department of Health (and subsequently by the American Legacy Foundation). The campaign was aimed at youth between the ages of 12 and 17 years, and showed images of youths who were engaged in public demonstrations against the tobacco industry:&nbsp; youth rebelling against the tobacco industry, rather than using tobacco to appear rebellious. A quasi-experimental design taking advantage of variation in exposure to the campaign stemming from the presence or absence of local affiliates of the networks that broadcasted the ads estimated that the campaign accounted for 22% of the observed decline (25.3% to 18%; so the campaign is thought to have been responsible for around 1.6% of the total decline) in the prevalence of youth smoking between 1999 and 2002&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?aetWZi\">(Farrelly et al., 2005)</a>. Note that I would still discount this estimate somewhat\u2014due to potential confounds from their method of measuring exposure, and the potential of p-hacking and publication bias. Nonetheless, I think this highlights how appealing to \u2018how people want to be perceived\u2019 may be a powerful tool towards behavior change.&nbsp;</p><h3>Coverage</h3><p>In order to promote change at the individual or group level, mass media campaigns need to exhibit sufficient coverage that people can recall the campaign\u2019s message.&nbsp; For example, notable mass media interventions failures include two campaigns designed to lower rates of diarrheal disease and increase rates of immunisation that were both carried out in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Lesotho, and Indonesia-West Java, by the HealthCom project. These failures have been blamed in part upon low exposure levels&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?nPoIGe\">(Hornik et al., 2002)</a>. It has been argued that while public health communication has (rightly) focused upon the design of campaigns, they have not adequately concentrated on the challenge of achieving sufficient message exposure&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?PsGshu\">(Hornik et al., 2002)</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>To what degree could changing behavior improve health?</h2><p>Assuming that mass media can shift behavior, a second component to examine is the degree to which these behavioral changes can improve morbidity and mortality. The Global Burden of Disease estimates the deaths attributed to various behavioral risk factors, see Fig 2. Note that the DALY burden from these behavioral risks is very large; to give a sense of scale, nearly 500 deaths per 10,000 of the global population are attributed to tobacco use.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cfFokZu7mH7SKCjwH/efuni70iactedafqwdv8\"></p><p>Fig 2: deaths attributed to behavioral risk factors according to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/?params=gbd-api-2019-public/47546bc8f91f7feb07427b9cf831175d\"><u>Global Burden of Disease.</u></a></p><p><br>Mass media interventions can target a full range of potential behavioral interventions, with the disclaimer that some behaviors may be more amenable to successful change than others. Assuming that change occurs, the table below provides estimates of the resulting predicted impact in terms of % change upon mortality or DALYs. These reductions are sufficiently large to suggest that mass media interventions which cause behavior change in ~2% of the population will be cost effective.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5e79bit0u1g\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5e79bit0u1g\">[8]</a></sup></span></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Behavior to modify</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>E: per person change in mortality/ DALY after behaviour change&nbsp;</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Source</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Tobacco consumption</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>5% reduction in mortality</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XZIR443EcFL3TgfYAyWdKXvgDbbo0aNq47ArAv1ogWg/edit#gid=0\"><u>Tax policy CEAs</u></a></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Using contraceptives in Kano, Nigero</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>1% reduction in mortality (based on avoiding maternal mortality)</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13n5Hc1R64UgA8TlQ42bQiC-ky3VOxmR9P9Qf6zVOgUQ/edit#gid=1583515765\"><u>Mass Media BOTEC</u></a></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Getting treatment for malaria when otherwise would not have done</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>0.82% reduction in mortality</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13n5Hc1R64UgA8TlQ42bQiC-ky3VOxmR9P9Qf6zVOgUQ/edit#gid=1583515765\"><u>Mass Media BOTEC</u></a>: no. of child deaths averted/ number who newly seek out treatment</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Going to antenatal care appointments</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>0.98% reduction in infant mortality</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Used to model effectiveness of Suvita</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Are mass media interventions underfunded?</h1><p>Roy Head (the CEA of DMI) has argued that \u2018mass media is not seen as a core component of public health\u2019, in part due to the difficulty in proving effectiveness through randomised controlled trials&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?YPQ2K8\">(Head et al., 2015)</a>. I am not sure whether public health campaigns are necessarily underfunded in high-income contexts\u2014where these campaigns are expensive to run, compete with multiple other sources of information, and the population already has easy access to high quality information about health. But it seems that mass media campaigns are actually especially well-suited to LMICs, given cheap radio airtime, reliance on fewer sources of information, and the ability to fill in \u2018gaps\u2019 about healthcare knowledge. To the best of my understanding, government-run public health campaigns in LMIC are relatively unusual\u2014I could not find many examples online. For these reasons, while I couldn\u2019t find actual data on the amount of money spent on mass media campaigns in LMIC, I suspect that this area is generally underfunded. There is some support from effective altruist organisations (such as The Life you Can Save, who&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/best-charities/development-media-international/\"><u>recommend DMI</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>As a general point, behavior is a key determinant of health (see Fig 2)\u2014yet behavioral interventions are not generally regarded as a critical component of public health in the way that medicine is. Behavior change can effectively be a preventative measure\u2014i.e. for reducing rates of STDs, for promoting heart-healthy behaviors, or by making it more likely that people will go to the clinic to receive treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there are several nonprofits in this space that may have room for funding:</p><ul><li>GiveWell\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/DMI-July-2021-Version\"><u>evaluation of DMI</u></a> says that in 2015, DMI estimated that they could productively use approximately $12 million in unrestricted funds to scale up and launch more campaigns to reduce under-5 mortality. I am not aware of DMI\u2019s current funding situation, but I note that they have ongoing work in the areas of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.developmentmedia.net/project/sunrise/\"><u>early cognitive development</u></a>, and designing videos that are designed to go&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.developmentmedia.net/project/sunrise/\"><u>viral on WhatsApp.</u></a><u>&nbsp;</u></li><li><a href=\"https://www.familyempowermentmedia.org/\"><u>Family Empowerment Media</u></a> broadcast shows about contraceptives in Nigeria.

One thing I am curious about is whether mass media organisations can simply pivot to use their infrastructure to use different media campaigns year on year: this would then maximise their start up costs, and minimise exposing people (who have already gained the informational benefits from prior broadcasts) to the same information past the point of benefit.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref05tsqiqxwbiv\"><sup><a href=\"#fn05tsqiqxwbiv\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;More broadly, I think that understanding the long-term effects of mass media campaigns is vastly underexplored\u2014and I suspect that some estimation of these (even if they are, by necessity, very rough) should go into CEAs.</p><p><br>&nbsp;I am also curious about spillover effects, which have not gone into my BOTECs. That is, do people pass the information on to others who have not been exposed to the campaign? I suspect that this is sometimes the case, if at a relatively low frequency.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;I think that the possibility of mass media to contribute to positive norm shift is hugely underexplored, and potentially very impactful.</p><h1>Conclusions</h1><p>Mass media has huge potential, because (at least in LMIC contexts) it is possible to expose a huge number of people to a campaign very cheaply. This means that even if the effect of these campaigns is very small, it is still likely to be cost-effective\u2014in my opinion, the importance of this factor in determining cost-effectiveness has been underappreciated. In addition, existing work using RCTs in LMICs suggests that the effect size is actually not especially small\u2014for example, the ~35% increase for child consultations of malaria/ pneumonia/ diarrhoea from the Sarassat et al. (2018) trial. Finally, I think that the impact of LMIC mass media interventions is heavily right-skewed (and that the mean effect is probably still cost-effective). That is, since information can be shared with others freely and passed down, there may be some mass media interventions whose effect extends far beyond their actual campaigns. Overall, I recommend proceeding with this investigation to examine mass media charities in more detail.&nbsp;</p><h2><br><strong>About Founders Pledge</strong></h2><p>Founders Pledge is a community of over 1,700 tech entrepreneurs finding and funding solutions to the world\u2019s most pressing problems.

Summary:</h1><h2>1.1 The Problem</h2><p>The increasing autonomy of nuclear command and control systems stemming from their integration with artificial intelligence (AI) stands to have a strategic level of impact that could either increase nuclear stability or escalate the risk of nuclear use. Inherent technical flaws within current and near-future machine learning (ML) systems, combined with an evolving human-machine psychological relationship, work to increase nuclear risk&nbsp;by enabling poor judgment and could result in the use of nuclear weapons inadvertently or erroneously. A key takeaway from this report is that this problem does not have a solution; rather, it represents a shift in the paradigm behind nuclear decision making and it demands a change in our reasoning, behavior, and systems to ensure that we can reap the benefits of automation and machine learning without advancing nuclear instability.</p><p>The figure below demonstrates the general path from AI/ML systems integration with nuclear command and control toward an increased risk&nbsp;of nuclear weapons use. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668776496/mirroredImages/BGFk3fZF36i7kpwWM/br9tqlfeofdlafcrdlnt.jpg\"></p><p>Navigating our relationship with machines, especially in a military context, is integral to safeguarding human lives. When considering this challenge at the already contentious nuclear level, our concern expands from preserving human lives to preserving human civilization. Undoubtedly, any development that alters decision making around nuclear weapons use demands our close attention. AI and ML stand to enable a significant increase in automation throughout Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3). Only time will reveal the exact way this will unfold, but early warning and decision support systems seem to be likely candidates for high levels of automation.</p><p>Integrating ML systems could increase the accuracy of these systems while also potentially removing human related errors. However, given their importance in detection, and their history with false positives, anything that impacts early warning and decision support systems requires the utmost scrutiny even if the change stands to potentially improve the safety of such systems.</p><p>This report is designed to lay out the problem, analyze possible solutions, and present funding opportunities designed to support impactful projects and developments. However, in a manner more akin to the academic paper, the through line in this report highlights that the automation ML fessably brings to NC3 could have substantial impacts on nuclear decision making.&nbsp;By increasing automation, we are effectively \u2018pre-delegating\u2019 authority to machine intelligences which are inevitably flawed systems despite the advantages they could bring. In one sense, their imperfection does not in-of-itself derail any argument in favor of ML integration. They would either work alongside, or replace, human operators who are also both flawed and limited in what they can do. However, the true danger of relying on flawed machines &nbsp;becomes apparent when we consider how automation will affect the human-machine relationship.</p><p>The very purpose of developing AI is for its theoretical ability to perform better than humans - to be faster, stronger, and continuously vigilant. However, overconfidence in their abilities could result in over deployment of the technology and premature \u2018pre-delegation\u2019 of responsibility. This not only sets the stage for technical flaws within the modern and nearterm ML systems to increase the risk of catastrophes, it also removes&nbsp;humanity from this process. While humans are far from perfect, we\u2019ve managed to avoid inadvertent nuclear weapons use and nuclear war for just under a century. I argue that &nbsp;human weakness itself played a key role in preventing inadvertent use of nuclear weapons. Therefore, the increasing automation that accompanies ML integration with NC3 could represent a dramatic shift in nuclear weapons decision making processes and this exacerbates pre-existing risks around inadvertent use.</p><h2>1.2 Possible interventions?</h2><p>A philanthropist interested in reducing nuclear risk stemming from a poorly planned integration of ML with NC3 could support efforts to increase research and discussion on this topic, and/or efforts to provide stronger empirical support of these concepts and possibilities. &nbsp;</p><p>Possible interventions include funding new experimental wargaming efforts, funding research at key think tanks, and increasing international AI governance efforts. While far from an exhausted list, some of the following think tanks and research groups are likely impactful candidates:</p><ol><li>The United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research</li><li>Stockholm International Peace Research Institute</li><li>RAND Corporation</li><li>The Centre for Strategic and International Studies</li><li>The Nuclear Threat Initiative</li></ol><p>I look at each intervention in more detail at the end of the document.</p><h2>1.3 Target Audience</h2><p>This report is designed to outline the effect that integrating AI/ML with NC3 could have for the risk of inadvertent use. It is also primarily designed for an audience already somewhat versed in nuclear deterrence literature with an understanding of what crisis stability/instability entails. Nonetheless, this report does delve into some of these topics insofar as they directly interact with the main argument. What this report is not is a deepdive into the computer science behind AI technology, nor is it a psychological piece of research designed to act as the definitive piece on the human-machine relationship.</p><p>This work aims to build off insights from both the&nbsp;fields of nuclear deterrence and AI safety. In synthesizing the literature of these two fields I hope to inform nuclear grantmakers of the risks involved in this integration and to provide direction for further research or other efforts &nbsp;to mitigate this problem.</p><h2>1.4 Scope of Analysis</h2><p>This work focuses on the U.S. and allied Western states: &nbsp;the U.K., France, and Israel. The reason for this is threefold:</p><ol><li>Systems between different powers differ and of the nuclear powers, I am best positioned to examine western nuclear command.</li><li>The problems addressed are related to the technology itself: how it could potentially impact the human-machine relationship and affect nuclear decision-making.&nbsp;These issues are not state specific, so omitting other nuclear states from the scope of this report is not a significant shortcoming.</li><li>Cooperative efforts to reduce nuclear risk are arguably preferable, but unilateral action matters and can make a positive impact on nuclear stability.</li></ol><p>In this case, any effort to mitigate the negative side effects of AI integration with nuclear command will likely lead to a net-positive outcome in terms of safety for all actors. Therefore, one can primarily focus on the U.S. and still provide reasonable suggestions for reducing nuclear risk.</p><p>There is also the question of alarmism. Some thinkers have rightly pointed out that discussions on emerging technologies often amounts to a dangerous form of alarmism.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref65lnll4qjtg\"><sup><a href=\"#fn65lnll4qjtg\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Historically, other technologies that were predicted to change the nature of warfare, such as chemical weapons, failed to live up to these expectations.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref11g1f3ruddri\"><sup><a href=\"#fn11g1f3ruddri\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Other times, \u201ceven when technologies do have significant strategic consequences, they often take decades to emerge, as the invention of airplanes and tanks illustrates.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3xjaxi835c1\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3xjaxi835c1\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The notable exception to this was the advent of nuclear weapons. The undeniability of their sheer destructive power has dominated international security and great power interactions since their conception. While the details of how AI will impact both the world at large, and the military context specifically, rests uncertain, there are reasons to be concerned that it will be more akin to nuclear weapons than other overhyped technologies. AI has been likened to electricity; \u201clike electricity brings objects all around us to life with power, so too will AI bring them to life with intelligence.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefutj3dyzy42g\"><sup><a href=\"#fnutj3dyzy42g\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Others have stated that it will be \u201cthe biggest geopolitical revolution in human history.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc5jch88s156\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc5jch88s156\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The potentially massive impact of strategic military AI, and the relatively small amount&nbsp;of philanthropic directed to this issue, highlight the need to outline potential dangers.</p><h2>1.5 Outline of Report</h2><p>This report starts with defining what is meant when discussing AI and NC3. Second, it then outlines the pressures to integrate AI with NC3, evidence to support this claim, and how this modernization could take place. Third, the report portrays the mechanisms that could lead to the risk of increased nuclear use risk: technical flaws within AI systems and problems surrounding the human-machine relationship. Forth, the report briefly analyzes a variety of solutions to these risks and outlines which seem most likely to have a positive impact on risk reduction. Fifth and finally, it provides a list of tractable funding opportunities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>2. Defining&nbsp;Key Aspects of the Discussion</h1><h2>2.1 Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</h2><p>Automation, to varying degrees, has been a part of deterrence and command/control since the dawn of nuclear weapons.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefez11w7xb3ak\"><sup><a href=\"#fnez11w7xb3ak\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;\u201cModern AI\u201d as it is publicly imagined is a relatively new addition. The Soviet Perimetr system, known as the \u2018Dead Hand\u2019 in the West, is an example of a more extreme form of automation with nuclear weapons. This was an automated NC3 system designed to react in a situation in which a potential nuclear detonation was detected and communication with national leadership was dead. The system could interpret this as an indication of a nuclear attack against Russia,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmzjjyue442g\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmzjjyue442g\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and give authority and ability to a human operator in a hardened bunker to launch nuclear missiles in response.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzj7f3diitx\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzj7f3diitx\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This operator would likely have very little information other than what the Perimetr system provided and would have to decide whether or not to trust its determination.</p><p>There is disagreement as to how developed this Perimetr system actually was.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff7yjlwrdw7f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf7yjlwrdw7f\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Nonetheless, it acts as an example of the potential pitfalls associated with linking a \u2018Doomsday Device\u2019 to a machine intelligence. Fortunately, both the U.S. and U.K. have made formal declarations that humans will always retain political control and remain in the decision-making loop when nuclear weapons are concerned.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq3h0aa3y5vn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq3h0aa3y5vn\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><p>The term \u201cAI\u201d invokes a myriad of different definitions, from killer robots to programs that classify images of dogs. What brings these computational processes together under the umbrella term of artificial intelligence is their ability to solve problems or perform functions that traditionally require human levels of cognition.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7a3ub499lz9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7a3ub499lz9\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Machine learning (ML) is an important subfield of this research as these systems learn \u201cby finding statistical relationships in past data.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqgcnx708azo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqgcnx708azo\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;To do so, they are trained using large data sets of real-world information. For example, image classifiers are shown millions of images of a specific type and form.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefurqqhgzjgze\"><sup><a href=\"#fnurqqhgzjgze\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;From there, they can look at new images and use their trained knowledge to determine what they are seeing. There are also a number of ways one can train an ML system. Training can be supervised, where data sets are pre-labeled by humans, or unsupervised, where the AI finds \u201chidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsb6chv0pf5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsb6chv0pf5\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>With this in mind, while ML is the overarching driver behind the renaissance of intelligent machines, its own subset of deep learning is arguably the main way in which AI will be used in nuclear command. Deep learning differs from machine learning through the number, or depth, of its neural network layers, which allows it to automate much of the training process and requires less human involvement in its training.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbd3fn02pltl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbd3fn02pltl\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This automation allows the system to use unstructured or unlabeled data to train itself by finding patterns within larger datasets that are not curated by humans. This makes them extremely useful for recognizing patterns and managing and assessing data for \u201csystems that the armed forces use for intelligence, strategic stability and nuclear risk.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx0rwyg4hmd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx0rwyg4hmd\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>However, because the ways in which AI could be integrated with NC3 could be incredibly varied and broad, I will generally use the ML terminology when discussing AI in this report. To put this in context, one study found that potentially 39% of the subsystems that make up NC3, could be integrated with ML.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2by4fx4jucb\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2by4fx4jucb\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;While deep learning may be crucial to the success of AI within command systems, it is but one, very important, subset of ML, and therefore this report will focus on the idea of machine learning.</p><p>Machine learning is the key to the advent of intelligent machines within nuclear command, and the autonomy it enables is arguably the most important benefit. Autonomy, or \u2018machine autonomy,\u2019 \u201ccan be defined as the ability of a machine to execute a task or tasks without human input, using interactions of computer programming with the environment.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx19o00rsgxk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx19o00rsgxk\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668776497/mirroredImages/BGFk3fZF36i7kpwWM/bsb3ngmo9xkwbfagtcpd.png\"></p><p>By removing human operators from the decision making loop in certain instances, one can better leverage both the operating speed, and the skill of ML systems to find hidden patterns in large complicated data sets.&nbsp;This presents a large strategic advantage within a military context where there is a premium on haste and reliable information.&nbsp;For the purpose of this report, AI integration will be generally discussed in terms of ML, automation, and its ability to assess data and provide analysis. &nbsp;</p><h2>2.2 Nuclear Command, Control, and Communications (NC3)</h2><p>NC3 is \u201cthe combination of warning, communication, and weapon systems\u2013as well as human analysts, decision-makers, and operators\u2013involved in ordering and executing nuclear strikes, as well as preventing unauthorized use of nuclear weapons\u201d.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqvyzysowihk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqvyzysowihk\">[19]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>New and more powerful ML systems could be used to improve the speed and quality of assessment completed by NC3. ML systems\u2019 ability to find correlations by continuously sorting through large amounts of data with an objective&nbsp;eye&nbsp;is particularly relevant to early-warning systems and pre-launch detection activities within the nuclear security field.</p><p>The other core reason for focusing on &nbsp;early warning and decision-support systems within NC3 is their susceptibility and influence on the possibility of inadvertent use. Since the inception of nuclear weapons, there has been a plethora of false alarms and false positives due to both technical and human error.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0pnk5v7f3q1\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0pnk5v7f3q1\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A now classic example of this occurred in the Soviet Union in September 1983 &nbsp;when Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Yevgrafovich Petrov\u2019s early warning system falsely detected five incoming U.S. Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The system confirmed the attack with the highest level of confidence with a probability factor of two.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjafci3azi5s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjafci3azi5s\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Despite this, he had reservations about the system\u2019s capability and accuracy and realized that the incoming attack did not fit Soviet strategic doctrine as it was far too small in scale.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft51vvr2n7i\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt51vvr2n7i\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Ultimately he dedicated to report it as a false alarm and his intuition was correct. The machine had made the wrong call and Petrov\u2019s skepticism and critical thinking combined likely contributed to preventing Soviet retaliation.</p><p>On the other side of the Iron Curtain, NORAD was not free from human and technical error resulting in false alarm situations. In November 1979 an early warning system was accidentally fed test scenario data designed to simulate an incoming Soviet nuclear attack. Lucky radar was about to confirm that this was a mistake and in 1980 NORAD \u201cchanged its rules and standards regarding the evidence needed to support a launch on warning.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsf8ijr53tq8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsf8ijr53tq8\">[23]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, this isn\u2019t the only example as less than a year later a faulty computer chip caused the early warning system to detect what looked like an incoming Soviet attack.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnqvorp8y26\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnqvorp8y26\">[24]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;At 02:26 on 3 June 1980, National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski received a telephone call informing him that 220 missiles had been fired at the U.S, which was then confirmed in another call with the number of missiles being raised to 2,200.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8soeda71p7a\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8soeda71p7a\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;At the literal last minute before he was about to inform President Carter did Brzezinski receive the final call telling him it was a false alarm that had been caused by a faulty computer chip. In one sense these stories demonstrate that even in the face of complex and flawed systems, organizational safety measures can prevent inadvertent use. However, they also speak to the frightening ease with which we arrive at the potential brink of nuclear use when even a small mistake is made.</p><p>Integrating ML systems could increase the accuracy of these systems while also potentially removing the human source of these errors. However, given their importance in detection, and their history with false positives, anything that impacts early warning and decision support systems requires the utmost scrutiny even if the change stands to potentially improve the safety of such systems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>3. Pressures to Integrate AI with NC3 and the Shape It Could Take:</h1><h2>3.1 Pressures to integrate&nbsp;ML with nuclear systems</h2><p>Despite the outlined dangers of AI integration, there are pressures and incentives to use ML systems within NC3. As previously stated, automation has always played a role in nuclear strategy and deterrence. ML could take the level of automation to new heights and potentially change nuclear weapons decision-making.</p><p>In one sense, states desire this integration for the strategic advantages that it promises.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref394tiophhlu\"><sup><a href=\"#fn394tiophhlu\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;ML systems can function without rest, look at enormous amounts of data, and, perhaps most importantly, find patterns and connections in a way that often outperforms human analysts by also being able to draw conclusions from seemingly unrelated data points.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0gl4og5esdsb\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0gl4og5esdsb\">[27]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Furthermore, current NC3 systems are aging and the last major update was during the 1980s.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9ta2gnpxmj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9ta2gnpxmj\">[28]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The need to ensure the technical effectiveness of NC3 is clear.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond working for deterrence as intended , there is also interest in ensuring that systems are progressively safer. The automation of ML stands to reduce the number of near-calls related to human error, cognitive bias, and fatigue.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref84ygbmpxnzs\"><sup><a href=\"#fn84ygbmpxnzs\">[29]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Despite concerns over integrating AI, it\u2019s also blatant that human operators are far from perfect and prone to allowing biases or making mistakes, especially when completing repetitive tasks or assessing adversarial moves.</p><p>Finally, states have an interest in keeping up with, if not surpassing, their adversaries\u2019 military technology.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjmlvv1gdnr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjmlvv1gdnr\">[30]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This is particularly concerning regarding the implementation of ML in nuclear command because in \u201can effort to gain a real or perceived nuclear strategic advantage against their adversaries, while engaging in an AI race, states may place less value on AI safety concerns and more on technological development.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnl83r4oo1xg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnl83r4oo1xg\">[31]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;While the development of AI technologies by major states may not currently be best characterized as a \u2018race\u2019, the pressure to keep up is unmistakable: \u201cAI has the potential to drastically change the face of war and the world at large\u2026 This in turn not only drives general integration, but raises the risk that both our advancements, and those of adversarial nations, increase the speed at which we field AI-enabled systems, even if testing safety measures are lacking.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyf35kugpbfb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyf35kugpbfb\">[32]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Not only will modernized NC3 incorporate ML but there is a real risk of rushed integration with higher risk tolerance than normally accepted.</p><h2>3.2 Modernization</h2><p>Given these pressures to integrate ML with nuclear command, what concrete evidence is there that integration is contemplated within the U.S. defense establishment? Additionally, how might this integration specifically take place within early warning decisions support systems?</p><p>Despite the inherently classified nature of these developments, public&nbsp;statements by US leadership indicate that NC3 modernization could include further automation and AI integration.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn80xfnwib7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn80xfnwib7\">[33]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;When asked about AI and NC3 modernization, former USSTRATCOM Commander General Hyten stated: &nbsp;\u201cI think AI can play an important part.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7fcyoq742p\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7fcyoq742p\">[34]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Former director of the USSTRATCOM NC3 Enterprise Center publication stated the desire and need for AI experts for NC3 modernization.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1svvd8c0pg4\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1svvd8c0pg4\">[35]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This follows statements by former U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis who also expressed an interest in the use of militarized AI and its ability to fundamentally change warfare.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefszoul0xnx1r\"><sup><a href=\"#fnszoul0xnx1r\">[36]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Building off this, &nbsp;\u201cThe U.S. budget for Fiscal Year 2020, for instance, singled out AI as a research and development priority and proposed $850 million of funding for the American AI Initiative.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv0nzhiky8cr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv0nzhiky8cr\">[37]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;China has \u201cdeclared its intentions to lead the world in AI by 2030, estimated to exceed tens of billions of dollars.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref98o2jaq4de\"><sup><a href=\"#fn98o2jaq4de\">[38]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Modernization and integration of AI with NC3 will likely take many different forms over the next decade with over $70 billion going towards command and control and early warning systems as part of the NC3 modernization.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw7pj2nj4s99\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw7pj2nj4s99\">[39]</a></sup></span></p><p>Given these statements and the potential benefits of AI, it is reasonable to assume that efforts to incorporate further AI and automation into the military include NC3.

And yet, detection and analysis of incoming attacks is getting increasingly complicated. Early warning systems must be capable of detecting multiple targets and also discriminating between: type of attack, launch and impact points, validity, and more.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq1kdqorradl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq1kdqorradl\">[42]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;AI could remove the worst aspects of humanity, while providing analysis for mass amounts of data, in a position that is traditionally both mentally taxing and boring for human analysts.&nbsp;This is arguably an important driver behind AI integration as both bias and exhaustion are human limitations that can easily impede good decision making.</p><p>ML systems could effectively replace at least some of the analytical work done by humans who assess early warning information to determine the credibility of a threat. \u201cRecent publications have highlighted the potential for machine learning-based algorithms to provide better discrimination abilities in radar applications. If used in early-warning systems, this could in principle result in fewer false alarms.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8y5let7m05\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8y5let7m05\">[43]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Early warning information is getting progressively complicated with the timeframe to determine the validity of the danger getting smaller.

The predictive forecasting machine in NC3 would also seek patterns that indicate a potential incoming threat&nbsp;by continuously monitoring an immense amount of real world data and calculating their significance to nuclear threats..</p><p>The strategic value of an accurate predictive and preemptive method in nuclear security is invaluable. Rather than reacting and responding to a nuclear strike or a similarly threatening attack, a military power would anticipate their adversaries\u2019 moves and either thoroughly prepare for them, hinder or inhibit them, or take the offensive. AI systems could theoretically offer the safest way to achieve preemption (an already contentious concept) if they can outperform their human counterparts, remain&nbsp;unbiased, and provide a calculated warning or suggestion. Additionally, AI can assess data and bring together different pieces of intelligence in a manner that a human potentially never would.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn7a7qsurhp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn7a7qsurhp\">[53]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course,&nbsp;even if such systems are deployed to assist with strategic decision-making, the question remains whether humans would act solely, or at least primarily, based on their recommendations. At a series of workshops on artificial intelligence and nuclear risk held by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) in 2020, \u201cworkshop participants found it hard to believe that a nuclear-armed state would find such a system reliable enough to initiate a pre-emptive nuclear attack based only on the information that its algorithms produce.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcpkg0u9iuzn\"><sup><a href=\"#fncpkg0u9iuzn\">[54]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Participants believed that states would likely wait for tangible evidence such as early warning system detections &nbsp;to confirm the AI conclusions .<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8pvzyy350td\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8pvzyy350td\">[55]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>I personally question this confidence in the reliability of decision-makers and their ability to wait to confirm the results of this predictive forecasting.&nbsp;First, crisis situations are unpredictable, and emotions running high or the other systems failing could result in less patience than imagined. Second, the human-machine relationship could evolve to a point where trust in machine intelligence is far higher, almost implicit. Finally, waiting for systems such as those used in early warning to confirm the statistical prediction of AI would completely negate the reason for deploying it in the first place.</p><p>ML powered predictive analytics in nuclear command and control could potentially be, or already is being, pursued by militaries. Even if the SIPRI participants are correct that decision-makers will reluctantly follow the ML recommendations, there are nevertheless a myriad of risks that must still be addressed following this integration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>4. Inherent Dangers of Integration</h1><p>This section outlines the risks of integrating ML with nuclear command. It offers an explanation of the contributing factors that result in these risks and also an explanation of the mechanisms - the how-and-what could go wrong and result in actual nuclear use or a significant increase in nuclear use risk. Each issue here presents a problem on its own, while also often working in conjunction with the other outlined problems to magnify the increased chance of inadvertent nuclear use.</p><p>In section 4.1 I outline the technical flaws within AI systems and how they interact with nuclear deterrence and decision making. In section 4.2 I explore how increasing automation could change the human-machine relationship, which stands to alter the decisions-making process of nuclear deterrence. As previously established, <i>any</i>&nbsp;potential changes to decision-making around nuclear weapons demand the utmost scrutiny.&nbsp;</p><h2>4.1 Technical Flaws in AI Technology</h2><p>The problems outlined here are technological hurdles that face current and near-term AI. Some of these seem solvable while others may simply be inherent and unsolvable. Regardless of these hurdles, the current and coming modernization means that integration may occur while these problems still persist. The simple adage that \u2018complexity breeds accidents\u2019 is relevant&nbsp;here. Even with rigorous testing, the coding error rate is often between 0.1 to 0.5 errors per 1000 lines of code.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmkq7xwrmgul\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmkq7xwrmgul\">[56]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Given that luxury automobiles have around 100 million lines of code,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9lm7d9zq0eb\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9lm7d9zq0eb\">[57]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;one can imagine that the amount of code required in AI systems used for command and control would be immense. Errors would be inevitable.</p><p>The nuclear weapon context also has specific implications for looking at technical flaws in AI. It is the paramount example of a \u2018safety critical\u2019 environment. The consequences of failure are at their highest which demands the utmost scrutiny into how decisions are made and what tools are used to aid the process. Additionally, the flaws outlined below would likely become a serious issue in a time of crisis. Periods of inflamed tensions and dangerous rhetoric are when mistakes are most likely. Finally, in critical circumstances, humans would likely have a very limited amount of time, if any, to scrutinize the data or suggestions provided by an AI.</p><h3>4.1.1 The Alignment Problem</h3><p>AI systems alignment, or misalignment, is a key problem facing AI deployment. While typically considered in the context of artificial <i>general </i>intelligence (AGI) development, &nbsp;ML experts struggle to design even modern ML systems that act exactly as intended without behaving even slightly wrong in unexpected and surprising ways.</p><p>Recent work done by Anthropic built on this claim when they found that \u201clarge generative models have an unusual combination of high predictability - model capabilities scale in relation to resources expended on training - and high unpredictability \u2014 specific model capabilities, inputs, and outputs can\u2019t be predicted ahead of time.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvo9trv51bj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvo9trv51bj\">[58]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; It is important to recognize that generally speaking, the impact of technical flaws do not cause the machine to break or fail to work. Rather, the machine does exactly as instructed, but not what is wanted from its programmers. Brian Christian effectively illustrated the&nbsp;\u201calignment problem,\u201d as by describing those who employ AI systems &nbsp;in \u201cthe position of the \u2018sorcerer\u2019s apprentice\u2019: we conjure a force, autonomous but totally compliant, give it a set of instructions, then scramble like mad to stop it once we realize our instructions are imprecise or incomplete.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbfgk17c5brr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbfgk17c5brr\">[59]</a></sup></span></p><p>The following problems fall under the greater issue of misalignment or contribute to it. These specific technical flaws can result in the deployment of ultimately misaligned systems..</p><h3>4.1.2 The \u2018Black Box\u2019 problem</h3><p>This is perhaps the most central problem in the context of nuclear command integration as it creates its own issues while also magnifying the other technical problems. \u2018Black Box\u2019 refers to ML systems being \u201copaque in their functioning, which makes them potentially unpredictable and vulnerable.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs0oib6gj2g\"><sup><a href=\"#fns0oib6gj2g\">[60]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;These systems are somewhat unknowable as \u201cneural nets essentially program themselves\u2026 they often learn enigmatic rules that no human can fully understand.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvvkobzws9td\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvvkobzws9td\">[61]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We can test their outputs, but we don\u2019t really know &nbsp;why or how they reach their conclusions. For all we know, the system is misaligned and either using data incorrectly or measuring the wrong data altogether. Since we don\u2019t understand the system\u2019s inner workings, its behavior can seem odd and completely unexpected, almost alien. Reliability is key in terms of nuclear decision making.</p><p>One example of this problem\u2019s consequences is discussed in a 2016 article from OpenAI describing their efforts to conduct new reinforcement learning (RL) experiments using the game CoastRunner. The team trained the AI to obtain the highest possible score in each level, assuming that this concrete goal would reflect their informal goal for the AI to finish the race. However, the RL agent determined that it could more effectively achieve a high score by simply going around in circles and continually knocking over the same three targets - as shown in the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tlOIHko8ySg\"><u>CoastRunners 7</u></a> video.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj6bx7nd1io\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj6bx7nd1io\">[62]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Despite catching on fire, crashing into a boat, and going the wrong direction, the AI scored 20 percent higher than human players. This perfectly illustrates the Black Box problem: we cannot fully predict its behavior, and we cannot foresee or control its interpretation of our goals. While this is harmless in a video game, this could be catastrophic in a nuclear context. &nbsp;</p><p>The \u2018Black Box\u2019 issue has been recognized by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) as the \u201cdark secret heart of AI\u201d which has acted as a significant hurdle to the military use of ML systems.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0p9alu51ryv9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0p9alu51ryv9\">[63]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This innate opacity is particularly problematic in safety-critical circumstances with short timeframes such as a nuclear crisis. Crises by their very nature are unpredictable: \u201ctesting is vital to building confidence in how autonomous systems will behave in real world environments, but no amount of testing can entirely eliminate the potential for unanticipated behaviors.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefenf3bllws8c\"><sup><a href=\"#fnenf3bllws8c\">[64]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It is important to note that \u201cthere is active research, often called \u2018explainable AI,\u2019 or \u2018interpretability\u2019 to better understand the underlying logic of ML systems.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnknsgxwylwr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnknsgxwylwr\">[65]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, at this time the \u2018Black Box Problem\u2019 remains and may be inherent to ML systems and thus not \u2018solvable\u2019.</p><p>Most importantly, the \u2018black box\u2019 makes it significantly more difficult to address the other technical flaws of AI systems. The need to determine and address AI system \u2018flaws\u2019 seems antithetical to the unknowable nature of these issues. Technical issues can very well remain dormant until they are triggered when the system is already in operation.</p><h3>4.1.3 Brittleness</h3><p>In the face of complex operating environments, machine learning systems often encounter their own brittleness \u2013 &nbsp;the tendency for powerfully intelligent programs to be brought low by slight tweaks or deviations in their data input that they have not been trained to understand.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefl398wbsuzm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnl398wbsuzm\">[66]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;On the technical side, this is known as a \u2018distributional shift\u2019 where ML systems can \u201cmake bad decisions \u2013 particularly silent and unpredictable bad decisions \u2013 when their inputs are very different from the inputs used during training.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefu864sdggfq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnu864sdggfq\">[67]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>In one case, despite a high success rate in the lab, graduate students in California found that the AI system they had trained to consistently beat Atari video games fell apart when they added just one or two random pixels to the screen.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref27usl4m9wa7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn27usl4m9wa7\">[68]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In another case, trainers were able to throw off some of the best AI image classifiers by simply rotating the objects in an image.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5nlz7m73bc6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5nlz7m73bc6\">[69]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This is an unacceptable issue when considering AI employment in an ever-changing real-world environment. Unlike human operators, autonomous ML systems \u201c lack the ability to step outside their instructions and employ \u2018common sense\u2019 to adapt to the situation at hand\u201d.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefy1zk87upmt8\"><sup><a href=\"#fny1zk87upmt8\">[70]</a></sup></span></p><p>The figure below &nbsp;illustrates how easily an adversary could confuse an image classifier by simply adding pixels(invisible to humans) to a picture,drastically changing the AI\u2019s interpretation while it signals evidentiary confidence.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(153, 153, 153);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>Deception of an artificial intelligence by an adversary</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668776496/mirroredImages/BGFk3fZF36i7kpwWM/g66u1iqd4uip3ojbls0f.png\"></p><p>Source: JCN 1/18, Human-Machine Teaming, Page 30</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>While this report does not focus on intentional attempts to deceive ML systems, the ease of this deception effectively demonstrates the concept and gravity of brittleness.</p><p>Indeed, ML systems struggling with brittleness are unprepared and unsuitable to function outside of the lab, let alone in a military setting. War is an atypical situation \u2013 while we can spend a prodigious amount of time training and preparing for it, the \u2018fog of war\u2019 will always lead to unexpected developments and surprises. An ML system would likely have a hard time adapting to new situations, and even if it was possible, taking the time to \u201cadapt\u201d could result in serious costs.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdjd1jbsys4a\"><sup><a href=\"#fndjd1jbsys4a\">[71]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;They would be held to extreme standards, as the need for accuracy and safety in the military context is unmatched. This is far more relevant in safety-critical nuclear security. We can imagine the impermissible consequences of a brittle AI system either failing to provide accurate information in a nuclear security context, or worse, providing inaccurate information with high confidence, leading to unwarranted decisions and actions by trusting human operators.</p><p>This vulnerability is compounded by inadequate data sets, resulting in even more unreliable systems.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefunljmbuy4tn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnunljmbuy4tn\">[72]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This is especially true in the nuclear security sphere, where so much of the training data is simulated<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref401ivovqe3h\"><sup><a href=\"#fn401ivovqe3h\">[73]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Although there are extensive records associated with the launch of older ballistic missiles, newer, less tested models require the use of simulation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsgi55pyjm1\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsgi55pyjm1\">[74]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The lack of data in terms of real-world offensive nuclear use is undoubtedly fortunate for the world, but it nevertheless means that much of the data involved in training machine learning programs for NC3 systems will be artificially simulated. Even real-world data is often insufficient to train ML systems for real-world environments, so training on simulated data leaves systems woefully unprepared for deployment in military operating environments. Despite the best efforts to ensure that simulated data is accurate and robust it will always be an imperfect, short-sighted imitation of world events.Therefore, when a ML system encounters even slightly unprecedented, real-world data, it it may be enough to throw it off track, with or without anyone noticing.&nbsp;</p><p>Watching AlphaGoZero play the game of Go has been described as \u201dwatching an alien, a superior being, a creature from the future, or a god play.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2onkmxrufri\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2onkmxrufri\">[75]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The program has the same goal as human players, but the way it achieves them - the actions it takes to get there - can be \u201calmost impossible to comprehend.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjasiuz9f8yd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjasiuz9f8yd\">[76]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It may seem obvious that an AI system is not human, but its inherently inhuman nature matters more than it may first appear, and should never be forgotten, underestimated, or overlooked. This is linked to the \u2018Black Box\u2019 problem outlined earlier. We don\u2019t truly know how or why an AI does what it does. We can see its output, but its reasons or justifications remain a mystery and should never be entirely trusted.</p><p>This issue of trusting the output of ML systems is further by the fact that these systems can be confident in their output even if they are wrong. Give a dog classifier a picture of a cat and it will tell&nbsp;you it's a Corgi with 99% confidence. Not only can systems be wrong but they can be wrong while telling you they are right with a high degree of confidence. This largely stems from the problem of brittleness as encountering unrecognized data often results in misinterpretation by the ML system as it attempts to categorize the data within the boundaries it does understand. &nbsp;Therefore, not only is it hard to identify when ML systems are not working as expected, but their degree of confidence may engender unwarranted trust in the machine.</p><p>AI systems in early warning or predictive forecasting would face immense, complex tasks. There is a very real chance that these machines would be brittle enough to fail at its desired performance outside the laboratory setting.</p><h3>4.1.4 Human Bias in the Machine&nbsp;</h3><p>One of the&nbsp;main arguments supporting the potential integration of ML systems with nuclear command and control states that decision-making processes stand to benefit from eliminating human error and bias. However, ironically, AI systems themselves are built and trained with human bias present, which clouds their own decision-making abilities.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6ls23ysbmy7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6ls23ysbmy7\">[77]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>The code and algorithms that form the foundation of \u2018objective\u2019 and autonomous ML systems are written by humans - coders, developers, programmers, engineers - and it is also humans who train the program to run according to their interests and expectations. However well meaning, these humans unintentionally integrate human bias into their work; it is inevitable. Moreover, AI becomes further biased when it is trained using historical data, which is a product of its circumstances. For example: \u201cmachine learning algorithms designed to aid in criminal risk assessments\u2026 [are learning] racial bias from historical data, which reflects racial biases in the American criminal justice system.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwuhty4uqnrl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwuhty4uqnrl\">[78]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This conclusion was reinforced when a study \u201cof a commonly used tool to identify criminal recidivism found that the algorithm was 45 percent more likely to give higher risk scores to black than to white defendants\u201d.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuih93pgzwik\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuih93pgzwik\">[79]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Another example of human bias occurred when Amazon used an AI system to filter r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of potential job candidates. Evidently, the system was found to have a significant bias toward male applicants, presumably because it trained by observing desirable patterns in r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of previously successful employees, most of which were male.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoxo0ugf1t6i\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoxo0ugf1t6i\">[80]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As a result, the AI determined that gender was a significant factor of candidate success and learned to place a higher value on male candidates. This not only reflected the male dominated nature of the industry at the time, but also perpetuated it.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefiu5d1ybd8zg\"><sup><a href=\"#fniu5d1ybd8zg\">[81]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>These examples illustrate that human bias can become integrated into AI systems by humans and/or training data, and then it is further ingrained and perpetuated by the AI system until it is detected. So, even in a best-case scenario where a ML system accurately interprets quality, relevant data and overcomes brittleness or other technical issues, it can still over- or under-evaluate the information it is assessing due to its trained human biases.</p><p>One can easily imagine similar problems occurring in AI systems trained to observe the actions of adversarial nations for the purpose of early warning or predictive forecasting. Human bias could sneak into the system, and the data relating to certain actors or variables could cease to accurately reflect what is occurring in the real world. In that case, extra weight could be given to standard activity, making a relatively normal action appear threatening. This could result in an AI warning of a potential incoming nuclear attack.&nbsp;A U.S. president and military commanders would be expecting a balanced, fair calculus when in truth the machine is perpetuating the kind of bias that could lead to catastrophic miscalculation and further the risk of responding to false positives.&nbsp;</p><p>These concerns become all the more pertinent during crisis situations such as the current ongoing conflict in Ukraine. A hypothetical ML integration system designed to assess the probability of Russian aggression against the West could act in unpredictable ways and give faulty information. The previously mentioned issues surrounding brittleness and the \u2018Black Box\u2019 could lead the system to misinterpret signating information such as troop movement, launch indicators, chatter, etc. A trained bias could then compound this misinterpretation, over-valuing the possibility of Russian aggression. For example, the system could perceive certain rhetoric or troop deployment as overly significant indicators of an imminent attack. While we hope that even in these cases military planners would review the &nbsp;information and hesitate to act on it, I don\u2019t believe one should so easily discount the power of confirmation bias or the chaos and \u2018fog of war\u2019 in a crisis scenario. Seemingly accurate information provided during an emergency could easily be acted on.</p><h2>4.2 Problems with Human-Machine Interaction</h2><p>This section explores the impact more automation could have on the human element of the machine-human team. This involves both how we treat the AI and also what the use of such intelligent machines means for our own thought processes.</p><p>Understanding why something has <i>not</i>&nbsp;happened is an inherently arduous task. Determining why nuclear weapons have not been used, whether it is due to more normative factors like the nuclear taboo or factors linked to structural realism such as deterrence, is difficult. In all likelihood a complex combination of factors have contributed to the non-use of nuclear weapons since WW2. Nonetheless, I would argue&nbsp;a key factor has been human <i>uncertainty </i>and our <i>lack </i>of knowledge. How we make decisions matters.</p><p>Human limitations and emotions, despite all their dangers, seem to have played a key role in preventing nuclear weapon use. The consequences of potential mistakes are so great at the nuclear level that individuals facing decisions at key moments often chose to risk their own lives and their teams rather than deploy nuclear weapons because they were not convinced of what appeared to be an incoming attack.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk74u0oisduk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk74u0oisduk\">[82]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This is not to downplay their courage or training, but when facing seemingly reliable information of a nuclear attack, these individuals decided not to act when others may have, and in some cases almost did. &nbsp;Whether it was intuition, reasonging, fear, guilt, panic, or a combination of these and other very human reactions, their decision to question the situation and hold back on reacting may have saved millions, maybe billions of lives.</p><p>Between 1945-2017 there have been \u201c37 different known episodes [linked to close inadvertent use], including 25 alleged nuclear crises and twelve technical incidents.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefptt9a5l38pk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnptt9a5l38pk\">[83]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;On the surface, it appears that the systems designed to prevent nuclear use worked. It has even been argued that \u201cthose in charge of nuclear weapons have been responsible, prudent, and careful\u2026 [and] \u2018close calls\u2019 have ranged in fact from \u2018not-so-close\u2019 to \u2018very distant.\u2019\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft3ywn1e8kfe\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt3ywn1e8kfe\">[84]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;While I would be far more hesitant to put such strong faith in the systems designed to prevent inadvertent use, the fact remains that we haven\u2019t used the weapons since the end of WW2. Luck may play a role here, but too many years with too many \u2018close calls\u2019 have occurred for us to completely discount the nuclear decision making systems. As the current decision-makers, we must be doing something right. One&nbsp;part of this success preventing inadvertent use is explicit mistrust of computer&nbsp;warning systems. In both the Petrov and NORAD cases, computers demonstrated high confidence of incoming attacks, and human operators didn\u2019t trust these false alarms. Their doubt and skepticism was paramount.&nbsp;Regardless of one\u2019s stance in this discussion, any evolving technology that could even potentially change how nuclear decisions are made demands thorough scrutiny as there are a number of unfortunate ways the situation could become more dangerous as a result.</p><p>While the previous section looked at technical flaws within ML systems and how they could impact the quality and reliability of their outputs, this section looks at how increased automation impacts the human element. This includes issues such as an over reliance on ML systems, the increasing speed of warfare and AI systems, and the growth of misplaced confidence in military commanders when backed by powerful machine intelligences. Each issue will be outlined and their possible impact on nuclear decision making explored. The eventual conclusion is that integrating ML with NC3 could result in a paradigm shift in nuclear decision-making. &nbsp;</p><h3>4.2.1 Automation Bias</h3><p>One key issue is the development of automation bias \u2013 the \u201cphenomenon whereby humans over-rely on a system and assume that the information provided by the system is correct.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref09m1y1r0ohc7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn09m1y1r0ohc7\">[85]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Bias also exists in the other direction with anover-mistrust of machines known as the \u201ctrust gap\u201d.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkoyfzx2dd2p\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkoyfzx2dd2p\">[86]</a></sup></span></p><p>Michael Horowitiz suggests there are three stages of trust towards artificial intelligence technologies:</p><ol><li>\u2018Technology Hype\u2019, or \u201cinflated expectations of how a given technology will change the world\u201d</li><li>The \u2018Trust Gap\u2019, \u201cor the inability to trust machines to do the work of people, in addition to the unwillingness to deploy or properly use these systems\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref74d2fefpi2a\"><sup><a href=\"#fn74d2fefpi2a\">[87]</a></sup></span></li><li>\u2018Overconfidence\u2019 or automation bias.</li></ol><p>The claim that humans progressively move through these stages was supported when \u201cpsychologists\u2026 demonstrated that humans are slow to trust the information derived from algorithms (e.g., radar data and facial recognition software), but as the reliability of the information improves so the propensity to trust machines increases \u2013 even in cases where evidence emerges that suggests a machine\u2019s judgment is incorrect.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0sjdos35pzr9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0sjdos35pzr9\">[88]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Automation bias has \u201cbeen recorded in a variety of areas, including medical decision-support systems, flight simulators, air traffic control, and even \u201cmaking friendly-enemy&nbsp;engagement decisions\u201d in shooting-related tasks.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjbj88b0pz0h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjbj88b0pz0h\">[89]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Given the multitude of technical flaws outlined earlier, one can imagine the problem with an overreliance on ML systems. And yet, the \u2018trust gap\u2019 is also problematic and should not be adopted as a desirable stance. Instead, there should be strong cognizance of the human tendency to trust the machine to the point of assuming it is always correct or more capable than its human counterpart.</p><p>In the context of inadvertent nuclear use, automation bias is a substantial problem when considering integrating ML with NC3 because it exacerbates both the time crunch of a crisis scenario and the \u2018black box\u2019 problem. Human operators would be unable to check the math behind the AI\u2019s decision, nor would they have time to even try. Additionally, \u201coperators might therefore be more likely to over-trust the system and not see a need to verify the information that it provides.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflyaq7plvsd8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlyaq7plvsd8\">[90]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Not only does this increase the likelihood that the aforementioned technical flaws of ML systems will go unnoticed, it also represents an effective pre-delegation of authority to these machine intelligences. Automation bias, and the \u201cunwarranted confidence in and reliance on machines\u2026 in the pre-delegation of the use of force during a crisis or conflict, let alone during nuclear brinkmanship, might inadvertently compromise states\u2019 ability to control escalation.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftlcblh4xncl\"><sup><a href=\"#fntlcblh4xncl\">[91]</a></sup></span></p><p>The pre-delegation of authority and automation bias are most evident in the Patriot fratricides (or friendly fire incidents) during the 2003 Iraq War. Three out of twelve successful engagements involved fratricides. This included \u201ctwo incidents in which Patriots shot down friendly aircraft, killing the pilots, and a third incident in which an F-16 fired on a Patriot.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa7xzn132z16\"><sup><a href=\"#fna7xzn132z16\">[92]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In the cases where the Patriots fired, and caused the fratricides, the AI guided machines were wrong, and in trusting them their operators succumbed to automation bias. In both cases, the errors in the Patriot systems harken back to the brittleness technical issue. In the first, the system misidentified a friendly fighter as a missile<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvotensjmteb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvotensjmteb\">[93]</a></sup></span>, and the second instance involved the Patriot systems tracking an incoming \u201cghost\u201d missile that wasn\u2019t there. Unfortunately, a nearby friendly fighter was in the wrong place at the wrong time and the Patriot\u2019s seeker locked on and killed the pilots.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq49jfai2m7n\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq49jfai2m7n\">[94]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, the AI driven systems were wrong and people were killed, illustrating that grave \u201cproblems can arise when human users don't anticipate these moments of brittleness\u201d.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp9t3ocw31xg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp9t3ocw31xg\">[95]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;One aspect of this is ensuring that automation does not result in the undue pre-delegation of authority to a ML enhanced system. Ensuring that the faults and strengths of these machines are understood is critical for their safe use.</p><h3>4.2.2 Machine Speed</h3><p>As previously stated, a key potential benefit to increasing the automation of military systems is that they can perform their assigned functions at blinding speeds that drastically outpace human operators. The risk here is that this increased processing speed could push \u201cthe speed of war to \u2018machine-speed\u2019 because autonomous systems can process information and make decisions more quickly than humans.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrgrv2qwgys\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrgrv2qwgys\">[96]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Aggressive reactions and decisions could take place in nano-seconds - &nbsp;dubbed \u2018hyperwar\u2019 in the West and \u2018battlefield singularity\u2019 in China.</p><p>Thomas Schelling\u2019s concern that \u201cthe premium on haste\u201d is \u201cthe greatest source of danger that peace will explode into all out war\u201d&nbsp;is echoed here when discussing machine speed and nuclear decision making. There is a concern that, in an effort to maintain battlefield advantage, states will pursue machine speed in their military operations and risk losing control of their machines, effectively pre-delegating authority to their AI systems to act in their stead. As of now, these systems are brittle and flawed, lacking the ability to think critically or work outside of the box. They are \u201cset up to rapidly act on advantages they see developing on the battlefield\u201d and could easily \u201cmiss de-escalatory signals,\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1kuqeg9ueed\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1kuqeg9ueed\">[97]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;echoing R.K.

Intimidating as that is, the reality of modern warfare&nbsp;could mean that working towards this level of haste may be necessary in order to maintain a competitive deterrence system. Other modern developments - such as the advent of hypersonic weapons or the potential for an offshore attack - have already shaved down a nuclear weapons strike to mere minutes. While distance matters even in an automated world,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefamj4l0hhm25\"><sup><a href=\"#fnamj4l0hhm25\">[99]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;a lightning fast first strike can only be deterred when a response at the same speed is feasible. &nbsp;Nonetheless, even if the need for speed in nuclear deterrence is unavoidable in our current security climate, it is imperative that we understand these problems and devise solutions or mitigating processes to prevent inadvertent nuclear use.</p><h3>4.2.3 Out-of-the-loop</h3><p>Machine Speed is a key aspect of automation that affects nuclear decision making, but it often does so by impacting the placement of the human supervision element in the decision making loop. As outlined in the below image, \u201cthere are three types of human supervision: a human can be in-the-loop, meaning a human will make final decisions; the human can be on-the-loop, supervising the system and data being generated; or the human can be out-of-the loop for full autonomy.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0ciz57sppqlr\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0ciz57sppqlr\">[100]</a></sup></span></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(255, 255, 255);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Roles for Humans and Machines in Decision Making</strong><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668776496/mirroredImages/BGFk3fZF36i7kpwWM/fmdc827ck1ybjoovznjy.png\"></p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>The primary problem is that \u201cAI systems operating at machine-speed could push the pace of combat to a point where the actions of machine [actors] surpass the (cognitive and physical) ability of human decision-makers to control (or even comprehend) events.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwziwkemyhrl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwziwkemyhrl\">[101]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;One proposed method for addressing the flaws of ML systems is ensuring that a human operator remains within-the-loop and able to control or stop&nbsp;automated military systems from acting in a manner that is unaligned with their objectives. However, as Andreas Matthias explained, any impactful human control is likely \u201cimpossible when the machine has an informational advantage over the operator ... [or] when the machine cannot be controlled by a human in real-time due to its processing speed and the multitude of operational variables.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwiwqkakfahi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwiwqkakfahi\">[102]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A 2020 RAND report explored the question: \u2018How might deterrence be affected by the proliferation of AI and autonomous systems?\u2019 by constructing and experimenting with a wargame to simulate how actors would make decisions in a conflict if automation became far more prevalent. A key insight from their experimentation was that \u201cthe differences in the ways two sides configure their human versus machine decisionmaking and their manned versus unmanned presence could affect escalatory dynamics during a crisis.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuoyfbbfzfnb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuoyfbbfzfnb\">[103]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The following figure demonstrates that escalation is affected by whether the machine or the human makes the decision. (The RAND report also considered the effects of humans remaining physically present at the outset of conflict scenarios, but that is outside the scope of this report). A key takeaway here was that escalation was harder to control or prevent when automated machines were the primary decision-makers.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcm49h5j3aq4\"><sup><a href=\"#fncm49h5j3aq4\">[104]</a></sup></span></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668776496/mirroredImages/BGFk3fZF36i7kpwWM/of6ckfbtdosughyvbumy.png\"></p><p><i>Note</i>. Reprinted from \u201cDeterrence in the Age of Thinking Machines,\u201d by Wong et al, RAND Corporation, 27 January 2020, page 64.</p><p>Human-machine warfighting and \u2018teaming\u2019 has been progressively undertaken and its importance and impact will increase as it is attempted in more scenarios. The further humans are removed from the loop, the more reliant we become on possibly faulty technology that does not make decisions like humans do. This can become a strength but, as already discussed, it can easily become a danger instead. Nonetheless, many influential figures are still not opposed to pushing the human element further out. Gen. Terrence J. O\u2019Shaughnessy, commander of NORAD stated that \u201cWhat we have to get away from is \u2026 \u2018human in-the-loop,\u2019 or sometimes \u2018the human is the loop.\u2019\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7o36phtezcn\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7o36phtezcn\">[105]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;By doing so we can attempt to leverage the speed and power of automated systems while theoretically&nbsp;still ensuring that human hands guide the ML power technology. Regardless of how we manage this change in the human-machine relationship, the further humans are taken from the loop, the more the risk increases that a technical flaw will impact nuclear decision making. The question remains; at what point will the inflexibility of these systems, and the resulting escalatory potential, outweigh the advantages in speed that they offer? &nbsp;</p><p>This possible gap in reliability is a clear problem when deploying ML systems in complex safety critical environments like nuclear command. However, this almost alien decision further complicates issues due to the general human desire to defer to such machines as though they are human. Work done in this area has demonstrated that \u201chumans are predisposed to treat machines (i.e., automated decision support aids) that share task-orientated responsibilities as \u2018team members,\u2019 and in many cases exhibit similar in-group favoritism as humans do with one another.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhmudzfaq9w5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhmudzfaq9w5\">[106]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In fact, work by James Johnson showed that instead of constraining the brittleness or flaws of ML systems, keeping a human in the loop &nbsp;can \u201clead to similar psychological effects that occur when humans share responsibilities with other humans, whereby \u2018[[social loafing]]\u2019 arises \u2013 the tendency of humans to seek ways to reduce their own effort when working redundantly within a group than when they work individually on a task.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyztxvdsuq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyztxvdsuq\">[107]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, however powerful and useful, the decision-making process of ML enhanced systems can result in unexpected deviations or instances of misalignment. Despite their inherently inhuman nature, humans have the tendency to treat ML systems as colleagues rather than instruments, and expect human-like, aligned responses from them.</p><h3>4.2.4 Misplaced Confidence</h3><p>Similar to automation bias, or at least its outcome, misplaced confidence occurs when a system that seems superior and capable of providing a military advantage can create a sense of confidence in military leaders that encourages them to take aggressive, risky, or drastic action. This is also linked to the importance of uncertainty in nuclear decision making.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefaim3lc6rcwi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnaim3lc6rcwi\">[108]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>An overzealous commander believing themselves to have perfect information along with the advantage of machine speed might act aggressively if they believed the need was great enough or the chance of reprisal was low enough, thinking that the strength of the AI system would guarantee a successful operation. This problem is twofold; not only could overconfidence risk increasing the likelihood of aggressive actions in general, but it would also make &nbsp;a commander more susceptible to automation bias. Both are inherently escalatory and raise the risk of inadvertent nuclear weapons use. This kind of \u201coverconfidence, caused or exacerbated by automation bias in the ability of AI systems to predict escalation and gauge intentions \u2013 and deter and counter threats more broadly \u2013 could embolden a state (especially in asymmetric information situations) to contemplate belligerent or provocative behavior; it might otherwise have thought too risky\u201d.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjr62dtluoln\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjr62dtluoln\">[109]</a></sup></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>5. Analysis of Potential Solutions</h1><p>The following section covers solutions designed to address the problems outlined in this report. They are not necessarily unique to the issue of integration, nor are they being suggested for the first time in this report. Nonetheless, here they are evaluated through the combined lens of nuclear strategy and ML technology. In doing so&nbsp;I aim to continue this discussion by adding my thoughts on what could work best and how funders could use this assessment to aid them in nuclear or nearterm AI risk reduction efforts.</p><p>In general, I find the first two possibilities in 5.1 unsatisfactory as they fail to take into consideration the wide range of implications of the technical and psychological issues around AI integration on nuclear security. The three solutions in 5.2 are more likely to be successful as they take into consideration the fact that we may not fix the technical flaws within current AI technology. They either pursue stopgap measures to prevent inadvertent use or they attempt to address the psychological side of the problem. In doing so, they work with factors that we can control: policy and people.&nbsp;In 5.3 I present the complicated solution of keeping humans in the loop which, while impactful to pursue, cannot address the problems outlined here by itself.</p><h2>5.1 Unsatisfactory Solutions</h2><h3>5.1.1 Do not integrate AI with Nuclear Command at all</h3><p>While this solution would have a high degree of impact on preventing inadvertent use as a result of ML integration, it is not tractable due to the pressures to increase automation with NC3.</p><p>At this time, no state or actor is advocating for completely autonomous nuclear weapons systems where the human element is completely out of the loop. This is important, and more states should follow the UK and U.S\u2019s examples of committing to this publicly in official strategy documents. Nevertheless the temptation may remain \u201cfor countries that feel relatively insecure about their nuclear arsenal, the potential benefits [of full automation] in terms of deterrence capability may outweigh the risks.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi9z8uboqgqe\"><sup><a href=\"#fni9z8uboqgqe\">[110]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless,&nbsp;not integrating AI into any stages of NC3 at all is not a realistic option. As argued in the modernization section, it is extremely likely that the U.S. government is already pursuing some degree of AI integration at some stages, rendering this suggestion irrelevant. Additionally, there are real benefits to integration at some stages and this should be at least explored. Improving one\u2019s early warning system, if done correctly could help mitigate the dangers faced by nuclear weapons on the road to disarmament.</p><p>Beside providing better analysis, AI integration could help ensure robust communication in nuclear command that helps reduce uncertainty during a crisis.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9bx1vsxhcx\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9bx1vsxhcx\">[111]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Additionally, AI run cyber security could help secure key systems related to deterrence<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqhwn1vtc88r\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqhwn1vtc88r\">[112]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and the safer and less vulnerable these weapons are, the less aggressive state may need to be. This is the same reason submarine based nuclear weapons are often touted as the current pinnacle of deterrence. They cannot be found and thus can reliably ensure a second-strike. Therefore, one can generally act with a greater degree of confidence and with less aggression because of their deterrent work. AI run cyber security could hopefully do the same, and in all honestly may simply be required in the face of AI run offensive cyber actions. Given the security climate, not pursuing AI integration could result in a lopsided or asymmetrical environment that itself encourages the kind of nuclear crisis or coercion that increases the risk of nuclear use.</p><p>There is still a lot of value in criticizing what appears to be an inevitable policy. Advocating for the elimination of nuclear silos and landlocked nuclear weapons may be difficult for a number of reasons but researchers and activists should not necessarily stop. The same can be said about advocating for zero ML integration to NC3. Nonetheless, I personally do not suggest this solution for funders and grantmakers attempting to maximize impact per dollar spent.</p><h3>5.1.2 Improve AI to eliminate technical problems</h3><p>Attempts to \u2018just make it better\u2019 may fix some of the technical problems eventually but the perfect system will never exist. While solving key technical issues would have a large degree of impact, and many AI researchers are exploring this route, it seems like an unlikely achievement. This in and of itself isn\u2019t a failure. Humans are not perfect either, but problems like brittleness or trained AI bias are especially dangerous because they could rear their heads suddenly and without warning and because of the \u2018black box\u2019 issue we might not be able to routinely check for these problems nor will we always be able to test for them.</p><p>\u2018Normal Accident Theory\u2019 \u201csuggests that: as system complexity increases, the risk of accidents increases as well and that some level of accidents are inevitable in complex systems.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxwt5pcuaqij\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxwt5pcuaqij\">[113]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Therefore,the risk of accidents in complex defence systems that incorporate autonomy may therefore be higher.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp4jiztvm00p\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp4jiztvm00p\">[114]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The reality is that \u201ceven with simulations that test millions of scenarios, fully testing all the possible scenarios a complex autonomous system might encounter is effectively impossible. There are simply too many possible interactions between the system and its environment and even within the system itself.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw2isq8emz9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw2isq8emz9\">[115]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, even if we implement safety features designed to stop accidents from occurring, it is often these very features that result in deadly errors and accidents. Two recent examples of this include Lion Air Flight 610 on October 29, 2018, and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10, 2019. There was a safety feature that resulted in the planes crashing.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrn5qytr3u2\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrn5qytr3u2\">[116]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The point is that not only are accidents normal and difficult to prevent in complex systems, but that even attempts to combat them can result&nbsp;in accidents themselves.</p><p>Perhaps the math works out that humans fail catastrophically more often than AI would (even if the AI is brittle or misaligned). Nonetheless, when combined with the issues forming in the human-machine relationship, the dangers of AI integration could go undiagnosed due to the implicit trust that the AI system is objectively better than its human counterparts. If automation increases and more nuclear decision-making is pre-delegated to machine systems, these problems will grow and risk inadvertent use in this safety critical environment.</p><p>Additionally, the consequences of human failure can be mitigated by human uncertainty and the supervision and control of peers and superiors. Throughout our entire history, humans worked together. Switching from human to AI is a clear paradigm shift for both decision making and safety culture, drastically shifting our reactions and approaches &nbsp;to problems in crisis.</p><p>This is not an outright rejection of ML in NC3 but rather a claim that we cannot rely on technological improvements to remove the possibility of accidents.</p><h2>5.2 Potentially Beneficial Solutions</h2><h3>5.2.1 Update Nuclear Posture to Reflect Changing Paradigm</h3><p>One of the greatest hurdles to mitigating the challenge of ML in NC3 is the fact that the technical problems discussed above may simply be unsolvable in the near-term. Approaching this problem from a non-technical angle may allow us to bypass the inherent technical flaws within ML systems by mitigating the dangers without necessarily resolving these technical problems. Specifically, policy can be restructured to mitigate the potential problem of ML integration with NC3.</p><p>Although technical solutions may be developed to lessen the impact of these limitations, the sheer complexity of AI machines and the pressure to integrate them with military systems mean that the problems these technical issues pose must be addressed now. The heavy incentive for states to start incorporating the technology as soon as possible means they may have to accept and implement imperfect systems into critical roles in nuclear command. In the end, however, the real problem is not the AI per se, but a rushed integration of AI with nuclear systems that does&nbsp;not fully take into consideration the heightened risks posed by the technical limitations of current AI technology and the complexity of nuclear security.</p><p>One solution is adopting a nuclear policy that expands the decision-making time for launching a nuclear weapon, such as by moving away from launch-on-warning (LOW) strategies or by \u201cde-alerting\u201d silo- based intercontinental ballistic missiles. The LOW strategy keeps missiles alert and constantly ready to fire so they can be launched before&nbsp;the first impact of an incoming attack. &nbsp;By legally increasing the appropriate amount of time to ready nuclear weapons for use, these types of policies would allow leaders more opportunity to assess the nuclear security-related information provided by the AI. In a sense, this would forcibly elongate the \u2018loop\u2019 so that regardless of lightning fast AI assessments, a specific no-first-use policy and a restriction on a rapid launch could lead to a less dangerous AI system or even make it effectively impossible for inadvertent use to occur.</p><p>Creating shifts in nuclear posture that increase decisions making time or move away from LOW strategies will result in innate advantages for reducing nuclear risk before we even consider their influence on ML integration with nuclear command. The risks of LOW can be broken down into two categories: the intense pressure under which the decisions are made, and the often-questionable quality of the information used to make decisions. As the many close calls and cases of near nuclear use demonstrate, LOW is already a dangerous prospect whose instance of responding before impact allows for the possibility of inadvertent use and catastrophe. The idea of moving away from a LOW posture is not a new idea but it made all the more relevant when considering the potential dangers associated with ML integration with nuclear command systems.</p><p>Ultimately, integrating ML into nuclear command would act as a compounding factor or threat multiplier for inadvertent use if done improperly. On the one hand, a working ML system could provide better information faster than our current systems do. This would rescue the chance of inadvertent use and potentially increase the amount of time decision makers have to determine whether they will respond or whether it is a false alarm. This could help reduce the risks associated with LOW strategies. However, while possible, these benefits rely on a number of assumptions regarding the ability of incredibly complex systems to work under immense pressure.</p><p>The risks outlined in this report should give one pause when considering the helpfulness of ML systems for reducing nuclear risk. This is not to say they have no place in risk reduction \u2014 on the contrary, finding the proper balance for safe AI integration should be pursued in the quest for nuclear risk reduction. Nonetheless, increasing automation within the systems that are integral to managing a LOW nuclear doctrine means potentially falling prey to the various technical and human-machine relationship issues outlined in this document. While we may be able to address some of these problems through technical or training based means, changing policy to make it nearly impossible to launch nuclear weapons within a few minutes could effectively eliminate the greatest risks associated with ML integration. While the danger of inadvertent use would still exist, it would be drastically reduced by this kind of a shift in posture. &nbsp;Still, it should be noted that moving away from Launch-On-Warning is unlikely as there is heavy domestic political pressure to maintain ICBMs and other more static nuclear forces.</p><p>An alternative solution is the commitment to move away from LOW during periods of peace and stability. Originally proposed by Podvig, this idea encourages nuclear weapon states to \u201cintroduce a policy of keeping their forces off alert most of the time\u201d.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe04fqrs43j\"><sup><a href=\"#fne04fqrs43j\">[117]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This would help reduce the chance of peacetime miscalculations. While escalation in times of stability is not as likely as it is in crisis scenarios, Barrett, Baum, and Hostetler demonstrated that half of all false alarm cases occurred during periods of low tension.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwd4dxxmaesc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwd4dxxmaesc\">[118]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Crises are still far more dangerous overall as half of all false alarms and inadvertent use scenarios occur during a comparably tiny amount of time when compared to periods of lower-tension. Nonetheless, this approach would effectively end peacetime inadvertent use risk and present a possible confidence-building-measure that could help increase crisis stability by enabling both informal and more structured talks. Additionally, it would signal the universal desire for safety and stability and a general lack of &nbsp;interest in conducting a first strike with these weapons.</p><p>And yet, changing nuclear doctrine is no easy feat even in the best of environments. Given the current war in Ukraine and revamped tensions over Taiwan, advocating for changes to doctrine at this time is perhaps more difficult than ever before. Successfully updating posture could effectively negate the risk of inadvertent use, but the tractability of this is incredibly low in the current international security climate.</p><h3>5.2.2 Update and ensure adequate training</h3><p>How we train the human element will be crucial to ensuring the safe integration of the human-machine team. This suggestion covers the training of all human components, whatever role they may play in the decisions making or support process.</p><p>Paradoxically, the more autonomous a machine, the more training is required for the humans involved with it. This training needs to reflect functionality as well as the machine-human relationship and the inherent flaws within the technology.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref24vjhaiki5j\"><sup><a href=\"#fn24vjhaiki5j\">[119]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; In order to maintain the benefits of \u2018human uncertainty\u2019 in nuclear decision making, training should embed a healthy degree of skepticism or doubt toward the militarized AI in its human operators. Properly done, this balanced training will avoid creating a \u2018trust gap\u2019 or an &nbsp;automation bias by highlighting both the potential benefits and risks of ML integration.</p><p>With the understanding that AI is flawed, perhaps the next crisis will reflect the one in the 1980s where Stanislav Petrov doubted an early warning system telling him, with the highest level of confidence, that there was an incoming U.S. nuclear attack.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk47h2om9cl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk47h2om9cl\">[120]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Petrov\u2019s&nbsp;uncertainty saved the day. Conversely, the operators of the 2003 Patriot systems that killed friendly aircraft were found to have a culture of \u201ctrusting the system without question.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflek2kbscyx8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlek2kbscyx8\">[121]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;To properly manage the flaws of powerful ML systems, people need to be trained to understand \u201cthe boundaries of the system - what it can and cannot do. The user can either steer the system away from situations outside the bounds of its design or knowingly account for and accept the risks of failure.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuydwospgm6a\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuydwospgm6a\">[122]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Both the Petrov case and the Patriot fratricides outline the importance of instilling the proper amount of confidence, and skepticism, when training operators of automated military systems.</p><p>&nbsp;A different but linked idea is creating organizational and bureaucratic solutions to address the technical problem of militarized AI. The SUBSAFE program is a \u201ccontinuous process of quality assurance and quality control applied across the entire submarine\u2019s life cycle.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmm1fheypr4b\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmm1fheypr4b\">[123]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Between 1915 and 1963, the U.S. lost an average of one submarine every three years to non-combat losses; since the program was established in 1963 not a single SUBSAFE certified submarine has been lost.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg5ismzfn97s\"><sup><a href=\"#fng5ismzfn97s\">[124]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This is even more impressive when considering both the increased complexity of modern submarines and their operating environments. This seemingly counteracts Normal Accident Theory.</p><p>Perhaps this kind of safety culture can act as a model for handling militarized AI systems. According to Paul Scharre, these lessons are already applied to the operation of the navy Aegis combat system, which was not trusted by its human operators.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8xbbnrgymf8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8xbbnrgymf8\">[125]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;They understood that \u201cthe automation was powerful and they respected it - they even recognized there was a place for it - but that didn\u2019t mean they were surrendering their human decision-making to the machine.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7u0mj0j4o2i\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7u0mj0j4o2i\">[126]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The teachings from the SUBSAFE program and modern Aegis system act as key examples for how we can instill a healthy degree of skepticism in any instances where ML is integrated with NC3. One can respect both<i>&nbsp;</i>the power <i>and</i>&nbsp;the flaws of automated military technology.</p><p>This suggestion will have low to medium impact as where and how the training occurs matter greatly, and errors will still occur, but it is highly tractable as militaries have a vested interest and desire to ensure their operators have any relevant training.</p><h3>5.2.3 Confidence Building Measures</h3><p>Confidence building measures (CBM) could create international norms around appropriate AI integration and reduce uncertainty between nations on acceptable military use of AI.</p><p>CBMs&nbsp;could start as unilateral declarations that nuclear launch decisions will always remain under human control. That first step could bring other powers to the table and potentially result in similar declarations if these CBMs align with their strategic interest. The UK government has already made this declaration in their June 2022 Defence Artificial Intelligence Strategy.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref27sm1ksdfq5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn27sm1ksdfq5\">[127]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Additionally, the U.S. government recently followed suit in their 2022 National Defence Strategy.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp69qmowy8sq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp69qmowy8sq\">[128]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;While we can\u2019t know the exact implications of this statement, this kind of action is conducive to reducing tensions and uncertainty.</p><p>Going further, an international dialogue about AI integration with NC3 would build confidence and also allow states to share common concerns and determine accepted best practices. Recent work looking at the viability of controlling militarized AI through international measures and norms saw \u201cthat while past strategies to contain and control nuclear weapons cannot and should not be taken as blueprints, these historical lessons remain essential in designing any future efforts to responsibly contain military AI.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflgo72cinpxq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlgo72cinpxq\">[129]</a></sup></span></p><p>The Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty was a key example of a de-escalatory CBM that allowed both Cold War powers to demonstrate their commitment to maintaining stability. By agreeing to limit the development of missile defense systems, both sides signaled that circumventing Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) and even winning a nuclear war would be too destabilizing and dangerous. While adversarial nations may often feel the need to consistently doubt and fear each other\u2019s intentions and actions, these CBMs help cut through the \u2018security dilemma\u2019, reduce uncertainty between states regarding military uses of AI, and mitigate the proverbial \u2018noise\u2019 around decision-making.</p><p>Naturally states are limited on how much they can share about their ML developments &nbsp;to keep adversaries from taking advantage of the information to manipulate or attack the systems. &nbsp;Nonetheless, this kind of cooperative effort should be explored to create a degree of confidence between states and allow experts within and outside government to determine and spread best safety practices.</p><p>The impact of CBMs is complicated to assess; individual measures\u2019 impacts are immensely varied. However,even low impact measures are important to reducing the risk of inadvertent nuclear use. Lowering tensions and reducing uncertainty are precursors to changing posture or preventing a race to bottom in AI safety. The tractability of this is again variable due to changing international environments, but at this time any multilateral agreements are unlikely due to high-tensions around the war in Ukraine. Conversely, this could also be the time when the tractability of low-cost CBMs go up due to a serious need to reduce tensions between Russia and the U.S. While the war in Ukraine undoubtedly makes cooperation difficult, we could also see states coming to the table at a high-level of diplomacy to make low-cost CBMs designed to reduce tension around nuclear weapons as a first step towards a potential return to a semblance of normality. All that being said, the tractability of CBMs is incredibly variable.</p><h2>5.3 The Complicated Humans in-the-loop Solution</h2><p>While it is ultimately useful to keep humans in-the-loop, and human oversight is still required to some degree, there are multiple issues with this approach to control and limit automation. First, machine speed in highly competitive scenarios will effectively remove humans from the equation. The speed of modern warfare increased by hypersonic weapons, cyber warfare, and other new technologies could simply require autonomous systems to be given the pre-delegated authority to act without meaningful human oversight. Demanding these systems to always have a human in-the-loop would effectively negate the reason for their use in the first place. Of course, it can be argued that this is completely acceptable and that we should not race to the bottom of AI safety and risk nuclear catastrophe in order to stay allegedly equal to our military adversaries. Regardless of where one falls in that debate, machine-speed makes keeping a human in-the-loop difficult.</p><p>Secondly, keeping a human in-the-loop does not address the \u2018black box\u2019 problem. Meaningful human control is negated when we don\u2019t know why the ML system is making its choices. While one can evaluate the outcomes, and this may be enough in many scenarios, not knowing if the ML system is actually working as intended opens us up to unpredictable ML outcomes. The human operator may be able to&nbsp;control for obviously wrong outcomes, but brittleness could lead to incorrect assessments proposed with a high level of confidence that could be undetected until a catastrophe arises during a crisis.</p><p>Finally, automation bias can make the human element effectively irrelevant.&nbsp;If the bias develops, a human in-the-loop who is inclined to defer to the machine intelligence will be inherently less likely to act as a good check on its actions. Therefore, due to the problems listed here, keeping humans in-the-loop cannot arguably be relied on to prevent an increase in risk.</p><p>However, despite not being the ultimate&nbsp;answer to the issues outlined in this report, attempting to maintain human control over AI-powered nuclear C3 by preserving a human position somewhere within the decision making loop is still worth pursuing.&nbsp;And yet, depending on the situation, the human may need to be in, on, or even out of the loop, &nbsp;so while&nbsp;this approach is respectable , keeping humans in-the-loop is not a final catchall solution. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>6. Potential Funding Avenues</h1><p>The early and relatively underexplored nature of this topic means that there are significant funding opportunities around expanding literature and study, while also looking for ways to improve the empirical strength of these ideas.</p><h2>6.1 Wargame Funding</h2><ul><li>Funding the creation, use, and research of wargames designed to demonstrate nuclear decision making using various forms of AI decision support<ul><li>Wargaming could add a form of empirical evidence to the discussion of how machine learning could impact nuclear deterrence and/or nuclear decision making</li><li>Funding could be used to create the game, execute it, and sustain thorough research based on the results.</li></ul></li><li>The use of wargaming could assist with two satisfactory solutions listed above.<ul><li>It could provide evidence and insight into the areas where nuclear and strategy doctrine is lacking when taking into account how automation could be integrated with NC3.

Clear examples of automation bias or situations where pre-delegating authority to machine intelligence is problematic can inform human operators in real-world situations.</li></ul></li><li>Additionally, while keeping humans in-the-loop may have been critiqued as a non-successful solution to the problems of integration, wargaming could identify best practices as to where and when humans should or must be kept within the loop of automated systems.<ul><li>My critique of the in-the-loop solution was based around the fact that the perceived need for machine speed and the whole reason one would want automation, could push humans out-of-the-loop. Therefore, trying to always have a human play the role of final call in an ML integrated system might simply not be feasible and thus cannot solve the problems outlined here by itself. However, ensuring human oversight when possible or where required will still be crucial to the safe use of ML systems. With this in mind, wargaming can determine where we must endeavor to maintain human control or final say as well as where human control could be detrimental to stability.</li></ul></li><li>A 2020 RAND report explored the question; \u2018How might deterrence be affected by the proliferation of AI and autonomous systems?\u2019 They did this by constructing and experimenting with a wargame to simulate how actors would make decisions in a conflict if automation became far more prevalent.<ul><li>While focusing on a different aspect of militarized AI, their insights are undoubtedly valuable when looking at complex military operating environments, the machine-human relationship, and how deterrence could be impacted by AI.</li><li>They effectively added empirical evidence to a subject that is classified and somewhat speculative in nature.</li><li>One very important takeaway for the subject of inadvertent use is that in their wargame \u201cthe U.S. and Japan players set their air defense systems to be fully autonomous\u2026however, when North Korea unexpectedly launched a missile over Japan, the AI in the system not only shot down the missile but launched counterbattery fire that hit North Korea.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefutib6rwxqqi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnutib6rwxqqi\">[130]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Neither player had intended to strike at North Korea but the machine-speed of conflict resulted in an inadvertent use of aggression before they could stop it from occurring.</li><li>There is currently very limited efforts to simulate how ML systems will impact deterrence or NC3 and funding here could provide strong empirical evidence and insights into what the future of nuclear deterrence will look like in a world with powerful militarized machine intelligences.</li></ul></li><li>The Nuclear Threat Initiative created the wargame/tabletop exercise: \u201cStrengthening Global Systems to Prevent and Respond to High-Consequence Biological Threats\u201d.<ul><li>It was designed to provide insight to high-consequence biological events and to determine how we might better improve prevention and response capabilities.</li><li>While not as directly linked to this report as the RAND wargaming was, these kinds of exercises are designed to explore crises which are by their nature, and luckily, a rarity. However, despite their rarity, failure to navigate them can result in immense suffering or even global catastrophic risk.</li></ul></li><li>I recognize the inherent limitations of wargaming and caution falling prey to any bias in favor of them.<ul><li>They are, as their name suggests, games and not a pure reflection of the real world. Rules and structure are designed to provide an accurate simulation but there will always be flaws and failures. One key one is that in wargaming participants in the RAND game were often overly aggressive, likely due to the artificial nature of the game.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe98f8lukpbe\"><sup><a href=\"#fne98f8lukpbe\">[131]</a></sup></span></li></ul></li><li>Nonetheless, I believe that wargaming can be immensely useful for preparing for crisis events.

No one game will be a perfect exploration of this kind of crisis. Therefore, a wide range of wargaming and analysis needs to take place to ensure that, when taken all together, we can paint an accurate picture of this nearterm risk. &nbsp;</li></ul><h2>6.2 Targeting Funding for Influential Think Tanks</h2><ul><li>Targeted funding for think tanks could promote diverse research in this area.

Conclusion</h1><p>To conclude this report, I will briefly touch on its core ideas and findings. ML integration with NC3 has the potential to drastically alter our decision making process and this demands scrutiny due to the safety critical requirements of nuclear security. Additionally, there is the possibility that moving from human to machine intelligence could eliminate key aspects of human nature that have helped prevent nuclear weapon use since 1945.</p><p>To address this, we should aim for solutions that affect the policy and people involved with nuclear decision making as the technical aspects of this problem may not be solvable for near term considerations. If done correctly, increasing the automation of NC3 through ML integration could significantly decrease the chance of inadvertent nuclear use. However, if rushed and implemented in a manner that does not consider the wider implications that ML could have for nuclear security, integration risks raising the risk of use in dangerously subtle manner that may go unnoticed until catastrophe strikes. Therefore, it is crucial to address this problem now while it is still in its malleable infancy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn65lnll4qjtg\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref65lnll4qjtg\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Todd S Sechser, Neil Narang, and Caitlin Talmadge. \u2018Emerging Technologies and Strategic Stability in Peacetime, Crisis, and War\u2019. <i>Journal of Strategic Studies</i>&nbsp;42, no. 6 (19 September 2019): 728,<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/01402390.2019.1626725\">&nbsp;<u>https://doi.org/10.1080/01402390.2019.1626725</u></a>.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn11g1f3ruddri\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref11g1f3ruddri\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Sechser, Narang, and Talmadge, 2019,&nbsp;729.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn3xjaxi835c1\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref3xjaxi835c1\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Ibid.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnutj3dyzy42g\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefutj3dyzy42g\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Paul Scharre, <i>Army of None: Autonomous Weapons and the Future of War</i>.

The purpose was to simulate a period of escalation that ended in the US military reaching DEFCON 1 and simulated a coordinated nuclear attack. The realism of the exercise, combined with new lows in U.S-Soviet Relations, led Soviet leadership to believe that Able Archer was a ruse and a genuine preparation for a first-strike on the Soviet Union. This perceived aggression led to the Soviet Union preparing to use their nuclear forces and the U.S. had little to no idea that this was occuring. While this ended without incident, this is arguably one of the closet times we have come to nuclear use.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fngd8zvs6vnh\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefgd8zvs6vnh\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Nate Jones and Peter J.

In 2015, less than 6% of global production that complied with major international or Chinese VCSs came from China or Thailand. This is surprising given the volume of Chinese and Thai exports and the proportion of standard-compliant production coming from developing countries. &nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/the-determinants-of-adopting-international-voluntary-2#Costs_and_Benefits_to_Farmers\"><strong>Incentives and costs:</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The biggest incentive to get certified under international VCSs is access to wealthy markets, typically in Europe and North America. The biggest costs come from auditing and conducting more costly production practices. Small-scale farmers who are poorly connected to global value chains typically face higher barriers to certification, greater relative costs, and lesser benefits than large-scale farmers. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/the-determinants-of-adopting-international-voluntary-2#Table_1__Summary_of_Structural_Barriers__Costs__and_Benefits_to_Certification__\">Table 1</a> summarizes incentives, costs, and structural barriers. &nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/the-determinants-of-adopting-international-voluntary-2#Summary_and_Synthesis_of_Structural_Barriers__Costs__and_Benefits\"><strong>Explaining low certification rates:</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>For large-scale farmers, national certification schemes may offer cheaper ways to gain the same benefits that international VCSs offer.

Instead, I suggest animal advocates consider strategies to more strongly incentivize higher standards for the world's lowest-welfare fish and shrimp farming practices. I also suggest raising welfare standards in major&nbsp;<strong>national&nbsp;</strong>VCSs. I do not have great confidence in my suggestions. &nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/the-determinants-of-adopting-international-voluntary-2#Future_Research\"><strong>Future research:</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>For greater insight on the international impacts of VCSs, a good foundation would involve gathering better disaggregated data on certification rates among different species, farm sizes, geographical regions, and export orientations. Research that would be more directly useful for animal advocates might involve investigating what changes to existing certification schemes are most promising, how effective different strategies for improving certification uptake might be, and to what extent grants can help lower barriers to certification. I list many research ideas in this report. &nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/the-determinants-of-adopting-international-voluntary-2#Limitations\"><strong>Caveats:</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Evidence tends to be weak, outdated, or scarce. I also expect the findings of this report to be more pessimistic than modern data might suggest. This is because most empirical evidence is from the mid-2010s, and the state of certification seems to be improving over time. I also anticipate that my inclusion of non welfare-centered certifications may lead to some findings that do not generalize well into welfare-focused certifications.&nbsp;</p><h1>Introduction&nbsp;</h1><p>Aquaculture is a large and growing industry. In 2017, an estimated 51 to 167 billion fish were farmed and killed for food (<a href=\"http://fishcount.org.uk/studydatascreens2/2017/numbers-of-farmed-fish-A0-2017.php?sort2/full\"><u>Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO], 2019</u></a>). Especially in intensive systems, farmed fish can suffer from crowding, handling, starvation, slow or traumatic slaughter, and physical injuries (<a href=\"https://www.bbfaw.com/media/1432/investor-briefing-no-23-animal-welfare-in-farmed-fish.pdf\"><u>Cooke, 2016</u></a>). Reducing suffering in fish aquaculture should be a priority for those concerned about animal welfare. &nbsp;</p><p>The last few decades have seen a proliferation of voluntary certification schemes (VCS) in aquaculture. These schemes verify that products or their production practices achieve certain standards. In aquaculture, VCSs address sustainability, genetically modified organisms, social welfare, worker rights, country of origin, organic status, food quality and safety, and more. Many VCSs combine criteria from different areas. Very few specifically target fish welfare, although many VCSs include criteria that relate to it, for example, reducing disease with the aim of minimizing fish loss.&nbsp;</p><p>VCSs can increase the welfare level of farming practices by making compassionate farming more profitable. They are credible signals that attract buyers who will pay more for high welfare levels. VCSs help avoid the scenario where welfare-conscious buyers choose cheaper, low-welfare options because they don\u2019t trust unverified welfare claims. &nbsp;</p><p>Research on the impacts of aquaculture VCSs on production practices is limited, especially in Asian developing countries. This is in spite of Asia\u2019s historic and expected dominance of global aquaculture production and exports (<a href=\"http://fishcount.org.uk/studydatascreens2/2017/numbers-of-farmed-fish-A0-2017.php?sort2/full\"><u>Mood and Brooke, 2019</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/ca9229en/ca9229en.pdf\"><u>FAO, 2020</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aquaculture2020.org/uploads/gca-tr9-value-chains-and-market-access-for-aquaculture-products.pdf\"><u>Ababouch et al., 2021</u></a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflb797986jgg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlb797986jgg\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;China and Thailand are the only upper-middle income countries in East Asia with significant aquaculture output, making it easier to assess them together. &nbsp;</p><p>This report addresses the determinants of adopting international VCSs for farmed fish and how an increase in VCSs might affect production practices in China and Thailand.

These important questions were excluded to keep the scope of this report manageable. I elaborate on my choice of scope in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/the-determinants-of-adopting-international-voluntary-2#B__Scope_and_Justification\">Appendix B</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Details about my literature search methods, standards, and inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/the-determinants-of-adopting-international-voluntary-2#A__VCS_Search_Methods\">Appendix A</a>.&nbsp;</p><h1>How Certification Works</h1><p><i>Standards bodies&nbsp;</i>are the organizations responsible for designing certification schemes, defining the requirements (called&nbsp;<i>standards&nbsp;</i>or&nbsp;<i>criteria</i>) that suppliers should comply with, and approving the bodies that issue the certificates<i>.&nbsp;</i>Standards consist of specific normative statements, of which some are mandatory and others have little bearing on compliance assessment. In some cases, VCSs may also establish&nbsp;<i>principles&nbsp;</i>alongside their standards<i>,&nbsp;</i>which are more loosely defined than standards and may be implemented in flexible ways. &nbsp;</p><p>Private standards bodies tend to be based in developed western countries and may be nonprofit organizations, business associations, or businesses. Some major examples of international private certifiers include (<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e4ff4ae6791c303cbd43f67/t/62a8f13266d94c737dc11073/1655238969432/Aquaculture+Certification+Schemes+Benchmark.pdf\"><u>Aquatic Life Institute, 2022</u></a>):</p><ul><li>Global Animal Partnership (GAP)</li><li>Global Good Agricultural Practices (GLOBALG.A.P.)</li><li>Friends of the Sea (FoS)</li><li>Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA)</li><li>Naturland</li><li>Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC)</li><li>Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA)</li></ul><p>In particular, ASC, GLOBALG.A.P., GAA, and FoS may soon incorporate stronger welfare criteria in future versions of their certification schemes. &nbsp;</p><p>To become certified, farmers usually first pick an appropriate&nbsp;<i>conformity assessment body&nbsp;</i>(CAB)<i>,&nbsp;</i>also known as a&nbsp;<i>certification body.&nbsp;</i>These are authoritative, usually for-profit organizations with the power to affirm or deny whether a farm meets specific standards. In some cases, farmers do not pick the CAB first \u2013 instead, they contact the standards body first, which then presents a list of CABs for the farmer to choose from. &nbsp;</p><p>Once contracts with the CAB and standards body have been established and approved, the CAB sends farmers more information about the certification process, followed by auditors to assess the farms. Auditors may be employed by the CABs or belong to separate organizations known as&nbsp;<i>inspecting bodies.</i> They compare farmers\u2019 practices, equipment, and outcomes against certification standards and principles.&nbsp;</p><p>If a farm meets the standards, the CAB issues the certificate and notifies the standards body. For consumer-facing VCSs, the farmer can then pay licensing fees to the standards body to use their name, logo, and scheme name on end-product labels.&nbsp;</p><p>Farms are reassessed at regular intervals (for example, eight or 12 months) to ensure continual compliance. Failing to meet standards when already certified may lead to rescinding the certification, depending on the severity of the transgression.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that this framework is somewhat idealized. In some cases, such as with the RSPCA, the standards body, CAB, and auditors belong to the same organization. This has attracted criticism in the past (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.01.019\"><u>Samerwong et al., 2018</u></a>).</p><p>A concrete example of these bodies is as follows: GLOBALG.A.P. is a standards body, AFRICERT LTD is one of their accredited conformity assessment bodies, and IFA v6 for Aquaculture is one of their standards. A GLOBALG.A.P. certification&nbsp;<i>scheme&nbsp;</i>refers to a specific combination of standards, certification processes, and auditing processes.&nbsp;</p><h1>The Current State of Certification</h1><p>At the moment, voluntary aquaculture certifications don't seem to be making much of a difference to the average farm (<a href=\"https://aquaculture2020.org/uploads/gca-tr9-value-chains-and-market-access-for-aquaculture-products.pdf\"><u>Ababouch et al., 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.01.025\"><u>Nhuong et al., 2013</u></a>). This section discusses the current state of international voluntary aquaculture certifications, specifically:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Certification rates in Asia and worldwide</li><li>Certification rates in China and Thailand by scheme and species</li><li>Comparing certification rates between China and Thailand</li><li>Non compliance</li><li>A caveat</li></ul><h2>Certification Rates in Asia and Worldwide</h2><ul><li>In 2013,&nbsp;<strong>4.6% of global aquaculture was certified</strong> by ASC, GLOBALG.A.P., or ACC (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1237314\"><u>Bush et al., 2013</u></a>).&nbsp;</li><li>In 2015, this number rose to<strong> 6.3% of global aquaculture certified</strong> by ASC, BAP, ChinaGAP, Conventional, FOS, GLOBALG.A.P., and Organic (<a href=\"https://www.iisd.org/publications/state-sustainability-initiatives-review-standards-and-blue-economy\"><u>Potts et al., 2016</u></a>). Despite 58% of standard-compliant production coming from developing countries,<strong> no Asian country made up more than 6% of the global production volume compliant</strong> with ASC, GAA Best Aquaculture Practices (BAP), ChinaGAP, FOS, GLOBALG.A.P., MSC, or Organic (<a href=\"https://www.iisd.org/publications/state-sustainability-initiatives-review-standards-and-blue-economy\"><u>Potts et al., 2016</u></a>).&nbsp;</li><li>In 2020, at most,<strong> 3% of global aquaculture production</strong> was certified by ASC or Global Aquaculture Alliance\u2019s Best Aquaculture Management (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03308-6\"><u>Naylor et al., 2021</u></a>). &nbsp;</li></ul><p>These are incomplete lists of certification schemes, but they include some of the biggest certifiers. For example, almost half of global certified aquaculture production was under GLOBALG.A.P., with BAP, ASC, and FOS making up similar proportions of the remaining fraction (<a href=\"https://www.iisd.org/publications/state-sustainability-initiatives-review-standards-and-blue-economy\"><u>Potts et al., 2016</u></a>).</p><h2>Certification Rates in China and Thailand by Scheme and Species</h2><p>Rates of certification seem to differ greatly by country, species, and scheme.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i>GLOBALG.A.P.&nbsp;</i>had very little or no presence in Chinese food production (not just aquaculture) between 2008 and 2014. This was potentially due to China being a net importer of most foods, and not exporting in great volumes to Europe, the home of the GLOBALG.A.P. schemes (<a href=\"https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/213006/1/168752369X.pdf\"><u>Flachsbarth et al., 2020</u></a>).</li><li><i>ASC</i> claimed in 2020 that 20% of the large seafood farmers in China were ASC-certified, though the rate fell to less than 1% after accounting for farms of all sizes and export orientations (<a href=\"https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/coronavirus-hits-sustainable-aquaculture\"><u>Chun, 2020</u></a>).&nbsp;</li><li><i>GAA\u2019s&nbsp;Best Aquaculture Practices report showed that in 2018, 164 Thai and 72 Chinese finfish and crustacean farms were certified under the BAP social and labor standards (</i><a href=\"https://www.globalseafood.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/KIT_BAP-social-impact3.pdf\"><i><u>Kruijssen et al. 2021)</u></i></a><i>. The size of these farms and the volumes they produce relative to their countries\u2019 production volumes is unclear.&nbsp;</i></li><li>Globally, salmon, pangasius, mussels, tilapia, prawns, trout, and sea bream are most commonly certified (<a href=\"https://www.iisd.org/publications/state-sustainability-initiatives-review-standards-and-blue-economy\"><u>Potts et al., 2016</u></a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Comparing Certification Rates Between China and Thailand</h2><p>I am uncertain whether rates of international VCS certification are higher in China or in Thailand at the time of writing, as information about certification rates is largely not detailed or not up to date. &nbsp;</p><p>In support of China having higher certification rates, researchers found that in 2009, Chinese food (not necessarily aquaculture) exporters were sometimes required to get certified under&nbsp;<i>international&nbsp;</i>schemes by the Chinese government (<a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/44390/eib-52.pdf?v=95.6\"><u>Gale and Buzby, 2010</u></a>). In contrast, in 2014, the Thai government required some aquaculture exporters to register with&nbsp;<i>national&nbsp;</i>certification schemes, which may explain why many export-oriented farmers were nationally certified at that time (<a href=\"https://storre.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/20283/1/SustDev_ANS_210514-FINAL1.pdf\"><u>Nietes-Satapornvanit, 2014</u></a>).</p><h2>Non Compliance</h2><p>Being certified doesn\u2019t necessarily guarantee compliance. Certification organizations may be corruptible (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10612-019-09454-8\"><u>Bleakley, 2020</u></a>), and there appears to be much leeway for major and minor infringements of certification standards before certification is rescinded. &nbsp;</p><p>The results of some studies tracking non-compliance with various schemes are below.</p><ul><li>In Norway,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/235657/746143_FULLTEXT01.pdf?isAllowed=y&amp;sequence=2\"><u>Bonsaken (2014)</u></a> studied compliance with ASC, which at the time had two<u>&nbsp;</u>welfare-relevant criteria: 2.2 and 5.1. Among the Norwegian farms that were ASC-certified at the time,<strong> two out of seven</strong>&nbsp;<strong>farms did not fully conform&nbsp;</strong>to 5.1,&nbsp;<strong>one of seven</strong> of which also did not fully conform to 2.2.&nbsp;</li><li>In Bangladesh,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.100811\"><u>Haque et al. (2021)</u></a> found that out of the 57 ASC indicators, only<strong> 35%</strong>&nbsp;<strong>were met&nbsp;</strong>by registered pangasius farmers at decent levels.&nbsp;</li><li>In Thai shrimp farms,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://library.enaca.org/AquacultureAsia/Articles/april-june-2009/2-globalgap-standard-in-shrimp-farms-apr-09.pdf\"><u>Leepaisomboon et al. (2009)</u></a> found that, among different GLOBALG.A.P. certification modules,&nbsp;<strong>compliance ranged from 22%-27% to 47%-52%</strong>.</li><li>Globally,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.globalseafood.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/KIT_BAP-social-impact3.pdf\"><u>Kruijssen et al. (2021)</u></a> found that in BAP social and labor standards,&nbsp;<strong>non-compliance generally fell under 5%</strong>. It would be interesting to see whether human-centered criteria in aquaculture consistently get higher compliance rates than animal-centered criteria. &nbsp;</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.globalseafood.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/KIT_BAP-social-impact3.pdf\"><u>Kruijssen et al. (2021)</u></a> also found a sharp increase in compliance over time. Between 2009 and 2010, six specific clauses in their social and labor standards had fewer than 10% of shrimp farms comply. By 2017-2018, the average compliance rate for any individual clause increased to over 83%. This may indicate that&nbsp;<strong>non-compliance could become much less of an issue over time</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2>A Caveat</h2><p>Results can be confused by farmers\u2019 uptake of their own national standards, rather than international ones coming from Western markets. For example, about 90% of shrimp farmers at a Thai national shrimp convention were certified by their national Good Agricultural Practices scheme (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.01.019\"><u>Samerwong et al., 2018</u></a>). China and Vietnam also have national Good Agricultural Practices schemes called ChinaGAP and VietGAP. Many countries also have national Code of Conduct standards. Finally, there are certification schemes with a regional scope, such as the ASEAN Shrimp Standards Project.</p><h1>Structural Barriers to Certification Uptake</h1><p>Structural barriers are responsible for a great proportion of the costs individual farmers face. For some farmers, they can make getting certified nearly impossible. They appear in many forms, which I discuss below:</p><ul><li>Inadequate technical and business infrastructure</li><li>Market exclusion</li><li>International competition</li><li>Uncertainty and lack of awareness about certification schemes&nbsp;</li></ul><p>These structural barriers may be different for farmers operating at different scales and levels of integration with global supply chains. For the purpose of illustration, I characterize three types of producers for export:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>A small-scale farm with small capital reserves, a limited number of workers, and somewhat informal ties with input suppliers, processors, or middlemen. These tend to be individually or family run and predominantly supply local markets.</li><li>A mid-scale farm with substantial capital reserves, external employees, formal and lasting ties with input suppliers, processors, or middlemen. These supply both export and local markets.</li><li>A large-scale farm either registered as a company or partially or completely owned and operated by multinationals. Some are specifically built to contribute to global value chains. &nbsp;</li></ol><p>In China, most farms run small-scale, extensive<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqjvagm39sd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqjvagm39sd\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;pond-based operations (<a href=\"https://files.fwi.fish/China_Scoping_Report.pdf\"><u>Gibson et al., 2020</u></a>). However, China\u2019s most highly exported fish are tilapia and penaeid shrimp, whose farms tend to be large-scale (<a href=\"https://storre.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/20347/1/Wenbo%20Zhang%20PhD%20thesis.pdf\"><u>Zhang, 2014</u></a>). I would expect export-oriented farms raising other species to be mostly large-scale as well.&nbsp;</p><p>In Thailand, I expect farm size to have grown significantly since 2004, when even export-oriented, intensive operations were very small (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0366.2004.00081.x\"><u>Hall, 2004</u></a>). In Thai coastal aquaculture, the most valuable and important exported species is whiteleg shrimp. Inland, Nile tilapia and hybrid catfish are farmed the most, though information on how these species contribute to the export industry is scarce (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-0366.2004.00081.x\"><u>FAO, 2019b</u></a>). I couldn\u2019t find evidence on the average size of tilapia and catfish operations in Thailand.&nbsp;</p><p>Thai farms registered as companies\u2013which tend to be larger\u2013are more likely to comply with standards than unregistered, medium- and small-scale farms (<a href=\"https://storre.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/20283/1/SustDev_ANS_210514-FINAL1.pdf\"><u>Nietes-Satapornvanit, 2014</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Understanding what farm scale looks like in each country and industry, and how scale interacts with certification, is important to estimating the relative importance of the factors affecting certification uptake.</p><h2>Inadequate Business and Technical Infrastructure</h2><p>Farms in China and Thailand may lack technical and business infrastructure. This is especially true for small-scale or unintegrated<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg7jdqjssfyw\"><sup><a href=\"#fng7jdqjssfyw\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;farms, though much less so for larger and better integrated farms. &nbsp;</p><p>On a technical level, especially in more rural areas, farmers may be missing energy, transport, water, and other infrastructure necessary for higher-welfare practices. For example, aerators may be required to keep oxygen levels comfortable for aquatic animals, but even if farmers owned aerators, they would need cheap and reliable electricity that their grid may or may not offer. Poorly developed roads not only limit animal transportation options, but make it hard to scale up operations to make the fixed costs of certifications worth the investment.&nbsp;</p><p>On a business level, infrastructure such as formal farm registration processors, producer groups that farmers can establish relationships with, finance, and trustworthy traders-credit relations can be missing (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2016.03.055\"><u>Ngoc et al., 2016</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/a1454e/a1454e03.pdf\"><u>Phillips et al., 2007</u></a>). This lack of infrastructure can increase farmers' financial risk. It can make it harder to secure long-term contracts and source finance for initial farm upgrading. Under these conditions, the smallest, most rural operators may especially suffer from poor traceability of farm inputs (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-010-9230-3\"><u>Loc et al., 2010</u></a>) due to weaker credit relations and less detailed record-keeping (<a href=\"https://storre.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/20347/1/Wenbo%20Zhang%20PhD%20thesis.pdf\"><u>Zhang, 2014</u></a>). Traceability is very important to many schemes, so this can be a major disadvantage.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, belonging to less integrated supply chains limits Chinese and Thai farmers\u2019 exposure to retailers and standards bodies, leaving them with only intermittent contact with pressure to certify (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/i1948e/i1948e.pdf\"><u>Washington and Ababouch, 2011</u></a>). An example of this could be seen in Vietnamese shrimp industries in 2013, where roads, farmer coordination, or information flow was weak. Processors struggled to work directly with farmers and had to request certification from them through levels of middleman traders (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.01.025\"><u>Nhuong et al., 2013</u></a>). &nbsp;</p><p>Given these limitations, it would be very unusual to expect many of these farmers to enter direct procurement contracts with big retail chains in the United States (US) or European countries selling high-value, processed, branded products in welfare-conscious regions of the world. But these direct supply relationships with stringent quality policies are exactly the ones which incentivise certification, and which offer benefits of product value-addition and access to lucrative developed-country markets (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/i1948e/i1948e.pdf\"><u>Washington and Ababouch, 2011</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><h2>Market Exclusion</h2><p>Even if farmers meet requirements and wish to become part of certified value chains, they may not be able to access those markets. \"The chains that producers feed into are often governed by a limited number of buyers\" (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1759-5436.2001.mp32003003.x\"><u>Humphrey and Schmitz, 2001</u></a>, p.20). Farmers need to directly or\u2013more commonly\u2013indirectly access those lead buyers, who integrate and coordinate links along supply chains all over the world. If key buyers and the wider ecosystem don\u2019t favor farmers, things still may not work out (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2007.10.002\"><u>Islam, 2008</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Accessing a market doesn\u2019t guarantee that farmers will be able to set their own prices. Wholesalers see fish processors from developing-country farms as higher risk and more difficult to risk-manage (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/a1454e/a1454e03.pdf\"><u>Phillips et al., 2007</u></a>). This is sometimes a reasonable perception, as smaller, poorer farmers may not yield consistent qualities and quantities. This perception potentially passes through to multinational processors and auctioneers, who may rightly begin to view partnerships with those farmers as higher risk, making it harder for these farmers to establish long-term buying contracts.&nbsp;</p><p>Market exclusion may also happen out of protectionism. Some think voluntary certifications can act like trade barriers. Countries that have many retailers toting voluntary certifications might prefer for the certified goods to be produced domestically, not overseas, in order to protect home industries (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1108/S1574-8715(2013)0000012007\"><u>Beghin et al., 2013</u></a>). This theme of standards-as-trade barriers has been explored in food safety legislation (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1515/gej-2012-0025\"><u>Long et al., 2013</u></a>) as well as labor economics (<a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.499.3937&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf\"><u>Flanagan, 2003</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Further research should be done on to what degree certifications tend to get introduced to developing industries through Western-owned vertically integrated enterprises, or to what degree native farmers who perceive an opportunity reach out to those global chains.&nbsp;</p><h2>International Competition</h2><p>Farmers may face international competition in different ways, since their certified products may reach international markets under foreign brands, domestic brands, or no brand. The limited evidence I found suggests that most certified products from developing countries are sold under European and North American brands. &nbsp;</p><p>Reasons for this may include the following</p><ul><li>Selling seafood products under Asian brands may mean competing with better established, more reputable European and North American brands with large product ranges. These competitors may have been certified much earlier, already running smooth operations, and able to deliver highly processed, chilled seafood, as they face lower transport costs and perishability risks. They are also more likely to have a deeper understanding of the market they're already embedded in. Asian-branded value chains may have a significant disadvantage here, especially since developing a brand for an unfamiliar foreign market can be risky and costly, disincentivizing farmers from supplying them (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/bb240e/bb240e.pdf\"><u>O\u2019Sullivan and Bengoumi, 2008</u></a>).</li><li>Consumers in developed countries tend to have a preference for locally branded products and an aversion to products coming from Asia, despite certification helping to counteract this location-based preference&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666317318664\"><u>(Hinkes and Schulze-Ehlers, 2018)</u></a>. The aversion may be small, making this disadvantage very minor. Nevertheless, selling under a foreign brand eliminates it.&nbsp;</li><li>Though evidence on this goes both ways, it\u2019s possible that production costs from certification may be higher for exporting farmers than for producers closer to the European and North American markets. Exporting farmers\u2019 key competitive advantage in overseas markets - low cost - may be weakened. Selling minimally processed, low-value fish products may no longer be a viable strategy, so farmers may prefer branded value chains over unbranded ones.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In this sense, the narrative of better market access and product acceptance promoted by standards bodies may only be accurate to the extent that farmers end up supplying to the right brands\u2013those which can afford to be selective. &nbsp;</p><p>Rather than take up these risks, some have suggested that improving food safety is an effective way to improve product acceptance and compete more effectively internationally (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1467-9701.2003.00576.x\"><u>Athukorala and Jayasuriya, 2003</u></a>). Comparing how effective food safety and animal welfare certifications are for increasing competitiveness in European and North American markets is beyond the scope of this report. Further research in this direction may help to investigate how much more competitive animal welfare certifications need to make a product. &nbsp;</p><p>A caveat to all this is that Chinese and Thai farmers tend to specialize in species such as tilapia, white shrimp and penaeid shrimp, which face less competition from countries with high rates of certification.&nbsp;</p><h2>Uncertainty and Lack of Awareness About Certifications</h2><p>Adding to the complexity of the decision to certify, farmers often face knowledge and uncertainty issues. It may be unclear to them how certification systems work, whether policy reform could get in the way, whether there is a market for a certified product, or&nbsp;<strong>how</strong><i>&nbsp;</i>to go about making changes even if they\u2019re aware of what changes to make. Some of these barriers might be reduced by more clarity in certifiers\u2019 communication, but oftentimes, important factors cannot be predicted, or there is a human capital issue keeping changes from being made. &nbsp;</p><p>In the presence of uncertainty, farmers are likely to \u201cmodel themselves after similar organizations in their field that they perceive to be more legitimate or successful\u201d (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.48416/ijsaf.v15i3.277\"><u>Ransom, 2007</u></a>). In this case, most farmers do not go with certifications, so this reduces the chances of getting certified.</p><h1>Costs and Benefits to Farmers</h1><p>At the individual level, farmers face various benefits and costs to certification. These include:</p><ul><li>Main benefits perceived by farmers, like selling more fish at higher prices</li><li>Other benefits, such as on-farm support, brand reputation, and productivity improvements</li><li>Costs such as capital and labor input costs, logistical costs, and adjustment frictions</li></ul><p>In this section, I illustrate the various factors. I also speculate about the importance of their bearing on farmers\u2019 decisions to get certified, though these costs and benefits have not been thoroughly measured and are difficult to quantify and compare against one another. I also touch on how farmers at different scales of operation experience costs and benefits differently. Further research in different farmer groups is needed to know how costs and benefits really weigh up.&nbsp;</p><h2>Main Benefits Perceived by Farmers</h2><p>A little work has been done on the incentives farmers perceive to get certified. Research across eight European countries (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104176\"><u>Chikudza et al., 2020</u></a>) has revealed that farmers mostly see certifications as an opportunity to sell more fish at higher prices. These perceptions were stable across countries of different economic status, so I expect them to appear in China and Thailand as well.&nbsp;</p><h3>Sell More Fish</h3><p>Getting certified can increase sales by helping farmers secure supplier contracts and increase sales in European and North American markets. European farmers perceive that a significant number of retailers in rich, Western countries consider eco-labels a prerequisite for imported products (the picture is less clear for Asian farmers\u2019 perceptions). Not only is certification increasingly demanded by consumers\u2013a demand which in the past has not been adequately met\u2013certification also assures importers of product quality.&nbsp;</p><p>Product quality assurances come from certification schemes often including food safety, transparency, and traceability criteria. These minimize safety issues and ensure that any which appear can be traced back to the source. Without proof of compliance, Chinese and Thai farmers may struggle to secure a place in global supply chains. Even if they have a solid contract with processors (cleaners, preparers, packers and storers of fish before export), their goods still go through transporters and distributors. There is the risk that fish is stopped at any of these points, or at import borders, if it fails to pass inspections. &nbsp;</p><p>In short, meeting retailer demands and lowering risks to their business partners helps farmers gain market access. It may be one of the more significant benefits (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221027153814/https://www.resolve.ngo/docs/appendices-only.pdf\"><u>Boyd and McNevin, 2011</u></a>). A supporting example is the major business-to-business certification GLOBALG.A.P., focusing on food safety (<a href=\"https://www.seafoodsource.com/news/aquaculture/globalgap-expands-aquaculture-certification\"><u>Forristall, 2011</u></a>), which in 2012, accounted for almost 80% of \u201cthe eco-certified segment\u201d (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-013-0409-3\"><u>Jonell et al., 2013</u></a>). Increasing sales by accessing more markets seems to be a powerful incentive for certification schemes in general, and especially for food safety schemes. However, I suspect that taking up specifically international or welfare-related<i>&nbsp;</i>certifications is not the most efficient strategy for gaining market access. I have seen no conclusive empirical evidence for this in aquaculture and base this hunch off the observation that many more export-oriented farms appear to be certified by national rather than international schemes (<a href=\"https://storre.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/20283/1/SustDev_ANS_210514-FINAL1.pdf\"><u>Nietes-Satapornvanit, 2014</u></a>). Intuitively, this makes sense\u2013national certification schemes can be internationally recognized, require standards that satisfy importing markets, and importantly, be cheaper and more accessible to farmers than international schemes are. Non-welfare certifications such as sustainable or organic may also grant better market access to farmers due to greater demand among overseas consumers, while also having lower auditing costs.</p><h3>Sell at Higher Prices</h3><p>Farmers can sell certified fish at higher prices than uncertified fish (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/bb240e/bb240e.pdf\"><u>O\u2019Sullivan and Bengoumi, 2008</u></a>). There are two main reasons for this:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Regions which demand certified products tend to be more lucrative in general.&nbsp;</li><li>Consumers interested in certified products are willing to pay a premium for the assurance of certain product qualities. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>First, certified fish can break into wealthier European and North American markets, where fish generally sells at higher prices, certified or not. Consumers in those markets may be accustomed to paying higher prices for their domestically produced fish (<a href=\"https://databank.worldbank.org/source/icp-2017#\"><u>World Bank, 2017</u></a>). Asian exporters who sell there can afford to match domestic prices by raising their own. &nbsp;</p><p>Second, both domestically and internationally sold certified fish can fetch higher prices than uncertified fish. One reason for this is consumers' willingness to pay more for the assurance that their products meet certain requirements. Another is the fact that certified products tend to belong to value chains building up to higher-value products. Western sellers especially are more likely to import certified fish for further processing, packaging, or labeling under a reputable brand. These value additions lead to the final product being sold at a higher price (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104176\"><u>Chikudza et al., 2020</u></a>). &nbsp;</p><p>Price premiums vary by species and region. In wild-capture fish products, consumers can pay up to 14%\u201320% extra for high-welfare, organic, or sustainable seafood (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2015.11.028\"><u>Ankamah-Yeboah et al., 2016</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1477-9552.2011.00299.x\"><u>Roheim et al., 2011</u></a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6bbk04m06p5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6bbk04m06p5\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Around 2008, in China, certified organic fish sold in domestic markets for 75%-117% more than uncertified counterparts. In shrimp, the price premium was 50%-87% (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.08.019\"><u>Xie et al., 2013</u></a>). This optimistic evidence about aquaculture premiums may be old, but I would expect premiums to grow over time rather than shrink, due to increased consumer interest in certification. &nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, in reality, price premiums may not translate to better farmer profits. Though I did not find clear evidence for or against this in China and Thailand, wider evidence from Swedish fisheries (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1477-9552.12106\"><u>Blomquist et al., 2016</u></a>), pangasius aquaculture (Mantingh and Dung 2008 as cited in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10668-010-9230-3\"><u>Loc et al., 2010</u></a>), and non-fish trades (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221027153814/https://www.resolve.ngo/docs/appendices-only.pdf\"><u>Boyd and McNevin, 2011</u></a>) supports it. Economic theory also acknowledges the possibility (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2015.09.032\"><u>Yenipazarli, 2015</u></a>). The difficulty of gaining certification-related premiums may be because of farmers\u2019 limited power to demand higher revenues (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10668-010-9230-3\"><u>Loc et al., 2010</u></a>) or because extra revenues go towards covering the costs of certification (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2015.09.032\"><u>Yenipazarli, 2015</u></a>). Standards bodies do not guarantee price premiums to farmers (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/uploads/media/UpgradingPangasiusFINAL.pdf\"><u>Khiem et al., 2020</u></a>). &nbsp;</p><p>As such, it would not surprise me if farmers in China and Thailand, who are responsible for many costs, generally distrusted purported benefits of certification. Some evidence of this is apparent with Vietnam pangasius farmers, who consider the uncertainty around the price premium a major limiting factor (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2016.03.055\"><u>Ngoc et al., 2016</u></a>). &nbsp;</p><p>However, this state of affairs may not be set in stone.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chieco.2013.11.001\"><u>Ortega et al. (2014)</u></a> derived a willingness-to-change figure for farmers suggesting that the typical Chinese farmer would be willing to adopt ChinaGAP\u2019s food safety standards for a 2.49% higher sales price. To the degree that this willingness-to-change figure truly represents the ballpark of price premiums that producers would be happy with, and to the degree that ChinaGAP certifications have similar costs to other VCSs, it seems that price premiums can become meaningful incentives. However, both of these assumptions seem unlikely to me. Future research could affirm or deny the usefulness of improving financial incentives to farmers through mechanisms like guaranteed price premiums.&nbsp;</p><h2>Other Benefits</h2><p>In this section, I explore benefits that, to my knowledge, farmers may not be aware of. Further research may be needed to confirm whether farmers perceive them.&nbsp;</p><h3>On-farm Support</h3><p>Standards bodies or value chains farmers associate with may provide<strong>&nbsp;</strong>on-farm support<strong>&nbsp;</strong>through the certification process. The support may result in higher productivity, better human capital, and lower perceived risk from potential business partners. Standards bodies and other bodies in the value chain have incentives to do this in order to secure the quality and efficiency of supply. As private sector actors connected to farmers through supply chains, they may be among the better-placed actors for providing on-farm support.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzp75ou04xi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzp75ou04xi\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306919205000308\"><u>Hatanaka et al. (2005)</u></a> provide an example of improved on-farm support. When investigating Integrated Pest Management in horticulture, they found that farmers engaged with GLOBALG.A.P. may benefit from training to reduce diseases in crops and remove contaminants in cheaper and more efficient ways. In some cases, standards bodies have even helped reduce post-harvest losses by verifying the quality of produce and demanding payment that might otherwise be withheld.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1759-5436.2001.mp32003003.x\"><u>Humphrey and Schmitz (2001)</u></a> also observe that lead firms in highly governed chains who take up more sophisticated practices can pass these on to surrounding producers, thereby quickly and significantly improving the economic outlook of the entire region. &nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I would need to double check that the aquaculture industry in China and Thailand are sufficiently connected to global value chains before believing this claim.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10668-010-9230-3\"><u>Loc et al. (2010)</u></a> also echo my call for further research.</p><h3>Domestic Brand Reputation</h3><p>Another benefit to involvement with certification schemes may include improved domestic brand reputation (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/publications/details-publication/en/c/1415846/\"><u>FAO, 2021a</u></a>), though this may only be relevant to the smaller sector of exporters who supply both internationally and domestically. When considering&nbsp;<strong>welfare</strong><i>&nbsp;</i>certifications, I expect this to be of comparatively less importance as Chinese and Thai consumers may not value welfare labels highly (<a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/asian-countries-and-fish-welfare\"><u>Lin, 2020</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><h3>Farm Productivity and Resilience</h3><p>Certification criteria may benefit farm productivity and resilience, and this may be especially true for welfare-related criteria. Happier fish are healthier, calmer, and more efficient at feeding. This may lead to better feed conversion ratios, growth rates, and filet quality, as well as reduced mortality, need for drugs, fish aggression, fin damage, and feed waste. Many VCSs also have stocking density or spacing requirements, which can reduce disease rates on individual farms and prevent more serious and contagious diseases from causing massive industry-wide fish loss. Moreover, in times of surplus, farmers believe that certified fish will sell before uncertified fish will, which grants their business more security. &nbsp;</p><p>However, Thai shrimp farmers do not associate national standard compliance with better outcomes. And the benefits may not be reliable\u2013for example, it was found that GAP compliance didn\u2019t reduce disease in Thai Pacific white shrimp farming (<a href=\"https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20103317465\"><u>Sanrak et al., 2010</u></a>).</p><h3>Barriers to Benefits</h3><p>As we have seen, some of these hoped-for benefits do not get realized, which indicates that there may be barriers preventing farmers from receiving these benefits. More research is needed to find the major barriers to each benefit. Complicating the matter, some examples were drawn from other industries, countries, and non-animal welfare certifications, though I believe they are generalizable enough to include. Further empirical validation of benefits in Chinese and Thai aquaculture industries would be useful.&nbsp;</p><h2>Costs to Farmers</h2><p>Farmers have in mind several costs, namely those related to:</p><ul><li>Installing, maintaining, and replacing facilities, equipment and labor necessary for documenting and performing higher-welfare operations (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104176\"><u>Chikudza et al., 2020</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2005.05.006\"><u>Hatanaka et al., 2005</u></a>)</li><li>Transporting, accommodating, documenting, and paying for auditors (thought to be a primary barrier by theorists, farmers, and empiricists alike) (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpe.2015.09.032\"><u>Yenipazarli, 2015</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104176\"><u>Chikudza et al., 2020</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2005.05.006\"><u>Hatanaka et al., 2005</u></a>)</li><li>Short-term stress from demands on the workforce to change practices, techniques, and processes and work quickly (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1759-5436.2001.mp32003003.x\"><u>Humphrey and Schmitz, 2001</u></a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Of the perceived incentives and barriers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2020.104176\"><u>Chikudza et al. (2020)</u></a> identified, all were similarly held between differently sized farms, at least in the nine European countries the authors surveyed, suggesting that they might hold in China and Thailand as well. &nbsp;</p><p>Of all costs, it is thought that auditing costs are the most difficult to overcome. The specific knowledge and skill sets required for a welfare auditor is difficult to come by, even more so than for sustainability auditors. Small farms especially would struggle with these costs (<a href=\"https://f.hubspotusercontent20.net/hubfs/7126072/eBooks/Sustainable-Aquaculture_Partnership-Assurance-Model.pdf?hsCtaTracking=1e7b2c74-2c59-47e9-bf68-e8bd4b18b5f2%7Cd0075965-8911-4ad9-9996-240323d29a53\"><u>Moore et al., 2020</u></a>) as auditing takes a roughly fixed cost per farm, and does not get cheaper just because one\u2019s farm has fewer fish.&nbsp;</p><p>A few empirical observations have been made about the extra costs of switching to higher welfare slaughter practices in European countries (<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52018DC0087&amp;from=en\"><u>European Commission, 2018</u></a>; G. Bridgewater and R. Springlea, personal communication, July 28, 2022). Estimates tend to fall between 0% and 4% of sales prices in Atlantic Salmon, European Seabass and Sea Bream, and Rainbow Trout. For French Rainbow Trout, costs increased by around 8% of sales price. For German and Romanian Common Carp, costs increased by around 22% of sales price. Costs of switching to higher welfare practices varied greatly by the size of the enterprise, where larger farms incurred lower costs. &nbsp;</p><p>It is unclear to me how costs might compare between European farms and Chinese and Thai exporting farms. On the one hand, costs may be lower in Asia due to lower labor, land, and energy costs. Alternatively, European costs may be lower due to better labor productivity, infrastructure, economies of scale, and geography. &nbsp;</p><p>All costs and benefits considered,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/publications/card/fr/c/c919251f-1ad1-5474-b6bf-fbaa7a5705bc/\"><u>Corsin et al. (2007)</u></a> calculated that for many different (not necessarily animal welfare-related) certification schemes, certified farmers and workers bore significant costs while consumers and other parts of the supply chain tended to benefit.&nbsp;Further research can confirm whether the same relative benefits hold today.</p><h2>Summary and Synthesis of Structural Barriers, Costs, and Benefits</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/the-determinants-of-adopting-international-voluntary-2#Table_1__Summary_of_Structural_Barriers__Costs__and_Benefits_to_Certification__\">Table 1</a> summarizes the various structural barriers, costs, and benefits farmers at different scales face as well as my best guesses at the direction and relative magnitudes of the effects.

The&nbsp;<strong>Importance weighted by farm scale&nbsp;</strong>column indicates how important a factor is for certification uptake in general, placing heavier weight on larger compared to smaller farms.</i></p><p><i><sup>a</sup> Definitions for scale of aquaculture operations vary in the literature and between species. Many sources categorize farm scale by geographic area alone. In general, for finfish, small-scale farms are less than 4.8 hectares, medium-scale farms are between 4.8 and 8 hectares, and large-scale farms are greater than 8 hectares (</i><a href=\"https://storre.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/20283/1/SustDev_ANS_210514-FINAL1.pdf\"><i><u>Nietes-Satapornvanit, 2014</u></i></a><i>,&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1070496517736872\"><i><u>Samerwong et al., 2018</u></i></a><i>). Other definitions of farm scale incorporate farm productivity, ownership and management structures, export orientation and status as a registered company. The terms in my table lean towards the more holistic definitions of scale.&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</p><p>With all this in mind, it\u2019s clear that various factors help explain the weak influence of international VCSs in China and Thailand. For small-scale, export-oriented farmers, the costs and barriers of certification tend to be much greater than the benefits, making certification a poor business strategy; benefits are far from guaranteed. &nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, the picture is less clear for large-scale, export-oriented farmers. My impression is that export-oriented, large-scale farms in China are rarely certified under international VCSs. But I would not be surprised if Thai farmed shrimp now enjoy relatively high rates of certification under these schemes. For now, under the current dearth of data, it is difficult to describe either certification landscape. &nbsp;</p><p>Thai shrimp aside, I did not find convincing explanations in the literature for why rates of certification among well-resourced, Western-market-facing Chinese and Thai farmers seems low. I speculate at two potential reasons. &nbsp;</p><p>First, perhaps the strongest draws to getting certified are not strong enough in these contexts. It\u2019s possible that one of the most valuable benefits of international VCSs\u2013granting market access to those who comply\u2013can be gained at lower costs under different certification schemes. For example, national schemes mandated or recommended by their own country or the country they are exporting to may be more economical (or less avoidable) and grant market access just as well. &nbsp;</p><p>Second, perhaps the costs, even for large farmers, may still be too high relative to the price premium a certified product would fetch. Arguably, Chinese and Thai farmers, who mostly export tilapia, shrimp, and catfish, aim at lower-value market segments which optimize for cost-competitiveness rather than quality signaling. Quality signaling could instead be the specialization of farmers in other countries. Such farmers may not only focus on other high-value species such as salmon, tuna, and rainbow trout, but also move their products through more processing and branding procedures to target especially wealthy or welfare-conscious consumers. In other words, Chinese and Thai farmers may not be part of chains aiming for quality-related price premiums, and so it is not worth getting certified. &nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion:</p><ul><li>Becoming certified does not appear to be a good business strategy for most farmers in China and Thailand if they are not already part of global value chains supplying businesses interested in certification.&nbsp;</li><li>Members of a global value chain will need to provide additional technical and financial support to improve the production practices of their farmers.&nbsp;</li><li>Farmers may gain as much or more value from national certification schemes, which tend to be less welfare-oriented.&nbsp;</li></ul><h1>How Might Chinese and Thai Export Industries Respond to Welfare Certification Expansion?</h1><p>In this section, I imagine a future where certification schemes become compelling to many more farmers on the margin, with the assumption that these changes primarily come from increased consumer interest in welfare-certified seafood. I\u2019d like to explore what might happen to the size and composition of exporting industries in China and Thailand. I discuss several different potential outcomes that can be organized as:</p><ul><li>Changes to farm volume and scale</li><li>Changes to farm production practices</li><li>Changes to global volumes and practices&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In general, since the impacts of certifications on Chinese and Thai exporting farmers seem small, I expect even a large expansion of certification schemes to have only minor effects in these countries. I also expect any significant uptake of better production practices to be ultimately in response to changes in demand. In other words, I don\u2019t think introducing new VCSs will by itself lead to major industry-level changes such as those described in this section.&nbsp;</p><p>These hypothesized effects are tentative and should not be viewed as predictions with high certainty. My conclusions come from economic intuition, which is fallible and can place too much confidence in market forces and the rationality of farmers while overlooking important factors.</p><h2>Changes to Farm Volume and Scale in China and Thailand</h2><p>First, I expect the<strong> number and proportion of higher-welfare farmed fish to grow&nbsp;</strong>as a direct result of the increased demand. &nbsp;</p><p>Second, I expect the&nbsp;<strong>size of the average farm exporting certified fish to grow</strong>. Since larger firms face lower proportionate costs to certification, they should cope better in markets where international VCSs have expanded to being meaningfully important to profit margins. In the case where consumer demand for welfare-certified goods in North American and European markets makes up a larger proportion of total demand, there will be a smaller market for non-welfare-certified Asian exporters to target. This could lead to greater competition between small-scale exporters. Necessarily, some small farmers could be squeezed out from those markets, resulting in larger average farm size.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodpol.2010.11.027\"><u>Belton et al., 2011</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1526/0036011041730527\"><u>Busch and Bain (2004)</u></a> argue this has already happened.</p><h2>Changes to Farm Production Practices in China and Thailand</h2><p>Third, I expect<strong> polarization between the practices of larger and smaller farm operators</strong>. Larger farm operators will supply more to markets with interests in welfare certifications, perhaps signing contracts with businesses closer to the consumer end of the supply chain. They may also produce increasingly branded and processed products. The more vertically integrated they become, the cheaper and smoother the certification process will be. So I would expect a gradual shift from the current non-integrated state of the exporting producer industry, to a collaborative structure, and finally, to a more vertically integrated structure. On the other hand, smaller producers who do not engage with certification schemes may not have the same incentives. If anything, they may be more likely to supply locally, informally, with minimum processing and low welfare standards, and to stay fragmented. &nbsp;</p><p>The push-threshold model from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00404.x\"><u>Tlusty (2012)</u></a> aligns with this, suggesting that certifications as they stand now could leave behind the farms with the worst animal welfare practices. In fact, most farmers may not change practices in response to expanding standards, largely because farms with the worst practices lag too far behind the certification threshold. It would take too many resources to generate sufficient welfare improvements to comply. Only those farmers close enough to the certification threshold\u2013those farmers who already have mediocre welfare practices\u2013may get certified. If certifications do not expressly target the worst performers, there may well always be producers specializing in low-cost, low-welfare seafood (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s13280-013-0409-3\"><u>Jonell et al., 2013</u></a>). &nbsp;</p><p>Further support for this idea appears in production trends in Vietnamese pangasius. Trends appear to be highly cyclical, with smaller farmers moving in and out of production and larger farmers consolidating over time (<a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203135921-20/factory-fish-pond-certi%EF%AC%81-cation-transform-vietnamese-pangasius-simon-bush-ben-belton\"><u>Bush and Belton, 2011</u></a>). This may indicate that instead of innovating or improving welfare practices to adapt to changing demand, farmers are instead primed to enter and exit opportunistically. It also reinforces the idea that small farmers are easily pushed out by events such as losing a harvest to disease, getting a low price for a couple of seasons, or struggling with feed costs and large debt (D. Waley, personal communication, September 6, 2022). In the short term, such opportunistic strategies may be appropriate. But to the degree that welfare demands become a long-term trend and certifications become mainstream, the sector of smaller-scale, cycling farmers may get smaller and smaller. &nbsp;</p><p>Fourth, I expect a&nbsp;<strong>risk of entrenching low-welfare production practices among native</strong> Chinese and Thai farmers<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Developed economies currently seem to have the advantage with high-welfare production. It\u2019s possible that in certain conditions, they could press this advantage, leading to a division where Asian countries specialize in low-welfare production while developed countries specialize in higher-welfare production (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1526/0036011041730527\"><u>Busch and Bain, 2004</u></a>). &nbsp;</p><p>This risk is heightened if:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Standards continue to be designed and promoted predominantly in developed Western countries, making it easier for farmers in those countries to get certified, compared to farmers in China and Thailand.</li><li>Lead firms in developed Western countries governing global value chains stay predominantly responsible for bringing certification schemes to developing countries. This was true some decades ago (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1759-5436.2001.mp32003003.x\"><u>Humphrey and Schmitz, 2001</u></a>), and would lead to greater Western ownership and control over high-welfare sectors. The Asian exporting industry could become home to an increasing number of European-owned firms which are already vertically integrated with certified supply chains. These could potentially crowd out home-grown Asian exporting firms, so that native firms do not take to higher welfare practices. This doesn\u2019t have to be counterproductive if there are spillover effects where proximity to foreign-owned, high-welfare farmers leads native farmers to improve their welfare practices.&nbsp;</li><li>National governments in China and Thailand limit their involvement in standard harmonization or the surrounding financial, technical, and infrastructure support for standard uptake.</li><li>Advocacy efforts in welfare-conscious countries create domestic pressure to certify without dissuading welfare-indifferent, developed country consumers from purchasing cheaper, low-welfare fish and shrimp from China and Thailand.</li></ol><h2>Changes to Global Volumes and Practices</h2><p>Fifth, I expect the&nbsp;<strong>volume of fish and shrimp produced globally to shrink</strong>, relative to a world where voluntary certifications were not introduced. Across both markets, consumers demanding fish produced at higher production costs should on average reduce total production. The shrinking of global production may be more apparent in shrimp and mollusk export industries, rather than fish, since fish seems least sensitive to changing food safety policies compared to other seafood groups (<a href=\"https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/46758\"><u>Nguyen and Wilson, 2009</u></a>). &nbsp;</p><p>The above expectation depends on the assumption that compliance is a burden on farmers, which seems fairly common regardless of country (S. Davis, personal communication, Sep 6, 2022). Alternately, in some scenarios, certifications may lead to an increase in global fish and shrimp production volumes. A variety of factors may support this outcome:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Farmers may become better able to cope with the challenges of certification</li><li>Certification schemes could become more easily attainable</li><li>Certification may encourage people to buy fish who otherwise wouldn\u2019t&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In these scenarios, even if a substantial proportion of fish are welfare certified, they may not have lives worth living. Then, certifications that increase global fish production could be a step back for animal welfare overall.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I want to address the possibility of fish production standards&nbsp;<i>racing to the top</i>. This occurs when certification at the highest standards has special profit advantages, which attracts investment in efficient and cost-effective ways to achieve those standards. Such investment could lead to diminishing costs of certification globally and higher global rates of certification. It is hard for me to get a read on the feasibility of this at the moment. But anecdotally, I have heard that farms have been able to produce standard-compliant fish on one side of their farm and non-compliant fish on the other. If it turns out that these split processors are feasible on a farm level, then a race-to-the-top scenario seems less likely to happen.&nbsp;</p><p>I do not hope for my writing here to be interpreted as what I think will actually happen. I mean to say that the expansion of certification schemes would put pressure on the exporting industry to evolve in these directions. In reality, there are so many other factors influencing how exporting industries evolve that certification schemes may have a negligible impact in comparison.&nbsp;</p><h1>Implications for Advocates</h1><p>My research produces some action-relevant suggestions for welfare advocacy in Chinese and Thai fish and shrimp aquaculture. They are ranked in rough order of efficiency by my best guesses as indicated by<i> [efficiency ranking, confidence level]</i>. Very little empirical evidence, if any, backs up this ranking. And given the shallow nature of this review, these suggestions are mostly based on the expected&nbsp;<strong>direct</strong><i>&nbsp;</i>effects. It's possible that indirect effects may make an approach much more or less promising than I expect. Moreover, these strategies are evaluated based on their anticipated effects in&nbsp;<strong>China</strong><i>&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<strong>Thailand</strong><i>&nbsp;</i>and do not take impacts on other geographies into account, which may be even more important. Almost all of these strategies should be better researched before going ahead.&nbsp;</p><h2>Use trade and policy instruments to incentivize welfare standards for the world\u2019s lowest-welfare exporters</h2><p><i>[Moderately efficient, Moderate confidence]</i></p><p>The world's exporters with the lowest-welfare production practices may be a top choice for the world\u2019s welfare-indifferent customers due to lower costs. When progress is made increasing welfare standards elsewhere in the world, the cost of fish and shrimp in those places may increase, pushing more consumers towards these lowest-welfare exporters. Strongly incentivizing welfare standards in lowest-welfare exporters, perhaps through trade-linked standards or bans, can help reduce this effect. Not only would the lowest welfare fish and shrimp live better lives, it could also magnify the impact of animal advocacy efforts everywhere else. Though tractability may be low, there are some countries where this approach could be promising (Cox, 2022 unpublished). Caution is still required, however. The same spillover mechanism that increases consumption of low-welfare fish from low-welfare places could happen between species. That is, if policies or campaigns dissuade the consumption of fish and push consumers toward (arguably lower-welfare) shrimp, advocates might actually cause harm.&nbsp;</p><h2>Raising welfare standards in major national VCSs</h2><p><i>[Weakly efficient, Low confidence]</i></p><p>Most farmers exporting to welfare-conscious markets such as the US, Europe, and others will become subject to food safety and traceability standards. These standards may be imposed by either the importing or exporting government. Examples include ThaiGAP and the US\u2019s Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP). Their requirements are so widespread that a small welfare-relevant change to these could have very large impacts. Tractability is uncertain.</p><h2>Raising welfare standards in existing international VCSs</h2><p><i>[Weakly inefficient, Low-moderate confidence]</i></p><p>Raising welfare standards may not have much direct impact on fish production practices in China and Thailand, given those countries\u2019 small proportion of registered farmers. It may also lower certification rates worldwide, so the improvement in the certified fish\u2019s experience would have to outweigh that downside. Advocates currently doing this should ensure that any extra stringency in existing standards meaningfully improves fish experience. However, there may be some important indirect effects where raising international welfare standards encourages other schemes to raise their own welfare standards.&nbsp;</p><h2>Increasing uptake among poorly integrated, small-scale farmers</h2><p><i>[Weakly inefficient, Moderate confidence]</i></p><p>In most cases, small farmers do not seem like a very promising group to target. In China and Thailand, small farms are responsible for producing only a small proportion of exported fish and shrimp. The barriers they face are also less mutable. Nevertheless, the situation may be different in countries at different levels of income and development. Advocates who have good reasons to work with small farmers should consider strategies that reduce auditing and transition costs.&nbsp;</p><h2>Promoting international VCSs to Chinese and Thai producers</h2><p><i>[Moderately inefficient, Moderate confidence]</i></p><p>Promoting international VCSs to Chinese and Thai producers doesn't seem very directly useful. Large-scale exporters are likely already aware of them. Small- and medium-scale farmers would probably find them too costly or inaccessible, especially compared to domestic schemes. It seems difficult to make a case for getting certified that is both honest and convincing.&nbsp;</p><h2>Building technical and business infrastructure for small farmers</h2><p><i>[Strongly inefficient, Moderate confidence]</i></p><p>This is resource intensive and well outside the function of most advocacy groups.&nbsp;</p><h2>Approaches with uncertain value</h2><ul><li><i>Promote certified products to more markets:&nbsp;</i>May increase the market access benefit of certification schemes, but the cost-effectiveness is uncertain.</li><li><i>Guarantee price premiums to farmers:&nbsp;</i>Costs could make this infeasible.&nbsp;</li><li><i>Increase technical and financial on-farm support:&nbsp;</i>Potentially resource intensive and difficult to screen for the right farms to support.

But the practices these criteria call for may already be changes farmers intrinsically have or want to make, leading to no additional improvement in practices.&nbsp;</li><li><i>Invest in developing economical, welfare-oriented farming equipment or practices:</i>&nbsp;Could reduce costs of higher-welfare production, but may not be cost effective.<i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>More research questions of particular interest to advocates can be found in the section&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/the-determinants-of-adopting-international-voluntary-2#Questions_Relevant_to_Fish_and_Shrimp_Advocates_and_Grantmakers\">Questions Relevant to Fish and Shrimp Advocates and Grantmakers</a>.&nbsp;</p><h1>Future Research</h1><p>This report was a literature review on research relevant to how VCSs affect international producers.

Determining the competitiveness of high-welfare sectors, both against different welfare levels and internationally, can determine, in the long run, how many fish are produced, and at what selling price and welfare level. &nbsp;</p><p>For empirically studying competitiveness, a European Commission study recommends assessing almost all of the following (<a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/dc039353-ca9c-11e7-8e69-01aa75ed71a1/language-en/format-PDF/source-search\"><u>Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety, 2017</u></a>). Some of these are much more relevant for assessments of international competitiveness than the competitiveness of high versus low welfare industries. &nbsp;</p><ul><li>Market performance<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk4upt7wifl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk4upt7wifl\">[6]</a></sup></span></li><li>Revealed comparative advantage<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftpjydldbfua\"><sup><a href=\"#fntpjydldbfua\">[7]</a></sup></span></li><li>Availability of natural resources</li><li>Feed cost and efficiency</li><li>Price of young animals or eggs to be raised and slaughtered on the farm</li><li>Labor cost</li><li>Other input costs (for example, energy)</li><li>Fixed costs (for example, plant and equipment depreciation)</li><li>Cost of logistics</li><li>Geographical position</li><li>Marketing costs</li><li>Environmental, sanitary and phytosanitary, and food safety legislation</li><li>Animal welfare legislation or standards</li><li>Tax regimes&nbsp;</li><li>Border protection (for example, import tariffs, tariff rate quotas) and other trade distortions</li><li>Exchange rates: only relevant for competitiveness in international markets.

It seems plausible that the aggregate welfare level of a fish industry is more dependent on volume-related changes caused by certifications than intra-fish welfare changes. For example, if certifications improved the subjective experience of a few fish by a small amount, this would be a less important effect if certification halved the total number of fish produced, where fish on average lived terrible lives. However, this rides on some philosophical assumptions, such as fish nonexistence being better than fish living \u201cterrible\u201d lives.&nbsp;</p><p>My intuition is that volume is more accurate than value as an indicator for the amount of fish suffering, though I am not certain. At the least, I expect volume per fish to vary less than value per fish over time, on average. Nevertheless, in this mini-section, \u201cvolume\u201d can be substituted by \u201cvalue.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Volume of production is indirectly related to the number of fish farmed at any time. This number of fish, as well as each fish\u2019s individual level of wellbeing, is important for estimating impacts on fish welfare across an industry. &nbsp;</p><p><i>Exporters\u2019 animal welfare content:</i></p><p>After the introduction of voluntary certifications, how many more exporters are selling products with higher animal welfare content compared to before, both overseas and domestically?&nbsp;</p><p><i>Percentages of certified fish:&nbsp;</i></p><p>What percentage of the total volume of fish sold to welfare-conscious markets is certified? How does this percentage change before and after new certifications are introduced? After accounting for the volume of fish who were going to be raised in higher-welfare conditions anyway, this change in percentage would be a crude estimate of the impact of certifications overseas. &nbsp;</p><p><i>Trade effects:&nbsp;</i></p><p>How do changes in welfare-conscious markets (for example, in price, volumes of supply of different types of goods, market concentration, etc.) affect those same properties in exporter countries through trade?</p><p><strong>Impacts on industry composition</strong></p><p><i>Composition of value chains:&nbsp;</i></p><p>What proportion of farms in exporter countries, vertically integrated with leading sellers in welfare-conscious markets, cease to operate once certifications are introduced in that value chain?&nbsp;</p><p><i>Scale of farmers:&nbsp;</i></p><p>What proportion of total export volume/value is produced by farmers at small-scale, mid-scale, and large-scale? How does this change before and after the introduction of certifications, or in uncertified countries compared to certified ones?</p><p><strong>Counterfactuals \u2013 would production practices have improved anyway?</strong></p><p><i>Additionality:&nbsp;</i></p><p>To what degree are the changes related to certification criteria already changes farmers wanted to make? For example, farmers may improve fish welfare as a byproduct of attempts to reduce disease and mortality, and improve food safety and sustainability (<a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/china\"><u>Gibson et al., 2020</u></a>). In the past, the salmon industry has introduced vaccines to reduce antibiotic use, increased farm monitoring technologies, and employed veterinarians and marine biologists, not necessarily in preparation for getting certified (<a href=\"https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/bitstream/handle/11250/2468571/17449_FULLTEXT.pdf?sequence=1\"><u>Mjaugeto et al., 2017</u></a>).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221027153814/https://www.resolve.ngo/docs/appendices-only.pdf\"><u>Boyd and McNevin (2011</u></a>, pp. A-57\u2013A-64) further discuss counterfactuals.&nbsp;</p><p>Without paying attention to this, researchers could be overestimating the popularity of certifications among farmers. Researchers could look out for events such as the sudden dismantling or public relations crisis of a VCS as grounds for a quasi-experimental analysis. &nbsp;</p><p><i>Changes enforced by law:&nbsp;</i></p><p>Related to the above, to what degree does becoming certified allow farmers to pre-empt enforced changes to production practices (for example, relating to food safety, traceability, sustainability)? If voluntary certification introduction tends to be followed with mandatory standard introduction, certified farms may not end up paying a lot more than uncertified ones, and may in fact have an early mover advantage.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Comparative studies</strong></p><p>Future researchers could study multiple regions with different outcomes in parallel. For example, throughout the report, I highlighted the special disadvantages small farms face. But some farm auditing shows that shrimp farms of different sizes in Thailand show no significant difference in compliance with GLOBALG.A.P. criteria. What makes Thailand different? What can other countries learn from it?</p><p><strong>Gathering and using data</strong></p><p>Future researchers can consider gathering data, as its scarcity at a disaggregated level has hindered research. Some important levels of disaggregation include species of fishes, type of product (for example, frozen or chilled), scale and location of farms, and certification status of farms or fish. There could be many uses for such a database. For example, volumes of fish production and trade could be translated into numbers of individual fishes, which could help improve estimates of welfare impacts. &nbsp;</p><p>Some data scarcity may be an intractable problem.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://orgprints.org/id/eprint/8486/1/Organic_Farming_in_Europe_Volume07_The_European_Market_for_Organic_Products_Growth_and_Development.pdf\"><u>Michelson et al., 1999</u></a> noted that, even for more widely known categories like \u201corganic,\u201d and in markets as established as European markets, distinctions between product types don\u2019t appear in official statistical accounts.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/i1948e/i1948e.pdf\"><u>Washington and Ababouch (2011</u></a>) struggled to find empirical data on how certifications affect markets, international trade, and actors in seafood supply chains.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221027153814/https://www.resolve.ngo/docs/appendices-only.pdf\"><u>Boyd and McNevin (2011</u></a>) pointed out the difficulty of estimating how market forces generated by aquaculture certifications might affect production practices.&nbsp;</p><p>In some places, data is available and the opportunity would be turning that information into reliable macro-level indicators of impacts arising from certifications, measured across all certification schemes, seem to be missing. For example, within better-established eco-labels, researchers have tried to use \u201cland use changes, use of fish meal and other resources, water pollution, biodiversity impacts, predator control, food safety, and social issues,\u201d as macro-level indicators common across all farms, certified or not&nbsp; (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221027153814/https://www.resolve.ngo/docs/appendices-only.pdf\"><u>Boyd and McNevin, 2011</u></a>). But the criteria for measurement differs among programs, meaning the data is not readily comparable. Levels of compliance relative to standards may also differ between schemes, complicating the issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Future researchers should also be aware of opportunities for improving the empirical picture. Researchers can consider tapping into data sources such as&nbsp; supermarket scanner data, which is becoming more available. Bigger research budgets could also afford other data-gathering methods, such as surveying supermarkets for disaggregated product data (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/bb240e/bb240e.pdf\"><u>O\u2019Sullivan and Bengoumi, 2008</u></a>).</p><h3>Variations of the Question</h3><p><strong>Region</strong></p><p>Future researchers can consider studying the same question in different regions of the world. &nbsp;</p><p><i>Asia:</i>&nbsp;</p><p>Lower-middle income countries such as India and Vietnam are sizable producer-exporters who likely face the same struggles to an even greater extent. &nbsp;</p><p><i>South America:&nbsp;</i></p><p>Chile is an upper-middle income country with a large aquaculture export industry. It may provide an interesting contrast to China and Thailand because it appears to be more vertically integrated and more specialized in higher value species like Atlantic Salmon and Rainbow Trout. The Caribbean and, more generally, Latin America, also have large export surplus (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4060/ca9229en\"><u>FAO, 2020</u></a>) and could be places to direct more research.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Europe:</i>&nbsp;</p><p>highly developed Norway and the Netherlands are relatively large aquaculture producers deeply embedded in supply chains. Another point of difference is their locality to welfare-conscious markets, which could imply they suffer less of the trade, knowledge-of-the-market, and production constraint issues that China and Thailand might face (for example, whether transporting live or chilled fish to European countries is feasible). Studying them can bring a simpler, but perhaps clearer, perspective to the impacts of welfare certifications. Moreover, if we find that exporting countries won\u2019t engage much with certifications until they\u2019re well developed, it may make sense to study these more developed countries in order to apply those findings to advocacy in Asia later. Data is also likely to be more plentiful in these countries.</p><p><strong>Animal</strong></p><p>Future researchers can consider studying the same question in specific species of fishes or shrimp. I attempted doing this briefly, but not enough data was available in Asia. Outside of Asia, Atlantic Salmon is among the most-studied farmed fish species and could be a good candidate.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Actor</strong></p><p>Future researchers can identify influential actors along aquaculture value chains and consider how they might react differently to voluntary certifications. For example, compare:</p><ul><li>Extensive, semi-intensive and intensive farmers</li><li>Leading, niche, and lagging retailers</li><li>Leading and lagging wholesalers and processors</li><li>Highly vertically integrated and non-integrated suppliers</li></ul><p><strong>Analogies</strong></p><p>Sustainability, Organic, Food Safety, and many other VCS types may share similarities with more welfare-related schemes. Discovering how other schemes are analogous or disanalogous with welfare-related schemes could help advocates draw and apply knowledge from existing sources.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other expressions of standards</strong></p><p>Voluntary certification schemes are just one expression of animal welfare standards. Standards can be public or private, international, domestic or linked with trade, voluntary or enforced. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/the-determinants-of-adopting-international-voluntary-2#Table_2__Expressions_of_Standards_by_Scope_and_Enforceability__With_Examples__\">Table 2</a> illustrates how these qualities interact to produce different classes of standards. &nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Table 2.

The papers include both empirical and theoretical methods which can be adapted to answer the question, \u201cHow do voluntary certifications affect international farming practices?\u201d Some papers address components of the question. Others address it directly, with some modifications to the good, region, or standard in question. I expect extending and replicating many of the papers to be useful. &nbsp;</p><p>The columns in the spreadsheet contain information on the article name, author, date of publication, abstract, specific relevance to the question, methods used, product and region of interest, as well as some other information. More notes about the contents of the columns will be visible upon hovering over the column names. &nbsp;</p><p>Some of the most valuable papers there ask questions such as:</p><ul><li>What effect does internationalization of a firm have on its likelihood of implementing improved animal welfare practices?</li><li>How are animal production practices different on the ground between certified and uncertified firms?</li><li>How do rules and regulations affect volumes traded, or the kinds of producers included or excluded from global markets?</li><li>What would be an optimal range of certification schemes to promote the most welfare improvement in farms?</li><li>How do the costs and benefits farmers face weigh up against each other?&nbsp;</li></ul><p>There are some limitations to this approach. Some papers that study the impacts of governance mechanisms on production practices do so by assessing animal welfare on the ground. These could be difficult to adapt to the aquaculture context because of a lack of comparable data about fish welfare. As of now, there is no standardized, widely-used fish welfare assessment protocol. Future researchers can consider formulating one that can scale.&nbsp;</p><h3>Leveraging Economic Methods, Models, and Concepts</h3><p>In the rest of this subsection, I discuss some terms, topics, and methods that theoretical modeling techniques may connect to. Using these as search terms may be a good starting point for technically-minded economists.</p><p><strong>Equilibrium modeling</strong></p><p><i>Equilibrium displacement model:&nbsp;</i></p><p>A methodology for analyzing consumer demand and consumer welfare.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199569441.013.0012\"><u>Wohlgenant (2011)</u></a> provides some introduction. Constructing equilibrium displacement models becomes more complicated when attempting to account for substitution between different products, as well as firm entry and exit.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Spatial equilibrium model:</i>&nbsp;</p><p>These solve for the equilibria of markets in different regions at the same time. They can estimate the effects of transportation costs and trade policies on producer prices and volume and direction of trade. They may be especially useful for studying trade-linked standards.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ifpri.org/publication/spatial-equilibrium-model-agrodep\"><u>Bou\u00ebt and Metivier (2016)</u></a> has an introduction. Unfortunately, spatial equilibrium models may require region-, product-, and welfare-level-specific supply and demand elasticities, as well as cross-price elasticities, which may be difficult in fish supply chains. To address this, sensitivity analyses could be used to estimate these elasticities to within plausible ranges. Moreover, at least in comparison to equilibrium displacement models, spatial equilibrium models require linear or quadratic programming, so are more work to solve (M. St. Jules, 2022, personal communication).&nbsp;</p><p>Initial steps for researchers interested in equilibrium modeling may include outlining a model, listing the data that is needed to get it working in different contexts, listing ranges for the parameters of that model, and identifying how difficult data would be to get for different parameters. After this initial assessment, it may make sense to decide whether or not to go ahead with estimation. Awareness of data limitations seems especially important in the fish welfare context.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Concepts in marketing</strong></p><p><i>Vertical product differentiation:</i>&nbsp;</p><p>Occurs when, for example, two different goods exist and all consumers would prefer one to another if they were priced the same. Contrasts with horizontal price differentiation, where some consumers would buy one and some would buy the other at the same price. &nbsp;</p><p><i>Credence goods:&nbsp;</i></p><p>A good with \u201cqualities \u2026 which, although worthwhile, cannot be evaluated in normal use. Instead the assessment of their value requires additional costly information\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/724826\"><u>Darby and Karni, 1973</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p><i>Information asymmetry:</i>&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cOccurs when one party to a transaction has more or superior information compared to another\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asymmetricinformation.asp\"><u>Bloomenthal, 2021</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p><i>Signaling:&nbsp;</i></p><p>Under information asymmetry, signaling refers to the market process through which one individual seeks information about an uncertain investment, and another individual transmits information about the quality of that investment through observable characteristics (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/87/3/355/1909092?redirectedFrom=fulltext\"><u>Spence, 1973</u></a>). Studies of signaling encompass theory models about labels, standards and certifications.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Screening</i>:&nbsp;</p><p>Under information asymmetry, screening refers to \u201ca strategy [by uninformed agents to] \u2026 filter out false information and retain only the true information\u201d&nbsp; (<a href=\"https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/other/screening/\"><u>Corporate Finance Institute, 2022</u></a>). Screening may occur with 1) consumers supporting NGOs to expand certification schemes in order to use certifications as a screening tool for welfare content and 2) businesses closer to the consumer-end of the supply chain distinguishing between suppliers with different product qualities. For this second use,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652619303233\"><u>Sun and Wang (2019)</u></a> discuss traceability.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Endogenous market segmentation</i>:&nbsp;</p><p>Under information asymmetry, endogenous market segmentation refers to a theoretical process where \u201clow-quality sellers voluntarily reveal the quality of their units\u201d (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1756-2171.2012.00186.x\"><u>Kim, 2012</u></a>).</p><p><strong>Pricing</strong></p><p><i>Asymmetric price transmission</i>:&nbsp;</p><p>A pricing phenomenon when downstream prices (for example, retail prices) react differently to upstream prices (for example, input prices).</p><h2>Other Impacts of Voluntary Certification Schemes</h2><p>Above, I discussed methods that could be used directly to answer the question, or components of it. The remainder of this section is a somewhat more miscellaneous collection of prompts and background. They came to mind during my reading and have not gone through great prioritization or deliberate idea-generation processes. As such, any claims I make about their importance, feasibility, or usefulness will be weak.&nbsp;</p><h3>On the Wider Regulatory Landscape</h3><p><strong>Voluntary certifications in other regions</strong></p><p>Having spoken to many animal advocates over the course of writing this report, I got a sense that introducing welfare certifications in one country can encourage the introduction of certifications in other countries. It lowers the cost of having to develop standards and procedures from scratch. This is especially true for farming and slaughter operations that are especially uniform between countries, such as with broiler chickens. Indeed, we have seen the certification scheme ChinaGAP drawing from GLOBALG.A.P. And Brazil has stirrings of their own Better Chicken Commitment, originally from the United Kingdom (UK) and European countries. &nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes, the standards and procedures are directly ported over, and this can cause issues if the consumers in the different countries have different preferences. It can also be difficult to port standards over directly if farming procedures are drastically different. I expect these challenges to occur in fish, since species and farming practices can be drastically different between countries.&nbsp;</p><p>The strength of the effect of voluntary certifications in one country on their construction in another could also depend on the relative product ranges in each country. I expect that an increased product would require greater effort in building certifications, but could also make certification within each sector more approachable due to their smaller size. &nbsp;</p><p>Future researchers may gather evidence to affirm or refute these suspicions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Standard harmonization</strong></p><p>Throughout my search, many sources have suggested that the myriad of certification schemes is confusing for producers and consumers alike (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1070496517736872\"><u>Samerwong et al., 2017</u></a>). There have been calls for harmonization across standards. As certification schemes grow, these calls may become even more insistent, leading to reevaluations of standards. Over time, a couple of standards may emerge to dominate future expressions of standards thereafter. &nbsp;</p><p>Relatedly, I have observed standards bodies gradually shifting from species-specific standards towards standards that apply to many species or species groups at once. On one hand, consolidation may streamline certification processes, reduce certifier manpower, or present a unified front that makes things less confusing for consumers and implementers. On the other hand, I would not be surprised if standards became less granular and therefore less appropriate for species who have different needs than their species group. How does consolidation of standards affect the uptake of standards and subjective welfare of different species? &nbsp;</p><p>Predicting how standards may evolve, converge, or diverge, may be useful for advocates hoping to promote the best standards for animal welfare in the long run. It may also be useful for certifiers to prepare for incoming changes in the regulatory landscape.</p><p><strong>Government regulation</strong></p><p>Voluntary certifications have the potential to both support and detract from public regulatory efforts. In 2011, no definitive information was available on this (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221027153814/https://www.resolve.ngo/docs/appendices-only.pdf\"><u>Boyd and McNevin, 2011</u></a>), though things might be different now. &nbsp;</p><p><i>Prompting public standards and certifications:</i></p><p>Governments already have a history of introducing their own voluntary or mandatory certification schemes. China and Thailand have ChinaGAP and ThaiGAP. The European Union (EU) has Organic standards. Many countries have food safety import restrictions. What opportunities do government sentiments afford animal advocates?</p><p>For example,&nbsp;</p><ul><li>To what degree do different governments see introducing mandatory public certification as an opportunity to improve the competitiveness of their nation\u2019s industries?</li><li>To what degree can systems of organization behind certification schemes can also be mobilized to apply pressure for government action? This may have happened with U.S. federal effluent regulations being influenced by the stakeholders and NGOs that designed the voluntary Best Management Practices programs (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221027153814/https://www.resolve.ngo/docs/appendices-only.pdf\"><u>Boyd and McNevin, 2011</u></a>).</li><li>Can advocates collaborate with governments, gaining support by framing VCSs as governments\u2019 opportunity to observe how similar public policies might play out?&nbsp;</li></ul><p><i>Influencing public standards and certifications:</i></p><p>To the degree that public regulatory efforts are similar to voluntary certification schemes, governments can draw from certifiers\u2019 experiences. For example, public certification schemes could<i>&nbsp;</i>model after<i>&nbsp;</i>current private schemes\u2019 methods for standard-setting, registering, auditing, and other processes. They can avoid mistakes public programs have already made, and they could use resources already collected by private bodies, such as a list of important or influential stakeholders to engage with. &nbsp;</p><p><i>Or not\u2026?</i></p><p>There\u2019s a possibility that voluntary programs are not stepping stones to public regulation, but part of a wider persistent shift of governance responsibilities to businesses. Will voluntary certifications really be replaced or complemented by more effective national regulations and guidelines? Or will rules and regulations in food production be increasingly the jurisdiction of private bodies? What would the implications be for fish welfare?</p><p><strong>Methods for studying impacts on wider regulation</strong></p><p>To study how voluntary certifications have impacted other regulations, future researchers could study regulatory documents that were written or updated after the voluntary certification schemes were introduced. Documents may include:</p><ul><li>Standards expressed in voluntary or mandatory certifications</li><li>Business codes of conduct</li><li>Public or private production guidelines</li><li>More&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Researchers can look out for references to voluntary certification schemes or collaborations with those certifying bodies. The more references, the more likely that voluntary certification efforts made an impact. I admit this is a noisy method.&nbsp;</p><p>A second method could involve qualitatively assessing how attitudes towards animal welfare in an exporter country evolve as voluntary certifications hit their domestic markets. My sense is that animal nonprofits have already developed and executed this approach quite a bit.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, there is already academic literature around&nbsp;<i>public-private</i> hybrid governance, which could be a place for researchers to start.</p><h3>On the Subjective Experience of Fish</h3><p>This question is crucial to understanding the impact of certifications on fish and more research is needed. However, it is out of the scope of this economics-focused report. Animal behavior and welfare scientists may be better suited to this question.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, a good place for economists to start may include researching whether welfare levels in certified, exporting farms is meaningfully different from welfare levels in uncertified, exporting farms. The spreadsheet in the section <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/the-determinants-of-adopting-international-voluntary-2#Adapting_Existing_Journal_Articles\">Adapting Existing Journal Articles</a> has research designs for this.</p><h3>On Consumer Demand and Innovation</h3><p><strong>Consumer demand</strong></p><p>Ultimately, voluntary certifications improve producers\u2019 abilities to differentiate products by welfare level, and for consumers to distinguish between them. Given a trustworthy way of pointing out the otherwise invisible welfare content of fish and shrimp, adverse selection is less likely to occur. Theoretically,&nbsp; consumers and producers should become more likely to buy and sell low-welfare products. Empirically, what evidence do we have that voluntary certifications increase consumer demand for high-welfare goods? What evidence do we have that the presence of high-welfare items in the market generate new norms of eating higher-welfare fish?</p><p><strong>Innovation</strong></p><p>Relatedly, as demand grows, it becomes more profitable to innovate other methods, equipment, and practices for all points along the aquaculture. Innovations can increase welfare levels or decrease the cost of farming at those welfare levels. As the high-welfare market becomes more and more established, these benefits become less risky for suppliers to pursue. How might the introduction of VCSs spur welfare-oriented innovation?</p><h2>Questions Relevant to Fish and Shrimp Advocates and Grantmakers</h2><p>The following few questions are by no means the most important questions advocates and grantmakers should be answering. They have a place here because they came to mind most readily during my research. In fact, I expect some of the most important work facing researchers right now is figuring out what advocates and grantmakers really need to know, and then finding out whether those questions can be usefully answered.&nbsp;</p><h3>To What Extent Can Grants Help Lower the Barriers Farmers Face?</h3><p>Interventions such as subsidizing farmer certifications or promoting information about certification could help to overcome the cost and exposure issues farmers face. Considering these raises more questions. In particular:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>How cost-effective would it be to help farmers overcome barriers to certification?&nbsp;</li><li>What are the best intervention opportunities?&nbsp;</li><li>What barriers are more fundamental and may be highly infeasible to address?&nbsp;</li><li>To what degree do those more fundamental barriers limit the long term potential or scalability of certification schemes? &nbsp;</li></ul><p>Some candidate barriers that seem most difficult to address include the fixed-cost structure of auditing, the lack of comparability and transferability between private certifications, and the opacity of state certification.&nbsp;</p><h3>How Substitutable are Different Welfare Certifications to Consumers?&nbsp;</h3><p>Some evidence points to the possibility of a race to the bottom in the stringency of welfare certifications. In wild-captured fish, an FAO study by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/publications/details-publication/en/c/338303/\"><u>Lem et al. (2014)</u></a> found that, after a group of Alaskan salmon processors withdrew from Marine Stewardship Council certification, they continued selling salmon under a local public certification program. Their sales were not affected much. If certifications are very substitutable, it may help to lift the lowest standards or combine standards to raise them together. On the other hand, it appears that markets which consume some certification type (for example, organic) may also be interested in another certification type (for example, sustainable). For certifications that are more complementary like this, it may help to support certification schemes that don\u2019t yet have much traction.</p><h3>Altering, Introducing, and Improving Certification Standards</h3><p><i>Scheme stringency:</i></p><p>Loose restrictions may attract more producers than stricter ones, expanding the reach of a certification in a way that increases total impact. But weaker criteria can come at the cost of slightly lower welfare per fish, lose consumer trust, and on longer timescales, lower the chances of good welfare standards becoming enforceable through domestic law or trade agreements. What is the optimal stringency and in what species groups, countries, or production systems? How do the qualities of legal systems in different countries factor? How might multiple certification schemes coordinate to improve welfare across the board (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1070496517736872\"><u>Samerwong et al., 2018</u></a>)?&nbsp;</p><p><i>Stepwise approach to welfare certification:</i></p><p>For different species groups, the standards body Global Animal Partnership offers a VCS where producers can achieve different levels of certification within the same scheme&nbsp; (<a href=\"https://globalanimalpartnership.org/about/news/post/why-does-g-a-p-s-new-farmed-salmon-standard-have-3-steps/\"><u>Global Animal Partnership, 2022</u></a>). Each level has progressively more stringent standards. The highest levels could draw in suppliers who target consumers with the strongest interest in certified food. The lowest levels could draw in disadvantaged exporters who need certification for economic benefits, but may not have the resources to comply with other existing VCSs. How promising is this approach for capturing farmers with different goals or resources at hand? How does a stepwise approach within a single VCS compare to a stepwise approach across the entire VCS landscape?</p><h3>How Effective are Different Strategies for Improving Certification Uptake?</h3><p><i>Group model to certification:</i></p><p>ASC, GAA, and GLOBALG.A.P. have begun introducing a group model to certification. In this model, many small-scale farmers may pool resources to apply for certification of the collective (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/in-action/globefish/publications/details-publication/en/c/1415846/\"><u>FAO, 2021a</u></a>,<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/ai770e/ai770e.pdf\"><u> FAO, 2008</u></a>). Only a sample of farms out of the group are checked. How many farmers improve their practices who otherwise wouldn\u2019t? How great an effect does the looser auditing have on non-compliance? How likely is it that the legitimacy and representativeness concerns of the group model lead to reduced consumer trust?&nbsp;</p><p><i>Increased support to farmers:</i></p><p>Increasing financial support and offering information and training to farmers is thought to improve certification uptake (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1070496517736872\"><u>Samerwong et al., 2018</u></a>), but naturally has its costs. What is the optimal level of on-farm support to offer? To whom should this support be directed? Who pays\u2013consumers, philanthropists, or various suppliers?&nbsp;</p><p><i>Promoting interest to supplier groups:</i></p><p>Supplier groups are conglomerates of farms, processors and middlemen, but unlike lead firms of global value chains, their circle of influence may not be very integrated. Some existing supplier groups, such as the salmon group MAUI, have aimed to get all of its members ASC-certified by a certain date. Unlike standards bodies or CABs, they work with producers on the ground every day. Certifiers who support them may therefore have better access to changing production practices. However, I am skeptical that supplier groups would involve many small-scale farmers, or that less developed countries would have a critical mass of sufficiently connected suppliers to effectively coordinate. Further research into how effective targeting supplier groups might be could be useful.&nbsp;</p><h3>What are the Best Opportunities for Promoting Certified Products?</h3><p><i>Promoting interest along the supply chain:</i></p><p>Where along the supply chain are promotion efforts most effective? How do retailers, wholesalers, processors, or brokers exert different pressure on farmers\u2019 practices?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1759-5436.2001.mp32003003.x\"><u>Humphrey and Schmitz, (2001</u></a>) suggest targeting lead firms that govern global value chains.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1070496517736872\"><u>Samerwong et al., (2018</u></a>) emphasize the importance of brokers.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Promoting interest to consumers:</i></p><p>To the degree that certification schemes are a tool for transforming consumer preferences into market forces, promoting consumer interest may be one of the more fundamental places to intervene. It is thought that standards appreciated by large consumer groups are more likely to become powerful (<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13657305.2017.1356398\"><u>Alfnes et al., 2018</u></a>). What effect does promoting consumer interest in welfare certifications have? How long does it take for consumer interest to translate into market forces? How persistent or self-sustaining are these effects compared to others?</p><h3>Fundamental and Systemic Questions</h3><p><i>Do welfare certifications ultimately condone and cement intensive farming?</i></p><p>Companies take up certifications with the hope to move more products at higher prices. They are not inherently driven by concern for animal welfare. How do strategies look different if radical rather than incremental change is attempted? How does the effectiveness of the two approaches compare?</p><h2>Data and Resources</h2><h3>Data Sources</h3><ul><li>FAO</li><li>Rabobank</li><li>UN COMTRADE</li><li>Existing studies</li><li>Country statistics</li></ul><h3>Sources of Useful and Relevant Policy Reports</h3><ul><li>European Commission publications</li><li>FAO GLOBEFISH&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Nonprofit Research Centers</h3><ul><li>Fish Welfare Initiative</li><li>Aquatic Animal Alliance</li><li>Animal Ask</li><li>Aquatic Life Institute</li><li>Charity Entrepreneurship</li><li>Compassion in World Farming</li></ul><h3>Other Authors\u2019 Suggestions for Future Research</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/13657305.2017.1356398\"><u>Alfnes et al., (2018)</u></a></li></ul><h1>Limitations</h1><h2>Data Scarcity&nbsp;</h2><p>My research has limitations. Data scarcity has made it difficult to make confident claims. It has also been difficult to reliably answer even simple questions like&nbsp;<i>How much of total Asian production of different species is exported?</i> or&nbsp;<i>What proportion of the exporting industry ascribes to voluntary certification schemes?</i> I encourage readers to clarify crucial considerations before acting on anything written in this report. &nbsp;</p><p>The scarcity of data and empirical research on how certifications affect Asian aquaculture will also challenge future research attempts.</p><h2>Bias</h2><p>Two of my choices during the design of this research could lead to biased findings. I made both of these choices to cope with data scarcity. &nbsp;</p><p>First, though I emphasize findings about certifications explicitly meant to improve animal welfare, I also include findings about certifications centered around other topics like sustainability and organic. This could introduce bias because VCSs differ in their requirements and contexts \u2013 farmers and industries respond differently to them. Despite increasing bias, broadening the scope of my search gives me more information to go off.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, though I emphasize findings about certifications coming from China and Thailand, I also include findings from lower middle income Asian countries such as Vietnam and Bangladesh. My search also reflects trends in past researchers\u2019 interests, which has often focused on how small-scale farmers respond to certification schemes. Though small-scale farmers are very populous, they may not represent the typical farmer who is producing for export, or who animal advocates hope to target. Nevertheless, these findings may be relevant to poorer and less coordinated groups of producers in China and Thailand, so I have chosen to include particularly insightful studies.&nbsp;</p><p>To help address these biases, future researchers can consider investigating the differences between welfare certifications and other certifications. Grantmakers and advocates can consider incorporating research about larger exporters with better infrastructure into their decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the age and type of my sources could be a limitation. As certification systems and economies evolve, old findings become less relevant. There is also the limitation of relying on a body of research that often resorts to case studies for empirical information (elaborated in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221027153814/https://www.resolve.ngo/docs/appendices-only.pdf\"><u>Boyd and McNevin, 2011</u></a>). Future researchers may need to focus research designs on less changeable aspects of certification schemes, for example, avoiding assessing the impacts of specific criteria in standards if those criteria are likely to be different within a few years. They should also consider designing research projects that yield more generalizable findings than case studies do.</p><h2>Confounding and Counterfactuals</h2><p>As a literature review, this report suffers less from confounding and counterfactual issues. However, counterfactuals or natural experiments for future research about the impact of voluntary certifications may be difficult to find (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221027153814/https://www.resolve.ngo/docs/appendices-only.pdf\"><u>Boyd and McNevin, 2011</u></a>, p. A-57). Researchers may want to look out for events where a voluntary certification is suddenly dismantled or undergoes a PR crisis. They could be grounds for a quasi-experimental analysis.&nbsp;</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Though much evidence is weak and outdated, international voluntary certification schemes do not seem very conducive to improving the welfare level of exporting farmers' production practices in China and Thailand. Volumes of fish and shrimp certified by VCSs have been low. Fortunately, certification rates seem to increase over time. &nbsp;</p><p>Various factors help explain the weak influence of international VCSs in China and Thailand. For small-scale farmers, the benefits are not worth the particularly high costs. For large-scale farmers, my guess is that there are cheaper ways to gain the same benefits VCSs offer and that VCSs do not help these farmers into their targeted market segments. For farmers of all scales, market access seems to be the most significant benefit, and auditing the most significant cost.&nbsp;</p><p>Should international VCSs expand, I would expect market forces to drive the following changes to Chinese and Thai exporting industries:</p><ul><li>a greater number and proportion of higher-welfare fish to be farmed,</li><li>the average exporting farm raising certified fish to grow in size,</li><li>practices between larger and smaller farm operators to polarize,</li><li>an increased risk of entrenching low-welfare production practices in China and Thailand, and</li><li>a smaller volume of fish and shrimp produced globally. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>Much future research remains to be done in this area. In particular, I would recommend gathering better disaggregated data on certification rates among different species, farm sizes, geographical regions, and export orientations. Future research that could be especially useful to advocates and grantmakers includes investigating what changes to existing certification schemes are most promising, how effective different strategies for improving certification uptake might be, and to what extent grants can help lower barriers to certification.&nbsp;</p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><h2><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668686579/mirroredImages/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/fld3l9rszk7vqrncfpgg.png\"></h2><p><i>This post was written by me, Jojo Lee, in my capacity as a research fellow at Rethink Priorities.

Scope and Justification</h2><p>In this appendix, I justify the scope I chose to focus on in this project. I focus on farmed seafood (aquaculture) rather than wild-caught seafood (fisheries), voluntary certifications rather than enforceable production standards, responses of farmers targeting international markets rather than domestic markets, and upper-middle income Asian countries rather than any other region.&nbsp;</p><h3>Farmed Versus Wild-caught Seafood</h3><p>For much of world history, capture fisheries have been responsible for most of the world\u2019s fish production. But from the 1990s onwards, the growth of the world\u2019s aquaculture industries has been much faster than that of capture fisheries\u2013between 1996 and 2005, aquaculture produced an average of 34.2 million tons per year. By 2018, production had more than doubled to 82.1 million tons in 2018. By contrast, fish capture has been holding mostly stagnant over that period, producing between 89 and 96 million tons per year. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/the-determinants-of-adopting-international-voluntary-2#Figure_A_1__World_Capture_Fisheries_and_Aquaculture_Production_Update\">Figure A.1</a> presents a visualization of world trends&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/ca9229en/ca9229en.pdf\"><u>(FAO, 2020)</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Figure A.1: World Capture Fisheries and Aquaculture Production Update</strong></i></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668686579/mirroredImages/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/oe2vtualzlduufg4shnr.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1c4b38d7503ab0c9cb639c6d5c0cf77a5342d3b0204c9633.PNG/w_160 160w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1c4b38d7503ab0c9cb639c6d5c0cf77a5342d3b0204c9633.PNG/w_320 320w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1c4b38d7503ab0c9cb639c6d5c0cf77a5342d3b0204c9633.PNG/w_480 480w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1c4b38d7503ab0c9cb639c6d5c0cf77a5342d3b0204c9633.PNG/w_640 640w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1c4b38d7503ab0c9cb639c6d5c0cf77a5342d3b0204c9633.PNG/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1c4b38d7503ab0c9cb639c6d5c0cf77a5342d3b0204c9633.PNG/w_960 960w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1c4b38d7503ab0c9cb639c6d5c0cf77a5342d3b0204c9633.PNG/w_1120 1120w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1c4b38d7503ab0c9cb639c6d5c0cf77a5342d3b0204c9633.PNG/w_1280 1280w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1c4b38d7503ab0c9cb639c6d5c0cf77a5342d3b0204c9633.PNG/w_1440 1440w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1c4b38d7503ab0c9cb639c6d5c0cf77a5342d3b0204c9633.PNG/w_1516 1516w\"><figcaption><i>Note: This figure illustrates world production of fish by main production methods.

Globalization, trade liberalization, and technological progress have made aquaculture more feasible and profitable than before. And aquaculture has the advantage of highly malleable production processes, with predictable production quantities. In contrast, capture fisheries are dependent on wild fish stocks, which are declining in quantity and sustainability&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/su10124814\"><u>(Kim, 2018)</u></a><i>.&nbsp;</i>As such, aquaculture seems like a higher priority to research.&nbsp;</p><h3>Region</h3><p>Asia is home to countries with some of the greatest world aquaculture production and export. In 2019, China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Bangladesh were the biggest aquaculture producers of fish crustaceans, molluscs and other seafood groups (<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/fishery/static/Yearbook/YB2019_USBcard/booklet/web_cb7874t.pdf\"><u>FAO, 2021b</u></a>). &nbsp;</p><p>In particular, China, India, and Vietnam are especially large producer-exporters (see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/the-determinants-of-adopting-international-voluntary-2#Figure_A_2__Top_Exporters_of_Fish_and_Fish_Products_in_Terms_of_Value__2018\">Figure A.2</a>).

And the scale of their operations means that affecting their production practices could have potentially large ripple effects through aquaculture industries in the rest of Asia and the world.</p><p><i><strong>Figure A.2: Top Exporters of Fish and Fish Products in Terms of Value, 2018</strong></i></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668686579/mirroredImages/EpmJZcu7deMMo6WDg/kke68ca0fyzhktslznng.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/72e62d42719a78167b344cfea9d40d364248ac6c104c673a.PNG/w_110 110w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/72e62d42719a78167b344cfea9d40d364248ac6c104c673a.PNG/w_220 220w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/72e62d42719a78167b344cfea9d40d364248ac6c104c673a.PNG/w_330 330w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/72e62d42719a78167b344cfea9d40d364248ac6c104c673a.PNG/w_440 440w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/72e62d42719a78167b344cfea9d40d364248ac6c104c673a.PNG/w_550 550w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/72e62d42719a78167b344cfea9d40d364248ac6c104c673a.PNG/w_660 660w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/72e62d42719a78167b344cfea9d40d364248ac6c104c673a.PNG/w_770 770w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/72e62d42719a78167b344cfea9d40d364248ac6c104c673a.PNG/w_880 880w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/72e62d42719a78167b344cfea9d40d364248ac6c104c673a.PNG/w_990 990w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/72e62d42719a78167b344cfea9d40d364248ac6c104c673a.PNG/w_1085 1085w\"><figcaption><i>Note: This figure presents the top exporting countries of fish products, as a percentage of the global total.

Notably, Europe and the US are two trading blocs with significantly higher welfare standards than other large importers.&nbsp;</p><p>In the future, the aquaculture and fishery exports coming out of China are expected to grow at faster rates than more developed European countries (<a href=\"https://aquaculture2020.org/uploads/gca-tr9-value-chains-and-market-access-for-aquaculture-products.pdf\"><u>Ababouch et al., 2021</u></a>), though these expectations are complicated somewhat by the inclusion of fishery product growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, export and production volumes or value may not have a close relationship with how much is produced domestically for export. For example, Indian finfish is largely produced for domestic consumption, but higher value products like shrimp, lobster, and tuna may be primarily produced for overseas markets (<a href=\"https://ageconsearch.umn.edu/record/57413\"><u>Gopal et al., 2009</u></a>). The statistics about domestic production for export were hard to come by. &nbsp;</p><p>Additional reasons why Asian countries may be worth looking at is there is little domestic CSR pressure, so studies are more likely to be isolating the impacts of market forces, and animal advocacy activity in Asian countries is significantly underfunded and understudied compared to more western regions of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Reasons why Asian countries may not be worth looking into for a literature review may include the scarcity of literature on their interactions with certification schemes. Europe and the US are better candidates in this sense. Historically, China in particular has been difficult to start grassroots change because starting charities there requires affiliation with Chinese politics. However, work there is becoming more accessible (<a href=\"https://files.fwi.fish/China_Scoping_Report.pdf\"><u>Gibson et al., 2020</u></a>).</p><h3>Standard Enforceability, Geographical Scope, and Beneficiaries</h3><p>I became interested in voluntary certification schemes standards because there seems to be more Effective Animal Advocacy work on them. So far, there has been a big push for them in chicken. There appears to be discussion for fish\u2013also intensively farmed for meat\u2013to come next. Getting a clearer idea of whether these certifications actually make a difference overseas seems valuable to funders and advocates in the EA fish space. &nbsp;</p><p>A second reason why it is better to look at farmed fish voluntary certifications rather than enforceable ones is because fish have very limited legal protections for enforceable standards to leverage. &nbsp;</p><p>The situation is worse for internationally enforceable standards: very few international regulations, restrictions, or agreements call on animal welfare specifically. When they have, scientific and public consensus on the importance of this animal suffering has been crucial (<a href=\"https://dalspace.library.dal.ca/bitstream/handle/10222/76756/Sykes-Katie-PhD-Law-November-2019.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\"><u>Sykes, 2019</u></a>). In particular, involving animal welfare standards in import restrictions is thought to interfere with principles of free trade, a major legal hurdle, though some argue it can be overcome. In this category, wrapping animal welfare considerations into bilateral or multilateral trade agreements seems slightly more doable. This topic is elaborated on in the Legal Hurdles section of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards\"><u>Animal Ask (2022</u></a>). In general, advocating for the enforcement of international standards seems relatively more intractable than other animal welfare options (<a href=\"https://3394c0c6-1f1a-4f86-a2db-df07ca1e24b2.filesusr.com/ugd/9475db_c06c0cce4deb44a39cfc6544cbbe0e38.pdf\"><u>Cox, 2020</u></a>). &nbsp;</p><p>I have also chosen to focus on international voluntary standards rather than domestic ones. This is because the theory of change for international standards is more direct. Domestically enforceable standards may be influential internationally only to the degree they are influential domestically. This mechanism would be better studied in two parts, and also seems understudied, making it unsuitable for a literature review of this small scale.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, there are arguments that look into voluntary certifications with global scope might not be as impactful as looking into standards elsewhere in the matrix. One main possibility is that enforceable national-level regulations may be more feasible than I expected and also much longer lasting. In those and probably other scenarios, I would be more interested in the international impact of enforceable, domestic regulations than I am now.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I focus on both business-to-consumer and business-to-business certifications. So certifications with labels facing consumers as well as those designed to smooth business-to-business dealings are included in my investigation. Both can be relevant to animal advocates and changing production practices.</p><h3>Producing for Export Versus for Domestic Consumption</h3><p>Another choice I made was to focus on exporters who are producing fish products destined for export rather than for local markets. These may be financed or owned by either Asian nationals or overseas groups. &nbsp;</p><p>I made this choice mainly because I felt that producers for export were much more likely to be affected by voluntary certifications building overseas. However, many producers are driven by domestic markets over international markets, so this is a gap potentially worth further investigation.</p><h3>Species</h3><p>Because different species of fishes can have very different welfare requirements, I considered focusing on a specific species or seafood group. However, given the lack of empirical studies to draw from and my relative lack of focus on fish\u2019s subjective experiences, I ended up reviewing literature relating to all farmed vertebrates in the clade&nbsp;<i>Actinopterygii,&nbsp;</i>referred to as \u201cfish\u201d throughout this report, as well as shrimp and prawns. I have excluded bivalves, molluscs, and other crustaceans from the study. &nbsp;</p><p>When more studies get published in the future, it may be worthwhile for future reviewers to focus on the species most exported from China or India to Europe or the US. Looking at intensively or semi-intensively studied species, which are more likely to have a wider scope of potential variation in production practices, could also be valuable.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S1751731118000940\"><u>Toni et al. (2018)</u></a> gives more details on more commonly studied fish species and how often different environmental parameters are observed.&nbsp;</p><h3>Other Out of Scope Questions</h3><p>Despite their importance, the following questions have also been excluded out of interest for time.</p><ul><li>How does the adoption of standards affect fish\u2019s subjective experiences\u2013for example, is one method of slaughter meaningfully different from another? This is a massive, ongoing field of scientific research.&nbsp;</li><li>How does the adoption of animal welfare standards affect and empower advocates abroad\u2013for example, can standards in one country be taken up with little friction elsewhere, accelerating advocacy efforts?</li><li>To what degree do people actually comply with key standards in farmed animal welfare, having implemented them? Jennifer Kirsch notes that \u201cseveral standards that are too general or otherwise fail to actually improve the animals' lives.\u201d</li></ul><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnlb797986jgg\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreflb797986jgg\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Projections are complicated by the inclusion of wild-capture product growth.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnqjvagm39sd\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefqjvagm39sd\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Aquaculture operations are classified as either&nbsp;<i>intensive</i>,&nbsp;<i>semi-intensive</i>, or&nbsp;<i>extensive</i>, to describe the amount of product that a site produces and, roughly, the amount of human intervention used to produce it.
