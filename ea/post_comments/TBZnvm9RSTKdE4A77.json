So it's important for us to think about which issues have room to compromise and which don't. The whole idea of extreme self-sacrifice has pretty mixed effects, so we don't need it in a bigger effective altruism movement. The importance of evidence and reason in altruistic actions is what's new and indispensible.

However, when someone does a small amount for others, if they're giving a small amount to highly effective causes, they can be a very important part of the extended altruism community.

But their openness and refusal to be exclusive \u2013 to demand standards for belonging \u2013 is also their downfall. By agreeing not to erect any high threshold for belonging, the liberal Protestant churches make their boundaries so porous that everything of substance leaks out, mingling with the secular culture around them.</p>\n<p>So what if liberal Protestants kept their open-minded, tolerant theology, but started being strict about it \u2013 kicking people out for not showing up, or for not volunteering enough? Liberals have historically been wary of authority and its abuses, and so are hesitant about being strict. But strictness matters, if for no other reason because conservatives are so good at it: most of the strict, costly requirements for belonging to Christian churches in American today have to do with believing theologies that contradict science, or see non-Christians as damned. What if liberal Protestantism flexed its muscle, stood up straight, and demanded its own standards of commitment \u2013 to service of God and other people, to the dignity of women, and to radical environmental protection? Parishioners would have to make real sacrifices in these areas, or they\u2019d risk exclusion. They couldn\u2019t just talk the talk.
