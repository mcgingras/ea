I currently use Obsidian for longer-form note taking and building up more complex thoughts, but mainly I just use backlinks; the Roam-style graph view is hip but I don't find it particularly useful. Then I use apple notes for on-the-fly, unimportant jots that I may or may not get ingested by Obsidian in a more structured form when I'm on my computer. I manage all of my productivity and to-do lists on one Apple note and my Apple calendar. &nbsp;Longer-form works of writing that have taken something of a single cohesive shape get their own Google docs. &nbsp;Finally, I manage all my sources on Zotero, with a few folders for broad subject areas and one big messy folder where I dump forum and blog posts I've read or skimmed that I might want to find later. I also read and annotate all PDFs within Zotero.</p><p>I'm pretty happy with this system currently, although I wish I had a good, easy-to-set up Zotero-Obsidian integration, and that it was easier to copy-paste links between Markdown and plain text editors. If anyone has suggestions on either of these that'd be great.</p><p>In general, I think it's a well-explored space and imo nobody has come up with anything that's convincingly a large productivity multiplier; for me, it doesn't seem like a promising place too put too much thought into at the moment. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NfdHG6oHBJ8Qxc26s/the-zettelkasten-method-1#comments\">This comment thread</a> on LessWrong raises some more interesting points.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Toby Weed"}}]
