Given the per capita cost of establishing the system is $0.07, and the system may have overlapping benefits for all diseases, the intervention seems very cost-effective. Such surveillance systems may have a strong use case for antimicrobial resistance and novel pathogen detection (especially those with pandemic potential).\"</strong></i></p><p>I don't understand why you make the leap to ISDR seeming \"very cost-effective\" t based on the low cost and potential overlap for other diseases. Having seen these kind of vague programs in Uganda, the net benefit might be close to zero, so it's dangerous to make assumptions of any impact at all. This kind of system will never detect a new pathogen, and unless it actually changes behaviour of prescribing health professionals (unlikely), then I don't see how it would prevent antimicrobial resistance.</p><p>Out of interest as wellwhat triggered you to focus on Bacterial Meningitis? It seems to me instinctively like a fairly well understood problem, with vaccines already available for Meningitis and in development for Group B strep. You might have found something promising in your research but it seems unlikely.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "NickLaing"}}, {"_id": "bbeebu3fgDftAkCj2", "postedAt": "2023-04-03T12:39:50.930Z", "postId": "JgexokNweDkTbkynG", "htmlBody": "<p>Interesting analysis.
