We aren't connected in any official capacity and haven't collaborated on any projects.<br>For the events we run, they are focused on students and young professionals that haven't engaged with AI safety arguments or the community before. LISA is more focused on those already doing relevant research. As office spaces, the majority of our users attend as individuals (working independently or as the only person from their organisation), while LISA is hosts organisations and up-skilling programs. Our office has a wider focus than just AI safety although I expect there is some overlap in the people we would accept, and a small number of users that are signed up to both offices.</p>", "parentCommentId": "YsKZyntJyTEcEn5Fz", "user": {"username": "Joe Hardie"}}, {"_id": "xSKGyFkyTe73F9ELN", "postedAt": "2024-01-11T19:34:24.159Z", "postId": "2M4KQWBoNiLpWFb8r", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks!</p>", "parentCommentId": "6s6tGGfjyQ7XHEtTB", "user": {"username": "Vael Gates"}}]
