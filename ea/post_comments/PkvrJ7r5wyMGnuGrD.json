I don\u2019t really mean to over-index on these examples. I actually feel like a decent majority of what I wish that EA had been doing differently relates to this wholesomeness stuff. However, I\u2019m choosing examples that are particularly easy to talk about \u2014 around FTX and around mistakes I've made \u2014 because I have good visibility of them, and in order not to put other people on the spot. Although I\u2019m using these examples to illustrate my points, my beliefs don\u2019t hinge too much on the particulars of these cases. (But the fact that the \u201cfailures of wholesomeness\u201d frame can be used to provide insight on a variety of different types of error does increase the degree to which I think there\u2019s a deep and helpful insight here.)</p><p><strong>Fraud at FTX</strong><br>To the extent that the key people at FTX were motivated by EA reasons, it looks like a catastrophic failure of wholesomeness \u2014 most likely supported by a strong desire for expedience and a distorted picture where people's gut sense of what was good was dominated by the terms where they had explicit models of impact on EA-relevant areas. It is uncomfortable to think that people could have caused this harm while believing they were doing good, but I find that it has some plausibility. It is hard to imagine that they would have made the same mistakes if they had explicitly held \u201cbe wholesome\u201d as a major desideratum in their decision-making.</p><p><strong>EA relationship to FTX</strong><br>Assume that we don't get to intervene to change SBF\u2019s behaviour. I still think that EA would have had a healthier relationship with FTX if it had held wholesomeness as a core virtue. I think many people had some feeling of unwholesomeness associated with FTX, even if they couldn't point to all of the issues. I think focusing on this might have helped EA to keep FTX at more distance, not to extol SBF so much just for doing a great job at making a core metric ($ to be donated) go up, etc. It could have gone a long way to reducing inappropriate trust, if people felt that their degree of trust in other individuals or organizations should vary not just with who espouses EA principles, but with how much people act wholesomely in general.</p><p><strong>My relationship to attraction</strong><br>I had an unhealthy relationship to attraction, and took actions which caused harm. (I might now say that I related to my attraction as unwholesome \u2014 arguably a mistake in itself, but compounded because I treated that unwholesomeness as toxic and refused to think about it. This blinded me to a lot of what was going on for other people, which led to unwholesome actions.)</p><p>Though I now think my actions were wrong, at some level I felt at the time like I was acting rightly. But (though I never explicitly thought in these terms), I do not think I would have felt like I was acting wholesomely. So if wholesomeness had been closer to a core part of my identity I might have avoided the harms \u2014 even without getting to magically intervene to fix my mistaken beliefs.</p><p>(Of course this isn\u2019t precisely an EA error, as I wasn\u2019t regarding these actions as in pursuit of EA \u2014 but it\u2019s still very much an error where I\u2019m interested in how I could have avoided it via a different high-level orientation.)</p><p><strong>Wytham Abbey</strong><br>Although I still think that the Wytham Abbey project was wholesome in its essence, in retrospect I think that I was prioritizing expedience over wholesomeness in choosing to move forward quickly and within the EV umbrella. I think that the more wholesome thing to do would have been, up front, to establish a new charity with appropriate governance structures. This would have been more inconvenient, and slowed things down \u2014 but everything would have been more solid, more auditable in its correctness. Given the scale of the project and its potential to attract public scrutiny, having a distinct brand that was completely separate from \u201cthe Centre for Effective Altruism\u201d would have been a real benefit.</p><p>I knew at the time that that wasn\u2019t entirely the wholesome way to proceed. I can remember feeling \u201cyou know, it would be good to sort out governance properly \u2014 but this isn\u2019t urgent, so maybe let\u2019s move on and revisit this later\u201d. Of course there were real tradeoffs there, and I\u2019m less certain than for the other points that there was a real error here; but I think I was a bit too far in the direction of wanting expedience, and expecting that we\u2019d be able to iron out small unwholesomenesses later. Leaning further towards caring about wholesomeness might have led to more-correct actions.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt"}}, {"_id": "5kfTw8Poe3riRdTCw", "postedAt": "2024-02-29T20:39:34.806Z", "postId": "PkvrJ7r5wyMGnuGrD", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Executive summary</strong>: Acting wholesomely feels aligned with commonsense morality but has tensions with some EA principles like \"shut up and multiply\".
