In the context of the American system, that sentence would convey something about offense severity -- and it would drastically understate it where a street dealer in illegal drugs might get the same sentence. So because of the background severity of sanctioning, the five-year sentence is inadequate to convey the appropriate degree of societal condemnation.

Or maybe the reality -- some people have argued that the court should consider SBF's loss of reputation and loss of massive earning capacity, which sounds a whole lot to me like taking his privilege into account.

Targeting vulnerable victims also gets you an enhancement for other reasons (e.g., it suggests a more extensive lack of moral compass that makes me value incapacitation more as a sentencing goal).</p><p>But most fundamentally, both harm and culpability go into the mix, filtered through the standard purposes of sentencing, to produce a sentence that I think is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to accomplish those goals.</p><p>So I can tell you that the relationship between harm and sentence in fraud cases shouldn't be -0-, both because there is little or no general deterrence against making your frauds bigger, and because there is some relationship between culpability and fraud size. It also shouldn't be linear, both because this is impractical given the wide variance in harms, and because the degree of culpability does not ordinarily vary in a linear manner.&nbsp;</p><p>Most people in the sentencing realm think the federal sentencing guidelines increase the sentence too much based on loss amount (~ 25% uplift for each doubling of amount, plus some other uplifts tend to scale with size) and give too much weight to loss size in general. I agree with both of those views. Roughly and after considering a fuller measure of harm than aggregate financial loss, I might consider such an algorithm appropriate for weighing the <i>harm factor</i> in arriving at a sentence rather than for uplifting the sentence itself. And maybe I would increase the average sentence about 10% for each doubling, if all other factors were equal (low confidence)? But usually non-harm culpability factors increase with harm size, so the average increase in practice would probably be higher (low confidence).</p><p>As a bonus exercise: The differential impact between harm and non-harm culpability factors seems to vary quite a bit based on offense type. In drunk driving cases, actual harm seems to explain the bulk of the variance? No harm, first offense -- 2 days. Kill someone, no harm -- perhaps 10 years. The non-harm culpability factors and even the expected-harm measures aren't really that different in a lot of cases. Even here, the extra punishment for multiplied harm isn't linear; you might get a 50% uplift for the second fatality, and a total of 85% more for three fatalities (low confidence)?&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, if you rob five convenience stores on five days before getting caught, you might get twice the sentence for robbing one (low confidence) -- even though the culpability scales here much more obviously with the number of offenses / amount of harm. One theory here is that getting caught and punished gives you the opportunity to learn your lesson; if you rob again after going through that then the argument for long-term incapacitation is stronger, etc.</p>", "parentCommentId": "SByd8YFdvAdE68Jm2", "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "KGy7w4FrWZLfaDWmA", "postedAt": "2024-03-29T01:34:01.614Z", "postId": "bNWgMHAsXdpwiSphN", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>Also, 16 million is peanuts for someone who's personally worth 2-10 billion</p></blockquote><p>If you're going to compare outflows to guess at motivation, I think it's better to use actual charitable giving numbers as the comparator rather than perceived wealth.

(But sure, you can say that, since nothing happened there, it was only talk. We don't know, but I find it plausible that he'd have liked the thought of being the guy who prevented Trump from running!)</li></ul><p>Edit: If someone says \"giving 10 million to his parents (and a house, but we're not sure if the house had other uses) shows he must have had mixed motives,\" I'd be like: Okay, yeah, it does look like this isn't what a utilitarian robot would've gone for, but when I hear \"mixed motives,\" I think of something like 50-50 or at least 40-self-oriented, 60-altruism, whereas giving money to get your parents to retire early could also be compatible with something like 10-90 (or even 5-95), \"focus on impact for the big decisions, but do something nice for your parents once you've made it big.\"&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "KGy7w4FrWZLfaDWmA", "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}, {"_id": "dxwMKkf9QD4cgjnbq", "postedAt": "2024-03-29T11:36:16.316Z", "postId": "bNWgMHAsXdpwiSphN", "htmlBody": "<p>yes, that's right.</p>\n<p>I can think of grounds to disagree, though. Say for example you were able to disproportionately protect e.g. white people from being prosecuted for jaywalking. I think jaywalking shouldn't be illegal, so in a sense any person you protect from prosecution is a win.

So even though there would be less direct harm, there might be more indirect harm.</p>\n<p>I think the indirect harms are at work in this case too, and it's just a matter of how you weigh them up.
