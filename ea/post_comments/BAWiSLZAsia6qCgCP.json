That's why I wrote <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1cq/does_effective_altruism_lead_to_the_altruistic/\">this post</a> asking others for counterarguments. After reading the comments on that post (one of which linked to <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1781092\">this article</a>), I became persuaded that I was wrong. </p>\n<p>Here's an additional counterargument. Let's say that I have two choices:</p>\n<p>A. I can save 1 person from a disease that decreases her quality of life by 95%; or</p>\n<p>B. I can save 5 people from a disease that decreases their quality of life by 90%.</p>\n<p>My intuition is that it is better to save the 5. Now let's say I get presented with a second dilemma:</p>\n<p>B. I can save 5 people from a disease that decreases their quality of life by 90%; or</p>\n<p>C. I can save 25 people from a disease that decreases their quality of life by 85%. </p>\n<p>My intuition is that it is better to save the 25. Now let's say I get presented with a third dilemma.</p>\n<p>C. I can save 25 people from a disease that decreases their quality of life by 85%; or</p>\n<p>D. I can save 125 people from a disease that decreases their quality of life by 80%. </p>\n<p>My intuition is that it is better to save the 125. This cycle continues until the seventeenth dilemma:</p>\n<p>Q. I can save 152,587,890,625 people from a disease that decreases their quality of life by 15%; or</p>\n<p>R. I can save 762,939,453,125 people from a disease that decreases their quality of life by 10%.</p>\n<p>My intuition is that it is better to save the 762,939,453,125.</p>\n<p>Since I prefer R over Q and Q over P and P over O and so on and so forth all the way through preferring C over B and B over A, it follows that I should prefer R over A.</p>\n<p>In other words, our intuition that providing a large benefit to one person is less important than providing a slightly smaller benefit to several people conflicts with our intuition that providing a very large benefit to one person is more important than providing a very small benefit to an extremely large number of people. Given <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hw/scope_insensitivity/\">scope insensitivity</a>, I think the former intuition is probably more reliable.</p>\n<p>One last point. I think that EA has a role even under your worldview.

But, is this assumption true? For example, is it actually the case that Bob had an equal chance to be in Amy's or Susie's position? If it is the case, then saving the greater number would in effect give each of them a 2/3 chance of being saved (the best chance as you rightly noted). But if it isn't, then why should an agreement based on a false assumption have any force? Suppose Bob, in actuality, had no chance of being in Amy's or Susie's position, then is it really in accordance with reason and empathy to save Amy and Susie and give Bob zero chance? </p>\n<p>Intuitively, for Bob to have had an equal chance of being in Amy's position or Susie's position or his actual position, he must have had an equal chance of living Amy's life or Susie's life or his actual life. That's how I intuitively understand a position: as a life position. To occupy someone's position is to be in their life circumstances - to have their life. So understood, what would it take for Bob to have had an equal chance of being in Amy's position or Susie's position or his own? Presumably, it would have had to be the case that Bob was just as likely to have been born to Amy's parents or Susie's parents or his actual parents. But this seems very unlikely because the particular \u201csubject-of-experience\u201d or \u201cself\u201d that each of us are is probably biologically linked to our ACTUAL parents' cells. Thus another parent could not give birth to us, even though they might give birth to a subjective-of-experience that is qualitatively very similar to us (i.e. same personality, same skin complexion, etc).  </p>\n<p>Of course, being in someone's position need not be understood in this demanding (though intuitive) way. For example, maybe to be in Amy's position just requires being in her actual location with her actual disease, but not e.g. being of the same sex as her or having her personality. But insofar as we are biologically linked to our actual parents, and parents are spread all over the world, the odds of Bob having had an equal chance of being in his actual position (i.e. a certain location with a certain disease) or in Amy's position (i.e. a different location with an equally painful disease) is highly unlikely. Think also about all the biological/personality traits that make a person more or less likely to be in a given position. I, for example, certainly had zero chance of being in an NBA position, given my height. Of course, as we change in various ways, our chances to be in certain positions change too, but even so, it is extremely unlikely that any given person, at any given point in time, had an equal chance of being in any of the positions of a trade off situation that he is later to be involved in. </p>\n<p>UPDATE (ADDED ON MAR 18): I have added the above two paragraphs to help first-time readers better understand how I understand &quot;being in someone's position&quot; and why I think it is most unlikely that Bob actually had an equal chance of being in Amy's or Susie's position. These two paragraphs have replaced a much briefer paragraph, which you can find at the end of this reply. UPDATE (ADDED ON MAR 21): Also, no need to read past this point since someone (kbog) made me realize that the question I ask in the paragraph below rests on a misunderstanding of the veil-of-ignorance approach.</p>\n<p>Also, what would the implications of this objection be for cases where the pains involved in a choice situation are unequal? Presumably, EA favors saving a billion people each from a fairly painful disease than a single person from the excruciating pain of being burned alive.

Were I to suffer many pains, I (just me) suffers all of them in such a way that there is a very clear sense how they, cumulatively, are worse to endure than just one of them. Thus, I find intra-personal aggregation of pains intelligible. I mean, when an old man reminiscing about his past says to us, &quot;The single worst pain I had was that one time when I got shot in the foot, but if you asked me whether I'd go through that again or all those damn'ed headaches I had over my life, I would certainly ask for the bullet.&quot;, we get it.

That someone raised (if I remember correctly) the following objection: If there was a burning house and you could either save the boy trapped inside or a painting hanging on the wall which you could sell and use that money to save 100 kids in a third world country from a similar pain that the boy would face, you should obviously save the boy. But EA says to save the painting. Therefore EA is false. Professor MacAskill's response (if I remember correctly) was to bite the bullet and say that while it might be hard to stomach, that is really what we should do. </p>\n<p>If professor MacAskill's view represents EA's position, then I assume that if you concede that we should flip a coin in such a case, then there is an issue.</p>\n<p>Regarding whether my argument recommends anything in the real world, I think it does. </p>\n<p>First, just to be clear, since we cannot give each person a chance of being helped that is proportionate to what they have to suffer, I said that I personally would choose to use my money to help anyone among the class of people who stands to suffer the most (see Section F.). Just to be clear, I wouldn't try to give each of the people among this class an equal chance because that is equally impossible. I would simply choose to help those who I come across or know about I guess. Note that I didn't explain why I would choose to help this class of people, but the reason is simply that were it possible to give each person a chance of being helped proportional to their suffering, those who stand to suffer the most have the highest chance of winning. (I have since updated the post to include this explanation, thanks.)</p>\n<p>I think, now that I have clarified my position, it should be clear that my way of things can recommend actions. There are many opportunities where donating almost certainly prevents or alleviates a certain extreme suffering to someone. Maybe depression is not one of those cases, but I would imagine that severe malnutrition is very painful. So is torture (which oftentimes can be prevented if a ransom is paid). Since the pattern of donation that EA promotes is likely very different from the pattern of donation that arises from my way of things, my way of things provides a real alternative practically speaking (but maybe up to a limit before the patterns of donations would converge).</p>\n<p>Btw, I would not be absolutely against giving to GiveDirectly if there is a statistically good chance that they will prevent or alleviate at least one person from one of the worst kinds of suffering AND there wasn't any other cheaper practical way to help that very person (which is likely the case because we don't even know who that person is). However, I would personally donate to charities where there is a near certainty of prevention of alleviation simply because at the end of the day my donation actually helped someone, whereas a statistically good chance may not pan out, in which case I haven't helped the worst off</p>\n<p>Yes, by doing so, I perhaps end up allowing someone to suffer in one of the worst ways who otherwise wouldn't have suffered had I (and everyone else) given to GiveDirectly. But, as I made more clear in Section F., there is no way to give each person an appropriate chance of being helped, not even if we just considered those people who stand to suffer the worst. And so, at the end of the day, I am forced to make a choice to help a particular person anyways.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "rXcs9ZvP9NwGnmx89", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}, {"_id": "vDAESuRPiS4nE2hzT", "postedAt": "2018-03-13T23:52:54.758Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Michael, </p>\n<p>Thanks very much for your response. </p>\n<p>UPDATE (ADDED ON MAR 16):</p>\n<p>I have shortened the original reply as it was a bit repetitive and made improvements in its clarity. However, it is still not optimal. Thus I have written a new reply for first-time readers to better appreciate my position. You can find the somewhat improved original reply at the end of this new reply (if interested):</p>\n<p>To be honest, I just don't get why you would feel the same if the 5 minor headaches were spread across 5 people. Supposing that 5 minor headaches in one person is (experientially) worse than 1 major headache in one person (as you request), consider WHAT MAKES IT THE CASE that the single person who suffers 5 minor headaches is worse off than a person who suffers just 1 major headache, other things being equal. </p>\n<p>Well, imagine that we were this person who suffers 5 minor headaches. We suffer one minor headache one day, suffer another minor headache sometime after that, then another after that, etc. By the end of our 5th minor headache, we will have experienced what it\u2019s like to go through 5 minor headaches. After all, we went through 5 minor headaches! Note that the what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-5-headaches consists simply in the what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-the-first-minor-headache then the what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-the-second-minor-headache then the what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-the-third-minor-headache, etc. Importantly, the what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-5-headaches is NOT whatever we experience right after having our 5th headache (e.g. exhaustion that might set in after going through many headaches or some super painful headache that is the &quot;synthesis&quot; of the intensity of the past 5 minor headaches). It is NOT a singular/continuous feeling like the feeling we have when we're experiencing a normal pain episode. It is simply this: the what-it\u2019s-like of going through one minor headache, then another (sometime later), then another, then another, then another. Nothing more. Nothing less.</p>\n<p>Now, by the end of our 5th minor headache, we might have long forgotten about the first minor headache because, say, it happened so long ago. So, by the end of our 5th minor headache, we might not have an accurate appreciation of what it\u2019s like to go through 5 minor headaches even though we in fact have experienced what it\u2019s like to go through 5 minor headaches. As a result, if someone asked us whether we\u2019ve been through more pain due to our minor headaches or more pain through a major headache that, say, we recently experienced, we would likely incorrectly answer the latter. </p>\n<p>But, if we did have an accurate appreciation of what it\u2019s like to go through 5 minor headaches, say, because we experienced all 5 minor headaches rather recently, then there will be a clear sense to us that going through them was (experientially) worse than the major headache. The 5 minor headaches would each be \u201cfresh in our mind\u201d, and thus the what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches would be \u201cfresh in our mind\u201d. And with that what-it\u2019s-like fresh in mind, it seems clear to us that it caused us more pain than the major headache did. </p>\n<p>Now, a headache being \u201cfresh in our mind\u201d does not mean that the headache needs to be so fresh that it is qualitatively the same as experiencing a real headache. Being fresh in our mind just means we have an accurate appreciation/idea of what it felt like, just as we have some accurate idea of what our favorite dish tastes like. </p>\n<p>Because we have appreciations of our past pains (to varying degrees of accuracy), we sometimes compare them and have a clear sense that one set of pains is worse than another. But it is not the comparison and the clear sense we have of one set of pain being worse than another that ultimately makes one set of pains worse than another. Rather, it is the other way around. It is the what-it\u2019s-like-of-having-5-minor-headaches that is worse \u2013 more painful \u2013 than the what-it\u2019s-like-of-having-a-major-headache. And if we have an accurate appreciation of both what-it\u2019s-likes, then we will conclude the same. But, when we don\u2019t, then our own conclusions could be wrong, like in the example provided earlier of a forgotten minor headache. </p>\n<p>So, at the end of the day, what makes a person who has 5 minor headaches worse off than a person who has 1 major headache is the fact that he experienced what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches. </p>\n<p>But, in the case where the 5 minor headaches are spread across 5 people, there is no longer the what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches because each of the 5 headaches is experienced by a different person. As a result, the only what-it\u2019s-like present is the what-it\u2019s-like-of-experiencing-one-minor-headache. Five different people each experience this what-it\u2019s-like, but no one experiences what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches. Moreover, the what-it\u2019s-like of each of the 5 people cannot be linked to form the what-it\u2019s-like-of-experiencing-5-minor headaches because the 5 people are experientially independent beings.</p>\n<p>Now, it's clearly the case that the what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-1-minor-headache is not worse than the what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-a-major-headache. Given what I said in the previous paragraph, therefore, there is nothing present that could be worse than the what-it\u2019s-like-to-go-through-a-major-headache in the case where the 5 minor headaches are spread across 5 people. Therefore, 5 minor headaches, spread across 5 people, cannot be (and thus is not) worse (experientially speaking) than one major headache. </p>\n<p>Therefore, &quot;conditional on agreeing 5 minor headaches in one person is worse than 1 major headache in one person, ... [one should not] feel exactly the same if it were spread out over 5 people.&quot;!</p>\n<p>Finally, since 5 headaches, spread across 5 people, is not EXPERIENTIALLY worse than another person's single major headache, therefore the case in which Emma would suffer a major headache is MORALLY worse than the case in which 5 different people would each suffer a minor headache. (If you disagree with this, please see Objection 1.2 and my response to it) Therefore what I said in choice situation 3 holds.  </p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>The somewhat improved though sub-optimal original reply:</p>\n<p>To be honest, I just don't get why you would feel the same if the pains were spread out over 5 people. I mean, when the 5 minor headaches occur in a single person, then FOR that person, there is a very clear sense how the 5 headaches are worse to endure than 1 major headache. But once the 5 minor headaches are spread across 5 different people, that clear sense is lost because each of the 5 people only experiences at most 1 minor headache. In each experiencing only 1 minor headache, NOT ONE of the 5 people experience something worse than a major headache (e.g., what Emma would go through). So none of them would individually be worse off than Emma. Are you really ready to say that the 5 of them together are worse off than Emma? But in what sense? Certainly not in any experiential sense (since none of them individually experiences anything worse than a major headache and they are experientially independent of each other).

And secondly, thanks for your response. </p>\n<p>My view is that we should give each person a chance of being helped that is proportionate to what they each have to suffer. It is irrelevant to me how many people there are who stand to suffer the lesser pain. So, for example, in the first choice situation you described, my intuition is to give the single person roughly slightly over a 50% chance of being saved and the others slightly under 50% of being saved. This is because the single person would suffer slightly worse than any one of the others, so the single person gets a slightly higher chance. It is irrelevant to me how many people have 90% to lose in quality of life, whether it be 5 or 5 billion. </p>\n<p>So if 760 billion people have 10% to lose where the single person has 90% to lose, my intuition is to give the single person roughly a 90% chance of being saved and the other 760 billion a 10% of being saved. </p>\n<p>In my essay, I in effect argued that everyone would have this intuition if properly appreciated the following two facts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>That were the 760 billion people to suffer, none of them would suffer anywhere near the amount the single person would. Conversely, were the single person to suffer, he/she would suffer so much more than any one of the 760 billion.</li>\n<li>Which individual suffers matters because it is the particular individual who suffers that bears all the suffering. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>I assume that we should accept the intuitions that we have when we keep all the relevant facts at the forefront of our mind (i.e. when we properly appreciate them). I believe the intuitions I mentioned above (i.e. my intuitions) are the ones people would have when they do this. </p>\n<p>Regarding your second point, I have to think a little more about it! </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "yWkostDhMfCzXdHNu", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}, {"_id": "zpDxooiABYSY6yWPD", "postedAt": "2018-03-14T00:33:18.350Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<p>If you think PETA is the best bet for reducing suffering, you might want to check out other farm animal advocacy organizations at <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/\">Animal Charity Evaluators'</a> website.

But the question then is whether this hypothetical contractual approach can serve as a \u201creasonable way of adjudicating between the interests of different numbers of people suffering different amounts of pain\u201d since your intuition might not be the same as the person whose fate might rest in your hands.

And this is because you agree that one subject-of-experience going through 5 headaches is not identical to five independent subjects-of-experience each going through 1 headache. You would say, &quot;Obviously they are not identical. The problem, however, is that - in case A, for example - there simply is no fact of the matter as to how many subjects-of-experience there were over those 5 days IN THE FIRST PLACE so saying that one subject-of-experience experienced all 5 headaches is arbitrary.&quot; </p>\n<p>I hope that was an accurate portrayal of your view. </p>\n<p>Let us then try to build some consensus from the ground up:</p>\n<p>First, there is surely experience. That there is experience, whether it be pain experience or color experience or whatever, is the most obvious truth there is. I assume you don't deny that. Ok, so we agree that </p>\n<p>1) there is experience. </p>\n<p>Second, well, each experience is clearly SOMEONE'S experience - it is experience FOR SOMEONE. Suppose there is a pain experience - a headache. Someone IN PARTICULAR experiences that headache. Let's suppose you're not experiencing it and that I am. Then I am that particular someone. I assume you don't deny any of that. Ok, so we agree that </p>\n<p>2) there is not just experience, but that for every experience, there is also a particular subject-of-experience who experiences it, whether or not a particular subject-of-experience can also extend through time and be the subject of multiple experiences. </p>\n<p>That's all the consensus building I want to do right now.</p>\n<p>Now, let me report something about myself (for the sake of argument, just assume it's true): I felt 5 headaches over the past 5 days. Here (just as in case A) you would say that there is no fact of the matter whether one subject-of-experience felt those 5 headaches or five different subjects-of-experience felt those 5 headaches, even though the \u201cI\u201d in \u201cI just felt 5 headaches\u201d makes it SOUND LIKE there was only one subject-of-experience. </p>\n<p>If I then say that, \u201cno no, there was just one subject-of-experience who felt those 5 headaches\u201d, your question (and challenge) to me is what is my criteria for saying that there was just one subject-of-experience and not five. More specifically, you ask whether memory-continuity and personality-continuity are necessary conditions for being the same subject-of-experience over the 5 days, \u201csame\u201d in the sense of being numerically identical and not qualitatively identical. </p>\n<p>Here\u2019s my answer:</p>\n<p>I\u2019m sure philosophers have tried to come up with various criteria. Presumably that\u2019s what philosophers engaged in the field called \u201cpersonal identity\u201d in part do, though I don\u2019t know much about that field. Anyways, presumably they are all trying to come up with a criteria that would neatly accommodate all our intuitive judgements in specific (perhaps imagined) cases concerning personal identity (e.g., split brain cases). A criteria that succeeded in doing that would presumably be regarded as the \u201ctrue\u201d or \u201ccorrect\u201d criteria. In other words, the ONLY way philosophers have for testing their criteria is presumably to see if their criteria would yield results that accord with our intuitions. Moreover, if the \u201ccorrect\u201d criteria is found, philosophers are presumably going to say that it is correct not merely in the sense that it accurately describes the implicit/sub-conscious assumptions that we hold about personal identity which have led us to have the intuitions we have. Indeed, presumably, they are going to say that the criteria is correct in the stronger sense that it accurately describes the conditions under which a subject-of-experience IN REALITY is the same numerical subject over time. Insofar as they would say this, philosophers are assuming that our intuitive judgements represent the truth (i.e. the way things actually are). For only if the intuitions represented the truth would it be the case that a criteria that accommodated all of them would thereby be a criteria that described reality. </p>\n<p>But then the question is, do our intuitions represent the truth? I don\u2019t know, and so even if I were able to give you a criteria that accommodated all our intuitions and that, according to this criteria, there was only one subject-of-experience who experienced all 5 headaches over those 5 days, I would not have, in any convincing way, demonstrated that there was in fact only one subject-of-experience who experienced all 5 headaches over those 5 days, instead of 5 independent subjects-of-experience who each experienced 1 headache. For you can always ask what reasons I have for taking our intuitions to represent the truth. I don\u2019t think there is a convincing answer. So I don\u2019t think presenting you with criteria will ultimately satisfy you, at least I don\u2019t think it should. </p>\n<p>Of course, that\u2019s not to say that we wouldn\u2019t know what would have to be the case for it to be true that one subject-of-experience experienced all 5 headaches over the 5 days: That would be true just in case one subject-of experience IN FACT experienced all 5 headaches over the 5 days. We just don\u2019t know if that is the case. And I have just argued above that providing a criteria that accords with all our intuitions won\u2019t really help us to know if that is the case either.  </p>\n<p>So, what reason can I give for believing that there really was just one subject-of-experience who experienced all 5 headaches over those 5 days? Well, what reason can YOU give for saying that there isn\u2019t a fact of the matter as to whether there was one subject-of-experience who experienced all 5 headaches over those 5 days or give independent subjects-of-experience who each experienced only 1 headache over those 5 days?</p>\n<p>Are we at a standstill? We would be if neither of us can provide reasons for our views. Your view attributes a fundamental indeterminate-ness to the world itself, and I wonder what reason you have for such a view.</p>\n<p>I have a reason for believing my view. But this reply is already very long, so before I describe my reason, I would just like some confirmation that we\u2019re on the same page. Thanks.</p>\n<p>P.S. I'll just add (as a more direct response to the first paragraph of your response): Yes, I can imagine 5 headaches by either imagining myself in the shoes of one person for 5 days or imagining myself in the shoes of 5 different people for one day each. In both cases, I imagine 5 headaches. True. BUT. When I imagine myself in the shoes of 5 different people for one day each, what is going on is that one subject-of-experience (i.e. me), takes on the independent what-it's-likes (i.e. experiences) associated with the 5 different people, and IN DOING SO, LINKS THESE what-it's-likes - which in reality are experientially independent of each other - TOGETHER IN ME. So ultimately, when I imagine myself in the shoes of 5 different people for one day each, I am, in effect, imagining what it's like to go through 5 headaches. \nBut in reality, there is no such what-it's-like among the 5 different people. The only what-it's-like present is the what-it's-like-of-going-through-1-headache, which each of the 5 different people would experience. </p>\n<p>In essence, what I am saying is that when you or I imagine ourselves in the shoes of 5 different people for a day each, we do end up with the (imagined) what-it's-like-of-going-through-5-headaches, but there is no such what-it's-like in reality among those different 5 people. But there needs to be in order for their 5 independent headaches to be worse than a major headache. I hope that made sense. If it didn't, then I guess you can ignore these last two paragraphs.   </p>\n<p>P.S.S. As a more direct response to your questions in the second paragraph of your response: it would still be possible IF the person is still the same subject-of-experience after the radical change in personality and loss of memory. It is impossible between two different people because they are numerically different subjects-of-experience.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "45T4t5inEYHRHxY3r", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}, {"_id": "dqwX77cyrmNm9Yqjt", "postedAt": "2018-03-16T03:36:34.931Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<p>Imagine you have 5 headaches, each 1 minutes long, that occur just 10 seconds apart of each other.

If there is, then this subject experiences what it's like of going through 5 pains (since, in fact, this subject has gone through 5 pains, whether he remembers going through them or not). Importantly, the what-it's-like-of-going-through-5-pains is just the collection of the past 5 singular pain episodes, not some singular/continuous experience like an feeling of exhaustion or some super intense pain from the synthesis of the intensity of the 5 past pains. It is this what-it's-like that can plausibly be worse than the what it's like of going through a major pain. Since there could only be this what-it's-like when there is a single subject who experiences all 5 pains, therefore 5 pains spread across 5 people cannot be worse than a major pain (since, at best, there would only be 5 experientially independent what-it's-like-of-going-through-1-minor-headache).</p>\n<p>My latest reply to Michael_S focuses on the question whether there could be a single subject-of-experience who extends through time, and thus capable of feeling multiple pains. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "ganJLMLtTGEFdWR4T", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}, {"_id": "h3kPhCaHJnhxLgpNR", "postedAt": "2018-03-17T02:21:08.400Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<p>I'd say I'm making two arguments:</p>\n<p>1) There is no distinct personal identity; rather it's a continuum.

Rather, it's simply a statement that if everybody argued as Bob did (not just regarding charity donations, but in general), we'd be living in a much unhappier society.</p>\n<p>If you're unmoved by this framing, consider this slightly different framing, illustrated by a thought experiment: Let's say that Bob successfully argues his case to the donor, who gives Bob a 1/2 chance of being helped. For the purpose of this experiment, it's best to not specify who in fact gets helped, but rather to just move forward with expected utilities. Assuming that his suffering was worth -1 utility point, consider that he netted 1/2 of an expected utility point from the donor's decision to give everyone an equal chance. (Also assume that all realized painful incidents hereon are worth -1 utility point, and realized positive incidents are worth +1 utility point.)</p>\n<p>The next day, Bob gets into a car accident, putting both him and a separate individual (say, Carl) in the hospital. Unfortunately, the hospital is short on staff that day, so the doctors + nurses have to make a decision. They can either spend their time to help Bob and Carl with their car accident injuries, or they can spend their time helping one other indivdual with a separate yet equally painful affliction, but they cannot do both. They also cannot split their time between the two choices. They have read your blog post on the EA forum and decide to flip a coin. Bob once again gets a 1/2 expected utility point from this decision.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Bob's hospital stay cost him all his savings. He and his brother Dan (who has also fallen on hard times) go to their mother Karen to ask for a loan to get them back on their feet. Karen, however, notes that her daughter (Bob and Dan's sister) Emily has also just asked for a loan for similar reasons. She cannot give a loan to Bob and Dan and still have enough left over for Emily, and vice versa. Bob and Dan note that if they were to get the loan, they could both split that loan and convert it into +1 utility point each, whereas Emily would require the whole loan to get +1 utility point (Emily was used to a more lavish lifestyle and requires more expensive consumption to become happier). Nevertheless, Karen has read your blog post on the EA forum and decides to flip a coin. Bob nets a 1/2 expected utility point from this decision.</p>\n<p>What is the conclusion from this thought experiment? Well, if decisions were made to your decision rule, providing each individual an equal chance of being helped in each situation, then Bob nets 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/2 = 3/2 expected utility points. Following a more conventional decision rule to always help more people vs. less people if everyone is suffering similarly (a decision rule that would've been agreed upon behind a veil of ignorance), Bob would get 0 (no help from the original donor) + 1 (definite help from the doctors + nurses) + 1 (definite help from Karen) = 2 expected utility points. Under this particular set of circumstances, Bob would've benefitted more from the veil of ignorance approach.</p>\n<p>You may reasonably ask whether this set of seemingly fantastical scenarios has been precisely constructed to make my point rather than yours. After all, couldn't Bob have found himself in more situations like the donor case rather than the hospital or loan cases, which would shift the math towards favoring your decision rule? Yes, this is certainly possible, but unlikely. Why? For the simple reason that any given individual is more likely to find themselves in a situation that affects more people than a situation that affects few. In the donor case, Bob had a condition where he was in the minority; more often in his life, however, he will find himself in cases where he is in the majority (e.g., hospital case, loan case). And so over a whole lifetime of decisions to be made, Bob is much more likely to benefit from the veil-of-ignorance-type approach.</p>\n<p>Based on your post, it seems you are hesitant to aggregate utility over multiple individuals; for the sake of argument here, that's fine. But the thought scenario above doesn't require that at all; just aggregating utility over Bob's own life, you can see how the veil-of-ignorance approach is expected to benefit him more. So if we rewind the tape of Bob's life all the way back to the original donor scenario, where the donor is mulling over whether they want to donate to help Bob or to help Amy + Susie, the donor should consider that in all likelihood Bob's future will be one in which the veil-of-ignorance approach will work out in his favor moreso than the everyone-gets-an-equal-chance approach. So if this donor and other donors in similar situations are to commit to one of these two decision rules, they should commit to the veil of ignorance approach; it would help Bob (and Amy, and Susie, and all other beneficiaries of donations) the most in terms of expected well-being.</p>\n<p>Another way to put this is that, even if you don't buy that Bob should put himself behind a veil of ignorance because he knows he doesn't have an equal chance of being in Amy's and Susie's situation, and so shouldn't decide to sign a cooperative agreement with Amy and Susie, you should buy that Bob is in effect behind a veil of ignorance regarding his own future, and therefore should sign the contract with Amy and Susie because this would be cooperative with respect to his future selves. And the donor should act in accord with this hypothetical contract.</p>\n<p>I would respond to the second point, but this post is already long enough, and I think what I just laid out is more central.</p>\n<p>I will also be bowing out of the discussion at this point \u2013 not because of anything you said or did, but simply since it took me much more time to write up my thoughts than I would have liked. I did enjoy the discussion and found it useful to lay out my beliefs in a thorough and hopefully clear manner, as well as to read your thoughtful replies.

Well, say I'm choosing between the World Food Programme (WFP) and some other charity, and I have $30 to donate. According to WFP, $30 can feed a person for a month (if I remember correctly). If I donate to the other charity, then WFP in its next operation will have $30 less to spend on food, meaning someone who otherwise would have been helped won't be receiving help. Who that person is, we don't know. All we know is that he is the person who was next in line, the first to be turned away.</p>\n<p>Now, you disagree with this. Specifically you disagree that it could be said of any SPECIFIC person that, if I don't donate to WFP, that it would be true of THAT person that he won't end up receiving help that he otherwise would have. And this is because:</p>\n<p>1) HE - that specific person - still had a chance of being helped by WFP even if I didn't donate the $30. For example, he might have gotten in line sooner than I'm supposing he has. And you will say that this holds true for ANY specific person. Therefore, the phrase &quot;he won't end up receiving help&quot; is not guaranteed. </p>\n<p>2) Moreover, even if I do donate the $30 to WFP, there isn't any guarantee that he would be helped. For example, HE might have gotten in line way to late for an additional $30 to make a difference for him. And you will say that this holds true for ANY specific person. Therefore, the phrase &quot;that he otherwise would have&quot; is also not guaranteed. </p>\n<p>In the end, you will say, all that can be true of any SPECIFIC person is that my donation of $30 would raise THAT person's chance of being helped. </p>\n<p>Therefore, in the real world, you will say, there's rarely a trade-off choice situation between specific people. </p>\n<p>I am tempted to agree with that, but two points:</p>\n<p>1) There still seems to be a trade off choice situation between specific groups of people: i.e. the group helped by WFP and the group helped by the other charity.<br />2) I think, at least in refugee camps, there is already a list of all the refugees and a document specifying who in specific is next in line to receive a given service/aid. In these cases, we will be faced with a trade off choice situation between a specific individual (who we would be helping if we donated to the refugee camp) and whatever group of people that would be helped by donating to another charity. I wonder what percentage of real life situations are like this. \nMoreover, if you're looking for real life trade off situations between some specific person(s) and some other specific person or specific group, they are clearly not hard to find. For example, you can either help a specific homeless man vs whoever. Or you can help a specific person avoid torture by helping pay off a ransom vs whoever else by helping a charity. Or you can spend fund a specific person's cancer treatment vs whoever. Etc...  </p>\n<p>My overall point is that trade off situations of the kind I describe in my paper are very real and everywhere EVEN IF it is true that there are trade off situations of the nature you describe.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "uCbnmhekipZ4ifxnQ", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}, {"_id": "veeLhHi448TeTvde3", "postedAt": "2018-03-17T19:14:47.889Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<p>1) A subject of experience is just something which &quot;enjoys&quot; or has experience(s), whether that be certain visual experiences, pain experiences, emotional experiences, etc...

That is, for example, why we don't feel concerned when we step on grass: it doesn't feel pain or feel anything. On the other hand, a cow is a subject-of-experience - it presumably has visual experiences and pain experience and all sorts of other experiences. Or more technically, a subject-of-experience (or multiple) may be realized by a cow's physical system (i.e. brain). There would be a single subject-of-experience if all the experiences realized by the cow's physical system are felt by a single subject.

It's been a pleasure : ) If you change your mind and decide to reply, definitely feel welcome to. </p>\n<p>Btw, for the benefit of first-time readers, I've updated a portion of my very first response in order to provide more color on something that I originally wrote. In good faith, I've also kept in the response what I originally wrote. Just wanted to let you know. Now onto my response.</p>\n<p>You write, &quot;In the donor case, Bob had a condition where he was in the minority; more often in his life, however, he will find himself in cases where he is in the majority (e.g., hospital case, loan case).

That is, Bob would have a higher chance of being in the majority in any given future trade off situation if Bob has an equal chance of being in any of the positions of a given trade off situation. Importantly, just because there is more positions on the majority side of a trade off situation, that does not automatically mean that Bob has a higher chance of being among the majority. His probably or chance of being in each of the positions is crucial. I think you were implicitly assuming that Bob has an equal chance of being in any of the positions of a future trade off situation because he doesn't know his future. But, as I mentioned in my previous post, it would be a mistake to conclude, from a lack of knowledge about one's position, that one has an equal chance of being in any one's position. So, just because Bob doesn't know anything about his future, it does not mean that he has an equal chance of being in any of the positions in the future trade off situations that he is involved in.</p>\n<p>In my original first response to you, I very briefly explained why I think people in general do not have an equal chance of being in anybody's position. I have sense expanded that explanation. If what I say there is right, then it is not true that &quot;over a whole lifetime of decisions to be made, Bob [or anyone else] is much more likely to benefit from the veil-of-ignorance-type approach [than the equal-chance approach].&quot;</p>\n<p>All the best!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "KQAt5ei5Xb4nsG7hP", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}, {"_id": "QEdcepv9HrNpf8Lzr", "postedAt": "2018-03-18T23:34:48.234Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<p>Just to make sure we're on the same page here, let me summarize where we're at:</p>\n<p>In choice situation 2 of my paper, I said that supposing that any person would rather endure 5 minor headaches of a certain sort than 1 major headache of a certain sort when put to the choice, then a case in which Al suffers 5 such minor headaches is morally worse than a case in which Emma suffers 1 such major headache.

E.g.: it is okay to have sex with Michelle, and it is okay to marry Tiffany, but it is not okay to do both.&quot;</p>\n<p>Your reductio-by-analogy (I made that phrase up) doesn't work, because your analogy is relevantly different. In your analogy, we are dealing with the relation of _ being heavier than _, whereas I'm dealing with the relation of _ being experientially worse than _. These relations are very different in nature: one is quantitative in nature, the other is experiential in nature. You might insist that this is not a relevant difference, but I think it is when one really slows down to think about exactly what is it that makes 5 minor headaches experientially worse than a major headache. </p>\n<p>As I mentioned, the answer is the what-it's-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches. That is, the what-it's-like of going through one minor headache, then another (sometime later), then another, then another, then another. It's THAT SPECIFIC WHAT-IT'S-LIKE that can plausibly be experientially worse than a major headache. It's THAT SPECIFIC WHAT-IT'S-LIKE that can plausibly be &quot;shittier&quot; or &quot;sucker&quot; than a major headache.</p>\n<p>However, when the 5 minor headaches are spread across 5 people, there is just 5 what-it's-likes-of-going-through-1-minor-headache, and no single what-it's-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches. Why? Because each of the minor headaches in this situation would be felt by a numerically non-identical subject-of-experience (i.e. 5 people), and numerically different subjects-of-experience cannot have their experiences &quot;linked&quot;. Otherwise, they would not be numerically different.  </p>\n<p>Therefore, only 5 minor headaches, when all had by one subject-of-experience (i.e. one person) can they be experientially worse than one major headache. And therefore, 5 minor headaches, when all had by one person, is experientially worse than 5 minor headaches, spread across 5 people. </p>\n<p>I think what I just said above shows clearly how the relation of _ being experientially worse than _ is impacted by whether the 5 minor headaches are all had by one person or spread across 5 different people. Whereas the relation of _ being heavier than _ is not similarly affected. So that is the relevant difference. </p>\n<p>I hope you can really consider what I'm saying here.

As I tried to explain, the &quot;experientially-worse-than&quot; relation is impacted by whether the X (e.g. 5 minor headaches) are spread across 5 people or all had by one person, whereas the &quot;heavier-than&quot; relation is not impacted by whether X (e.g. 100 tons) are spread across 5 objects or true of 1 object. </p>\n<p>3) &quot;Yes, but the question here is whether 5 what-it's-lies-of-going-through-1-minor-headache is 5x worse than 1 minor headache.

Someone by the name of &quot;kbog&quot; recently read my very first reply to you (the updated edition) and raised basically the same concern as you have here, and I think I have responded to him pretty aptly. So if you don't mind, can you read my discussion with him:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1lt/is_effective_altruism_fundamentally_flawed/dmu\">http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1lt/is_effective_altruism_fundamentally_flawed/dmu</a></p>\n<p>I would have answered you here, but I'm honestly pretty drained from replying to kbog, so I hope you can understand. Let me know what you think. </p>\n<p>Regarding defining S1, I don't think I can do better than to say that S1 is a thing that has, or is capable of having, experience(s). I add the phrase 'or is capable of having' this time because it has just occurred to me that when I am in dreamless sleep, I have no experiences whatsoever, yet I'd like to think that I am still around - i.e. that the particular subject-of-experience that I am is still around. However, it's also possible that a subject-of-experience exists only when it is experiencing something. If that is true, then the subject-of-experience that I am is going out of and coming into existence several times a night. That's spooky, but perhaps true. </p>\n<p>Anyways, I can't seem to figure out why you need any better of a definition of a subject-of-experience than that. I feel like my definition sufficiently distinguishes it from other kinds of things. Moreover, I have provided you with a criteria for identity over time. Shouldn't this be enough? </p>\n<p>You write, &quot;I think moral personhood doesn't make sense as a binary concept (the mind from a brain is different at different times, sometimes vastly different such as in the case of a major brain injury) The matter in the brain is also different over time (ship of Theseus).&quot;</p>\n<p>I agree with all of this, but I would insist those NEED NOT BE numerical differences, just qualitative differences. A mind can be very qualitatively different (e.g. big personality change) from one moment to the next, but that does not necessarily mean that it is a numerically different mind. Likewise, a brain can be very qualitative different (e.g. big change in shape) from one moment to the next, but that does not necessarily mean that it is a numerically different brain. </p>\n<p>You then write, &quot;I don't see a good reason to call these the same person in a moral sense in a way that two minds of two coexisting brains wouldn't be.&quot;</p>\n<p>Well, if a particular mind is the numerically same mind before and after a big qualitative change (e.g., due to a brain injury), then clearly there is reason to call it the same mind/person in a way that two minds of two coexisting brains wouldn't be. After all, it's the numerically same mind, whereas two minds of two coexisting brains are clearly two numerically different minds. </p>\n<p>You might agree that there is a literal reason to call it the same mind, but deny that there is a moral reason that wouldn't be true of two minds of two coexisting brains. But I think the literal reason constitutes or provides the moral reason: if a mind is numerically the same mind before and after a big qualitative change (e.g. big personality change), then that means whatever experiences are had by that mind before and after the change are HAD BY THAT NUMERICALLY SAME MIND. So if that particular mind suffered a headache before the radical change and then suffered a headache after the change, it is THAT PARTICULAR MIND THAT SUFFERS BOTH. That is enough reason to also call that mind the same mind in a moral sense that wouldn't also be true of two numerically different minds of two coexisting brains.</p>\n<p>I didn't quite understand the sentences after that. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "QKD6ijmbcNZQGY3hM", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}, {"_id": "Z5JHuyukywPeAW7wf", "postedAt": "2018-03-22T01:32:28.461Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<p>Hey Brian, </p>\n<p>I just wanted to note that another reason why you might not want to use the veil-of-ignorance approach to justify why we should save the greater number is that it would force you to conclude that, in a trade off situation where you can either save one person from an imminent excruciating pain (i.e. being burned alive) or another person from the same severe pain PLUS a third person from a very minor pain (e.g. a sore throat), we should save the second and third person and give 0 chance to the first person. </p>\n<p>I think it was F.

I know what the positive case is for the approach of automatically saving two people vs. one: maximizing aggregate utility, which I see as the most rational, impartial way of doing good. But what's the case for giving everyone an equal chance? What's gained from that? Why prioritize &quot;chances&quot;? I mean, giving Bob a chance when most EAs would probably automatically save Amy and Susie might make Bob feel better in that particular situation, but that seems like a trivial point, and I'm guessing is not the main driver behind your reasoning.</p>\n<p>One way of viewing &quot;giving everyone an equal chance&quot; is to give equal priority to different possible worlds. I'll use the original &quot;Bob vs. a million people&quot; example to illustrate. In this example, there's two possible worlds that the donor could create: in one possible world Bob is saved (world A), and in the other possible world a million people are saved (world B). World B is, of course, the world that an EA would create every time. As for world A, well: can we view this possible world as anything but a tragedy? If you flipped a coin and got this outcome, would you not feel that the world is worse off for it? Would you not instantly regret your decision to flip the coin? Or even forget flipping the coin, we can take donor choice out of it; wouldn't you feel that a world where a hurricane ravaged and destroyed an urban community where a million people lived is worse than a world where that same hurricane petered out unexpectedly and only destroyed the home of one unlucky person?</p>\n<p>If so, then why give tragic world A any priority at all, when we can just create world B instead? I mean, if you were asked to choose between getting a delicious chocolate milkshake vs. a bee sting, you wouldn't say &quot;I'll take a 50% chance of each, please!&quot; You would just choose the better option. Giving any chance, no matter how small, to the bee sting would be too high. Similarly, giving any priority to tragic world A, even 1 in 10 million, but be too high.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "Z5JHuyukywPeAW7wf", "user": {"username": "brianwang712"}}, {"_id": "XPvAy5fv4NdLgbicv", "postedAt": "2018-03-23T16:35:44.843Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Brian, </p>\n<p>I think the reason why you have such a strong intuition of just saving Amy and Susie in a choice situation like the one I described in my previous reply is that you believe Amy's burning to death plus Susie's sore throat involves more or greater pain than Bob's burning to death. Since you think minimizing aggregate pain (i.e. maximizing aggregate utility) is what we should do, your reason for just Amy and Susie is clear.</p>\n<p>But importantly, I don't share your belief that Amy's burning to death and Susie's sore throat involves more or greater pain than Bob's burning to death. On this note, I have completely reworked my response to Objection 1 a few days ago to make clear why I don't share this belief, so please read that if you want to know why. On the contrary, I think Amy's burning to death and Susie's sore throat involves just as much pain as Bob's burning to death. </p>\n<p>So part of the positive case for giving everyone an equal chance is that the suffering on either side would involve the same LEVEL/AMOUNT of pain (even though the suffering on Amy's and Susie's side would clearly involve more INSTANCES of pain: i.e. 2 vs 1.)</p>\n<p>But even if the suffering on Amy's and Susie's side would involve slightly greater pain (as you believe), there is a positive case for giving Bob some chance of being saved, rather than 0. And that is that who suffers matters, for the reason I offered in my response to Objection 2. I think that response provides a very powerful reason for giving Bob at least some chance, and not no chance at all, even if his pain would be less great than Amy's and Susie's together. \n(My response to Objection 3 makes clear that giving Bob some chance is not in conflict with being impartial, so that response is relevant too if you think doing so is being partial)</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, I think one's intuitions are based on one's implicit beliefs and what one implicitly takes into consideration. Thus, if we shared the same implicit beliefs and implicitly took the same things into consideration, then we would share the same intuitions. So one way to view my essay is that it tries to achieve its goal by doing two things:</p>\n<p>1) Challenging a belief (e.g. that Amy's burning to death plus Susie's sore throat involves more pain than Bob's burning to death) that in part underlies the differences in intuition between me and people like yourself.</p>\n<p>2) Reminding people of another important moral fact that should figure in their implicit thought processes (and thus be reflected in their intuitions): that who suffers matters. This moral fact is often forgotten about, which skews people's intuitions. Once this moral fact is seriously taken into account, I bet people's intuitions would not be the same. Importantly, I bet the vast majority of people (including yourself) would feel that giving Bob some chance of being saved is more appropriate than none, EVEN IF you still thought that Amy's pain and Susie's pain involve slightly more pain than Bob's. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "bZPdinngB87FhNa7i", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}, {"_id": "hLdBBoK6M4oknP5uE", "postedAt": "2018-03-24T21:11:42.520Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>I disagree.

As I tried to explain, the &quot;experientially-worse-than&quot; relation is impacted by whether the X (e.g. 5 minor headaches) are spread across 5 people or all had by one person, whereas the &quot;heavier-than&quot; relation is not impacted by whether X (e.g. 100 tons) are spread across 5 objects or true of 1 object</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course you can define a relation to have that property, but merely defining it that way gives us no reason to think that it should be the focus of our moral concern.</p>\n<p>If I were to define a relation to have the property of being the target of our moral concern, it wouldn't be impacted by how it were spread across multiple people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As I said before, I think experience is the only morally relevant factor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well, so do I.

So I'm missing out on just as much as the amnesiac. In both cases people's perceptions are inaccurate.&quot;</p>\n<p>I don't quite understand how this is a response to what I said, so let me retrace some things: </p>\n<p>You first claimed that if I believed that 5 minor headaches all had by one person is experientially worse than 5 minor headaches spread across 5 people, then I would be committed to &quot;believing that it doesn't matter how many times you are tortured if your memory is wiped each time. Because you will never have the experience of being tortured a second time&quot; and this is a problem. </p>\n<p>I replied that it does matter how many times I get tortured because even if my memory is wiped each time, it is still ME (as opposed to a numerically different subject-of-experience, e.g. you) who would experience torture again and again. If my memory is wiped, I will incorrectly VIEW each additional episode of torture as the first one I've ever experienced, but it would not BE the first one I've ever experienced. I would still experience what-it's-like-of-going-through-x-number-of-torture-episodes even if after each episode, my memory was wiped. Since it's the what-it's-like-of-going-through-x-number-of-torture-episodes (and not my memory of it) that is experientially worse than something else, and since X is morally worse than Y when X is experientially worse (i.e. involves more pain) than Y, therefore, it does matter  how many times I'm tortured irrespective of my memory. </p>\n<p>Now, the fact that you said that I &quot;will never have the experience of being tortured a second time&quot; suggests that you think that memory-continuity is necessary to being the numerically same subject-of-experience (i.e. person). If this were true, then every time a person's memory is wiped, a numerically different person comes into existence and so no person would experience what-it's-like-of-going-through-2-torture-episodes if a memory wipe happens after each torture episode. But I don't think memory-continuity is necessary to being the numerically same subject-of-experience. I think a subject-of-experience at time t1 (call this subject &quot;S1&quot;) and a subject-of-experience at some later time t2 (call this subject &quot;S2&quot;) are numerically identical (though perhaps qualitatively different) just in case an experience at t1 (call this experience E1) and an experience at t2 (call this experience E2) are both felt by S1. In other words, I think S1 = S2 iff E1 and E2 are both felt by S1. S1 may have forgotten about E1 by t2 (due to a memory wipe), but that doesn't mean it wasn't S1 who also felt E2.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, memory (and thus how accurate we appreciate our past pains) is not morally relevant since it does not prevent a person from actually experiencing what-it's-like-of-going-through-multiple-pains, and it is this latter thing that is morally relevant. So I don't quite see the point of your latest reply.</p>\n<p>2) &quot;Of course you can define a relation to have that property, but merely defining it that way gives us no reason to think that it should be the focus of our moral concern.</p>\n<p>If I were to define a relation to have the property of being the target of our moral concern, it wouldn't be impacted by how it were spread across multiple people.&quot;</p>\n<p>I am not simply defining a relation here. We both agree that experience is morally relevant and that therefore pain is morally bad, and that therefore an outcome that involves more pain than another outcome is morally worse than the latter outcome. That is, we agree X is morally worse than Y iff X involves more pain than Y. But how are we to understand phrase 'involves more pain than'? I understand it as meaning &quot;is experientially worse than&quot;, which is why I ultimately think that 5 minor headaches all had by one person is morally worse than 5 minor headaches spread across 5 people. You seem to agree with me that the former is experientially worse than the latter, yet you deny that the former is morally worse than the latter. Thus, you have to offer another plausible account of the phrase 'involves more pain than' on which 5 minor headaches all had by one person involves just as much pain as 5 minor headaches spread across 5 people. IMPORTANTLY, this account has to be one according to which 5 minor headaches all had by one person can involve more pain than 1 major headache and not merely in an experientially worse sense. Can you offer such an account? </p>\n<p>I mean, how can 5 minor headaches all had by one person involve more pain than 1 major headache if not in an experientially worse sense? You might try to use math to help illustrate your point of view. You might say, well suppose each minor headache represents a pain of a magnitude of 2, and the major headache represents a pain of a magnitude of 6. You might further clarify that the 2 doesn't just signify the INTENSITY of the minor pain since how shitty a pain episode is doesn't just depend on its intensity but also on its duration. Thus, you might clarify that the 2 represents the overall shitness of the pain - the disutility of it, so to speak. Next, you might say that insofar as there are 5 such minor headaches, they represent 10 disutility, and 10 is bigger than 6. Therefore 5 minor headaches all had by one person involves more pain than a major headache. </p>\n<p>But then I would ask you: what is the reality underpinning the number 10? Is it not some overall shittiness that is experientially worse than the overall shittiness from experiencing one major headache? Is it not the overall shittiness of what-it's-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches? If it is, then we haven't departed from my &quot;is experientially worse than&quot; interpretation of 'involves more pain than'. If it isn't, then what is it?</p>\n<p>To see the problem even more clearly, consider when the 5 minor headaches are spread across 5 people. Here again, you will say that the 5 minor headaches represent 10 disutility and 10 is greater than 6, therefore 5 minor headaches spread across 5 people involve more pain than one major headache. This conclusion is easy to arrive at when one just focuses on the math: 2 x 5 = 10 and 10 &gt; 6. But we must not forget to ask ourselves what the &quot;10&quot; might signify in reality. Is it meant to signify an overall shittiness that is shittier than the experience of 1 major headache? Ok, but where in reality is this overall shittiness? I certainly don't see it. I don't see the presence of this overall shittiness because there is no experience of it. </p>\n<p>(Thus, I find using math to show that 5 minor headaches spread across 5 people involves more pain than 1 major headache is very misleading: yes, mathematically, you can easily portray it. But, at bottom, the '10' maps onto nothing in reality.) </p>\n<p>So in conclusion, I don't see any other plausible interpretation of 'involves more pain than' than &quot;is experientially worse than&quot;. If that is the case, then not only is it the case that I haven't arbitrarily defined a relation, but it's also the case that this relation is the only plausible morally relevant relation. </p>\n<p>3) &quot;Well, so do I. The point is that the mere fact that 5 headaches in one person is worse for one person doesn't necessarily imply that it is worse overall for 5 headaches among 5 people.&quot;</p>\n<p>We need to distinguish between experientially worse and morally worse. You agree that 5 headaches in one person is experientially worse than 5 headaches spread across 5 people, yet you insist that that doesn't mean the former is morally worse than the latter. Well, again, this requires you to show that there is another plausible interpretation of 'involves more pain than' on which the former involves just as much pain as the latter. </p>\n<p>Also, I should note that I was too hasty when I said that I think experience is the ONLY morally relevant factor. Actually, I also think who suffers is a morally relevant factor, but that doesn't affect our discussion here. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "hLdBBoK6M4oknP5uE", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}, {"_id": "Qwgny3Xtf887vunDb", "postedAt": "2018-03-27T21:47:00.264Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Telofy, nice to hear from you again :) </p>\n<p>You say that you have no intuition for what a subject-of-experience is. So let me say two things that might make it more obvious: </p>\n<p>1.Here is how I defined a subject-of-experience in my exchange with Michael_S:</p>\n<p>&quot;A subject of experience is just something which &quot;enjoys&quot; or has experience(s), whether that be certain visual experiences, pain experiences, emotional experiences, etc... In other words, a subject of experience is just something for whom there is a &quot;what-it's-like&quot;. A building, a rock or a plant is not a subject of experience because it has no experience(s). That is why we don't feel concerned when we step on grass: it doesn't feel pain or feel anything. On the other hand, a cow is a subject-of-experience: it presumably has visual experiences and pain experience and all sorts of other experiences. Or more technically, a subject-of-experience (or multiple) may be realized by a cow's physical system (i.e. brain). There would be a single subject-of-experience if all the experiences realized by the cow's physical system are felt by a single subject. Of course, it is possible that within the cow's physical system's life span, multiple subjects-of-experience are realized. This would be the case if not all of the experiences realized by the cow's physical system are felt by a single subject.&quot;</p>\n<p>I later enriched the definition a bit as follows: &quot;A subject-of-experience is a thing that has, OR IS CAPABLE OF HAVING, experience(s). I add the phrase 'or is capable of having' this time because it has just occurred to me that when I am in dreamless sleep, I have no experiences whatsoever, yet I'd like to think that I am still around - i.e. that the particular subject-of-experience that I am is still around. However, it's also possible that a subject-of-experience exists only when it is experiencing something. If that is true, then the subject-of-experience that I am is going out of and coming into existence several times a night. That's spooky, but perhaps true.&quot;</p>\n<p>2.Having offered a definition to Michael, I then say to him here is WHAT MAKES a particular subject-of-experience the numerically same subject-of-experience over time:</p>\n<p>&quot;Within any given physical system that can realize subjects of experience (e.g. a cow's brain), a subject-of-experience at time t-1 (call this subject &quot;S1&quot;) is numerically identical to a subjective-of-experience at some later time t-2 (call this subject &quot;S2&quot;) if and only if an experience at t-1 (call this experience &quot;E1&quot;) and an experience at t-2 (call this experience &quot;E2&quot;) are both felt by S1. That is S1 = S2 iff S1 feels E1 and E2.&quot;</p>\n<p>Let me just add: A particular subject-of-experience can obviously be qualitatively different over time, which would happen when his personality changes or memory changes (or is erased) etc... But that doesn't imply there is any numerical difference. I assume the distinction between numerical identity and qualitative identity is a familiar one to you. In any case, here is an example to illustrate the distinction: Two perfectly matching coins are qualitatively the same, yet they are numerically distinct insofar as they are not one and the same coin. </p>\n<p>I hope what I have said here helps! </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "gzKwYq4evTXRdZhDj", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}, {"_id": "DjzyRgKNGAv45AN47", "postedAt": "2018-03-27T22:54:58.595Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<p>1) &quot;But you are trying to argue about what makes one state of affairs morally worse than another.

I prefer giving a 50% chance to each party because </p>\n<p>A) I don't think the case in which the two would suffer involves more pain than the case in which the one would (given our discussion under Michael_S's post),</p>\n<p>B) I believe who suffers matters (given my response to Objection 2)</p>\n<p>Even if you disagree with me on A), I think if you agreed with me on B), you would at least give the one person a 49% of being helped, and the other two a 51% of being helped. </p>\n<p>It is true that once the coin has been flipped, one party still ends up suffering at the end of the day.

Certainly, the amount of pain they involve isn't any different.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, each of the 5 minor headaches spread among the 5 people are phenomenally or qualitatively the same as each of the 5 minor headaches of the one person. The fact that the headaches are spread does not mean that any of them, in themselves, feel any different from any of the 5 minor headaches of the one person. A minor headache feels like a minor headache, irrespective of who has it. </p>\n<p>Now, each such minor headache constitutes a certain amount of pain, so 5 such minor headaches constitutes five such pain contents, and in THAT sense, five times as much pain. Moreover, since there are 5 such minor headaches in each case (i.e. the 1 person case and the 5 people case), therefore, each case involves the same amount of pain. This is so even if 5 minor headaches all had by one person (i.e. the what-it's-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches) is experientially different from 5 minor headaches spread across 5 people (5 experientially independent what-it's-likes-of-going-through-1-minor-headache). </p>\n<p>Analogously, a visual experience of the color orange constitutes a certain amount of orange-ish feel, so 5 such visual experiences constitutes 5 such orange-ish feels, and in THAT sense, 5 times as much orange-ish feel. If one person experienced 5 such visual experiences one right after another and we recorded these experiences on an &quot;experience recorder&quot; and did the same with 5 such visual experiences spread among 5 people (where they each have their visual experience one right after the other), and then we played back both recordings, the playbacks viewed from the point of view of the universe would be identical: if each visual experience was 1 minute long, then both playbacks would be 5 minutes long of the same content. In this straight forward sense, 5 such visual experiences had by one person involves just as much orange-ish feel as 5 such visual experiences spread among 5 people. This is so even if the what-it's-like-of-going-through-5-such-visual-experiences is not experientially the same as 5 experientially independent what-it's-likes-of-going-through-1-such-visual-experience.</p>\n<p>Right? I assume this is what you have in mind.</p>\n<p>I thus understand your alternative account or sense of 'involves more pain than'. I can see how according to it, 5 minor headaches had by 1 person involves the same amount of pain as 5 minor headaches spread among 5 people. </p>\n<p>But again, consider 5 minor headaches spread among 5 people vs 1 major headache. Here you claim that the 5 minor headaches involves more pain than 1 major headache, and I asked you to explain in what sense. Why did I do this? Because it is clearest here how your account fails to achieve what you think it can achieve.</p>\n<p>So let's carefully think about this for a second. Each minor headache constitutes a certain amount of pain - the amount of pain determined how shitty it feels in absolute terms. The same is true of the major headache. Since a major headache feels a lot shittier in absolute terms, we might use '6' to represent the amount of pain it constitutes, and a '2' to represent the amount of pain a single minor headache constitutes. IMPORTANTLY, both numbers - and the amount of pain they each represent - are determined by how shitty the major headache and the minor headache respectively FEEL. (Note: As I mentioned in an earlier reply, how shitty a pain episode feels is a function of both its intensity and duration).</p>\n<p>Ok. Now, we have 5 experientially independent minor headaches. We have 5 such pain contents, and in THAT sense, 5 times as much pain. The duration of the playback would be 5 times as long compared to the playback of 1 minor headache.) Ok, but do we have something that we can appropriately call 10. Well, these numbers are meant to represent the amount of pain there is and we just said that the amount of pain is determined by how shitty something feels. </p>\n<p>The question then is: Do 5 experientially independent minor headaches some how collectively constitute an amount of pain that feels like a 10. Clearly they don't because only the what-it's-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches can plausibly feel like a 10, and 5 experientially independent what-it's-likes-of-going-through-1-minor-headache is not experientially the same as 1 what-it's-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches. </p>\n<p>You might reply that 5 experientially minor headaches collectively constitute a 10 in that each minor headache constitutes an amount of pain represented by 2 and there are 5 such headaches. In other words, the duration of the playback is 5 times as long. There is, in that sense, 5 times the amount of pain, which is 10. </p>\n<p>Yes, there is 5 times the amount of pain in THAT sense, which is why I would agree that 5 minor headaches all had by one person involves just as much pain as 5 minor headaches spread among 5 people in THAT sense. BUT, notice that only the number 2 is experientially determined. The 5 is not. The 5 is the number of instances of the minor headaches. As a result, the number 10 is not experientially determined. So, the number 10 simply signifies a certain amount of pain (2) repeated 5 times. It does NOT signify an amount of pain that feels like a 10. </p>\n<p>You might not disagree. You might ask, what is the problem here? The problem is that while you can compare a 10 and a 10 that are both determined in this non-purely experiential way, which in effect is what you do to get the result that 5 minor headaches had by one person involves just as much pain as 5 minor headaches spread among 5 people, you CANNOT compare a 10 and a 6 when the 10 is determined in this non-purely experiential way and the 6 is determined in a purely experiential way. For when the numbers are determined in different ways, they signify different things, and are thus incommensurate. </p>\n<p>I can make the same point by talking in terms of pain, rather than in terms of numbers. When you say that 5 minor headaches all had by one person involves the same amount of pain as 5 minor headaches spread among 5 people, you are USING 'amount of pain' in a non-purely experiential sense. The amount of pain, so used, is determined by a certain amount of pain used in a purely experiential sense (i.e. an amount of pain determined by how shitty a minor headache feels) x how many minor headaches there are. While you can compare two amounts of pains, so used, with each other, you cannot compare an amount of pain, so used, with a certain amount of pain used in a purely experiential sense (i.e. an amount of pain determined by how shitty a major headache feels). </p>\n<p>Of course, how many minor headaches there are will affect the amount of pain there is (used in a purely experiential sense) when the headaches all occur in one person. For 5 minor headaches all had by one person results in the what-it's-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches, which feels shittier (i.e. is experentially worse) than a major headache and thus constitutes more pain than a major headache. Thus, when I say 5 minor headaches all had by one person involves an amount of pain that is more than the amount of pain of a major headache, I am using both &quot;amount of pain&quot; in a purely experiential sense. I am comparing apples to apples. But when you say that 5 minor headaches spread among 5 people involves an amount of pain that is more than the amount of pain of a major headache, you are using the former &quot;amount of pain&quot; in a non-purely experiential sense (the one I described in the previous paragraph) and the latter &quot;amount of pain&quot; in a purely experiential sense. You are comparing apples to oranges. </p>\n<p>In this response, I've tried very hard to make clear why it is that even though your account of 'involves more pain than' can work for 5 minor headaches all had by one person vs 5 minor headaches spread across 5 people (and get the result you want: i.e. that the amount of pain in each case is the same), your account cannot work for 5 minor headaches spread across 5 people vs 1 major headache. Thus, your account cannot achieve what you think it can achieve.</p>\n<p>I worry that I haven't been as clear as I wish to be (despite my efforts), so if any part of it comes off unclear, I hope you can be as charitable as you can and make an effort to understand what I'm saying, even if you disagree with it. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "ek67biHCKXJXFqaCq", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}, {"_id": "n36K5sbzc2Ejx7jzW", "postedAt": "2018-03-29T06:45:08.773Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<p>Just because two things are different doesn't mean they are incommensurate.

We can't hope to resolve deep issues of of suffering within ethics, because we are somewhat egocentric beings by nature. We see only through our eyes and feel our body. I don't see that ethics really can adress that level meaningfully, it requires us to abstract from that existential reality.</p>\n<p>For me the alternative is a more pragmatic ethical framework.\nIt acknowledges we are not just ethical beings, but that ethics is important on an interpersonal level.\nFrom that point of view helping more people can be the right thing because we are aware we generally cannot truly resolve others suffering on an individual basis. So we are in effect helping the greater system of society or humanity. In that case there's no problem helping a group instead of an individual. We are not trying to help &quot;at the root&quot; - which we may only be able to do for ourselves or perhaps people close to us - but contribute to society in a meaningful way. And on that level there's a practical difference between helping one person or many.</p>\n<p>In practice, for me that means I do take effective altruism into account, but also acknowledge its limitations. I'd say everyone does that implicity or explicity.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "bejaq"}}, {"_id": "Pjat6LzmtJQcf2xiW", "postedAt": "2018-03-30T21:17:49.297Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<p>You'll need to read to the very end of this reply before my argument seems complete.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In both cases I evaluate the quality of the experience multiplied by the number of subjects.

Say each minor headache feels like a 2, then 2 x 5 = 10. Call this 10 \u201c10A\u201d.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in Case 2, you are multiplying the amount of pain of a major headache (determined solely by how badly a major headache feels) by the number of instances, in this case just 1, to get a total amount of pain (determined via this multiplication). Say the major headache feels like a 6, then 6 x 1 = 6. Call this latter 6 \u201c6A\u201d.</p>\n<p>You then compare the 10A with the 6A. Moreover, since the amounts of pain represented by 10A and  6A are both gotten by multiplying one dimension (i.e. amount of pain, determined purely experientially) by another dimension (instances), you claim that you are comparing things along the same dimension, namely, A. But this is problematic.</p>\n<p>To see the problem, consider </p>\n<p>Case 3: 5 minor headaches all had by 1 person. </p>\n<p>Here, like in Case 1, we can multiply the amount of pain of a minor headache (determined purely experientially) by the number of instances to get a total amount of pain (determined via this multiplication). 2 x 5 = 10. This 10 is the 10A sort.</p>\n<p>OR, unlike in Case 1, we can determine the final amount of pain not by multiplying those things, but instead in the same way we determine the amount of pain of a single minor headache, namely, by considering how badly the 5 minor headaches feels. We can consider how badly the what-it's-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches feels. It feels like a 10, just as a minor headache feels like a 2, and a major headache feels like a 6. Call these 10E, 2E and 6E respectively. The \u2018E\u2019 signifies that the numbers were determined purely experientially.</p>\n<p>Ok. I'm sure you already understand all that. Now here's the problem. </p>\n<p>You insist that there is no problem with comparing 10A and 6A. After all, they are both determined in the same way: multiplying an experience by its instances. </p>\n<p>I am saying there is a problem with that. The problem is that saying 10A is more than 6A makes no sense. Why not? Because, importantly, what goes into determining the 10A and 6A are 2E and 6E respectively: 2E x 5 = 10A. 6E x 1 = 6A. So what? </p>\n<p>Well think about it. 2E x 5 instances is really just 2E, 2E, 2E, 2E, 2E.</p>\n<p>And 6E x 1 instance is really just 6E.</p>\n<p>So when you assert 10A is more than 6A, you are really just asserting that\n(2E, 2E, 2E, 2E, 2E) is more than 6E.</p>\n<p>But then notice that, at bottom, you are still working with the dimension of experience (E) - the dimension of how badly something feels. The problem for you, then, is that the only intelligible form of comparison on this dimension is the &quot;is experientially more bad than&quot; (i.e. is experientially worse than) comparison. </p>\n<p>(Of course, there is also the dimension of instances, and an intelligible form of comparison on this dimension is the \u201cis more in instances than\u201d comparison. For example, you can say 5 minor headaches is more in instances than 1 major headache (i.e. 5 &gt; 1). But obviously, the comparison we care about is not merely a comparison of instances.) </p>\n<p>Analogously, when you are working with the dimension of weight - the dimension of how much something weighs -, the only intelligible form of comparison is &quot;weighs more than&quot;. </p>\n<p>Now, you keep insisting that there is an analogy between </p>\n<p>1) your way of comparing the amounts of pain of various pain episodes (e.g. 5 minor headaches vs 1 major headache), and</p>\n<p>2) how we normally compare the weights of various things (e.g. 5 small oranges vs 1 big orange).</p>\n<p>For example, you say, </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, I am effectively saying that the weight of five oranges is more than the weight of one orange.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So let me explain why they are DIS-analogous. Consider the following example:</p>\n<p>Case 1: Five small oranges, 2lbs each. (Just like 5 minor headaches, each feeling like a 2).</p>\n<p>Case 2: One big orange, 6lbs. (Just like 1 major headache that feels like a 6).</p>\n<p>Now, just as the 2 of a minor headache is determined by how badly it feels, the 2 of a small orange is determined by how much it weighs. So just as we write, 2E x 5 = 10A, we can similarly write 2W x 5 = 10A. And just as we write, 6E x 1 = 6A, we can similarly write 6W x 1 = 6A.</p>\n<p>Now, if you assert that (the total amount of weight represented by) 10A is more than 6A, I would have NO problem with that. Why not? Because the comparison &quot;is more than&quot; still occurs on the dimension of weight (W). You are saying 5 small oranges WEIGHS more than 1 big orange. The comparison thus occurs on the SAME dimension that was used to determine the number 2 and 6 (numbers that in turn determined 10A and 6A): A small orange was determined to be 2 by how much it WEIGHED. Likewise with the big orange. And when you say 10A is more than 6A, the comparison is still made on that dimension.</p>\n<p>By contrast, when you assert that (the total amount of pain represented by) 10A is more than 6A, the &quot;is more than&quot; does not occur on the dimension of experience anymore. It does not occur on the dimension of how badly something feels anymore. You are not saying that 5 minor headaches spread among 5 people is EXPERIENTIALLY WORSE than 1 major headache had by 1 person. You are saying something else. In other words, the comparison does NOT occur on the same dimension that was used to determine the number 2 and 6 (numbers that in turn determined 10A and 6A): A minor headache was determined to be 2 by how EXPERIENTIALLY BAD IT FELT. Likewise with the major headache. Yet, when you say 10A is more than 6A, you are not making a comparison on that dimension anymore. </p>\n<p>So I hope you see how your way of comparing the amounts of pain between various pain episodes is disanalogous to how we normally compare the weights between various things. </p>\n<p>Now, just as the dimension of weight (i.e. how much something weighs) and the dimension of instances (i.e. how many instances there are) do not combine to form some substantive third dimension on which to compare 5 small oranges with a big orange, the dimension of experience (i.e. how badly something feels) and the dimension of instances do not combine to form some substantive third dimension on which to compare 5 minor headaches spread among 5 people and 1 major headache had by one person. At best, they combine to form a trivial third dimension consisting in their collection/conjunction, on which one can intelligibly compare, say, 32 minor headaches with 23 minor headaches, irrespective of how the 32 and 23 minor headaches are spread. This trivial dimension is the dimension of &quot;how many instances (i.e. how much) of a certain pain there is&quot;. On this dimension, 5 minor headaches spread among 5 people cannot be compared with a MAJOR headache, because they are different pains, but 5 minor headaches spread among 5 people can be compared with 5 minor headaches all had by 1 person. Moreover, the result of such a comparison would be that they are the same on this dimension (as I allowed in an earlier reply). But this is a small victory given that this dimension won't allow any comparisons between differential pains (e.g. 5 minor headaches and a major headache).</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "kwhYGWMNZ67oha9G3", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}, {"_id": "qDeojuKjDfaMsN56p", "postedAt": "2018-03-30T22:40:57.140Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>But then notice that, at bottom, you are still working with the dimension of experience (E) - the dimension of how badly something feels.

Fortunately, the additional time made me realize that I was the one who was confused as I now see very clearly the utilitarian sense of \u201cinvolves more pain than\u201d that you have been in favor of.</p>\n<p>Where this leaves us is with two senses of \u201cinvolves more pain than\u201d and with the question of which of the two senses is the one that really matters. In this reply, I outline the two senses and then argue for why the sense that I have been in favor of is the one that really matters. </p>\n<p>The two senses:</p>\n<p>Suppose, for purposes of illustration, that a person who experiences 5 minor toothaches is experientially just as badly off as someone who experiences a major toothache. This supposition, of course, makes use of my sense of \u201cinvolves more pain than\u201d \u2013 the sense that analyzes \u201cinvolves more pain than\u201d as \u201cis experientially worse than\u201d. This sense compares two what-it\u2019s-likes (e.g., the what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-5-minor-toothaches vs the what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-a-major-toothache) and compares them with respect to their what-it\u2019s-like-ness \u2013 their feel. On this sense, 5 minor toothaches all had by one person involves the same amount of pain as 1 major toothache had by one person in that the former is experientially just as bad as the latter.</p>\n<p>On your sense (though not on mine), if these 5 minor toothaches were spread across 5 people, they would still involve the same amount of pain as 1 major toothache had by one person. This is because having 1 major toothache is experientially just as bad as having 5 minor toothaches (i.e. using my sense), which entitles one to claim that the 1 major toothache is equivalent to 5 minor toothaches, since they give rise to distinct what-it\u2019s-likes that are nevertheless experientially just as bad. At this point, it\u2019s helpful to stipulate that one minor toothache = one base unit of pain. That is, let\u2019s suppose that the what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-one-minor-toothache is experientially as bad as any of the least experientially bad experience(s) possible. Now, since there are in effect 5 base units of pain in both cases, therefore the cases involve the same amount of pain (in your sense). It is irrelevant that the 5 base units of pain are spread among 5 people in one case. This is because it is irrelevant how those 5 base units of pain feel when experienced together since we are not comparing the cases with respect to their what-it\u2019s-like-ness \u2013 their feel. Rather, we are comparing the cases with respect to their quantity of the base unit of pain. </p>\n<p>Which is the sense that really matters? </p>\n<p>I believe the sense I am in favor of is the one that really matters, and that this becomes clear when we remind ourselves why we take pain to matter in the first place. </p>\n<p>We take pain to matter because of its negative felt character \u2013 because of how it feels. I argue that we should favor my sense of \u201cinvolves more pain than\u201d because it fully respects this fact, whereas the sense you\u2019re in favor of goes against the spirit of this fact. </p>\n<p>According to your sense, 5 minor toothaches spread among 5 people involves the same amount of pain as one major toothache had by one person. But doesn't this clearly go against the spirit of the fact that pain matters solely because of how it feels? None of the 5 people feel anything remotely bad. There is simply no experience of anything remotely bad on their side of the equation. They each feel a very mild pain \u2013 unpleasant enough to be perceived to be experientially bad, but that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the worst what-it\u2019s-like on their side of the equation. Yet, a bundle of 5 of these mild what-it\u2019s-likes somehow involve the same amount of pain as one major toothache. That can only be acceptable if the felt character of the major toothache (and of pain in general) is not as important to you as the sheer quantity of very mild pains (i.e. of base units of pain).

(By P1)</p>\n<p>P3) 5 minor toothaches spread among 5 people is 5 minor toothaches, just as 5 minor toothaches had by one person is 5 minor toothaches, so there is the same quantity of minor toothaches (or same quantity of base units of pain) in both cases. (Self-evident)</p>\n<p>P4) Therefore, we are entitled to say that 5 minor toothaches spread among 5 people is equivalent to 5 minor toothaches had by one person. (By P4)</p>\n<p>P5) Therefore, we are entitled to claim that 5 minor toothaches spread among 5 people is equivalent to 1 major toothache had by one person. (By P2 and P4)</p>\n<p>C) Therefore, 5 minor toothaches spread among 5 people involves the same amount of pain as 1 major toothache had by one person. (By P5)</p>\n<p>As the illustrated reasoning shows, 5 minor toothaches spread among 5 people involves the same amount of pain as 1 major toothache had by one person (i.e. C) only if 5 minor toothaches had by ONE person is equivalent to 1 major toothache (i.e. P2). You agree with this. </p>\n<p>Moreover, as the illustrated reasoning also shows, the reason why 5 minor toothaches had by one person is equivalent to 1 major toothache (i.e. P2) is because they give rise to two different what-it's-likes that are nevertheless experientially just as bad (i.e. P1). I presume you agree with this too. Call this reason &quot;Reason E&quot;, E for &quot;experientially just as bad&quot;)</p>\n<p>Furthermore, as the illustrated reasoning shows, the reason why 5 minor toothaches spread among 5 people is equivalent to 5 minor toothache had by one person is DIFFERENT from the reason for why 5 minor headaches had by one person is equivalent to 1 major toothache had by one person. That is, 5 minor toothaches spread among 5 people is equivalent to 5 minor toothaches had by one person (i.e. P4) because they share the same quantity of base units of pain, namely 5, irrespective of how the 5 base units of pain are spread (i.e. P3), and NOT because they give rise to two what-it's-likes that are experientially just as bad (as they clearly don't).

Indeed, that's not the problem I want to raise for your sense of &quot;involves more pain.&quot;</p>\n<p>The problem with your sense of &quot;involves more pain&quot; is that it admits of Reason S as a basis for saying X involves more pain than Y. But Reason S, unlike Reason E, is against the spirit of why we take pain to matter. We take pain to matter because of the badness of how it feels, as you rightly claim. But Reason S doesn't give a crap about how bad the pains on the two sides of the equation FEEL; it doesn't care that 5 MiTs/1 person constitutes a pain that feels a whole lot worse than any anything on the other side of the equation. It just cares about how many base units of pain there are on each side. And, obviously, more base units of pain does not mean there is experientially worse pain precisely because the base units of pain can be spread out among many different people.  </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maybe you think that no amount of minor pains can ever be equally important as one excruciating pain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This an interesting question.

If so, then I would think that 1 third-degree burn/1 person is morally worse than infinite mild pains/1 person.

For example, I would agree that Amy and Susie each suffering is twice as morally bad as just Amy suffering. However, I would not agree IF the single person was not a subset of the two (e.g., if the single person was Bob). If the single person was Bob, I would think the two cases are morally just as bad. </p>\n<p>Now, one basic premise that kbog and I have been working with is this:\nIf two people suffering involves more pain than one person suffering, then two people suffering is morally worse (i.e. twice as morally bad) as one person suffering.</p>\n<p>However, based on my preferred sense of &quot;more pain&quot;, two people suffering involves the same amount of pain as one person suffering, irrespective of whether the single person is a subset or not. </p>\n<p>Therefore, you might wonder how I am able to arrive at the different opinions above. More specifically, if I think Amy and Susie each suffering involves the same amount of pain as just Amy suffering, shouldn't I be committed to saying that the former is morally just as bad as the latter, rather than twice as morally bad (which is what I want to say?)</p>\n<p>I don't think so. I think the pareto principle provides an adequate reason for taking Amy and Susie each suffering to be morally worse than just Amy's suffering. As Otsuka (a philosopher at Harvard) puts it, the Pareto states that \u201cOne distribution of benefits over a population is strictly Pareto superior to another distribution of benefits over that same population just in case (i) at least one person is better off under the former distribution than she would be under the latter and (ii) nobody is worse off under the former than she would be under the latter.&quot; Since just Amy suffering (i.e. Susie not suffering) is Pareto superior to Amy and Susie each suffering, therefore just Amy suffering is morally better than Amy and Susie each suffering. In other words, Amy and Susie each suffering is morally worse than just Amy suffering. Notice, however, that if the single person were Bob, condition (ii) would not be satisfied because Bob would be made worse off. The Pareto principle is based on the appealing idea that we shouldn't begrudge another person an improvement that costs us nothing. Amy shouldn't begrudge Susie an improvement that costs her nothing.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I just wanted to make that aspect of my thinking clear. So I would agree with you that more people suffering is morally worse than fewer people suffering as long as the smaller group of people is a subset of the larger group, due to the Pareto principle. But I would not agree with you that more people suffering is morally worse than fewer people suffering if those fewer people are not a subset of the larger group, since the Pareto principle is not a basis for it, nor is there more pain in the former case than the latter case on my preferred sense of &quot;more pain&quot;. And since I think my preferred sense of &quot;more pain&quot; is the one that ultimately matters because it respects the fact that pain matters solely because of how it feels, I think others should agree with me. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A couple of brief points in favour of the classical approach: It in some sense 'embeds naturally' in the universe, in that if our actions can only effect some small section of the universe, we need only consider that section when making decisions.

However, as I argued, this stipulation is not true OF the real world because each of us didn't actually have an equal chance of being in any of our position, and what we should do should be based on the facts, and not on a stipulation. In kbog's latest reply to me regarding the veil of ignorance, he seems to argue that the stipulation should determine what we ought to do (irrespective of whether it is true in the actual world) because &quot;The reason we look at what they would agree to from behind the veil of ignorance as opposed to outside is that it ensures that they give equal consideration to everyone, which is a basic principle that appeals to us as a cornerstone of any decent moral system.&quot; I have yet to respond to this latest reply because I have been too busy arguing about our senses of &quot;more pain&quot;, but if I were to respond, I would say this:\n&quot;I agree that we should give equal consideration to everyone, which is why I believe we should give each person a chance of being helped proportional to the suffering they face. The only difference is that this is giving equal consideration to everyone in a way that respects the facts of the world.&quot; Anyways, I don't want to say too much here, because kbog might not see it and it wouldn't be fair if you only heard my side. I'll respond to kbog's reply eventually (haha) and you can follow the discussion there if you wish. </p>\n<p>Let me just add one thing: Based on Singer's intro to Utilitarianism, Harsanyi argued that the veil of ignorance also entails a form of utilitarianism on which we ought to maximize average utility, as opposed to Rawls' claim that it entails giving priority to the worst off. If this is right, then the veil of ignorance approach doesn't support classical utilitarianism which just says we ought to maximize utility and not average utility. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One could imagine others who also disagreed with Comparability, but thought the appropriate solution was to always help the person suffering the most, and not care at all about anyone else. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, they could, but I also argued that who suffers matters in my response to Objection 2, and to simply help the person suffering the most is to ignore this fact. Thus, even if one person suffering a lot is experientially worse (and thus morally worse) than many others each suffering something less, I believe we should give the others some chance of being helped. That is to say, in light of the fact that who suffers matters, I believe it is not always right to prevent the morally worse case. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To take things to the opposite extreme, someone could also deny Comparability but think that the most important thing was minimizing the number of people suffering at all and not take into account intensity whatsoever (although they would likely justify rejecting Comparability on different grounds to you).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While this is a possible position to hold, it is not a plausible one, because it effectively entails that the numbers matter in itself. That is, such a person thinks he should save the many over one other person not because he thinks the many suffering involves more pain than the one suffering (for he denies that a non-purely experientially determined amount of pain can be compared with a purely experientially determined amount of pain). Rather, he thinks he should save the many solely because they are many.

For example, if someone is to experience 5 headaches, we are to assign a single moral value to his 5 headaches based on how experientially bad the what-it's-like-of-going-through-5-headaches is. If going through 5 such headaches is about experientially as bad as going through 1 major headache, then we would assign the same moral value to someone's 5 minor headaches as we would to someone else's 1 major headache. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We then add up the moral value assigned to each person's experiences to get a global moral value, and compare this moral value to the other global values corresponding to the other states of affairs we could bring about. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This approach reminds me of trade-off situations that involve saving lives instead of saving people from suffering. For example, suppose we can either save Amy's and Susie's life or Bob's life, but we cannot save all. Who do we save? Most people would reason that we should save Amy's and Susie's life because each life is assigned a certain positive moral value, so 2 lives is twice the moral value as 1 life. I purposely avoided talking about trade-off situations involving saving lives because I don't think a life has moral value in itself, yet I anticipated that people would appeal to life having some sort of positive moral value in itself and I didn't want to spend time arguing about that. In any case, if life does have positive moral value in itself, then I think it makes sense to add those values just as it makes sense to add the dollar values of different merchandise. This would result in Amy's and Susie's death being a morally worse thing than Bob's death, and so I would at least agree that what we ought to do in this case wouldn't be to give everyone a 50% chance.</p>\n<p>In any case, if we assign a moral value to each person's experience in the same way that we might assign a moral value to each person's life, then I can see how people reach the conclusion that more people suffering a given pain is morally worse than fewer people suffering the given pain (even if the fewer are other people). Moreover, given step 1., I agree that this approach, at least prima facie, respects [the fact that pain matters solely because of how it FEELS] more than the approach that I've attributed to kbog). (I added the &quot;[...]&quot; to make the sentence structure more clear.) As such, this is an interesting approach that I would need to think more about, so thanks for bringing it up. But, even granting this approach, I don't think what we ought to do is to OUTRIGHT prevent the morally worse case; rather we ought to give a higher chance to preventing the morally worse case proportional to how much morally worse it is than the other case. I will say more about this below. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then I am really not sure at all what you are meaning by 'morally worse' (or 'right'!). In light of this, I am now completely unsure of what you have been arguing the entire time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Please don't be alarmed (haha). I assume you're aware that there are other moral theories that recognize the moral value of experience (just as utilitarianism does), but also recognizes other side constraints such that, on these moral theories, the right thing to do is not always to OUTRIGHT prevent the morally worst consequence. For example, if a side constraint is true of some situation, then the right thing to do would not be to prevent the morally worst consequence if doing so violates the side constraint. That is why these moral theories are not consequentialist. </p>\n<p>You can think of my moral position as like one of these non-consequentialist theories. The one and only side constraint that I recognize is captured by the fact that who suffers matters. Interestingly, this side constraint arises from the fact that experience matters, so it is closer to utilitarianism than other moral theories in this respect. Here's an example of the side constraint in action: Suppose I can either save 100 people from a minor headache or 1 other person from a major headache. Going by my sense of &quot;more pain&quot; (i.e. my way of quantifying and comparing pains), the single person suffering the major headache is morally worse than the 100 people each suffering a minor headache because his major headache is experientially worse than any of the other people's minor headache. But in this case, I would not think the right thing to do is to OUTRIGHT save the person with the major headache (even though his suffering is the morally worse case). I would think that the right thing to do is to give him a higher chance of being saved proportional to how much worse his suffering is experientially speaking than any one of the others (i.e. how much morally worse his suffering is relative to the 100's suffering). </p>\n<p>Similarly, if we adopted the approach you outlined above, maybe the 100 people each suffering a minor headache would be the morally worse case. If so, given the side constraint, I would still similarly think that it would not be right to OUTRIGHT save the 100 from their minor headaches. I would again think that the right thing to do would be to give the 100 people a higher chance of being saved proportional to how much morally worse their suffering is relative to the single person's suffering.</p>\n<p>I hope that helps.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "RcdWwSNDqE8Wjkca2", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}, {"_id": "2zoxRSL6mHELJvHE5", "postedAt": "2018-04-13T20:43:32.040Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>So you're suggesting that most people aggregate different people's experiences as follows:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well most EAs, probably not most people :P</p>\n<p>But yes, I think most EAs apply this 'merchandise' approach weighed by conscious experience.</p>\n<p>In regards to your discussion of moral theories, side constraints:\nI know there are a range of moral theories that can have rules etc. My objection was that if you were not in fact arguing that total pain (or whatever) is the sole determiner of what action is right then you should make this clear from the start (and ideally baked into what you mean by 'morally worse'). </p>\n<p>Basically I think sentences like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;I don't think what we ought to do is to OUTRIGHT prevent the morally worse case&quot; </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>are sufficiently far from standard usage (at least in EA circles) you should flag up that you are using 'morally worse' in a nonstandard way (and possibly use a different term).

Thus, if you follow your approach and give some chance of helping people not experiencing the most pain, in the case when you do help them, the 'total pain' does not change at all!</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Suppose Alice is experiencing 10 units of suffering (by some common metric)</li>\n<li>10n people (call them group B) are experiencing 1 units of suffering each</li>\n<li>We can help exactly one person, and reduce their suffering to 0</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In this case your principle says we should give Alice a 10/(10+10n) = 1/(n+1) chance of being helped, and each person in group B a 1/(10+10n) chance of being helped. But in the case we help someone from group B the level of 'total pain' remains at 10 as Alice is not helped. </p>\n<p>This means that n/(n+1) proportion of the time the 'total pain' remains unchanged. i.e. we can make the chance of actually effecting the thing you say is morally important arbitrarily small.

Sorry for the super late response!

As you know, if (there was a 100% chance) I could give each person a chance of being saved in proportional to his/her suffering, I would do that instead of outright saving the person who has the worst to suffer. After all, this is what I think we should do, given that suffering matters, but who suffers also matters. Here, there seems to me a nice harmony between these two morally relevant factors \u2013 the suffering and the identity of who suffers, where both have a sufficient impact on what we ought to do: we ought to give each person a chance of being saved because who suffers matters, but each person\u2019s chance ought to be in proportion to what he/she has to suffer because suffering also matters. </p>\n<p>Now you\u2019re asking me what I would do if there was only a 95% chance that I could give each person a chance of being saved in proportion to his/her suffering with a 5% chance of not helping anyone at all: would I accept the 95% chance or outright save the person who has the worst to suffer?</p>\n<p>Well, what should I do? I must admit it\u2019s not clear. I think it comes down to how much weight we should place on the morally relevant factor of identity. The more weight it has, the more likely the answer is that we should accept the 95% chance. I think it\u2019s plausible that it has enough weight such that we should accept a 95% chance, but not a 40% chance. If one is a moral realist, one can accept that there is a correct objective answer yet not know what it is.  </p>\n<p>One complication is that you mention the notion of fairness. On my account of what matters, the fair thing to do \u2013 as you suggest - seems to be to give each person a chance in proportion to his/her suffering. Fairness is often thought of as a morally relevant factor in of itself, but if what the fair thing to do in any given situation is grounded in other morally relevant factors (e.g. experience and identity), then its moral relevance might be derived. If so, I think we can ignore the notion of fairness.   </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For example:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2022    Suppose Alice is experiencing 10 units of suffering (by some common metric)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2022    10n people (call them group B) are experiencing 1 units of suffering each</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2022    We can help exactly one person, and reduce their suffering to 0</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this case your principle says we should give Alice a 10/(10+10n) = 1/(n+1) chance of being helped, and each person in group B a 1/(10+10n) chance of being helped. But in the case we help someone from group B the level of 'total pain' remains at 10 as Alice is not helped.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This means that n/(n+1) proportion of the time the 'total pain' remains unchanged. i.e. we can make the chance of actually effecting the thing you say is morally important arbitrarily small. It seems strange to say your morally is motivated by x if your actions are so distanced from it that your chance of actually effecting x can go to zero.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a fantastic objection. This objection is very much in the spirit of the objection I was raising against utilitarianism: both objections show that the respective approaches can trivialize suffering given enough people (i.e. given that n is large enough). I think this objection shows a serious problem with giving each person a chance of being saved proportional to his/her suffering insofar as it shows that doing so can lead us to give a very very small chance to someone who has a lot to suffer when it intuitively seems to me that we should give him a much higher chance of being saved given how much more he/she has to suffer relative to any other person. </p>\n<p>So perhaps we ought to outright save the person who has the most to suffer. But this conclusion doesn\u2019t seem right either in a trade-off situation involving him and one other person who has just a little less to suffer, but still a whole lot. In such a situation, it intuitively seems that we should give one a slightly higher chance of being saved than the other, just as it intuitively seems that we should give each an equal chance of being saved in a trade-off situation where they each have the same amount to suffer. </p>\n<p>I also have an intuition against utilitarianism. So if we use intuitions as our guide, it seems to leave us nowhere. Maybe one or more of these intuitions can be \u201cevolutionarily debunked\u201d, sparing one of the three approaches, but I don\u2019t really have an idea of how that would go. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, for another example:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2022    Say a child (child A) is about to be tortured for the rest of their life, which you can prevent for \u00a32.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2022    However another child (child B) has just dropped their ice cream, which has slightly upset them (although not much, they are just a little sad).

In footnote 4, I wrote:</p>\n<p>\u201cNotice that with certain types of pain episodes, such as a torture episode vs a minor headache, there is such a big gap in amount of suffering between them that any clear-headed person in the world would rather endure an infinite number of minor headaches (i.e. live with very frequent minor headaches in an immortal life) than to endure the torture episode. This would explain why in a choice situation in which we can either save a person from torture or x number of persons from a minor headache (or 1 person from x minor headaches), we would just save the person who would be tortured rather than give the other(s) even the slightest chance of being helped. And I think this accords with our intuition well.\u201d</p>\n<p>Admittedly, there are two potential problems with what I say in my footnote.</p>\n<p>1)    It\u2019s not clear that any clear-headed person would do as I say, since it seems possible that the what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-infinite-minor-headaches can be experientially worse than the what-it\u2019s-like-of-going-through-a-torture-session.</p>\n<p>2)    Even if any clear-headed person would do as I say, it\u2019s not clear that this can yield the result that we should outright save the one person from torture. It depends on how the math works out, and I\u2019m terrible at math lol. Does 1/infinity = 0? If so, then it seems we ought to give the person who would suffer the minor headache a 0% chance (i.e. we ought to outright save the other person from torture).</p>\n<p>But the biggest problem is that even if what I say in my footnote can adequately address this objection, it cannot adequately address your previous objection. This is because in your previous example concerning Alice, I think she should have a high chance of being saved (e.g. around 90%) no matter how big n is, and what I say in footnote 4 cannot help me get that result. </p>\n<p>All in all, your previous objection shows that my own approach leads to a result that I cannot accept. Thanks for that (haha). However, I should note that it doesn\u2019t make the utilitarian view more plausible to me because, as I said, your previous objection is very much in the spirit of my own objection against utilitarianism. </p>\n<p>I wonder if dropping the idea that we should give each person a chance of being saved proportional to his/her suffering requires dropping the idea that who suffers matters... I used the latter idea to justify the former idea, but maybe the latter idea can also be used to justify something weaker - something more acceptable to me...

The argument against my approach-minus-the-who-suffers-matters-bit is that it renders all resulting states of affairs equally bad, morally speaking, because all resulting states of affairs would involve the same total pain. Given that we should prevent the morally worst case, this means that my approach would have it that we shouldn't take any action, and that's just absurd. Therefore, my way of determining total pain is problematic. Here &quot;a resulting state of affairs&quot; is broadly understood as the indefinite span of time following a possible action, as opposed to any particular point in time following a possible action. On this broad understanding, it seems undeniable that each possible action will result in a state of affairs with the same total maximal pain, since there will surely be someone who suffers maximally at some point in time in each indefinite span of time.</p>\n<p>Well, if who suffered didn't matter, then I think leximin should be used to determine which resulting state of affairs is morally worse. According to leximin, we determine which state of affairs is morally better as follows:\nStep 1: From each state of affairs, select a person among the worst off in that state of affairs. Compare these people. If there is a person who is better off than the rest, then that state of affairs is morally better than all the others. If these people are all just as badly off, then move onto Step 2.\nStep 2: From each state of affairs, select a person among the worst off in that state of affairs, except for the person who has already been selected. Compare these people. If there is a person who is better off than the rest, then that state of affairs is morally better than all the others. If these people are all just as badly off, then move onto Step 3. And so forth...\nAccording to this method, even though all resulting states of affairs will involve the same total pain, certain resulting states of affairs will be morally better than others, and we should act so as to realize them. </p>\n<p>My appeal to leximin is not ad hoc because it takes an individual's suffering seriously, which is inline with my approach. Notice that leximin can be used to justify saving Susie and Amy over Bob. I don't actually endorse leximin because leximin does not take an individual's identity seriously (i.e. it doesn't treat who suffers as morally relevant, whereas I do. I think who suffers matters). </p>\n<p>So that is one response I have to your argument: it grants you that the total pain in each resulting state of affairs would be the same and then argues that this does not mean that all resulting state of affairs would be morally just as bad.</p>\n<p>Another response I have is that, most probably, different states of affairs will involve different amounts of pain, and so some states of affairs will be morally worse than others just based on total pain involved. This becomes more plausible when we keep in mind what the maximum amount of pain is on my approach. It is not the most intense pain, e.g. a torture session. It is not the longest pain, e.g. a minor headache that lasts one's entire life. Rather, it is the most intense pain over the longest period of time. The person who suffers maximum pain is the person who suffers the most intense pain for the longest period of time. Realizing this, it is unlikely that each possible action will lead to a state of affairs involving this.

If Reason S truly cared about pain-qua-how-it-feels, it cannot ignore this difference. </p>\n<p>I understand where you're coming from though. You hold that Reason S cares about the quantity of base units of pain precisely because pain feels bad, and that this fact alone sufficiently shows that Reason S is in harmony with the fact that we take pain to matter because of how it feels (i.e. that Reason S cares about pain-qua-how-it-feels). </p>\n<p>However, given what I just said, I think this fact alone is too weak to show that Reason S is in harmony with the fact that we take pain to matter because of how it feels. So I believe my objection stands. </p>\n<p>Have we hit bedrock? </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "PdStpLgNnaJSJK8m2", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}, {"_id": "Q5B9wZAohGrbxXA6i", "postedAt": "2018-04-23T22:44:02.176Z", "postId": "BAWiSLZAsia6qCgCP", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>On what basis are you able to say that 1 MaT/1 person involves 5 base units of pain?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because you told me that it's the same amount of pain as five minor toothaches and you also told me that each minor toothache is 1 base unit of pain.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5 base units of pain all experienced by one person feels a whole heck of a lot worse than anything felt when 5 base units of pain are spread among 5 people, yet Reason S completely ignores this difference.

I am restating it as part of a further argument against your sense of &quot;involves more pain than&quot; or &quot;involves the same amount of pain as&quot;. The argument in essence goes:\nP1) Your sense relies on Reason S\nP2) Reason S does not care about pain-qua-how-it-feels (because it ignores the above stated difference).\nP3) We take pain to matter because of how it feels.\nC) Therefore, your sense is not in harmony with why pain matters (or at least why we take pain to matter).</p>\n<p>I had to restate that Reason S ignores this difference as my support for P2, so it was not merely stated. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, you do not care how many people are in pain, and you do not care how much pain someone experiences so long as there is someone else who is in more pain, so if anyone's got to figure out whether or not they &quot;care&quot; enough it's you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Both accusations are problematic. </p>\n<p>The first accusation is not entirely true. I don't care about how many people are in pain only in situations where I have to choose between helping, say, Amy and Susie or just Bob (i.e. situations where a person in the minority party does not overlap with anyone in the majority party). However, I would care about how many people are in pain in situations where I have to choose between helping, say, Amy and Susie or just Amy (i.e. situations where  the minority party is a mere subset of the majority party). This is due to the strict pareto principle which would make Amy and Susie each suffering morally worse than just Amy suffering, but would <em>not</em> make Amy and Susie suffering morally worse than Bob suffering. I don't want to get into this at this point because it's not very relevant to our discussion. Suffice it to say that it's not entirely true that I don't care about how many people are in pain.  </p>\n<p>The second accusation is plain false. As I made clear in my response to Objection 2 in my post, I think who suffers matters. As a result, if I could either save one person from suffering some pain or another person from suffering a slightly less pain, I would give each person a chance of being saved in proportion to how much each has to suffer. This is what I think I should do. Ironically, your second accusation against me is precisely true of what you stand for. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You've pretty much been repeating yourself for the past several weeks, so, sure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In my past few replies, I have:</p>\n<p>1) Outlined in explicit terms a line of reasoning that got from the supposition to C), which I attributed to you.</p>\n<p>2) Highlighted that that line of reasoning appealed to Reason S.</p>\n<p>3) On that basis, argued that your sense of &quot;involves the same amount of pain as&quot; goes against the spirit of why pain matters.</p>\n<p>If that comes across to you as &quot;just repeating myself for the past several weeks&quot;, then I can only think that you aren't putting enough effort into trying to understand what I'm saying.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "Q5B9wZAohGrbxXA6i", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}]
