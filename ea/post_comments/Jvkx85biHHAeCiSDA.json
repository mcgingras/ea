[{"_id": "4vXzhe3vGddFetxYP", "postedAt": "2023-10-11T16:58:34.072Z", "postId": "Jvkx85biHHAeCiSDA", "htmlBody": "<p>Hey!<br>Just registered myself here and wanted to quickly introduce myself. I am a classical trained soprano touring with two symphonic metal bands, one (the smaller) of them is my personal \"baby\" I composed 3 albums and an EP for. My main area is my homeland Germany, but I gave concerts in many European countries, South- and Latin America, in the Caribean Sea, in Turkey, in China and Taiwan. My main occupation is my own band, since I am doing also the work behind the scenes - marketing, booking, organising everything, taxes... I am teaching singing and piano and doing haunted tours as side jobs to make ends meet, since art, especially if you are not mainstream, doesn't pay the bills despite an immense workload - I usually work 6-7 days a week and rarely less then 10 hours per day, often more.<br>I started my career with studying communication and media and also made my magister degree (similiar to master, just the older German academic system) and got my professional musical education in parallel (basically, I did music aside from school already as small child). I focused in my studies on TV journalism and media paedagogic, also did some internships at some TV stations - where basically everybody told me: If you can, do sth else, working circumstances are getting worse and worse here. And since I really loved music, I focussed on that. Now, 39 years old, I feel like I exchanged one industry with catastrophic work conditions against an even worse one and I feel kind of a lack of sense in my life.<br>What makes it even worse, I ask myself if, regarding the pressing problems humanity is facing right now, I should use my personal ressources for art. Even worse, the more I advance in my career, the more I am busy with 1001 jobs around the art that annoy me and that feel completely wrong. Example: You don't get your music promoted if you don't spend money on paid ads in social media and guiding people to streaming platforms, but at the same time, these structures are exploiting artists, especially independent artists that are not willing to shape their music in behalf of best selling instead of best artistry. So it would feel way better for me to work on structures that improve the situation instead of feeding the devil with my ressources. In addition, my job gets threatened by AI and generated music. E.G. Deezer is just teaming up with label managers from huge major artists (those, that are the commercial big fishes) in order to rank down all musical tracks in payment (that's already a nightmare now) under a certain amount of listeners, officially to protect again generated music. As a result, they basically rank down all small or niche artists on the level of white noise (so basically I get paid the same for a professional production that involved almost 40 musicians, a professional producer and several years of work as if I had recorded my running vaccuum cleaner and uploaded the sound file), shifting the shares of the small ones to the big labels.<br>But it is not only a lack of structures for fair spread and payment of art online that make me worry in my field of expertise, but also the power of misused AI in combination with good marketing skills. You can manipulate already now public opinion and sometimes also people in leader positions quite well, but you don't have to be a prophet to see the danger on the near horizon to drown the truth in science with a spiderweb of fake studies, easily generated and spread with AI and bots. Combined with fake proofs of reality (AI generated videos and pictures, AI generated voices), there is a huge risk we completely loose track of reality and truth. While, at the same time, journalists are under immense pressure for output, as their earnings went down with the internet as well and deep research often is too expensive, therefore it's easier to quickly spread news they get from press agencies and they are under pressure to make content that is clicked a lot, which usually works best with click bait titles and provocing/shocking themes. And I strongly wish to do sth. against all that mess.<br>In my opinion, we need a global safe space of information, science and art, that respects the preferences of media use of people to be broadly used and gives the creators an income safety net and fair equal opportunities to publish (no matter who they are) as long as they fullfill the standards of different categories. I developed quite some ideas for that, this is a super rough presentation of the idea, but I am unsure how to get such a huge project running and quite sure I will need a bigger amount of allies in order to have a chance to successfully get sth. from scratch board to reality (besides the fact that I don't consider myself as perfect super human and therefore I am convinced that more heads wrapping around the matter and scientific comparison of different approaches is needed to create a system that's as effective and fair as possible). That's (besides that I am also deeply worried about many other pressing problems, but where I don't feel such a strong personal fit) how I ended up here.<br>I feel like I would love to write a lot more, but for a quick introduction I already created a novel. ;-)</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Janika"}}, {"_id": "jHupSb7DqEGmhPtTj", "postedAt": "2023-10-12T10:43:29.386Z", "postId": "Jvkx85biHHAeCiSDA", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Janika,<br><br>welcome to the EA Forum.<br><br>Can you send me a link to some music you produced?

This is the YouTube channel of my band: <a href=\"https://youtube.com/@molllust\">https://youtube.com/@molllust</a>\nYou find the band on the common streaming services as well.\nHow I can get involved in EA is exactly the question I am asking myself.\nUntil now, I tried to raise awareness about pressing problems with my songs and worked on my own lifestyle (going vegan, reducing foodwaste with actively being part of foodsharing, avoiding emissions on personal travels with going almost everywhere by bike or rarely public transport, signed petitions, went to demonstrations) and informed myself about models how to shape the world in the future. I found e.g. \"Earth for all\" from the Club of Rome quite inspiring.\nBut this all feels too few for me and so I am on  search how to improve my impact. I think I have at least some reach as an artist. So I am thinking about how I can inspire the audience, as I think just speaking of problems is just unconfortable for many, but presenting solutions could make it easier for people to do good.\nThen I am trying to figure out if I can help to solve the problems I named in my first post - but this would only work with connections and a team, which I both don't have. Therefore I was thinking I have to start seaching somewhere and this could be a good place for that. I know that it is seen a bit critical here to improve science globally, but I think it would be possible to tackle the biggest sorrow - one could rank scientific studies after a scale from \"highly beneficial for humanity and Earth\" to \"highly dangerous for humanity/Earth\" and just grant access to different groups of people (all vs. very small circle) to results and connect results depending on the ranking. In addition, a platform as I imagine couldn't get online from one day to the next with all possible publications anyway, so one could classify the studies first and then working from highest to least beneficial and therefore giving the beneficial topics an extra headstart.\nThe third thing I wrap my mind around is: After we just very recently finally have a study with a quite complete status of Earth's health, wouldn't it be possible to build a meta-organisation that raises money in Crowdfundings to directly elliminate the biggest problems with concrete projects, in the order how pressing they are regarding the tipping points? E.g. identify the most inefficient and  dirty power plant of the world and replace it? Fund a specific scientific project to get the aircraft fuel problem solved? Help farmers change to organic agriculture in an area with exceptional high poisoning of water through herbicites and fertilizers? Just to mention a few ideas. I think it's easier to motivate people with small chunks of highly effective projects where the personal impact is way easier to see than just a big fond where you don't even know what exactly your money is taken for. Perhaps one could even engage the people in a community voting between different similiar impactful solutions what to do first. But also here it is at the moment just an idea and I would enjoy finding people to wrap the mind around as well and if it seems a realistic option to start sth. together.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "jHupSb7DqEGmhPtTj", "user": {"username": "Janika"}}, {"_id": "pxJeyfAgpbXZeN2uM", "postedAt": "2023-10-13T20:05:32.213Z", "postId": "Jvkx85biHHAeCiSDA", "htmlBody": "<p>Is there any online aggregator for short term volunteering opportunities with EA-affiliated orgs?</p><p>Anecdotally I've seen a lot of interest in volunteering among the EAs in my area, but a quick search for volunteering opportunities online only shows the more traditional \"staff a soup kitchen\" or \"do phone banking\" style opportunities.

Our activism was about convincing individuals to stop consuming animal products out of personal compassion. This is a good thing, I think, but the problem is that arguments appealing to compassion will only appeal to the already compassionate. If someone just doesn't care about the animals, all the vegan arguments in the world won't convince them.&nbsp;<br><br>Then I found the EA community, and saw that you were taking concrete, evidence-based actions to improve the lives of animals.

I'm sorry that I didn't sae this earlier (the holiday season has been extremely busy for me!). To answer your question (\"how do EA animal advocacy programs differ from typical vegan advocacy organizations' initiatives?\"), there are three main differences (and one minor thing to keep in mind):&nbsp;</p><ol><li>EA animal welfare advocacy isn't necessarily focused on total animal liberation in the immediate term -- although animal liberation is absolutely our ultimate goal. Because EA is based on utilitarian ethics (in a nutshell, utilitarianism is the moral claim that the greatest practical good should be done for the greatest number of moral patients [sentient beings]), we believe <i>any</i> improvement to sentient beings' quality of life is a good thing, and to cause it is a moral imperative. Therefore, EA animal initiatives focus on things like eliminating abusive animal agriculture practices like cages and maceration in egg production, in addition to reducing animal product use worldwide.&nbsp;</li><li>EA also has a long-term focus, so our animal initiatives fund technologies that show strong probabilities of reducing animal exploitation in the future (e.g., lab-grown meat and dairy, cellular agriculture more broadly), even if such interventions have little immediate impact.&nbsp;</li><li>More broadly, EA animal charities (like all EA programs) focus on <i>evidentiary support</i>. Our initiatives are constantly measured against qualitative and quantitative data to ensure they are meeting their goals -- and if they aren't, they are defunded and scrapped. In many non-EA charities, ineffective programs may be retained simply for sentimental or pecuniary reasons.&nbsp;</li><li>This is a minor point, but the majority of EA members / practitioners are vegans or are vegetarian and working toward veganism. Aside from vegan activism itself, there is no other social movement, community, or philosophy in the Western world* that is so pro-vegan and pro-animal as Effective Altruism. That means a lot to me.<br><br>*in the East, Jainism and many forms of Buddhism are equally pro-animal and anti-carnism</li></ol><p>I hope this answers your questions! I'm not one of those EAs who believes the movement is flawless or without fault, and there are things I wish EA animal welfare would do differently (like placing abolitionism of animal exploitation at the center of its goals), but on the whole I strongly believe EA initiatives do the most good for the animals, when compared to non-EA large-scale vegan programs.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless of what you conclude about EA, thank you for standing up for our marginalized sentient siblings -- it means so much. Have a fabulous holiday season! :)&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "Q2wvB5mFJqErZAt6h", "user": {"username": "Hayven Jackson"}}, {"_id": "97cgQsRH45xCjG9tB", "postedAt": "2023-12-26T18:37:25.222Z", "postId": "Jvkx85biHHAeCiSDA", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi!
