These models predict that <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/emptyplanet.pdf\"><u>with a shrinking population</u></a>, economic growth and technological progress stop and humanity stagnates into extinction. Metascience proposals focus mostly on improving the design of scientific institutions. This is surely important, but in the face of rapidly declining population growth rates it is like making a dam more efficient when the river is running dry.</p><h3>Why Are People So Important?</h3><p>Physical capital is subject to diminishing returns and depreciation which inevitably bring its impact on economic growth to zero. People, on the other hand, have increasing returns. As groups of people get larger, they can cooperate and specialize making the group more productive than the sum of its parts. But most importantly: People can share ideas.</p><p>When one person has an idea that makes them productive, it can be near-costlessly copied to all the other people in the economy, multiplying its effect. These increasing returns make people the driving force behind economic models of growth. There are important temporary sources of growth, like increasing education, research intensity, and labor force participation, but these are all changes to the percentage of your population that is devoted to discovering ideas and growing the economy. This percentage can only grow to 100 so the long run rate of growth is always constrained by the population growth rate.</p><h3>Empirical Evidence</h3><p>There is evidence that population is the fundamental input into economic growth and technological progress outside of theoretical models. There is the striking co-movement of population and per capita GDP over the long term.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:728px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DaLz98E2GMTHpfFfP/frfrav4ghxywfkanmexa\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DaLz98E2GMTHpfFfP/byguditbczd0tp3ynffd 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DaLz98E2GMTHpfFfP/ofejsf5gvssxrahkepfz 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DaLz98E2GMTHpfFfP/jwyyngxsbd7m3jnvccgf 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DaLz98E2GMTHpfFfP/frfrav4ghxywfkanmexa 1456w\"></figure><p>Note that this is GDP <i>per person</i> so the direct increase in production that comes from adding an extra worker to the economy is not counted here, only the increases which come from raising worker\u2019s productivity are shown.</p><p>This correlation is strong within countries and also across them. <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/108/3/681/1881850\"><u>Michael Kremer</u></a> finds that regions with larger starting populations several thousand years ago had faster technological change and population growth for the rest of their history.

Population growth is already negative in Italy and Japan. Economic growth has been completely stagnant in Japan and Italy for about as long as they have had negative population growth rates.

This claim depends a lot on the political support for fertility interventions which I\u2019m not too familiar with, but the data on existing fertility interventions suggest that certain policies can have large effects.</p><p>In 2014, the French government switched their child care rebates from a universal system to a means-tested system with sharp cutoffs at certain income levels. <a href=\"https://read.dukeupress.edu/demography/article/60/5/1493/382373/Fertility-and-Labor-Supply-Responses-to-Child\"><u>This study</u></a> finds that the cutoff reduced births by 40% among the high income families in France! (I didn\u2019t have time to fully vet this study and it seems like a huge effect from a relatively small intervention but there is a large literature on fertility interventions with varied but <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w13700\"><u>qualitatively similar conclusions</u></a>).</p><p>There is lots of <a href=\"https://ifp.org/about/\"><u>overlap between metascience and immigration</u></a> reform which is probably the easiest way to increase birth rates, at least in the US, and comes with lots of other great benefits. But birth rates are falling globally, and for all the benefits that come from bringing immigrants to high-income countries, it will probably decrease their counterfactual birthrates. Reallocating people across the world is the right thing to do but it probably quickens the global demographic transition.</p><p>Metascience should take this prediction from the models of economic growth seriously: shrinking populations end growth. Long run growth rates are bounded by the growth rate of population, so if we want a world with rapid economic growth for the next several centuries, this is the binding constraint.</p>", "user": {"username": "Maxwell Tabarrok"}}, {"_id": "faELcsmLdYqsk9pCn", "title": "Should I prove myself first by prestigious employers or go directly into the fields I want to end up in?", "postedAt": "2023-11-26T08:08:07.983Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm currently pursuing my undergraduate Computer Science degree in Germany and so far it's going very well.

The forum posts mostly seem to talk about meat consumption and global health donations without using numbers.  I haven\u2019t read most of the linked material though, so there\u2019s a good chance someone has already come up with parts of what I\u2019ve written below \u2013 if that\u2019s the case, please let me know where I can read it in the comments!</p>\n<h3>Framework</h3>\n<p>An assumption is that work that would otherwise be done by each agent has no value to the other.</p>\n<p>Cost effectiveness = unit of value/cost</p>\n<p>Percent of an intervention\u2019s cost an agent should be willing to fund = percent effectiveness estimate (relative to current bar, which is the level of cost-effectiveness required for an intervention to be funded)</p>\n<p>Leverage factor = 1/percent effectiveness estimate</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve recently been thinking about the problem of antibiotic resistance, which is partly caused by animal agriculture (bad for nonhuman animals) and prevents medicine from working (bad for humans and nonhuman animals).  Depending on the effectiveness of a campaign that tackles both issues, you could get gains from collaboration.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say Open Philanthropy has two teams: animal welfare (AW) and global health and development (GH&amp;D).  AW thinks that the best intervention is a corporate campaign against Purdue to change to a slower-growing breed.  AW also thinks that a corporate campaign against JBS would be 92% as impactful as the campaign against Purdue, but it won\u2019t be quite as effective since their feed gives the chickens stronger bones, making the rapid growth rates less of a welfare issue.</p>\n<p>GH&amp;D thinks that the best intervention is GiveWell\u2019s top recommendation.  GH&amp;D also thinks that the campaign against Purdue wouldn\u2019t have any appreciable effect on human well-being, since they don\u2019t use medically important antibiotics, and thus don\u2019t contribute to antibiotic resistance that will be problematic for humans.  However, since JBS uses many medically relevant antibiotics, they think a corporate chicken campaign against them could be 12% as effective as GiveWell\u2019s recommendation.  If the campaign works, the slower-growing breeds will require fewer antibiotics, thereby contributing less to the problem of antibiotic resistance.</p>\n<p>The corporate campaign will cost $1,000,000 regardless of which company is targeted.  Each team has a $1,000,000 budget.  Without trade, GH&amp;D will spend all their money on GiveWell recommendations, and AW will spend all their money on the Purdue campaign.  Each considers the other\u2019s impact to be 0 units, while theirs is 10 units.</p>\n<p>GH&amp;D should be willing to fund up to 12% of the JBS campaign (leverage factor = 8.33), assuming someone else, who would otherwise generate no value in their view, funds the rest.  AW should be willing to fund up to 92% of the JBS campaign (leverage factor 1.09), assuming someone else, who would otherwise generate no value in their view, funds the rest.</p>\n<p>With trade, GH&amp;D will fund 8-12% of the campaign, and AW fund 88-92%.  We\u2019ve already discussed how to derive the maximum percentages.  The minimum percentage is simply the smallest amount they could fund while leaving the other equally well off.  GH&amp;D must fund at least 8% because AW only benefits by funding 92% or less.  Anywhere in these ranges, therefore, both are better off than they were before.  Let\u2019s say GH&amp;D funds 10% and AW funds 90%.</p>\n<p>The JBS campaign generates 9.2 units of value for AW and 1.2 units of value for GH&amp;D.  AW spends their remaining $100,000 on a fraction of the Purdue campaign, generating 1 unit of value.  GH&amp;D spends their remaining $900,000 on GiveWell recommended charities, generating 9 units of value.  At the end of the day, both AW and GH&amp;D end up with 10.2 units of value generated, which is greater than the original 10 they would have achieved without trade.</p>\n<p>I suspect this sort of trade doesn\u2019t happen often because it\u2019s rare for a particular intervention to be sufficiently impactful under two worldviews to warrant collaborative funding.  It\u2019s also hard to prove that one would have donated less to the secondary intervention (i.e. that it was not already the top intervention).  However, such a trade seems plausible with antibiotic resistance.

When people are ill they cannot farm, drive, teach \u2013 function, so the improvement in health leads to economic as well as humanitarian benefits.</p><p>This is a terrific contribution from the tens of thousands of donors who have contributed US$180 million over the last two years, and the many partners with whom we work that make possible the distribution of these life-saving nets.</p><p>We received our millionth donation recently, a nice milestone. Our total funds raised is now US$543 million.</p><p>But these numbers are not as important as the impact numbers once all the nets we have funded in our 19 years and can currently fund, have been distributed and have had their impact: 250 million nets funded and distributed, 450 million people protected, 185,000 deaths prevented, 100 to 185 million cases of malaria averted and US$6.5 billion of improvement in local economies.</p><p>Many recognise the impact of AMF\u2019s work, yet we still have significant immediate funding gaps that are over US$300m. While this number seems daunting, every US$2 matters as that funds another net and allows two more people to be protected when they sleep at night, so no support is too small or inconsequential.</p><p><strong>Partnerships are crucial to what we do</strong></p><p>We work with partners at every stage of our work: funding nets; ensuring operations proceed effectively and nets are distributed as intended; and monitoring net use, performance and impact. Over the last few years we have strengthened relationships with key organisations that have allowed AMF to contribute more and work faster and more effectively.</p><p>AMF has strong partnerships with the Global Fund and the US\u2019s President\u2019s Malaria Initiative, and we work together closely to ensure net distributions are fully funded. None of us can work alone. Typically AMF funds nets for a distribution and the Global Fund or PMI funds the non-net costs. Non-net costs are shipping and transport costs, household registration activities to ensure each household receives the right number of nets, and the distribution of the nets themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Nets are always distributed in partnership with national health systems. This is because all households in a regional or nationwide distribution are visited in the pre-distribution registration phase to establish how many nets are needed per individual household, and this work involves visiting hundreds of thousands or millions of households and needs a work force that only a national system can provide.&nbsp;</p><p>A final set of partnerships in-country that are very important for AMF\u2019s work are those with independent monitoring partners with whom AMF contracts to carry out data-driven monitoring of all phases of a distribution.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AMF\u2019s focus has been, and still is, on nets</strong></p><p>This focus on nets is not accidental. Long-lasting insecticidal nets are the most effective way of preventing malaria. Malaria-carrying mosquitoes typically bite between 10 o/c at night and two in the morning so if people in malarious areas are protected when they sleep at night, the impact on malaria transmission is significant. In the environments in which nets are distributed, they will frequently develop holes and rips and tears, but because the nets are covered with insecticide they remain 99+% effective. This is because the mosquito does not do an aerobatics manoeuvre through a hole, but instead lands on the nets and walks to the hole picking up insecticide as it does so, and that causes knockdown \u2013 the mosquito dies.</p><p>AMF has developed over 15 years an expertise in selecting the right type of net for a given distribution. It is not one net type fits all, as different areas, regions and countries have different levels of insecticide resistance (this has developed over the last twenty years and particularly the last five) and other factors that influence a specific net choice. These net choices materially affects the impact of the nets in the communities being protected.</p><p><strong>Operations is at the heart of AMF\u2019s work</strong></p><p>Operations takes up the majority of AMF\u2019s time and is our focus. We often say that you cannot mess up, per se, on the amount of money you raise but boy can you mess up on operations if you don\u2019t get that right. Huge attention has gone into this area over many years, learning lessons, improving and refining what we do, to ensure that the distributions we fund have nets reach recipients as intended, accountably so and with comprehensive data at the household level to evidence it.</p><p>We focus on planning as it sets operations off on the right track; we focus on building strong relationships and strong procedures with operating partners as that ensures things run smoothly; and we focus on ensuring comprehensive and reliable data are collected as that delivers evidence of outcome.</p><p>We monitor all stages of a distribution, from planning, through household registration and net distribution to post-distribution monitoring of net presence, use and condition. AMF funds this monitoring. We like to say that we monitor the living daylights out of what we do! This is because we believe monitoring improves outcomes as it can influence behaviour, allows us to learn lessons so that we can adjust if necessary and improve and, crucially, it is a necessary mechanism to ensure we have high levels of confidence in knowing what has happened in a distribution. AMF funds and controls this work.</p><p>Recently in the Togo distribution, our monitoring partner, GRASE Population, identified a village that had been registered for distribution but nets had not been given out when they should have. Our monitor contacted the national program, who were grateful to be informed, and who immediately made arrangements to ensure the village received nets during the \u2018mop up\u2019 phase of the distribution.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A small but growing team that punches above its weight</strong></p><p>2023 has seen AMF\u2019s focused team grow to 13, with the addition of seven new team members \u2013 Alicja, Richard, Neil, Jeremy, Izabel, Helena and Eliette. We are delighted to have team members not only in the UK but now also in the US (Boston), Kenya (Nairobi), Germany (Dresden) and South Africa (Cape Town).</p><p><strong>2023 has been an important year for malaria vaccines</strong></p><p>Outstanding scientific progress has meant for the first time in human history we have vaccines for a parasitic disease. The impact of these first vaccines will become known over time. They are a welcome addition to the malaria control toolkit.&nbsp;</p><p>We hope one day a vaccine, or a gene-drive technology solution, might be a silver bullet.&nbsp;</p><p>One way we find it helpful to think about a vaccine is to consider performance along four parameters, with a strong benchmark being the polio vaccine: % efficacy, proportion of the target population that can benefit from the vaccine, number of doses that need to be administered and the need or otherwise to refrigerate the vaccine, so called \u2018cold chain logistics\u2019. The latter two parameters can have a material impact on cost. For polio: 100%; 100%; one administration only; and no cold chain logistics. For the two malaria vaccines, 35% - 65%; a subgroup only, albeit an important one of 6-18 month olds; three doses one month apart and a fourth a year later; and refrigeration is required.</p><p>The fervent hope is that the remarkable achievement of these scientists will be developed further.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2024 to 2026 are shaping up to be challenging years&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There is already a significant shortfall in funding for malaria control activities, including for net distribution programmes so miraculous things will have to happen in the coming year if we are to get anywhere close, globally and across all funding partners, to where we need to be to be able to drive malaria impact numbers down. Counterfactually of course, if the funding that is being brought to bear was not there, the number of people affected by malaria would be horrifically higher. Currently there are ~620,000 deaths a year from malaria and 250 million people fall sick.&nbsp;</p><p>The Global Fund is the world\u2019s largest funder of malaria control activities and has a funding replenishment round every three years, with funding provided by global governments, that determines the funds it has available across three disease areas: HIV/Aids, malaria and TB. The target for the 2024 to 2026 period was raising US$18 billion, largely to stand still. The funding achieved was US$15.7 billion. The shortfall will have major ramifications and we are already seeing the impact in planning in the Democratic Republic of Congo, one of the two countries in the world worst affected by malaria, for the 2024 to 2026 programme. Currently only 65% of the nets desperately needed will be able to be funded. We have never had this low a percentage of funding at this stage, with limited additional funding forecast.</p><p>But we are positive, and gaps make us work harder.</p><p>We must remember that enormous progress was made in reducing the impact of malaria over a 15 year period from 2000 to 2015 with a 60% reduction in malaria deaths and two thirds of that being down to the distribution of the humble bednet.</p><p>Aside gaps in funding, we face challenges of increasing costs in some areas (COVID didn\u2019t help) and insecticide resistance is on the rise. New net products have been and are being developed to deal with this and progress in some areas is excellent.</p><p>We never tire of reminding people that every US$2 net matters as it protects two people when they sleep at night. And given the funding gaps, we put each of those US$2 to work straight away when they come in.</p><p><strong>You</strong></p><p>If you are interested in joining or continuing the fight against malaria in 2024, thank you.</p>", "user": {"username": "RobM"}}, {"_id": "2YFCg2TsJXzs3Bg7q", "title": "What happened to the contra kidney donation post?", "postedAt": "2023-11-23T22:13:36.434Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm considering donating my kidney and wanted to look at the data from a recent contra-Alexander post re kidney donation.&nbsp;</p><p>But the post seems to have disappeared.</p><p>Does anyone have access to the research cited in the post?

High quality studies show that preventing violence from occurring in the first instance are effective, and that community-led programs that aim to shift individual, interpersonal and society level attitudes and norms around gender are particularly effective (more information in this previous post). Violence against women and girls is undoubtedly an important area (more information <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/majcwf7i8pW8eMJ3v/new-cause-area-violence-against-women-and-girls\">here</a>), and there are specific, cost-effective preventative interventions that can help address this global issue (more information <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/uH9akQzJkzpBD5Duw/what-you-can-do-to-help-stop-violence-against-women-and\">here</a>)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>What is happening</strong></h3><p>The Life You Can Save is proud to provide recommendations for a broad range of important issue areas.&nbsp; They are now adding nonprofits focused on preventing violence against women and girls - with far-reaching benefits to families and entire communities.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cedovip.org/\"><u>Center for Domestic Violence Prevention</u></a><u>, CEDOVIP</u>, is an Ugandan nonprofit that implements community-driven, cost-effective programming: $150 for a woman to live a year free from violence. Their program implementation has shown a 52% reduction in intimate partner violence, with effects that continue after 3 years.</li><li><a href=\"https://inbreakthrough.org/\"><u>Breakthrough Trust</u></a> in India promotes culture-based change, focusing on girls and boys at ages 11-24 by redesigning school curricula and running mass media campaigns. Breakthrough\u2019s programs reduce early marriage, increase girls enrollment in school and increase health care access.</li><li><a href=\"https://raisingvoices.org/\"><u>Raising Voices</u></a> (inclusion in fund pending due diligence)&nbsp; identifies the most impactful ways of reducing violence against women and children -( including the programming implemented by CEDOVIP), supports evidence-generation on best practice in violence prevention, and has worked with over 600 organisations throughout Africa, Asia Pacific and Latin America to build the capacity of community-based violence prevention centres.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h3><strong>Caveats</strong></h3><p>While the data underscores the measurable success&nbsp; and high cost-effectiveness of community-led programs in reducing violence (you can see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/uH9akQzJkzpBD5Duw/what-you-can-do-to-help-stop-violence-against-women-and\">here</a> for some estimations of the same), it's crucial to recognize the profound, and enduring, and more intangible impact of such initiative in changing cultural and societal norms. Changing the culture that perpetuates violence creates freedom for women to thrive - reducing ongoing fear of violence, improving family and child wellbeing, and increasing women\u2019s ability to contribute productively in society and the workforce. Long-term social change demands a multidimensional, intersectional approach, focusing on the transformation of attitudes and norms. These intangible benefits, immeasurable in their impact, work towards creating a more just and equitable world.</p><h3><br><strong>What you can do</strong></h3><p>If you would like to help contribute to ensure that violence against women and girls is prevented, and we can live in a world where respect, equity and understanding flourish, please consider donating to this fund.

I've had a few people ask me about this, so I thought I'd compile all of my knowledge in this article.</li><li>I assume that the audience of this article already: know what academic research is; know how to conduct academic research (e.g. at the level of a Masters degree or perhaps a research-focused Bachelors degree); have a basic grasp of what a journal is; and have the skills to read scientific publications.</li><li>This article is based on my own views and my own experiences in academic publishing. I expect that there will be many academics who have a different view or a different strategy. My own experiences come from publishing in ecology, economics, agriculture/fisheries, psychology, and science communication.</li></ul><h1><strong>Should you publish your work in a peer-reviewed journal?</strong></h1><p><i>Edit: There is also some discussion on this decision in a recent forum article </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xbiJRzSJKq69RRHDd/why-you-should-publish-your-research-in-academic-fashion\"><i>here</i></a><i>, and that article's comments too, as well as </i><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/is-it-better-to-blog-or-formally-publish/\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></p><h2><i>Advantages of publishing in peer-reviewed journals</i></h2><ul><li>Publication in a journal can make your research appear more credible. This won't always matter, but my colleagues and I have encountered a few instances during animal advocacy where stakeholders (e.g. food retail companies, government policymakers) find research more compelling if it is published in a journal.</li><li>Publication in a journal can make&nbsp;<i>you</i> appear more credible. This is particularly true in non-EA circles, like if you want to apply for research jobs or funding from outside of the EA community.</li><li>Key ideas can be more easily noticed and adopted by other academics, and perhaps other stakeholders like government policymakers. I don't know how influential this effect is.</li><li>Your research can be more easily criticised by academics. This can provide an important voice of critique from experts outside of the EA community, which could be one way to detect if a piece of research is flawed in some way. This is my motivation for publishing a study I conducted where I used an economic model to estimate the impact of slow-growing broilers on aggregate animal welfare - submitting a paper like this for peer review is a great way to get feedback from experts in that specific branch of economics.</li></ul><h2><i>Drawbacks of publishing in peer-reviewed journals</i></h2><ul><li>Publications are not impact. Publishing your work is a tool that can sometimes help you to achieve impact. If we're trying to do the most good in the world, that may&nbsp;<i>sometimes</i> involve publishing peer-reviewed research (see above). In other cases, it'll be better to spend that time on more impactful work.&nbsp;</li><li>Not all research is suitable for peer-reviewed journals. For example, in the EA community, it is common to conduct prioritisation research to determine the most promising interventions or strategies, like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/farmed-fish-advocacy-in-denmark\"><u>our recent work on fish advocacy in Denmark</u></a>. That fish advocacy report would only be interesting to advocacy organisations and doesn't contribute any new understanding of reality beyond the strategy of one organisation, so it is probably not be publishable in a journal (though a smaller version focused on the Appendix of that report may be publishable).</li><li>Publishing in peer-reviewed journals costs time and energy. When I publish in a peer-reviewed journal (compared to when I publish a report on my organisation's website), I usually spend a couple of extra days writing the draft, and then a few extra days addressing peer review comments over the following months.</li><li>Peer-reviewed papers have significantly longer timelines. After the first draft of a manuscript is done, it might take 6 or 12 months or even longer (most of which is spent waiting) before the article is finally published.</li><li>Peer review can be emotionally challenging (see below).</li><li>Peer review does not guarantee quality research. In the experience of myself and probably most academics, peer review does, on average, increase the quality of papers (1). That said, there are lots of examples of obviously low-quality and non-rigorous studies in peer-reviewed journals (including one or two of my own!). There are also lots of examples of rigorous, top-notch pieces of research published outside of peer-reviewed journals (including many posts on the EA Forum). Publishing is not a panacea, but it can be a tool to help you achieve impact.</li><li>It's no secret that the peer review system and the publishing industry have major challenges. Major issues include the replication crisis; extremely high numbers of publications being churned out each year; discrimination; uncompensated labour by peer reviewers and editors; shady, questionable practices such as p-hacking; outright fraud such as data fabrication; and predatory journals. There is lots of information about all of these available online. The publishing industry is not perfect, but it can help you achieve impact.</li></ul><h2><i>How peer-reviewed papers differ from EA Forum articles</i></h2><ul><li>Compared to EA Forum articles, peer-reviewed papers are more detailed in the literature that they cite. Typically, when you're writing a paper, you need to demonstrate a deep, detailed understanding of the peer-reviewed literature relevant to your research. It is common for papers to have even 60 - 100 references, though many shorter papers have fewer. For one of my peer-reviewed papers (a short opinion article), I read roughly 50 papers and cited 15 of these. For another one of my papers (a long review article), I read roughly 400 papers and cited 100 of these.</li><li>Peer-reviewed science tends to be more focused on testing ideas and theories, not having impact. This means that the focus of the papers tends to differ from the focus of EA Forum articles, though it is still very possible to publish a high-impact piece of research in a journal. It's just important to understand this difference to make sure you're pitching your work in the right way when writing and submitting to a journal.</li><li>Peer-reviewed papers are written in a different tone and style. The main differences from an EA Forum article are a) the academic writing style (see below), and b) the use of in-text citations rather than links to sources.</li></ul><h2><i>How I think about publishing</i></h2><ul><li>I hold two beliefs: 1) publishing is a game, and a pretty silly game at that; 2) you can publish any piece of research, as long as the paper is at least passable in quality.</li><li>It is very common to have a paper rejected by one or multiple journals before having it accepted by another journal (2\u20134). One small survey found that it was normal for authors to submit papers 4 times before being accepted, with one author reporting a paper that was submitted 11 times before finally being accepted (4)! While this sometimes means that the paper is eventually accepted by a less prestigious journal, many papers are actually accepted by&nbsp;<i>more</i> prestigious journals (3). I have had opinion articles accepted by&nbsp;<i>PNAS and Trends in Ecology and Evolution</i>, both pretty swanky journals, after being rejected by less prestigious biology journals.</li><li>There is a pretty low level of agreement between individual peer reviewers (5), and there are many, many journals. If reviewers don't like your paper and it gets rejected from one journal, there is every chance that the paper will be appreciated by another set of reviewers from another journal.</li><li>Authors, reviewers, and editors are not gods - they are simply nerds with laptops, just like the rest of us.</li><li>Therefore, if your work is at least passable in quality and rigour, the chances of achieving publication are pretty high as long as you persist in submitting to new journals.</li><li>Under this cynical view of the publishing industry, the most important skill is not necessarily to produce quality research - rather, the most important skill is to cultivate \"rejection resilience\" (4). Of course, we also have a responsibility to produce high-quality, rigorous research, but this is not always a requirement for actually publishing your work.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/i4vihmhtki7pbKLxq/kluziuyh7tyjrwph6l1s\"></p><h1><strong>Types of journals</strong></h1><p>A quick Google tells me that there are around 30,000 to 50,000 peer-reviewed journals currently in existence. The database Journal Citation Reports lists over 21,000 journals. Even once you narrow this down to journals that would accept a particular paper, you still might be looking at hundreds or even thousands of journals that you could plausibly target. Here is one way to think about the different journals out there - this is just how I think about journals, and this is not a comprehensive or exhaustive system. Note that the first four categories overlap.</p><h2><i>Top-tier journals</i></h2><p>Firstly, there are the really swanky, top-tier journals. These are highly prestigious. Think&nbsp;<i>Nature</i>,&nbsp;<i>Science</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>&nbsp;<i>(PNAS)</i>. These typically have Impact Factors of above ~10, and sometimes above 30. Those three journals publish articles across a variety of disciplines, but there are also many top-tier journals that are specific to certain fields.</p><h2><i>High-tier and mid-tier journals.</i></h2><p>Secondly, there are high-tier and mid-tier journals. These are the standard, bread-and-butter journals, where most academics will publish most of their work - they are perfectly respectable places to publish. Depending on the discipline, these may have Impact Factors between 0.5 and ~10. In biology, this might include&nbsp;<i>Global Change Biology</i>,&nbsp;<i>Marine Biology</i>,&nbsp;<i>Fisheries Research</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology</i>. In economics, this might include&nbsp;<i>Environmental and Resource Economics</i> or&nbsp;<i>Journal of Labor Economics</i>.</p><h2><i>Low-tier journals</i></h2><p>On the less prestigious end are low-tier journals, which usually have an Impact Factor below 1. These can be perfectly rigorous journals, but are often focused on a very specific region (e.g.&nbsp;<i>Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens</i>;&nbsp;<i>Icelandic Review of Politics &amp; Administration</i>) or a very specific topic (e.g.&nbsp;<i>American Malacological Bulletin</i>). These can be a good place to publish if you a) care about your work being published, b)&nbsp;<i>do not</i> care about the reach of your paper or prestige of your journal, and c) have already tried a few high- and mid-tier journals.</p><h2><i>Open-access mega journals</i></h2><p>Open-access mega journals are a relatively recent phenomenon. These journals tend to have some unusual characteristics: they publish very large numbers of papers; they often don't care about the novelty of a paper, but will accept the paper as long as it is rigorous and passes peer review; and they charge the author a fee for publishing (6). They'll only really reject if the work is actually low-quality or unscientific. But the trade-off is that they do charge quite large fees for publication (from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, depending on the journal and the type of article). You may be able to apply for a fee waiver or discount if you're from a developing country and/or if you do not belong to a university or institution. Often, a single publisher owns a large number of these journals.</p><p>Major examples include the publishers Frontiers (e.g.&nbsp;<i>Frontiers in Psychology</i>), MDPI (e.g.&nbsp;<i>Animals</i>), and other journals like&nbsp;<i>PeerJ</i> and&nbsp;<i>PLOS ONE</i>. Note that open-access mega journals do conduct rigorous peer review and are therefore&nbsp;<i>not</i> predatory journals (see below). I quite like these journals, and they tend to be open-minded, but I wouldn't exclusively rely on them - some academics are wary of publishing&nbsp;<i>only</i> in open-access mega journals, and it is not always possible to fork out $2,000 or more for a publication fee.</p><h2><i>Journals that work differently</i></h2><p>There are a few interesting journals that I want to flag here.&nbsp;<i>F10000 Research</i> is an open-access mega journal that publishes&nbsp;<i>before</i> peer review - then, peer review comments are made public, and the authors can adopt the comments into a revised paper that is published in place of the old one (though this journal charges publication fees).&nbsp;<i>Journal of Controversial Ideas</i> is notable for allowing anonymous publication. Depending on the field, there are also some journals that explicitly invite replication studies or null results.</p><h2><i>Places to publish your research that are not journals</i></h2><p>Depending on your motivations for publishing, there are places you can publish your work that aren't actually peer-reviewed journals, but share some characteristics of journals. For example, see&nbsp;<i>The Unjournal</i>. I'd include the EA Forum in this category. I'd also include pre-prints, but I'll discuss these more later in this article (see below).</p><h2><i>Student journals</i></h2><p>There are some journals, often affiliated with specific universities, that specifically publish papers from undergraduate students or graduate students. I'd usually stay away from these. While these journals are typically rigorous, they also tend to have low prestige and small audiences. I think most papers that are publishable in student journals are also publishable in mainstream journals.</p><h2><i>Predatory journals</i></h2><p>Unfortunately, there are many predatory journals out there. These journals either don't conduct peer review, or conduct a minimal peer review as a simple formality. These journals often charge for publication. If you look online, you can find many lists of predatory journals and predatory publishers, and there are guides to help you evaluate if a journal is predatory (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beallslist.net/how-to-recognize-predatory-journals/\"><u>Beall's List</u></a>). Stay far, far away from these.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/i4vihmhtki7pbKLxq/rushtl9n3dexarfqmo6e\"></p><h1><br><strong>Types of papers</strong></h1><p>There are a number of different types of papers that can be written and submitted to journals. Not all journals accept all of these types, and different journals have different definitions - make sure you check the \"instructions to authors\" page of the journal.</p><ul><li><i>Research articles</i>. This forms the bulk of published research. These are empirical studies based on original data. They typically fall in the range of 4,000 to 10,000 words, depending on the journal.</li><li><i>Short reports. Some journals accept shorter research articles. These are also empirical studies based on original data, but they are shorter in length. They typically fall in the range of 1,000 to 6,000 words, depending on the journal. This can be appropriate for publishing pilot studies or any other study that does not need to be a full research article. These are surprisingly high value - they are faster to write, are faster to get through peer review, and often just as impactful as full-length research articles.</i></li><li><i>Review articles</i>. These are literature reviews. These range from glorified opinion articles, to narrative reviews, to systematic reviews, to systematic reviews accompanied by meta-analyses.</li><li><i>Opinion / perspective articles</i>. Some journals accept opinion or perspective articles (these often have creative names, like the \"Science &amp; Society\" article type in&nbsp;<i>Trends in Ecology and Evolution</i>). These are also critical, rigorously researched, and well-supported by existing literature, but they can often present a particular viewpoint. These usually don't involve any data or empirical analysis. It&nbsp;<i>is&nbsp;</i>sometimes possible to publish opinion or perspective articles that rely on a small empirical analysis or a pilot study, as long as it is presented in the right way.</li><li><i>Reply articles</i>. Many journals let authors write short replies that respond to other authors' publications in that journal. These can offer agreement and extend on the original paper, or they can be critical and point out flaws. Paper fights!</li></ul><h1><strong>Choosing journals to target</strong></h1><p><i>Edit 23rd March 2024: I've just found </i><a href=\"https://www.journalguide.com/\"><i>JournalGuide</i></a><i> and </i><a href=\"https://scirev.org/\"><i>SciRev</i></a><i> which seem like useful databases of journals that let you filter by discipline and then sort by both impact factor and publication speed. Seem like really useful tools for picking journals.</i></p><p>These are the main considerations when considering journals:</p><ul><li>(Essential) Does the journal have an article type that matches the type and style of paper that you're aiming to write? You can see this on the \"information for authors\" page on the journal's website.</li><li>(Essential) Does the journal's scope seem like it'd include your paper? Has the journal published papers like yours before? Some journals are very narrow in what they're interested in, while others are much more open-minded.</li><li>(Essential) Does the journal have fees? This is pretty common for open-access journals. There are so many journals in existence that you'll be able to find many without fees.</li><li>(Helpful but non-essential) What is the journal's impact factor? I've just found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://exaly.com/journals/if/\">this site</a>, which seems to list all journals and their impact factors. You probably wouldn't want to go below an impact factor of 1 (though it is more common for journals in the humanities to have lower impact factors, even if they're swanky journals). Bigger is better (mostly). But journals with impact factors that are too big (above ~10-15ish) also have very high rejection rates. So I reckon impact factors of between ~2.0 and ~8.0, based on my gut feel, would be the sweet spot for many science and economics papers.</li><li>(Helpful but non-essential) Does the journal have an international focus, rather than a local focus? (See \"Low-tier journals\", above). If you're interested in credibility and career capital, it might be worth picking a journal with an international focus (and therefore a stronger reputation).</li><li>(Helpful but non-essential) Does the journal have a name that will look relevant on your resume? For example, if you want to get into a job in economics, it probably wouldn't hurt to have the word \"economics\" in the journal title.</li></ul><p>There are some strategies:</p><ul><li>Make a list of between 3 and 10, guided by the above criteria. Make sure they have a section that fits your type of article and your word count. Pay attention to whether they charge Article Processing Charges or page fees. Ideally, your list will consist of mostly high- and mid-tier journals, though you can also include a few low-tier journals and open-access mega journals if you feel like it. Be prepared to modify this list after you receive feedback on your paper.</li><li>You can only submit a particular paper to one journal at a time, but having a list makes it easier to submit your paper to a new journal if it gets rejected.</li><li>Some people simply start at the highest tier journals (<i>Nature</i>,&nbsp;<i>Science</i>, and so on) and then work their way down the list. This isn't a bad strategy (2). It is good to be ambitious (don't sell yourself short!). However, it is also good to be honest with yourself about whether a particular paper has any chance of getting into&nbsp;<i>Nature</i> or&nbsp;<i>Science&nbsp;</i>so you can save yourself time and energy.</li><li>Most research questions would fit well in multiple disciplines. For example, a paper on intensification of agriculture in India might fit into journals in agriculture, agricultural economics, international development, poverty economics, animal welfare, food security, or possibly even environmental sustainability.</li><li>You can find information by searching Google, and for many fields you can find blog articles online that make recommendations. If you know which existing papers are similar to yours, you can look at where those papers were published. If you are affiliated with a university, you might have access to tools like InCites Journal Citation Reports. (<i>Edit 23rd March 2024: Also see </i><a href=\"https://www.journalguide.com/\"><i>JournalGuide</i></a><i> and </i><a href=\"https://scirev.org/\"><i>SciRev</i></a>)</li><li>Over time, you develop a feel for which journals accept which type of work. For example, not all entomology journals will be keen on insect welfare research, but other journals will find that very swanky.</li></ul><h1><strong>Coauthors</strong></h1><ul><li>If you've conducted a study as part of a team, then it is typical for the people who have contributed to the study to be listed as co-authors on the paper. This might include people who helped with data collection and analysis; people who contributed in other important ways, like designing the study and helping to write the paper; and supervisors. The person who did the bulk of the \"work\" on the paper is usually the first author, though this is not always the case (e.g. some fields list authors alphabetically). Ideally, authorship and author order would be determined in advance.</li><li>It's not always clear-cut who qualifies for authorship. If somebody has helped out in a small way, it may be more appropriate for them to be listed in the \"acknowledgements\" section of the paper rather than as a coauthor. There are lots of guides on the internet if you need help figuring this out.</li><li>Coauthors will always need to approve the manuscript before it is submitted for publication (and you need to confirm that this has happened when submitting). Therefore, disputes or fallouts between coauthors will typically mean that the paper is unable to be published.</li><li>Having senior coauthors (e.g. professors or well-known academics) can help lend your paper credibility, and these coauthors will often have lots of experience going through the publication process themselves.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h1><strong>Steps for writing and submitting a paper</strong></h1><p>Your guidebook is the \"instructions for authors\" or \"guidelines for submission\" page of the journal, which you can find on the website of any journal. That page is the single most important document to read, understand, and follow to the letter. Pay close attention to it, and do exactly what it says.</p><h2><i>Writing the paper</i></h2><ul><li>I assume that you already know how to conduct research and that you know what a journal article looks like (e.g. structure, academic tone). There are guides available that can help you with those things too.</li><li>In terms of writing style, there are two schools of thought. The book&nbsp;<i>Writing Scientific Research Articles: Strategy and Steps</i> by Cargill and O'Connell is a great general introduction to academic writing. The work of Helen Sword and the book&nbsp;<i>The Sense of Style</i> by Steven Pinker expand on the academic style by adding style and flair. If you're not yet comfortable writing in academic language, I'd stick to the first option. If you have experience and want to improve the reach of your paper, it may be worth exploring the second option.</li><li>Emphasise the global relevance and policy implications of your research, particularly in the abstract, introduction, and discussion. Often, your research will involve a particular local area (e.g. you might use a particular country or state as a study location, or a particular species as a study species), but it's often wise to hold off on the details of this until the beginning of your methods. A colleague is working on a study about wealth and intensification of animal agriculture in India, but the focus of the paper is on the theory of wealth and agricultural intensification; India is presented as a study site, not mentioned until the methods section of the paper. Likewise, one of my PhD chapters was a study about cooperative management of a shellfish fishery in south-east Australia, but I pitched the chapter as \"extending the economic/game theory of fisheries management to account for climate change and environmental fluctuations\".</li><li>If you have difficulty writing or editing your English, there are paid proofreaders who can help. Just make sure you pay attention to the journal's policies on paid proofreaders/writing assistants - they often need to be acknowledged in some way.</li></ul><h2><i>Parts of a journal submission</i></h2><p>When you submit a paper, you also need to submit a bunch of other stuff:</p><ul><li>The manuscript itself. This is the main file containing your paper. If the \"instructions for author page\" doesn't give you specific instructions, it's standard for this file to be formatted with double spacing, size 12 Times New Roman font, page numbers, and sometimes line numbers. There are templates&nbsp;<a href=\"https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/publishing-your-research/writing-your-paper/formatting-and-templates/\"><u>here</u></a> if you want, but make sure to follow every instruction in the \"instructions for author\" page.</li><li>Figures and tables. These are sometimes included at the end of the manuscript file, or otherwise uploaded as separate files. It depends on the journal.</li><li>Title page. This lists the title of your paper, author names, author affiliations, and sometimes extra statements or other information (depending on the journal). Use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/paper-format/title-page\"><u>this guide</u></a>, and follow any extra instructions on the \"instructions for authors\" page of the journal you're targeting. Some journals want the title page as a separate file (especially if they conduct double-blind peer review), while others want the title page as the first page of the manuscript.</li><li>Cover letter. Not all journals require these. This is a document whose purpose is to convince the editor to send your paper to peer review. It should, very briefly, address the editorial board, give the title of your paper, state what your research has done, and explain why your paper is interesting and worth publishing. Be brief and compelling. The cover letter itself is not peer reviewed, so some academics embellish the truth a bit to spark the editor's interest. It's great if you can write a cover letter on a university letterhead and have it signed by an author with a title (e.g. if you or a coauthor have a PhD or are a Professor), though that's not essential. Use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/publishing-your-research/making-your-submission/writing-a-journal-article-cover-letter/\"><u>this guide</u></a>.</li><li>Various statements. Depending on the paper and the journal, you might need: a conflict of interest statement; a data availability statement; an ethics approval statement; an author contribution statement; and an acknowledgements section. These are all quick and easy, and there are examples you can copy or closely follow online.</li><li>Data and code. Some journals let you upload your data and code for review, or otherwise submit it to a data repository for public access once your paper is published. Even if you're not going to publish your data and code, make it as replicable and easy to understand as possible. This is for your own sake - it'll save you headaches when you need to make subtle adjustments to your analysis due to peer review comments, six months after you last thought about the paper. It's also polite to cite the software and any additional software packages you use (e.g. R packages).</li></ul><h2><i>Author name</i></h2><p>If it's your first submission, you'll need to figure out which name you want to publish under. Typically, this will be your full name. I'd encourage you to add your middle initial, or even your full middle name if your name is common. The idea is to have as many individual unique letters in your name as possible, to avoid being confused with other researchers in the future - it does happen.</p><p>Also consider if you're planning to change your name in the future, perhaps for marriage, gender affirmation, or religious reasons. It is possible to change your name on a published paper, but it's just a bit of extra bureaucracy that's best to avoid if possible.</p><h2><i>Pre-submission enquiry</i></h2><p>Some journals use pre-submission enquiries, and don't allow journal submissions unless you've already sparked the editor's interest with a pre-submission enquiry. This is basically an email, addressed to a particular editor, pitching your idea. This is very similar to a cover letter. Pre-submission enquiries are more common in swanky journals (e.g.&nbsp;<i>Nature</i>,&nbsp;<i>Science</i>) or review articles in high-tier journals.</p><h2><i>Submission portal</i></h2><p>Basically all journals use a submission portal to manage the submission process. You get to the submission process by clicking the big shiny \"Submit a paper\" or \"Submissions\" button on the journal website. You'll usually need to register for an account, and some journals require you to enter an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://orcid.org/\"><u>ORCID</u></a> (ORCIDs take ten seconds to make if you don't have one).</p><p>The portal will have a very structured way to submit your paper. You'll need to upload all your files in the right spots, in the right way. You'll also need to enter a bunch of information about your paper (e.g. your name, coauthor names, title, abstract, word count, number of figures and tables).&nbsp;</p><p>Some journals allow, or even require, you to recommend peer reviewers. Other journals forbid this. The point of recommending reviewers is to save the editors time, as authors typically have the best idea of who the experts in their discipline are. Editors will not always use your suggested reviewers, but they often will. Some authors will specifically choose reviewers who are likely to look on their work favourably (e.g. if the reviewer shares a philosophical view or theoretical perspective with the author). You cannot recommend reviewers if you have recently worked with them or if they belong to the same university/institution as you.</p><p>Do not communicate with the journal outside of the submission portal, unless you've been specifically asked to do so. Editors are highly time-stressed, and this will mostly annoy them. Keep communications to essential information within the portal, and keep any communications brief.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/i4vihmhtki7pbKLxq/zymukcac4qtlp5tu1ozv\"></p><h1><strong>After submission</strong></h1><h2><i>Possible outcomes</i></h2><p>After you've submitted a paper to a journal, there are four main outcomes:</p><ul><li>Desk reject. This is when your paper is rejected by the editor, without being sent to peer review. This is usually because the paper doesn't fit into the scope of the journal or because the editor just plain doesn't like it. Desk rejects are common. (Sometimes you also have a paper returned&nbsp;<i>before</i> it is sent to the editor, because an administrator has spotted formatting errors or something like that.)</li><li>Reject after review. This is when your paper is sent to peer review, and then rejected by the editor due to the peer review comments. This is also fairly common. If you take the comments on board (see below), it hopefully shouldn't happen too many times for a given paper.</li><li>Revise and resubmit. This is when your paper is sent to peer review, but the editor/peer reviewers have requested changes to the paper. You have the opportunity to revise the manuscript in line with the reviewer comments (see below), and then resubmit to the same journal. This is a great outcome - it means the editor seems interested and thinks that it could plausibly be published in the journal. Depending on the journal and how major the revisions need to be, the revised manuscript might be evaluated by the editor, by the same peer reviewers, or by different peer reviewers.</li><li>Accept. If the editor thinks your paper is high-quality and appropriate for the journal, and if the paper passes peer review, then it can be accepted by the journal. Acceptance without any revisions is quite rare - it is much more common to go through at least one round of \"revise and resubmit\" before a paper is accepted.</li></ul><h2><i>Timelines</i></h2><p>The time it takes to publish a paper strongly depends on the journal and the discipline. Many journals list their median publication times on their website. It is common to take a journal a few days or weeks to either desk reject or send the paper to peer review, and it is common for peer review to take several months. After a paper is accepted, it might take a few weeks to be published on the journal's website, though it might be uploaded as an unformatted manuscript to the journal's website in the meantime.</p><h2><i>Addressing peer review comments (revise and resubmit)</i></h2><p>A top-notch guide is the paper by Sullivan et al (7), which gives step-by-step advice for responding to peer review comments. Follow their advice. I would emphasise their key points:</p><ul><li>\"Answer every request or question, but use no more words than necessary.\"</li><li>\"Make your author response letter crystal clear\u2014as clear yet as brief as possible. [...] Brevity is a virtue, yet your responses must be complete.\"</li><li>\"The editors and reviewers are (nearly) always right.\"</li></ul><p>You might not agree with all of the comments. It is common for peer review comments to be silly or even nasty. As Peterson (8) writes: \"Dear Reviewer 2: Go F\u2019 Yourself\". Nevertheless, if you want your revised paper to be accepted by that journal, you must take all of the comments on board and adopt them all, to the best of your ability. In the case of misunderstanding, adopting a comment might not mean doing exactly what the comment says, but rather figuring out why the reviewer might have become confused and then clarifying your manuscript to avoid that misunderstanding. In practice, I've found it's usually safe to respectfully disagree with 1 comment for every 10 or 20 comments that I do adopt without complaint. (In the case of actual abuse or discrimination by the reviewers, which sadly does happen, things are different - see the below section on discrimination.)</p><h2><i>Addressing peer review comments (reject after review)</i></h2><p>If your paper is rejected after peer review, meaning you need to submit your paper to a new journal, then you don't have such a strong need to adopt the comments from that peer review. However, it can be good to consider the comments and adopt the comments that seem valid, major, and/or easy. This can stop you from tripping up over the same problems with the next journal.</p><h2><i>Proofs (after acceptance)</i></h2><p>After your paper is accepted, the journal will typically send you proofs - this is the formatted paper, in line with the journal's style. You'll get a link to an online portal, where you can correct any formatting/visual mistakes and respond to any questions from the typesetter and production staff.</p><h2><i>When to quit</i></h2><p>If you come to see your paper as genuinely flawed, faulty, or non-rigorous, then it is ok to quit and not worry about publishing it. Try not to confuse this with&nbsp;<i>thinking</i> that your paper is flawed because a peer reviewer said so.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/i4vihmhtki7pbKLxq/p3ucyul8mbk1bpwispaz\"></p><h1><br><strong>Emotional challenges</strong></h1><h2><i>Rejection resilience</i></h2><p>Rejection is ubiquitous. Every academic on the planet routinely experiences rejection (9). It really sucks to have your work rejected. Whenever I check my emails and see that a journal has sent me a rejection letter, it stings. My cheeks burn and my stomach drops. I've learned to accept this feeling more quickly as I've developed as a researcher, and I'm less averse to rejection since I've developed lots of experience.</p><p>My view is that to publish papers, the most important skill to cultivate is \"rejection resilience\" (4). If you persist, and your work is at least half-decent (i.e. it is rigorous, it engages with the existing literature, and it is not downright fraudulent), then the chance that your work will eventually get published is high.</p><p>A satirical, but validating, perspective on rejection is provided by Han et al (10), who describe \"ManuScript Rejection sYndrome (MiSeRY)\": \"Manuscripts associated with high pre-submission expectations and sent for external review were associated with increased MiSeRY when rejected. This was especially true for first authors, who are not only more personally invested in the reported research but must also bear the burden of re-formatting the manuscript for the next submission. Further, we hypothesise that senior authors, who have undoubtedly encountered MiSeRY during their formative research years, may have developed enhanced Coping and reLaxing Mechanisms (CaLM) that guard against a potential state of permanent MiSeRY.\"</p><p>I think Han et al demonstrate a great mindset for publishing. As they write: \"We acknowledge the various medical journals that have rejected our manuscripts and provided inspiration for this study. To quote a contemporary poet: 'thank u, next'.\"</p><p>One particular complication that I've experienced due to rejection is email anxiety. As Gill (11) writes, \"'Addiction' metaphors suffuse academics\u2019 talk of their relationship to e-mail, even as they report such high levels of anxiety that they feel they have to check e-mail first thing in the morning and last thing at night, and in which time away (on sick leave, on holiday) generates fears of what might be lurking in the inbox when they return.\" In my own case, this has been exacerbated by previous experiences and psychological challenges (including trauma and abuse during my childhood and adolescence). Developing emotional intelligence, self-understanding, and mindfulness, as well as understanding what my core values are, have been really useful in learning to manage this anxiety (probably good life advice in general, if somewhat inane!).</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/i4vihmhtki7pbKLxq/lhg0fntohwjzhxodvgns\"></figure><h2><i>Reviewer comments can be nasty</i></h2><p>It's no secret that peer reviewers can sometimes be really mean (12). While many peer reviewers are helpful and encouraging, others can be downright nasty (often partially because they have experienced hurtful criticism or other injuries from academia themselves).</p><p>Gill (11) reports receiving this reviewer comment: \"This paper will be of no interest to readers of x (journal name). Discourse analysis is little more than journalism and I fail to see what contribution it can make to un- derstanding the political process. It is self evident to everyone except this author that politics is about much more than 'discourse'. What\u2019s more, in choosing to look at the speeches of Margaret Thatcher, the author shows his or her complete parochialism. If you are going to do this kind of so-called 'analysis' at least look at the discourse of George Bush.\"&nbsp;</p><p>Gill also tells us how she responded: \"I laughed (bitterly) at the accusation of parochialism from this particular North American journal, and even more at the suggestion that this would be put right by focusing on the US (!). But that was small comfort because mostly I felt belittled, hurt and upset at this dismissive rejection of work that I had thought about, developed and crafted over months of careful scholarship. Maybe I wasn\u2019t 'good enough' for academia. I had felt optimistic and proud to have written my first 'proper' academic paper. Eight months later when the rejection letter came, disheartened, I could not bear to look at it again. It remained unpublished and some years passed before I submitted another paper to a journal.\"</p><h2><i>Burnout and discrimination</i></h2><p>Burnout is common among academics. The publication system has contributed to this (9).</p><p>Since reviewers are human, comments can even be straight-up sexist, racist, transphobic, ableist, and/or offensive in other ways (13,14). There's a discussion of this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://polarjournal.org/2022/06/13/how-to-complain-against-unfair-peer-review/\"><u>here</u></a>. Depending on context, some journals and universities have complaints policies (though I'd be skeptical about their value).</p><h1><strong>Tips</strong></h1><ul><li>Use a reference manager. These are programs that store all of your papers (both the citation information, e.g. author, date, title, etc, + you can attach the full-text PDF). This will save you many, many headaches (you'll find yourself storing hundreds or maybe even thousands of papers if you get into research over the next few years). My #1 recommendation would be Zotero (free), and #2 would be Mendeley (also free). Paperpile is also really good. Endnote is popular, but I think it has a difficult workflow. Spend a bit of time (perhaps an hour) learning how to import references - it'll be time well-spent. Also, get the browser plugin for whichever reference manager you choose. Then when you find a paper you like, it's one click to import it to your library (plus sometimes a bit of extra work for importing PDFs, but this is reduced if you use Zotero, Mendeley, or Paperpile). Also, get the word processor plugin for whichever one you choose. Probably working in Google Docs would be easiest if we're collaborating. I think Zotero has a Google Docs plugin. This automatically formats your reference list, can one-click change the formatting of your references, etc. Absolute miracle.</li><li>Make sure you're engaging with the literature that is relevant to your study. You definitely need to cite the seminal, key publications in your field (e.g. review articles, important books, seminal papers). You also need to cite any other papers that are relevant to your topic, research question, your study site, or your methodology. It's common for a research article to have between 30 and 60 citations.</li><li>Do not publish your paper anywhere online (including the EA Forum) if you plan to submit it to a journal. The exception is preprints (next point).</li><li>Consider publishing your work as a preprint. There are many places online where you can \"publish\" your draft manuscript at the same time as submitting it to a journal. This lets you share your work with others (by linking to the preprint) without waiting for the peer review process. Do pay close attention to the preprint policy of your target journal - most journals have no problem with you posting your work as a preprint first, but some journals differ. Good preprint servers include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://biorxiv.org/\"><u>https://biorxiv.org/</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/\"><u>https://arxiv.org/</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/\"><u>those hosted by Open Science Framework</u></a>. Most disciplines have specific preprint servers.</li><li>Consider academic conferences, or don't. Academic conferences are one way to \"publish\" your work. Some conferences actually publish your full paper in a large document that contains all of the papers presented at that conference. Other conferences simply invite people to present work they're planning to publish elsewhere. Conferences are very important in some fields (e.g. computer science). Conferences are also good if you want to network with academics in a particular field. Apart from that, I've found them to be a waste of time (talking about academic conferences here,&nbsp;<i>not</i> EAG). If you're presenting your work specifically as a poster, then I strongly encourage you to watch&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYk29tnxASs\"><u>the Better Poster videos</u></a> and ignore all other advice you receive on creating your poster.</li><li>I've heard people claim that an editor might be more willing to consider your paper if you or a coauthor are from a university, or if you or a coauthor have an academic title (e.g. PhD, Professor). This isn't strictly necessary, but I suspect it can help.</li><li>Stay away from ChatGPT. Most journals explicitly forbid the use of large language models when writing your paper, and sometimes in other aspects of the research too.</li></ul><h1><strong>Suggested reading</strong></h1><p><i>The Lean PhD&nbsp;</i>by Julian Kirchherr</p><ul><li>This is targeted at PhD students, but much of it is highly relevant to publishing.</li><li>Chapters 1 and 3 have most of the value. Much of this strongly aligns with my own views, such as: \"You do not want the paper to be perfect; you want it to be a minimum viable paper, since reviewers will always provide plentiful comments on any paper, no matter how excellent it already is.\" ... \"Peer review can almost be as random as a coin toss.\"</li><li>A lot of what the author describes is how to \"play the game\" (as I have also done in this article!) - which is perfectly valid, but of course there is also the responsibility to produce research that is not only publishable but actually high-quality and potentially impactful. I think the author does explicitly say that too.</li><li>I don't agree with everything the author says or does. It seems like some of the strategies they recommend could lead to taking advantage of people, though this is more relevant for people in positions of power who already know how to publish.</li><li>Concretely, I disagree with the author's approach to responding to peer review comments. They say \"I really develop in-depth responses to every single comment raised by my reviewers in my revision process.\" This strikes me as unnecessary - the author mentions having once written a 26-page response letter to reviewers, which is something I would never do. My approach still incorporates all reviewer comments, of course, but I prefer much more succinct response letters (see above). Even if you make extensive changes to your manuscript, the response to the reviewer can just summarise these changes and give the page/line numbers. This is a good reminder that every academic, including me, will have their own individual approach.</li></ul><p>Books on academic writing style</p><ul><li><i>Writing Scientific Research Articles: Strategy and Steps</i> by Margaret Cargill and Patrick O'Connor (if you're new to academic writing, start with this book)</li><li><i>Air &amp; Light &amp; Time &amp; Space: How Successful Academics Write by Helen Sword (once you have a bit of experience writing)</i></li><li><i>The Sense of Style</i> by Steven Pinker (once you have a bit of experience writing)</li></ul><h1><strong>References</strong></h1><p>1.

It was a significant long shot, but the best I had.</p><p>Then came EA.</p><p>In 2021 I started working operations for the <a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/\">Happier Lives Institute</a>, which was my first real baptism into EA. I told HLI from the start that my priority was going to be Vida Plena, and they still hired me- even giving me significant amounts of flexibility. This would never happen in the highly competitive traditional nonprofit world. But as Micheal Plant generously told me then: EA is about seeking the greatest impact, so if that is Vida Plena, they would be there for me for it. Since then, the HLI team has continued to support me with research help, feedback, and much love (although to be clear, not money).&nbsp; Thank you especially to Samuel Dupret for countless hours on <a href=\"https://vidaplena.global/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Predictive-CEA-2022-_compressed.pdf\">our predictive CEA</a> and Barry Grimes for giving all the comms support. Peter, I so appreciate all our long walks and chats.</p><p>Then the broader EA community stepped up and supported this project financially. When Vida Plena was still just an idea in my head, two exceptional individuals I met at EAG London 2021 stepped up and promised me the funding needed to run our pilot. This was the encouragement I needed to go from <i>\u201cI really think I want to do this\u201d</i> to <i>\u201cWell, now I have to do it.\u201d&nbsp;</i> It\u2019s a very scary step to launch something new, but knowing that they believed in me enough to put their own money behind the idea was overwhelming. To these individuals, you know who you are\u2014I can't express my gratitude enough. The fact that you trusted an almost stranger still deeply moves me.</p><p>And with that, I need to say thank you to everyone who put in so much work to organize EAG, and all the people who financed it to bring so many people together.&nbsp; I would have never met these angel donors if it wasn\u2019t for the CEA team and volunteers.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I need to thank Joey Savoie and the whole <a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/\">Charity Entrepreneurship</a> team. Although they rejected my application the first year (encouragement to keep trying for anyone else who\u2019s not made it), the next year they took a risk to include me and my co-founder, Anita Kaslin, in the Incubator Program with our outside-the-box idea. And you haven\u2019t stopped supporting us since. A special thanks to Patrick, Steve, Ula, and especially my dear friend, Judith. A huge thank you to the CE Seed Funding network, who gave us the boost to really get off the ground running.&nbsp;</p><p>I love the CE community. I really do. Nowhere else have I found such a determined, giving group of doers. &nbsp;People who make shit happen out in the world. And who are so exceptionally generous. With their time, their connections, sharing ideas and resources. I\u2019m in a random corner of the world just doing my thing in Quito, but the group calls and messages help me feel connected to something bigger. &nbsp;Especially appreciate everyone in my CE cohort, especially the other exceptional women, Sarah (<a href=\"https://give.cornerstone.cc/maternalhealthinitiative\">Maternal Health Initiative</a>) and Rachel (<a href=\"https://www.kayaguides.com/\">Kaya Guides</a>). You guys are rocking in, and I\u2019m so inspired by you both.</p><p>There are so many other people in the wider CE family that need to be thanked too:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Sophie Gulliver and Erik Hausen for the M&amp;E support</li><li>Melanie Basnek at Rethink Priorities for doing the analysis of <a href=\"https://vidaplena.global/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vida-Plena-Pilot-2022-Report-English_compressed-1.pdf\">our pilot results</a></li><li>Thank you, Jack Rafferty for all the hours of encouragement. &nbsp;</li><li>Simon Newstead and his exceptional coaching through <a href=\"https://www.goalswon.com/\">GoalsWon</a>. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re real and not an AI bot like my friends were trying to convince me. You literally send me encouragement every day. Even my mom doesn\u2019t do that.</li></ul><p>Extra special thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.mentalhealthfunders.com/\">Mental Health Funding Circle</a> (started by Joey and CE) for supporting mental health initiatives like ours. This exceptional group of funders stepped up to support us last year and again this coming year. Cannot thank you enough.</p><p>And everyone from the wider EA world:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.danmindus.com/\">Dan Mindus</a> for being behind us for over a year of mentoring, coaching, and constant cheerleading.

IPA brings together researchers and decision-makers to design, rigorously evaluate, and refine these solutions and their applications, ensuring that the evidence created is used to improve the lives of the world\u2019s poor. In recent decades, trillions of dollars have been spent on programs designed to reduce global poverty, but clear evidence of which programs succeed is rare, and when evidence does exist, decision-makers often do not know about it. IPA exists to bring together leading researchers and these decision-makers to ensure that the evidence we create leads to a tangible impact on the world. Since its founding in 2002, IPA has worked with over 600 leading academics to conduct over 830 evaluations in 52 countries. This research has informed hundreds of successful programs that now impact millions of individuals worldwide.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IPA's Commitment to Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion (DEI)&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>As an organization, IPA is dedicated to improving the lives of the world's most vulnerable populations through evidence and policy.

What if you spent half as much time in the news? Would you really be noticeably less informed? No. But would you be less unhappy? At least in the time diary sense, where you are counting the experiences of the day, then I don\u2019t see how you could fail to be more happy as a result of cutting down 50%, with really virtually no change in the level of knowledge that you have, even about the events themselves.</i></p><p>- Bryan Caplan</p></blockquote><p>Is following important political and international news a civic duty \u2014 or is it our civic duty to avoid it?</p><p>It\u2019s common to think that \u2018staying informed\u2019 and checking the headlines every day is just what responsible adults do.</p><p>But in today\u2019s episode, host Rob Wiblin is joined by economist Bryan Caplan to discuss the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Reading-News-Manifesto-Happier/dp/1529342724/\"><i>Stop Reading the News: A Manifesto for a Happier, Calmer and Wiser Life</i></a> \u2014 which argues that reading the news both makes us miserable and distorts our understanding of the world. Far from informing us and enabling us to improve the world, consuming the news distracts us, confuses us, and leaves us feeling powerless.</p><p>In the first half of the episode, Bryan and Rob discuss various alleged problems with the news, including:</p><ul><li>That it overwhelmingly provides us with information we can\u2019t usefully act on.</li><li>That it\u2019s very non-representative in what it covers, in particular favouring the negative over the positive and the new over the significant.</li><li>That it obscures the big picture, falling into the trap of thinking \u2018something important happens every day.\u2019</li><li>That it\u2019s highly addictive, for many people chewing up 10% or more of their waking hours.</li><li>That regularly checking the news leaves us in a state of constant distraction and less able to engage in deep thought.</li><li>And plenty more.</li></ul><p>Bryan and Rob conclude that if you want to understand the world, you\u2019re better off blocking news websites and spending your time on Wikipedia, Our World in Data, or reading a textbook. And if you want to generate political change, stop reading about problems you already know exist and instead write your political representative a physical letter \u2014 or better yet, go meet them in person.</p><p>In the second half of the episode, Bryan and Rob cover:</p><ul><li>Why Bryan is pretty sceptical that AI is going to lead to extreme, rapid changes, or that there\u2019s a meaningful chance of it going terribly.</li><li>Bryan\u2019s case that rational irrationality on the part of voters leads to many very harmful policy decisions.</li><li>How to allocate resources in space.</li><li>Bryan\u2019s experience homeschooling his kids.</li></ul><p><i>Producer and editor: Keiran Harris</i><br><i>Audio Engineering Lead: Ben Cordell</i><br><i>Technical editing: Simon Monsour and Milo McGuire</i><br><i>Transcriptions: Katy Moore</i></p><h2>Highlights</h2><h3><strong>Rob's experience with quitting the news</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> After hearing the arguments Rolf makes in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Stop-Reading-News-Manifesto-Happier/dp/1529342724/\"><i>Stop Reading the News: A Manifesto for a Happier, Calmer and Wiser Life</i></a>, my wife and I decided to stop reading the news basically cold turkey Christmas last year, because we thought it was making us sad and anxious without actually doing that much to help us make the world a better place, or even understand the world. I\u2019m kind of naturally a news junkie, and before that I was spending maybe one to three hours reading the news, on average, a day \u2014 and that\u2019s probably about what I\u2019ve been doing for most of my adult life.</p><p>Since then we\u2019ve mostly stuck to it, and I\u2019d say my news consumption is down about 90%. Some stuff still gets through in the comedy we watch. I listen to a Spanish language learning programme which has news in it sometimes. People bring it up in conversation in person, which is fine I guess. Sometimes preparing for the show, I check out specific news things that I\u2019m actively looking for for more technical stuff, and I don\u2019t try to avoid that. But basically, I haven\u2019t checked the homepage at the <i>Financial Times</i> or <i>The New York Times</i> or <i>The Atlantic</i> or <i>The New Yorker</i> or the BBC, or the newsfeed on Twitter or Reddit or anything like that, for about 10 months. It\u2019s all been blocked.</p><p>And I really do think I\u2019m happier and more productive than I used to be. Certainly I\u2019m not as anxious, and my moods are not as volatile as they were before.</p><p>I was spending 10% of my waking life reading the news. That is a lot of time. It\u2019s not enough to say that there is <i>some</i> benefit to that; you really want to say that this is providing 10% of the value in your life. It has to be actually providing a significant amount of goodness. And it just is so unclear that it\u2019s doing that. It\u2019s unclear whether it\u2019s positive or negative, let alone providing 10% of my wellbeing.</p><p>Now I think that as a result of reading less news, I do read more books and I do listen to more lecture series. This company <a href=\"https://www.thegreatcourses.com/\">The Great Courses</a> produces fantastic lecture series, and I\u2019ve just been churning through them this year. But I would say about half of the time that we\u2019ve freed up, I just play computer games with my wife. But I honestly think that is a much better use of time, because, firstly, it\u2019s just fun. I come away from playing computer games with my wife feeling refreshed. I\u2019m excited and happy. I\u2019ve had a good time rather than feeling actively worse, rather than feeling drained because I was reading about something horrible, and it\u2019s good for our relationship and it\u2019s just inherently enjoyable during the time. So I\u2019d say even playing computer games is maybe a more respectable [use of time].</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Two angles on why you shouldn't read the news</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Bryan Caplan:</strong> One is: What is the actual effect of following the news on the life of the individual that\u2019s doing it? And I think it\u2019s hard to imagine that it\u2019s not just what you\u2019re saying. Just imagine doing a time diary approach, where you are talking about what you\u2019re doing and what your mood is at every minute of the day. Obviously, when people are watching the news, normally stuff on the news is quite horrifying, and they\u2019re getting upset and agitated. If you just think about people that are angry about things every day, normally they don\u2019t have enough stuff going on in their personal lives to actually get that angry \u2014 so what they are angry about is stuff that they are hearing about on the news. So that one I would just say is the main selfish case.</p><p>And then to say, \u201cBut what if I fail to learn something that\u2019s really important for me personally?\u201d Well, what are the odds of that? That hardly ever happens. And especially if it were going to be that important, you would hear about it almost certainly in a number of other ways and therefore it wouldn\u2019t matter. I remember actually my family was driving down from DC to Florida on the very day that the George Floyd riots were hitting the country. So I had heard something about it from Facebook. But if we were just totally not following the news, since I was going to be visiting some friends, I would have gotten emails from them \u2014 I <i>did</i> get emails from them \u2014 saying, \u201cDon\u2019t come to Charleston, South Carolina; it\u2019s a war zone here.\u201d And therefore it would have been fine.</p><p>So it really just very rarely happens that not following the news would actually wind up having any harm to you personally because you were uninformed, and there are the psychological gains from not having the negativity \u2014 because as we know, news veers very negative.</p><p>Now, in terms of \u201cHow can you become an informed and enlightened person?\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s the other perspective. And this is one where my first reaction is: read it in history books. If it\u2019s that important, it\u2019ll be in history books. Read that. When I do want to get up to date with something that\u2019s been going on, I find it\u2019s very helpful just to read Wikipedia. It\u2019s a lot less emotionally affecting because they\u2019re aggregating a whole lot of information. It\u2019s not this sense of, \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen next? What\u2019s going to happen next? Oh no. Oh good. Oh no.\u201d</p><p>So in that way, you wind up getting not only less of an emotional rollercoaster, but you also get a better picture of what\u2019s really going on when you read the Wikipedia article on an event \u2014 because there\u2019s filtration, there\u2019s curation, stuff that turns out to be not actually true and important generally doesn\u2019t appear on the Wikipedia article. And in that way, you can still be highly informed.</p><p>For example, with all due modesty, I\u2019ll say I think I\u2019m at 99.9% on Israel and Palestine. For Americans anyway. You can say, \u201cWell, for an American\u2026\u201d But still, I think that\u2019s way beyond what most people who follow the news are. That\u2019s because I\u2019ve just read a number of books on it, as well as some really good graphic novels \u2014 honestly, some great graphic novels on this topic. But in terms of knowing what\u2019s going on, I think I\u2019m really quite good, but without that sense of dread and horror and outrage that people who are watching the news minute to minute actually experience.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Isn't it important for good citizens to follow what's going on?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Bryan Caplan:</strong> First of all, of course, there\u2019s the general effective altruism point that unless you think that this is the most important problem in the universe, you should be directing all of your altruistic energy towards the number one cause. So this is probably not the number one most important cause in the universe. So take that time you\u2019re spending reading on the news, and put it into whatever is the number one most important problem \u2014 whether it\u2019s deworming or bed nets or whatever you have.</p><p>But another key point is: Like I said, you could believe that and still recognise that you could cut down by 90% without any loss in your ability to perform that function. And I would say you could go and cut down way more and just go and read the Wikipedia article instead; I think the political bias in Wikipedia is quite a bit lower, and the \u201cgetting the big picture\u201d is a lot better. So I would just say you could do that instead and then you are performing this duty in a much more effective way. This is where you can tell the people that only read the daily stories, \u201cActually, there was a story that got a lot of coverage that turned out to be wrong. And therefore, rather than helping us to go and hold the government to account, it is scapegoating people for something that didn\u2019t even really happen in the way that people imagine. And so it\u2019s not in fact a big deal.\u201d</p><p>Other things to think about are certainly if you\u2019re just using it for voting: What are the odds that the news stories will be sufficiently severe that it would even change your vote? So there\u2019s that.</p><p>And then in terms of the story of \u201cEven if the people that I like are in power, I still want to be able to be monitoring them and making sure they\u2019re doing good things\u201d: Again, on the one hand, there\u2019s something to the argument, but what about the point of there\u2019s a base rate of honest, standard human error, below which you ought to actually be worrying that they\u2019re just not trying hard enough? There\u2019s the old joke in economics about how if you\u2019ve never missed a plane, you spend too much time hanging around in airports. Similarly, if you were to say \u201cI\u2019m going to get really angry over every mistake the politicians make,\u201d well, isn\u2019t there just some base rate of mistakes that they will make if they\u2019re doing a good job? And if you only punish the kinds of mistakes that are covered in the media, aren\u2019t you going and actually giving them incentive to basically make the mistakes that come from avoiding risk?</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> From avoiding acting and just being as conservative as possible, to not be associated with any actions, even if they had positive expected value \u2014 because then you\u2019ll be blamed if they go badly.</p><p><strong>Bryan Caplan:</strong> Right. Or especially when you realise that some actions are not counted as actions by the media. So failing to repeal doesn\u2019t count as an action. This is a general problem with any kind of deregulation or repeal: If, after it happens, any bad thing occurs that would have been prevented, or at least even imagined to be prevented, by keeping the regulation on the books, this is seen as the hard proof that the regulation should never have been repealed \u2014 even though cost-benefit analysis might say it\u2019s better to go and cut the price of housing by 20% and have three more buildings collapse from earthquakes per year.</p><p>Another nice illustration of this is whenever there is a disaster, the normal reaction is, \u201cSomething has to be done to stop this from ever happening again.\u201d Again, the question is: Maybe we should just stay the course, because this is the right number of disasters to have? Which horrifies people. But look, we shouldn\u2019t have earthquake codes so strict that no building ever collapses, no matter what, because the effect on housing costs would be astronomical. So why don\u2019t you tell me what is the correct number of houses to collapse in earthquakes? And then we\u2019re only going to cover it in the media if we exceed that number. You just imagine people\u2019s heads exploding, like, \u201cNo, we have to cover every single one so that we can have the proper reaction!\u201d This proper reaction is what makes housing costs too high.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>But what if I mostly read good news? And what if I miss the frenetic energy?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Maybe the first rebuttal that I could imagine someone saying is, \u201cI mostly read good news \u2014 like a weekly summary of the world events in <i>The Economist</i>, or long essays in <i>The New Yorker</i>, or long big-idea pieces in the <i>Financial Times</i> \u2014 and I\u2019m not that interested in random grabbing, shocking headlines. Is that really so wrong? Maybe this is a net benefit.\u201d</p><p><strong>Bryan Caplan:</strong> That doesn\u2019t sound crazy. I would just say that if someone were to say, \u201cYou\u2019re basically right, but I can cut down 90%; I can still be almost as well informed while reducing the harm,\u201d I think that\u2019s a really obvious position, and I think that one\u2019s almost impossible to argue against. What if you spent half as much time in the news? Would you really be noticeably less informed? No. But would you be less unhappy? At least in the time diary sense, where you are counting the experiences of the day, then I don\u2019t see how you could fail to be more happy as a result of cutting down 50%, with really virtually no change in the level of knowledge that you have, even about the events themselves.</p><hr><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> [Another] stream of defence that I hear is to say that, and maybe this is the one that I\u2019m most sympathetic to: The one thing that I feel maybe I\u2019ve lost from not reading the news is this kind of frenetic energy that you get from engaging with live events. On the one hand, it\u2019s kind of anxiety and it\u2019s kind of feeling bad; it\u2019s kind of feeling overwhelmed by events. But there\u2019s also this kind of enthusiasm, energy, uncertainty. It\u2019s like watching a sports match in real time. And you\u2019re like, this is kind of bad because I\u2019m worried that things will go badly. But also I\u2019m so engaged, and this is really activating me. I think on balance I don\u2019t really want to have more of that in my life. I value the calm. But I do slightly miss that at times. I guess there were times when that was fun.</p><p><strong>Bryan Caplan:</strong> I think that\u2019s the secret to the business model. It can\u2019t be that people are made happy by it. So it\u2019s got to be that you\u2019re tapping into some other emotion that is at least partly positive. It\u2019s anxiety, but yeah, it\u2019s the frenetic anxiety. It\u2019s being part of something, it\u2019s flow. So yeah, definitely there\u2019s a lot of flow from news, but with moderate effort, I think you can find some much better substitutes for it.</p><p>Really, a much better substitute for the news is just friendship, just having people that you would like spending time with. This is the main secret of human happiness. People are primarily happy when they\u2019re spending time with people whose company they enjoy. You might compare the news to spending time with your cousin that you hate, but you\u2019ve known each other and you sit there pushing each other\u2019s buttons. Wouldn\u2019t you rather be with a relative that you have positive flow with than this negative flow? It\u2019s like, yeah, well, it\u2019s too hard to find that. But if you don\u2019t recognise what you\u2019re really looking for, you\u2019re really not likely to find it.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Terrorism and the news</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> So here\u2019s a controversial point that Rolf makes in the book, to begin to close out this section: that reading the news and journalism and the media in general are the direct cause of terrorism. The notion there being that terrorists commit terrorism in large part to get massive media coverage. So when the media provides massive media coverage to terrorist attacks and we choose to read about it, that motivates further terrorism. What do you think of that argument?</p><p><strong>Bryan Caplan:</strong> I think it\u2019s got to be at least 70% true. If you were to just get rid of news entirely, there\u2019d still be some terrorism. They\u2019re hoping to spread it through word of mouth or whatever. But yeah, obviously they\u2019re highly motivated by these social dynamics. It\u2019s hard to see how you can doubt it. If you were to just go back historically, were there things that we would classify today as terrorism before there was any mass media?</p><p>There\u2019s a few things that you might go and count, but really it\u2019s anachronistic, because in the past there\u2019s a pogrom and they aren\u2019t doing it for the purposes of getting a reaction; they\u2019re doing it just to kill a bunch of people that they\u2019re mad about in that area. You might say pogroms have a motivation of, \u201cWe go and massacre a couple of towns, and this will lead to mass flight from the country, from all the other people that are worried about it.\u201d And that\u2019s terrorists in a sense.</p><p>But this is actually one of several examples of things where if you know the broad span of human history, mass media seems to just change the way that bad things happen. Closely related to terrorism is if you look at the way that the motivations and the dynamics in the way that wars played out in the past. Normally, the ways that wars used to work is there\u2019d be two countries, one would attack another, one side would be decisively defeated, and then there\u2019d be a peace treaty where they would go and \u201cpermanently\u201d hand over some land to the other side. That\u2019s the way that it worked. And in those days, you could very plausibly see they\u2019re fighting because this side wants the city of Cologne with its salt mines or whatever.</p><p>Now, if you look at the modern world, there are a lot of wars where really the whole point of it is just to antagonise people. There\u2019s no actual goal, there\u2019s no resource anyone wants, there\u2019s no plausible risk. And furthermore, there\u2019s no actual resolution. The normal result of a war in the modern period is what was called a frozen conflict zone \u2014 no peace, no war; we have a ceasefire, and that\u2019s the end of it \u2014 until, of course, war fighting breaks out again.</p><p>So if you just look at, prior to Ukraine, all Russian military interventions, they basically go and there\u2019s some incident and they grab a little piece of territory and they basically just give the middle finger to the rest of the world. And then there\u2019s a ceasefire, and that\u2019s it. It\u2019s just not the kind of war that used to be fought. There\u2019s very little strategic, military, economic point to the territory that\u2019s seized. It\u2019s more of just showboating for the media, and saying, \u201cThere were some ethnic Russians there. You can\u2019t push us around. Ha!\u201d</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> An important question here, if we\u2019re trying to just take this from a very pragmatic point of view, is: If the media just had a blanket ban on reporting of terrorism in the long run, how much would we expect terrorism to decline? I guess you were saying something like 70%. That seems kind of reasonable to me.</p><p><strong>Bryan Caplan:</strong> Yeah. Presumably you wouldn\u2019t be able to go and ban people from emailing things. There\u2019d be viral emails. I believe there\u2019d be a lot of substitution, like, \u201cThe terrorism the media doesn\u2019t want you to know about!\u201d So there\u2019d be kooks with internet lists and you\u2019d have to have a real police state to go and totally crack down on it.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Bryan's overall take on AI risk</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Bryan Caplan:</strong> So the number of times I\u2019ve been told by people, \u201cOh my god, the AI is so fantastically good,\u201d and then I look at it and it doesn\u2019t seem to work at all; what are you talking about? Or people go and say, \u201cIt\u2019s gotten so good at chess.\u201d Yeah, well, that\u2019s just what I would expect that it would be good at. And who cares? Chess isn\u2019t important. It\u2019s like, \u201cNow it can do Go.\u201d Yeah, Go is an even dumber game than chess. And I have actually told friends that when it\u2019s good at Dungeons and Dragons, let me know. That\u2019s a <i>real</i> game. That\u2019s a game that I actually care about, that really is essential to being a human being.</p><p>So that was my view for a long time, because people just made claims that seemed unlikely to be true, and I checked them out and they were false. And then when GPT-3 came along, once again, people started saying, \u201cThis is fantastic.\u201d And I said, let\u2019s see what happens if I give my labour economics midterm to GPT-3. And <a href=\"https://betonit.substack.com/p/chatgpt-takes-my-midterm-and-gets\">it got a D</a>. Then the reaction from some fans is, \u201cTo get a D on that exam is an incredible achievement!\u201d I\u2019m like, do you realise how low my standards are? No. A D is not an incredible achievement. It\u2019s basically what you get for just mentioning some key terms and rambling on a bit about the question. So that was where I said this is basically vaporware #173.</p><p>But then GPT-4 came out, and I gave it the same exams and it did great. It got As. And I\u2019m like, all right. And this is in the course of three months: over the course of three months, it goes from a D to an A. I remember when I was arguing with my friends, I was even saying, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying the next version is going to do a lot better on the test?\u201d Tyler Cowen just said, \u201cYour tests don\u2019t count for anything anyway. Who cares about your stupid tests?\u201d I care about my stupid test. To my mind, these tests show whether people are really thinking about the subject, whether they understand it on a deep level, where they can take what I have taught them and apply it in ways that are not just rote memorisation. And of course, since I\u2019ve been giving these tests for 25 years, I feel like I\u2019ve got a really good sense of what level of thought and depth goes behind certain levels of answers versus others. And of course, and I just feel like I understand this metric much better than I understand most other metrics.</p><p>Furthermore, I consider it to be a lot more impressive than being able to do well on an SAT. They\u2019ve got hundreds of SATs that they can train off of; it\u2019s not that surprising that you can get a machine to go and do well on a test that it has all this training data on. But on the other hand, my tests are either not on the training data, or at least there\u2019s just not that much of it. So if a machine can do well on it, then that would really say something. It\u2019s saying that it\u2019s actually got some kind of general performance capability.</p><p>Anyway, so I went and gave it a test three months later with GPT-4, and it got an A. And I will say my jaw did drop. <a href=\"https://betonit.substack.com/p/ai-bet\">I had a bet on it</a>. The bet doesn\u2019t mature until 2030, and it\u2019s a higher bar than just getting an A once, so I still feel like maybe I\u2019ll win just by virtue of bad luck for the AI. But I will say that in terms of the substance, the guy that bet me, I think that it shows that he in particular was right.</p><p>So that\u2019s where it really changed my mind about the ability to go and perform well on tasks of this kind, which do mean a lot to me. I mean, I do actually consider the ability to go and learn material to the degree where you can get an A on one of my tests, that is something where\u2026 I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s what separates humans from the animals, but at some level it\u2019s what separates someone that I want to have lunch with from someone that I don\u2019t want to have lunch with: whether they are capable of learning this material to the degree where they can get an A one of my tests. It\u2019s not like I don\u2019t want to talk to you if you haven\u2019t taken the class with me, but if you couldn\u2019t, after taking the class, go and do well in the test, then it\u2019s just there\u2019s something about you that isn\u2019t engaging to me anyway.</p><p>So I did change my mind about the performance there. But where this all comes back to me is base rates. Now, Scott Alexander has this phrase of \u201cbase rate ping pong,\u201d where he says anytime someone makes a base rates argument, you can always make a different base rate argument, and then base rates really aren\u2019t meaningful. So I say \u201cbase rate\u201d for people saying something is going to be the end of humanity, and then how often have they been right? They\u2019ve never been right. But I could have the base rate of a new weaponisable technology gets released, and then we do the average of how many people it would kill and then that winds up being high. So it is true that you can go and do this. And this really actually is almost directly out of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction\">Hume\u2019s problem of induction</a>. Not quite the same, but still it is very much in the same ballpark of: for any observation, what is the correct generalisation to draw?</p><p>Now, it is hard for almost any rationalist to really stick with this base rate ping pong nihilism \u2014 because it is a nihilistic view. Remember, one of the main lessons out of books like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecasting:_The_Art_and_Science_of_Prediction\"><i>Superforecasting</i></a> is that an essential skill for good forecasting is thinking in terms of base rates. So just to go and say, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t trick me with this base rate trick. Base rates, we can just do ping pong all day and there\u2019s no such thing as a right base rate or even a better or worse base rate\u201d \u2014 if you\u2019re going to say that, then the whole rationalist project crumbles. It is very close to saying we can\u2019t learn anything from experience, per the original Hume\u2019s problem of induction.</p><p>And if you don\u2019t think you can learn anything from experience, there\u2019s no EA project. And of course, there\u2019s no existing, other than Hume saying, \u201cI just kind of pretend that I don\u2019t know this stuff and have a beer with my friends and try to get through the next day.\u201d So I would say if we\u2019re not willing to go and think in terms of base rates, then we can barely converse anymore, if we\u2019re going to say that there\u2019s just no such thing as a more or less reasonable base rate.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Rational irrationality on the part of voters</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Bryan Caplan:</strong> Imagine that you go to the grocery store and you just start throwing objects in at random and buy them. What happens? Well, you waste a pile of your own money on a bunch of stuff you don\u2019t actually want, right? Or imagine, even more strongly, what if you just go in there and you just buy a bunch of stuff that you\u2019re supposed to want? So you just go and put in a whole bunch of rice cakes or whatever stuff is allegedly super healthy, and then you buy it. And what\u2019s happened? Yeah, you just have a bunch of stuff that you don\u2019t even want to eat because it sounds good, but in fact it\u2019s disgusting and you can\u2019t stand it, right?</p><p>And when you make decisions on this basis, you are the one that suffers: it is your money that is wasted. Which doesn\u2019t mean that no one will ever do it. We\u2019ve all made purchases that afterwards we\u2019re like, \u201cMan, that was kind of dumb. Why did I buy that thing?\u201d And yet it is quite abnormal for you to go fill your cart with a bunch of total junk that you don\u2019t even want and then get home and say, \u201cWhy did this happen to me?\u201d</p><p>On the other hand, if you go and vote randomly, or go and vote for a bunch of stuff that just sounds good, even though it doesn\u2019t work very well in practice, what happens to you? And the answer is: the same thing that would have happened to you if you were the most diligent, thoughtful voter in the world and voted on that basis. Because you\u2019re just one person. You\u2019re just one person out of millions or tens of millions or even 100 million voters. So effectively, you have no influence on the outcome, which means that you really can safely go and vote randomly, or you could very safely go and vote for what sounds good rather than what actually works well.</p><p>Now, many people say, well, why would I vote randomly? Yeah, probably it\u2019s going to be more of you\u2019ll vote emotionally. You\u2019ll vote based upon what sounds good; you\u2019ll vote based upon ideology. If you were to say, \u201cI\u2019m going to go and figure out what job to do based on philosophy,\u201d your philosophy is not going to be very helpful for figuring out these questions. But if you go and vote based on a philosophy, that\u2019s actually quite normal for people to go and do it in that way.</p><p>Now we\u2019re in the middle of a new book, where I think that I really am taking the argument from <i>The Myth of Rational Voter</i> and I\u2019m giving it a lot more psychological structure, and I\u2019m really happy with how it\u2019s coming out. And this is where I build very heavily on the idea of social desirability bias. It\u2019s basically very simple. It\u2019s a commonsense idea with a fancy name. It just says: When the truth is ugly, people lie. And when the lies become ubiquitous enough, people often just even forget that they\u2019re lying. They lose consciousness of it because no one\u2019s ever even challenging them. And I say this is really the general theory of democracy: what rules policy is just what sounds good, not what <i>is</i> good. Because virtually everyone really is voting based purely upon the most superficial appearances, and even curiosity about what the real effects of policies are is so low.</p><hr><p>Another one, and this one is great for EAs: Almost every country, I think really every rich country spends considerably more on universal redistribution than on means-tested redistribution. From an EA perspective, this is just insanity. Just imagine what EAs would say about a billionaire who says, \u201cI have $8 billion to give away. Here\u2019s my plan: $1 to each person on Earth.\u201d All right, there are worse things you could do, like you give $8 billion to a terrorist group or something, but it\u2019s about as dumb of a helpful thing as you could do.</p><p>It\u2019s like, <i>target your resources to where they do the most good</i>. And yet every first-world government anyway, they spend a lot more on universal redistribution. The intellectual case is pretty simple; it comes down to: Why take money from everyone to give to everyone? Why not instead focus on the biggest problems, and just say most people just don\u2019t need help and can take care of themselves?</p><p>And then the defences of this, even social scientists are so pathetic. It\u2019s pathetic just in the sense of they hardly even exist. If you just go to Google Scholar and try to find all the defences of the way that first-world governments spend trillions of dollars every year, you\u2019ve got like 20 articles. And that\u2019s it. It\u2019s like 20 articles to justify spending trillions of dollars every year? And what are the defences? Well, there\u2019s the one of the only way to redistribute is to do it universally, because otherwise people vote too selfishly and you have to basically trick them into thinking that they\u2019re benefiting \u2014 even though, of course, on net they are not \u2014 which is an awfully specific theory of human error.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "ZncJiLJyqDBzAz3uJ", "title": "Are U.S. Politicians Intellectually Rigorous Behind the Scenes or Do Public Debates Accurately Reflect Their Understanding?", "postedAt": "2023-11-23T09:14:59.267Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Epistemic Status: Tentative and Seeking Clarification</i></p><p>My current view of politicians, influenced in part by examples like George Bush's academic record, leans towards a perception of general intellectual mediocrity.

Major additions: 2013. Last nontrivial update: 4 Aug 2018.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Human environmental choices have vast implications for wild animals, and one of our largest ecological impacts is climate change. Each human in the industrialized world may create or prevent in a potentially predictable way at least millions of insects and potentially more zooplankton per year by his or her greenhouse-gas emissions. Is this influence net good or net bad? This question is very complicated to answer and takes us from examinations of tropical-climate expansion, sea ice, and plant productivity to desertification, coral reefs, and oceanic-temperature dynamics. On balance, I'm extremely uncertain about the net impact of climate change on wild-animal suffering; my probabilities are basically 50% net good vs. 50% net bad when just considering animal suffering on Earth in the next few centuries (ignoring side effects on humanity's very long-term future). Since other people care a lot about preventing climate change, and since climate change might destabilize prospects for a cooperative future, I currently think it's best to err on the side of reducing our greenhouse-gas emissions where feasible, but my low level of confidence reduces my fervor about the issue in either direction. That said, I am fairly confident that biomass-based carbon offsets, such as rainforest preservation, are net harmful for wild animals.</p><p>See also:</p><ul><li>\"<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/effects-climate-change-terrestrial-net-primary-productivity/\">Effects of Climate Change on Terrestrial Net Primary Productivity</a>\"</li><li>\"<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/scenarios-for-very-long-term-impacts-of-climate-change-on-wild-animal-suffering/\">Scenarios for Very Long-Term Impacts of Climate Change on Wild-Animal Suffering</a>\"</li></ul><h1><a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/effects-climate-change-terrestrial-net-primary-productivity/\">Effects of CO<sub>2</sub> and Climate Change on Terrestrial Net Primary Productivity</a></h1><p>By Brian Tomasik</p><p>First written: 2008-2016.

Last nontrivial update: 2016 Mar 07.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>Climate change will significantly affect wild-animal populations, and hence wild-animal suffering, in the future. However, due to advances in technology, it seems unlikely climate change will have a major impact on wild-animal suffering beyond a few centuries from now. Still, there's a remote chance that human civilization will collapse before undoing climate change or eliminating the biosphere, and in that case, the effects of climate change could linger for thousands to millions of years. I calculate that this consideration might multiply the expected wild-animal impact of climate change by 20 to 21 times, although given model uncertainty and the difficulty of long-term predictions, these estimates should be taken with caution.</p><p>The default parameters in this piece suggest that the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of the average American lead to a long-term change of -3 to 3 expected insect-years of eventual wild-animal suffering <i>every second</i>. My main takeaway from this piece is that \"climate change could be really important even relative to other environmental issues; we should explore further whether it's likely to increase or decrease wild-animal suffering on balance\".</p><p>This piece should not be interpreted to support human technological progress or development of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Although those outcomes would probably mostly eliminate the wild-animal impacts of climate change within centuries, they would also <a href=\"http://foundational-research.org/risks-of-astronomical-future-suffering/\">vastly multiply suffering</a> throughout the cosmos in other ways.</p>", "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}, {"_id": "xcDZccfWkA6a9Atuv", "title": "AMA: GWWC research team", "postedAt": "2023-11-22T16:26:09.464Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We\u2019re the research team at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us\"><u>Giving What We Can</u></a>:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/people/alana-horowitz-friedman\"><u>Alana</u></a> (research communicator)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/people/michael-townsend\"><u>Michael</u></a> (researcher)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/people/sjir-hoeijmakers\"><u>Sjir</u></a> (research director)</li></ul><p>Ask us anything!</p><p>We\u2019ll be answering questions&nbsp;Monday the 27th from 2pm UTC until Tuesday the 28th at 9pm UTC.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 28 November 6.20pm UTC: thank you for all the great questions!

However, we still think ACE\u2019s funds and recommendations are worth considering for impact-focused donors and we will continue to host them on the GWWC donation platform. We\u2019ve also decided to recommend the work of one of ACE\u2019s recommendations \u2014 The Humane League (THL) \u2014 on corporate campaigns for chicken welfare as a top-rated program, and plan to allocate half of the <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-US/charities/effective-animal-advocacy-fund\">GWWC Effective Animal Advocacy Fund</a>\u2019s budget to it until our next review in animal welfare.</p><p>Our key findings informing these decisions are:</p><ul><li>When compared with the AWF, we think ACE\u2019s Movement Grants fund (MG) performs slightly less strongly on several proxies we looked into for the marginal cost-effectiveness of its grants.<ul><li>We therefore think the AWF is currently a slightly better donation option for the impact-focused donor. However, we are open to part of this difference being explained by reasonable disagreements on optimal grantmaking strategy. Moreover, if the AWF had not been available as a better alternative by our criteria, we might have recommended MG upon further consideration. We think MG will become more competitive with the AWF, according to our criteria, if it succeeds in implementing the improvements that ACE has planned and in moving closer to the vision for MG that ACE has shared with us.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>ACE\u2019s charity evaluations process does not currently measure marginal cost-effectiveness to a sufficient extent for us to directly rely on the resulting charity recommendations.&nbsp;<ul><li>We see some reasons to be hopeful this will change in future evaluations, and still think ACE\u2019s recommendations are worth considering for impact-focused donors. We also expect the gain in impact from giving to any ACE-recommended charity over giving to a random animal welfare charity is&nbsp;<i>much</i> larger than any potential further gain from giving to the AWF or THL\u2019s corporate campaigns over any (other) ACE-recommended charity, and note that we haven\u2019t evaluated ACE\u2019s recommended charities individually, but only ACE\u2019s evaluation process.</li></ul></li><li>THL\u2019s corporate campaign work for chicken welfare is plausibly a highly cost-effective donation opportunity.&nbsp;<ul><li>This assessment is not based on a direct investigation by the GWWC research team, but supported by four separate pieces of evidence, one of which is ACE\u2019s recommendation.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><p>We decided not to make an explicit comparison between THL\u2019s corporate campaign work and the AWF in terms of their marginal cost-effectiveness, as we thought we would be unlikely to find a justifiable difference between the two in the limited time we had available.

I also propose ways the EA community can help accelerate some of the African EAs' impact. I do not intend to imply that current African EAs are not impactful or are the only ones needing support to accelerate their impact, nor is it meant to refer to any individual African EAs. This is based on my experience in EA community building in Nigeria and engaging with other EAs in the region. My post is intended to raise awareness in any way that would be useful.</p><p>For emphasis, I\u2019m not implying that the challenges I included capture everything or that the proposed ways are exhaustive.&nbsp;</p><h2>Interests and challenges that I have identified</h2><p>EA seems to pique the interest of young professionals and students in Nigeria when they first learn about it. This interest could very well be shared by individuals in other African contexts, as I have heard similar sentiments from those I engage with from other regions of Africa. Those curious tend to explore EA further by interacting with local groups (where they can), enrolling in an introductory program (usually EA Virtual Programs or the one organized by the local group where applicable), signing up for an event, or utilizing online resources, such as the forum, to delve deeper into the EA.</p><p>Based on my experience in EA community building in Nigeria, I have observed that there is more interest in Effective Altruism from recent graduates/early career professionals, followed by university students and mid-level career professionals. However, I have noticed very little interest from advanced professionals. This pattern may likely be similar in other contexts. The groups that show more interest in EA may do so for any of the following reasons:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Many are still exploring their career options and see EA as a viable approach.&nbsp;</li><li>Some are interested in charitable causes and view EA as a way to align with their goals.&nbsp;</li><li>Others are looking for opportunities and stumbled upon EA.&nbsp;</li><li>Some have found EA to be advocating for the cause area they are already passionate about or interested in.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>I have also identified some of the problems that I think are preventing some of the individuals from making headway:</p><ul><li>Commitment and Disorganization: I experienced situations in which recent graduates looking to use their career to make a more positive difference could not commit to learning more about some of the top problems or even properly engage in career planning to enable them to figure out their abilities and top problem that they could effectively contribute to. I think this commitment issue correlates with disorganization in this context, and this is actually one of the key concerns I repeatedly see in our community in Nigeria. I believe it has a lot of implications for making progress and how impactful one could be. I tried to get a sense of this problem, and in some of the surveys or interactive sessions, time issues were flagged as some of the reasons, as some are actively engaging in other day\u2019s work; other reasons cited are internet access related or visa for in-person training or program abroad.&nbsp;</li><li>Lack of confidence and collaboration: Some of the individuals in the community feel less confident and that it would be hard to make headway tackling big problems at their stage; they think that&nbsp;engaging in such efforts is traditionally reserved for higher career-level individuals. Also, there is the issue of collaboration, and some tend to be thinking about these problems or efforts alone. I realized this issue when I saw members with shared interests but failing to collaborate several times to think about solutions and strategies, get help, or even check with one another for accuracy or to improve accountability. With regard to the confidence issue,&nbsp; fear of rejection plays a role; during our last retreat, a member narrated how such a situation influenced him on some of the considerations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Openness Issue: The speed in updating the view also seems slow among some members. &nbsp; In my experience, this tends to be more common among individuals who may have difficulty allocating enough time to learn about other issues or approaches, as they may be more focused on their own preconceived notions.</li></ul><p>However, I saw comments on collaboration, interest in learning, and openness in recent feedback.&nbsp;</p><h2><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/nfd2qkpgx59qhkgkpex5\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/ijqh0mrc3lyyozyzcwcf 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/frd5zmhgbw1djhtbgnsj 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/i5ljjqvg7ozkhkfvvjam 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/rzx73igffvb17e9ywf2l 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/oim6fea6zirmlg0xruio 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/mrn7pjpfswo71zpsc4cf 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/bjhjbbrwwsacuhximddo 1050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/j4l9kfo0vybmlqjavddk 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/vkkdsldthygoaxj05rzc 1350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/muggoxsrli6pmxqyjymn 1494w\"><br><br>Here are some thoughts on how I think the EA community can continue accelerating the impact of African EAs.</h2><ul><li>EA Community has already made efforts toward building capacity, knowledge, and understanding either by running a skilling program accessible to the African community or funding programs to skill up African communities.&nbsp; Some of these programs offer stipends to participants to cover their time and internet costs. The EA community organizations focused on training and capacity building could further accelerate such efforts through targeted, tailored programs for African communities to increase accessibility and reduce competition. Animal Advocacy Africa (AAA) runs a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/training-advocates\"><u>training program</u></a> to enable African animal advocates and talented individuals to start high-impact projects or work on existing organizations to reduce the industrialization of animal agriculture on the continent by enhancing participants' abilities in communication, decision-making, planning, etc.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/\"><u>AAA</u></a> has already helped some local animal organizations increase access to funding, talents, and organizational abilities through its existing programs.<a href=\"https://ilinaprogram.org/\"><u> ILINA programs</u></a> also run training programs focused on GCR\u2019s causes. &nbsp; Similar programs targeting individual cause areas, such as AI, Biosecurity, Climate change, Poverty, etc., providing training and enhancing capacities could accelerate more African communities' impact on such issues. Although time constraints, limited access, and lack of training impacted the previously mentioned commitment issues.</li></ul><p>Some recent feedback flagging training needs.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/lwl7p7jrgmznf9lulkbm\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/thir9hqmvaueqn0mnpb9 140w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/kcswc2sn3qrg1fsrxqtg 280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/ikdccehzaegv1govzyv0 420w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/ta10z0u5pvbqkyqxmgqh 560w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/m4atlfvaxcupftinorih 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/xjkypvlfny7trk2cbkpv 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/wd6uzfzfxh5cxpp1yugp 980w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/py4hfzyx8podhc8mu5f7 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/opc5wvlj6gtxxrgnmxiz 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ztrjYbGwQZLFRfWDs/c1gdnh1tvy0341zeh5fk 1357w\"></figure><ul><li>Aligned organizations and Initiatives with operations in Africa that have the capacity and what it takes could complement the effort by providing internships, volunteering, or even job opportunities to deserving young professionals and students of the African communities. Even organizations and Initiatives with remote internships and volunteering can accelerate such efforts by improving their inclusion of providing remote internships and volunteering to deserving members. This may build capacities by doing&nbsp;</li><li>Regional conferences. The EA Global team is making efforts to increase the participation of African EAs in the EA conference by offering admission and facilitating travel and visa support. Hosting regional conferences will further improve access and networking opportunities and enable the global community to engage with the regional community. This will also encourage more collaboration and action that is aligned with shared values.</li><li>Grantmaking organizations and scholarship programs can accelerate impact by improving funding decisions for deserving opportunities in African communities.</li></ul><h2>Why I think this matters to the EA Community.&nbsp;</h2><ul><li>One of the ample resources African EAs could utilize to make more difference is their careers. Therefore, it is crucial to support them to deploy these resources effectively. This, in turn, will lead to greater epistemic diversity in the community and may help reduce the tendency to work on regional problems in isolation, ultimately leading to increased ownership and reduced delivery costs.</li><li>If the African EAs are positioned and able to take ownership and contribute to EA-aligned organizations in the regions, they are more likely to uphold EA values and principles. Currently, EA-aligned organizations working in Africa tend to source their talents from the wider African population, which often has different values and motivations. This may lead to misaligned priorities and values in the long run, especially if the core EA team discontinues their work on the project.</li><li>After weeks of learning and involvement, we wouldn't want to see people diverting entirely to other things. Of course, everyone has the right to choose their own path, and an EA career may not be the best fit for everyone despite their initial interest. However, I believe that this should not always be the case. If we have the resources to retain talented individuals looking to contribute, we should do so.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, I hope that this may improve awareness, contribute to the discussions, and enhance the dialogue that is already in existence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Thanks to Kaleem Ahmed for the review and feedback.&nbsp;</i></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "zakariyauu"}}, {"_id": "wXrxBEqGwEmeedEXF", "title": "Sam Altman returning as OpenAI CEO \"in principle\"", "postedAt": "2023-11-22T06:15:16.922Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This was <a href=\"https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1727206187077370115?s=20\">just announced</a> by the OpenAI Twitter account:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wXrxBEqGwEmeedEXF/vql4hft5drdabrdrf7kq\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wXrxBEqGwEmeedEXF/bxcnmvxowjxc2x3dxziq 120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wXrxBEqGwEmeedEXF/bnpmu2gtmjat3t7hqnwl 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wXrxBEqGwEmeedEXF/tj1ot0yro6ytqawfctki 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wXrxBEqGwEmeedEXF/bog9dghgzebx4yfjlicq 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wXrxBEqGwEmeedEXF/tueqqg9ynrnkg8iwytqo 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wXrxBEqGwEmeedEXF/pksluvfcmgffhhpzcmgu 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wXrxBEqGwEmeedEXF/ihbrfjwdwydamyljssfo 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wXrxBEqGwEmeedEXF/sod8bjaoqigsy5bosn3d 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wXrxBEqGwEmeedEXF/dqvccndzrlewrgukopyk 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wXrxBEqGwEmeedEXF/mtkzh3gcwz83da6fzyln 1178w\"></figure><p>Implicitly, the previous board members associated with EA, Helen Toner and Tasha McCauley, are (\"in principle\") no longer going to be part of the board.&nbsp;</p><p>I think it would be useful to have, in the future, a postmortem of what happened, from an EA perspective.

Figures like $5,000 per life saved are rough estimates; while we spend thousands of hours on our cost-effectiveness analyses, they're still inherently uncertain. But the bottom line is that we think donors have the opportunity to do a huge amount of good by supporting the programs we recommend.</p>\n<p>For a concrete sense of what a donation can do, let's focus briefly on <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/seasonal-malaria-chemoprevention\">seasonal malaria chemoprevention</a> (SMC), which involves distributing preventive medication to young children. We've directed funding to <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium\">Malaria Consortium</a> to implement SMC in several countries, including Burkina Faso.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-2\" id=\"fnref-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>In Burkina Faso, community health promoters go from household to household across the country, every month during the rainy season (when malaria is most common). They give medicine to each child under the age of five, which involves mixing a medicated tablet into water and then spoon-feeding the medicine to infants and having young children drink it from a cup. They also give caregivers instructions to give additional preventive medicine over the next two days.</p>\n<p>It costs roughly <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ROI6dRdKsNfXg5gIyBa1_7eYOjowfbw5n65zkrLnvc/edit#gid=791021775&amp;range=B17\">$6</a> to reach a child with a full season's worth of SMC (though this figure doesn't account for <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2018/02/13/revisiting-leverage/\">fungibility</a>, which pushes our estimate of overall cost-effectiveness downward).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-3\" id=\"fnref-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-3\">[3]</a></sup> If a child receives a full course of SMC, we estimate that they're <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ROI6dRdKsNfXg5gIyBa1_7eYOjowfbw5n65zkrLnvc/edit#gid=791021775&amp;range=B27\">about five times</a> less likely to get malaria during the rainy season (which is when roughly <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ROI6dRdKsNfXg5gIyBa1_7eYOjowfbw5n65zkrLnvc/edit#gid=791021775&amp;range=B65\">70%</a> of cases occur).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6xDeDX3iqwwab6qSA/d2l18rzra9ljqmyv3wnn\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>Community distributor providing SMC medication to a child sitting on mother's lap. Photo courtesy of Malaria Consortium.</em></p>\n<p>Imagine a village with 135 families in it, each with two kids under the age of five, for a total of 270 young children. In this village, imagine that every child is reached with a full course of SMC during the rainy season.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-4\" id=\"fnref-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-4\">[4]</a></sup> Without SMC, we estimate that on average, 100<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-5\" id=\"fnref-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-5\">[5]</a></sup> of those 270 young kids would test positive for malaria at any given point in time (though we think most of them would be asymptomatic). We estimate that SMC brings the overall prevalence of malaria down from 100 kids to only 40.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-6\" id=\"fnref-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-6\">[6]</a></sup> For kids who would be symptomatic, this is the difference between feeling healthy and experiencing fever, aches, and other flu-like symptoms. <strong>And even more importantly: we estimate that SMC would protect one of these 270 young children from a fatal case of malaria.</strong><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-7\" id=\"fnref-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-7\">[7]</a></sup></p>\n<p><strong>What we're excited to have recommended so far</strong></p>\n<p>This year, we've recommended grants to extend and expand programs we've supported for a while, like top charities, and we've also supported programs that are newer to us. With a decline in <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2023/10/06/open-philanthropys-2023-2025-funding-for-givewells-recommendations/\">expected funding</a> from Open Philanthropy, we've slowed our spending to match the funding we expect to raise going forward; we've focused more of our grantmaking on building for the future rather than funding large-scale opportunities this year. Below, we describe four selected grants from this year.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-8\" id=\"fnref-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-8\">[8]</a></sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6xDeDX3iqwwab6qSA/bmlxdiffnmfxk3mrao06\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6xDeDX3iqwwab6qSA/i59qgtnbhg2whgsnauw8\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>More about each of these grants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$6.6 million to the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) to provide oral rehydration solution (ORS) and zinc for the treatment of diarrhea and to study the program's effectiveness.</strong> We've been interested in funding ORS/zinc for a long time; it appears to be a low-cost way to prevent and treat dehydration caused by diarrhea. Previously, we hadn't found the right opportunity to support it or to learn about our open questions. This grant will fund a randomized controlled trial studying the extent to which preemptively distributing free ORS/zinc directly to households increases usage by children under five, who are most at risk of death from diarrhea. This is the first program we've funded via the <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/Clinton-Health-Access-Initiative-Incubator-August-2022\">CHAI Incubator</a>, a collaboration between GiveWell and CHAI designed to identify, assess, and scale highly cost-effective interventions.</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/new-incentives-nigeria-expansion-extension-may-2023\">$12.6 million</a> to New Incentives to extend and expand its promotion of infant immunization.</strong> New Incentives is one of our four <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a>, which means it's one of the giving opportunities we're most confident in recommending to donors. With this funding, New Incentives is scaling up its work in northern Nigeria, where vaccination rates are particularly low and many children die of vaccine-preventable diseases. So far in 2023, New Incentives has enrolled <a href=\"https://www.newincentives.org/blog-posts/2023-enrollment-exceeds-all-previous-years-combined\">over 1 million infants</a> in its program.</li>\n<li><strong>$5.8 million to <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2023/07/07/miraclefeet-clubfoot-treatment-grant/\">MiracleFeet</a> to <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/miraclefeet-clubfoot-treatment-january-2023\">scale up treatment</a> for clubfoot and <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/miraclefeet-monitoring-and-evaluation-may-2023\">monitor</a> its program.</strong> MiracleFeet's program is different from most of the programs we fund because it involves treating a physical disability rather than implementing a preventive health program. We currently estimate that this program is close to our cost-effectiveness threshold, and we hope that we'll learn more and update our views as a result of this work with MiracleFeet.</li>\n<li><strong>$7.3 million to Evidence Action to explore opportunities to expand water chlorination and improve its effectiveness.</strong> This funding is intended to support Evidence Action to improve its safe water interventions and scope opportunities to expand to new settings. Evidence Action is also conducting <a href=\"https://www.evidenceaction.org/newsroom/weiss-asset-management-foundation-awards-over-1-25-million-to-support-evidence-actions-safe-water-pilot-in-india\">pilots</a> in three states in India; the goal is to explore the feasibility of different chlorination programs and partner with the government to deliver chlorination effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What more donations will enable</strong></p>\n<p>With more funding, we can support more programs over the next few years. We research a variety of programs and estimate the cost-effectiveness of each, which varies by both <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2023/11/09/how-we-work-2-specific-opportunities/\">program and location</a>.</p>\n<p>We set our cost-effectiveness threshold such that we expect to be able to fully fund all the opportunities above a given level of cost-effectiveness. Currently, we generally fund opportunities that we believe are at least 10 times as cost-effective as unconditional cash transfers to people living in poverty (i.e., \"<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models#grantmaking\">10x cash</a>\"). But there's nothing magical about the 10x cash threshold. We'd be very excited to recommend programs that are 6x cash, for example, if we had enough funding\u2014a program that's 6x cash might save a life for less than $15,000.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-9\" id=\"fnref-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-9\">[9]</a></sup></p>\n<p>See below for a stylized representation of our cost-effectiveness threshold, with details in this footnote.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-10\" id=\"fnref-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-10\">[10]</a></sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6xDeDX3iqwwab6qSA/go2thgrmaqoiwu4daljd\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If we had a very weak Giving Season this year and expected donations to continue lagging, we might have to raise our cost-effectiveness threshold to something like 12x cash and fund fewer programs going forward. In contrast, with exceptionally strong growth in donations we might be able to use a bar of 8x cash, expanding the set of opportunities we can fund.</p>\n<p>Funding we receive this Giving Season could support a variety of programs at top charities and in areas that are newer to us; we're still in the process of researching those opportunities. A few examples of programs that we might support include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Iron fortification.</strong> When people consume iron-fortified <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/incubation-grants/Fortify-Health-expansion-December-2021\">wheat</a> or rice, they're less likely to be iron deficient and anemic. In areas where iron deficiency is very common, we think fortification leads to cognitive benefits that also increase income and consumption.</li>\n<li><strong>Malnutrition treatment.</strong> Children experiencing malnutrition are at higher risk of mortality. Severe acute malnutrition can be treated with ready-to-use therapeutic food and antibiotics. We wrote about malnutrition in <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2021/11/19/malnutrition-treatment/\">2021</a> and have continued to refine our analysis of malnutrition programs since then.</li>\n<li><strong>Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC).</strong> As discussed <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6xDeDX3iqwwab6qSA/givewell-s-2023-recommendations-to-donors#Why_your_support_matters\">above</a>, this program involves distributing preventive antimalarial medication to young children. We've directed about <a href=\"https://airtable.com/appGuFtOIb1eodoBu/shrqjTYlWADcWscID/tblG72bMUu36lrWsr?backgroundColor=gray&amp;viewControls=on\">$400 million</a> to Malaria Consortium for SMC throughout GiveWell's history.</li>\n<li><strong>Vitamin A supplementation.</strong> Vitamin A deficiency prevents the immune system from functioning well, increasing the risk of death from infectious diseases.

When you give to the All Grants Fund, your donation might go to support <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/yale-research-initiative-on-innovation-and-scale-operational-grant-december-2022\">research</a> or <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/spark-microgrants-participatory-learning-action-mnh-november-2022\">scoping</a> opportunities rather than straightforward delivery of programs. You can find examples of the types of grants that could be funded by the All Grants Fund <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/all-grants#What_types_of_organizations_does_GiveWell_grant_to\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Top Charities Fund and specific top charities</em></p>\n<p>If you want to give to the programs we have the highest confidence in, we recommend giving to the <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/top-charities-fund\">Top Charities Fund</a>. The Top Charities Fund is allocated to the highest-priority funding gaps among our <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a> only. Because it's more restricted, the Top Charities Fund may go to opportunities with lower expected value than the All Grants Fund; this would happen if our top charities become less funding-constrained than the rest of our portfolio, though so far we think the expected impact has been similar across the two funds. You can also give to a specific top charity of your choosing.</p>\n<p><em>Unrestricted Fund</em></p>\n<p>If you're open to supporting both GiveWell's operating expenses and our recommended programs, we recommend our <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/unrestricted-fund\">Unrestricted Fund</a>. If we raise more unrestricted funding than we need for our operating costs, we will grant out the <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/about/official-records/Excess-Assets-Policy\">excess</a>. This is a great fit for donors who are excited about GiveWell's work and trust us to prioritize between our operations and our recommended programs.</p>\n<p>You can read more about all options for making a donation <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/donate/more-information\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Your impact</em></p>\n<p>Our community of donors will determine what we're able to fund in the future. By giving to any of the options above, you'll be supporting high-impact, evidence-backed programs.

The estimated marginal cost to save a life (i.e., the cost-effectiveness of the \"last\" grant we make) is lower, around $7,500, but we think it generally makes sense for donors to think of the average in this context. We reached $5,000 by looking first at top charities, where the <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/impact-estimates#Impact_metrics_for_grants_to_GiveWells_top_charities\">latest annual estimates</a> range from $4,000 to $5,500 (rounded up to the nearest $500) by charity and more recent grants are in a similar range, as seen <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z065ab9PPMu9i5KiQ4yLyQJPFQCfEzHSgtHulPiZeBo/edit#gid=0\">here</a>. We then checked that $5,000 estimate against the life-saving grants we've recommended to non-top charities so far this year, and it seemed fair as a reasonable overall estimate. <a href=\"#fnref-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-qHeniBcxioKXaSDFe-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>This example is of a top charity.

Also, part 1 might not really be all that necessary for some EAs to read, especially if you've already read stuff by people like Brian Tomasik or Magnus Vinding. Anyway, I'm hoping some of what I've written is interesting/helpful :)</i></p><p>Oh yeah, warning that this discusses extreme suffering and I've been told it can be quite depressing.</p><h1><strong>Part 1</strong></h1><p>Why it\u2019s bad</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Life is suffering.</p><p>Many people know the quote. Everyone has suffered, to one degree or another. But few humans have a deep or broad understanding of it. I am not one of them, at least on the dimension of depth; for this, I am very thankful.</p><p>But I have suffered, and I can use that as a reference point of sorts. When I was around 15 years old, I developed an anxiety disorder. Ever since then, it\u2019s come and gone in waves. Fortunately, medication and therapy, along with general self-development, have generally made these episodes more sparse and bearable. But still. For those who may not be able to understand, those episodes feel like being stalked alone through a dark alleyway or menacing forest, except for hours, days, or even months on end. The suffering bleeds into every corner and crevice of experience. At its worst, it feels like it has lasted forever, and that it will last forever. It feels unbearable, and sometimes, it is. Sometimes I am surprised by how much I suffer from it. Yet suffering of this sort is commonplace, and is only the tip of an incomprehensible, terrible iceberg.</p><p>A terrifying example is that of cluster headaches. Several people&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5901943/\"><u>describe their experiences with cluster headaches</u></a>. One account that really struck me was this one:</p><blockquote><p>A few years ago I had a life \u2014 a husband, children, an interesting job and a lovely home. One day my life became a nightmare. I lost everything. I had no life anymore just pain and suffering all the time with just a few hours\u2019 relief every day. I couldn\u2019t eat, sleep, listen or play with my kids \u2014 they were too loud. I couldn\u2019t go to the theatre \u2014 too loud. I couldn\u2019t sleep, couldn\u2019t work, I was suffering too much and no one could understand me. I had lost everything (Kalina, France)</p></blockquote><p>Suffering, especially that of this and similar magnitudes, should be relieved when possible, full stop. We do not think twice about giving anesthetic to those who undergo surgery, and we do not (or at least should not) question the need for pain relief for many mothers who undergo childbirth. More than that, the relief of intense suffering is of paramount importance. If the patient begins to scream from suffering on the operating table, relieving the patient\u2019s suffering becomes a top priority (and for the patient, it is certainly&nbsp;<i>the</i> top priority). Similarly, if a person or animal is in a state of intense suffering, our first response should be one of urgent compassion and not detached apathy.</p><p>In case you\u2019re inclined to believe that these reports are exaggerated, or that it would be different for you, you can check your pride&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104498599\"><u>here</u></a>. You aren\u2019t special, and neither are those who\u2019ve experienced intense suffering. The only difference is that of luck. In another world, you are the one who is in Hell.</p><p>Okay. Get ready.</p><p>In my view, suffering is immense in the three key dimensions:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probablygood.org/cause-areas/#:~:text=Importance%3A%20the%20scale%20of%20the,currently%20dedicated%20to%20the%20problem.\"><u>scale/importance (depth and breadth), tractability, and neglectedness</u></a>.</p><p>I already said that everyone suffers, but I say it again to clarify the definition of everyone. Every human that has ever lived, each of the 100+ billion of them, has suffered. Many have experienced severe suffering of one kind or another. One episode that demonstrates the wantonness of suffering was (according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Song_dynasty#War_with_Northern_Wei\"><u>Wikipedia</u></a>) recounted by Sima Guang:</p><blockquote><p>\u2026 The Song deaths and injuries were innumerable. When Wei forces encountered Song young men, the forces quickly beheaded them or cut them in half.&nbsp;<strong>The infants were pierced through with spears, and the spears were then shaken so that the infants would scream as they were spun, for entertainment.</strong> The commanderies and counties that Wei forces went through were burned and slaughtered, and not even grass was left. When sparrows returned in the spring, they could not find houses to build nest on, so they had to do so in forests. Wei soldiers and horses also suffered casualties of more than half, and the Xianbei people were all complaining.</p></blockquote><p>Any decent scholar of history will tell you that such episodes are not the exception, but the rule. Even if a small fraction of such recountings reflect reality, what the Mirror shows is a very grim picture indeed. And it gets worse. For of course, pain is not limited to that which is deliberately caused. Disease, starvation, childbirth, and accidents were (and in some ways still are) cruel instruments used to great effect by an arbitrary and uncaring world.</p><p>And then it gets worse still when one expands the scope beyond mere humanity and considers all beings who are capable of suffering. Though the boundaries of sentience are somewhat fuzzy, current science definitively identifies most animals as sentient (<a href=\"https://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf\"><u>this declaration</u></a> represents the general scientific consensus). This is extremely bad news.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ranker.com/list/what-being-boiled-is-like/laura-allan?_ga=2.100457814.953900888.1697855459-1479077326.1697855459\"><u>This</u></a> is what it\u2019s like to be boiled alive. If you don\u2019t want to read the article, the gist of it is that it\u2019s really bad. If you\u2019ve ever been burned by steam or hot water or some other fluid, a good intuition might be to imagine that happening all over your body and all within your body for an agonizingly long time. Now imagine you\u2019re a chicken in a factory farm. You\u2019re shackled by your feet and hung upside down before a blade slices through your neck.&nbsp;<strong>But you\u2019re still alive and conscious, and you watch with increasing terror as you\u2019re lowered into a vat of boiling-hot water.</strong> Now imagine that happening&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mercyforanimals.org/blog/horror-one-million-birds-boiled-alive-each-year/?_ga=2.26867517.1099690040.1545059389-1606136063.1544554323\"><u>a million times every year</u></a>.</p><p>In fact, over forty billion farmed land animals (cows, pigs, and chickens) and many more farmed/wild-caught marine animals (including fish and crustaceans) are slaughtered every year and, in the case of farmed animals (land and marine), are forced to live in atrocious and inhumane conditions until the point of slaughter. These are numbers too large for our puny brains to comprehend. For context, a rough conservative estimate I came up with is that, were the Holocaust to be carried out on farmed land animals rather than humans, it would need to be repeated over 2,000 times to kill the number of farmed land animals that are killed worldwide in a single year. Imagine a 10,000 year Holocaust condensed into the span of a single year, year after year, and you start to imagine the scale which I\u2019m speaking of.</p><p>We\u2019re not done. For we have not even begun to consider the welfare of wild animals. It\u2019s easy to fall prey to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/event/myth-bambi-idyllic-view-nature-and-wild-animal-suffering#:~:text=Wild%20Animal%20Suffering-,The%20Myth%20of%20Bambi%3A%20The%20Idyllic%20View,Nature%20and%20Wild%20Animal%20Suffering&amp;text=toward%20helping%20wildlife.,when%20left%20alone%20is%20unsubstantiated.\"><u>Myth of Bambi</u></a> (or as I like to think of it, the Lion King Effect) and either ignore or rationalize the suffering of wild animals. Gary Paulsen, in his book&nbsp;<i>Woodsong</i>, writes:</p><blockquote><p>Wolves do not kill \u201cclean.\u201d (If there can be such a thing.) It is a slow, ripping, terrible death for the prey and only those who have not seen it will argue for that silly business about the prey actually selecting itself. Two wolves held the doe by the nose, held her head down to the ice, and the other wolves took turns tearing at her rear end, pulling and jerking and tearing, until they were inside of her, pulling out parts of her and all this time she was still on her feet, still alive. She was still on her feet though they had the guts out of her now, pulled back on the ice, eating and pulling, and I wanted it to end, wanted it to be over for her. And she sank.&nbsp;<strong>She somehow did not die then and still does not die in my mind.&nbsp; She just sinks.&nbsp; Over and over I can see her sinking as they pull at her.&nbsp; When I could stand it no longer, when I was sick with it and hated all wolves for the horror of it, I yelled. \u201cLeave her\u2026\u201d</strong></p></blockquote><p>One may argue that the wolves had no choice, that they needed to eat her or they would starve. One may argue that there is a certain harmony in the order of nature, that the deer herself pulled up plants by their roots and devoured them. One may argue that it is in the service of the balance of the ecosystem, which we do not understand and should not try to change. One may argue.</p><p>Yet if there\u2019s one thing I want to get across, it\u2019s this:</p><p><strong>Suffering brooks no arguments</strong></p><p>Imagine you are the doe. Imagine the sharp teeth tearing into your flesh, ripping skin from organs and sinew from bones. Imagine your suffering in that eternal moment, frightened and alone and in unbearable agony.&nbsp;<strong>What argument could I make to you that would justify that?</strong></p><p>Now imagine this happening on a scale so large it dwarfs even that of factory farming. From the Great Apes to the tiny ants, and everywhere in between. Trillions of trillions of sentient beings subjected to the same horrible ends.</p><p>Brian Tomasik writes about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/the-horror-of-suffering/\"><u>the horror of suffering</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>On one afternoon, while walking outside, I saw many winged ants on the sidewalk, some of which had been stepped on. I wondered whether I should try to move them out of the way of pedestrians, but there were too many. The sheer number of ants was such that I felt awful thinking about the pain of each of their deaths, multiplied by how many there were. Of course, this is a drop in the bucket relative to nature as a whole, but seeing it up close made the horror sink in</p></blockquote><p>That is nature, and that is our world. Simply indifferent and full of extreme suffering.</p><p>The beauty and harmony of nature is no consolation to its sufferers. In fact, it is the worst perversion. That an exterior so beautiful and wondrous should conceal a bottomless Hell of suffering and indignity is a level of perversity only a demon could orchestrate.</p><p>I could go on and I could go further, considering speculations on the suffering of future people, of artificial intelligences, of alien civilizations, and of even wilder things. But I don\u2019t need to. I hope.</p><p>The good news is that because there\u2019s so much intense suffering, there\u2019s so much opportunity to reduce it, both at individual and collective levels.</p><p>Even tweaking our daily habits can reduce intense suffering immensely. For example, joining the growing plant-based or plant-forward movement&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org.uk/article/how-many-animals-can-you-save-by-going-vegan\"><u>directly corresponds to a reduction in the number of animals tormented and slaughtered for food</u></a>. Through this alone, you could spare thousands of animals immense suffering and painful deaths. Imagine the joy you might feel if you could save even one dog from a puppy mill. Now imagine getting to do that day after day after day. That\u2019s the sort of impact you could have just by changing what you consume.</p><p>Donating to the right charities is also a great way to reduce intense suffering. It\u2019s true that many charities are ineffective, but not for the reasons commonly assumed. Effective charities are effective not only because they are managed well but because they use pragmatic interventions and focus on effective cause areas. Choosing the right charity is important, and there are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/best-charity/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=80KMAR-GrantsDSAs&amp;utm_content=61209776527&amp;utm_term=&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwysipBhBXEiwApJOcuxwXf10yVsFq8zid8B-pUP7cXWGaVHurPseax6zz8VSqDTxRW76UNhoCNKkQAvD_BwE\"><u>many methods you can use to ensure your donations are used effectively</u></a>.</p><p>A person can also use their career to reduce intense suffering. Of course, this is what many people already do with their careers (e.g. many healthcare professionals, humanitarian aid workers, and activists). If you\u2019re earlier on in your career, or you\u2019re (open to) transitioning to another career, then your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/summary/\"><u>choice of career path</u></a> will be important to determining the impact you can have. Even if you\u2019re later on in your career, or you\u2019re set on a specific discipline, you can still make decisions that will maximize your impact. To take just one example, the fight against extreme poverty can and has drawn people from many disciplines.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug\"><u>Norman Borlaug</u></a>, an agronomist, is credited for spearheading efforts to increase food production that saved an estimated billion people from starvation.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer\"><u>Peter Singer</u></a>, the patron saint of animal welfare activists, used his expertise in philosophy to argue for greater efforts to reduce extreme poverty.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Malaria_Foundation\"><u>Rob Mather</u></a>, founder of the Against Malaria Foundation, comes from a background in business. These are just a few of the most prominent and exceptional individuals who have done much to reduce this one specific slice of suffering. Even ordinary folks like us can use the skills and interests we have effectively, for example by employing them in the service of an effective organization.</p><p>On the collective level, things can seem to unfold more slowly from the perspective of the individual. However, within our lifetimes, we\u2019ve seen massive victories for civil rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and even farmed animal protections (the biggest example being&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_California_Proposition_12\"><u>California\u2019s Proposition 12</u></a>, which was recently upheld by the Supreme Court). These were all massive efforts that were made possible by the hard work of coalitions of people. There is no guarantee of progress except that which we make for ourselves, but there is also nothing more powerful than a collective, well-directed effort continually striving across time.</p><p>Another reason there\u2019s so much opportunity to reduce intense suffering is that many causes regarding immense suffering are highly neglected. The biggest example is in animal welfare: over 99% of all animals in the US are farmed animals,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/why-farmed-animals/\"><u>but they receive only 0.8% of all funding for non-human animals in the US</u></a>. The situation for wild animals is even more dismal, especially when one excludes funding that is not in their interests but rather in the interests of \u201cnature\u201d or conservation (which are often neutral to or even cause suffering in wild animals; e.g. reintroducing predators). Effort or resources expended for a more neglected cause area will be more beneficial, all else equal, than the same amount of effort or resources expended for a less neglected cause area. To put this in perspective, even if the number of farmed animals was the same as the number of shelter animals and farmed animal suffering was equal to that of shelter animals, it would still be more effective to invest one\u2019s effort and resources into helping farmed animals because their cause is more neglected.</p><p>The bottom line is that many of us are capable to one degree or another of reducing suffering. Indeed, many of us already do so in our day-to-day lives. We might help an old lady cross a street, give money to a homeless person, or volunteer at the children\u2019s hospital. These acts that help to alleviate the suffering of others are some of the most meaningful, both to the helper and the one helped. This is no different from that. It\u2019s just that we now realize how much greater the scope of suffering was than we had previously thought, and we should adjust how we think and act accordingly. If you\u2019ve made it through this essay, thank you; I imagine it might not have been easy. But you might have motivated yourself with the thought that, hard as it was for you, it was infinitely harder for the individuals who underwent the torments I described. For them, the least we can do is to learn and try not to repeat the terrors of the past.</p><h1><strong>Part 2&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>What makes it a priority</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them peace and rest &nbsp; at last, but that it was essential and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature\u2014that baby beating its breast with its fist, for instance\u2014and to found that edifice on its unavenged tears, would you consent to be the architect on those conditions? Tell me, and tell the truth. (The Brothers Karamazov, Chapter 4)</p></blockquote><p>Truly immerse yourself in this situation. Imagine as if it were real that you were there, making the choice between two possible worlds. In one, you have a world full of billions of blissful and joyful beings, but to achieve it, you must use the worst forms of torture on an infant. Burning, beating, stabbing, flaying, and so forth. The infant will survive for a long while with pain undiminished; as long as any other person. In another world, you have nothing. Which world would you choose?</p><h2>Bad Is Stronger Than Good</h2><p>The very fact that we struggle with this question at all should make us seriously question some underpinnings of our worldviews. To drive the point home, consider the inverted question: you have a choice between two worlds; in one, billions of beings endure the worst suffering while an infant enjoys the greatest bliss and joy, and in the other, there is nothing. Which world would you choose? It seems far more obvious in this case that the better choice would be nothing. Yet if pleasure and pain were equally important to us, we should expect the same amount of hesitancy to arise in answering both questions.</p><p>A number of scientific results seem to converge with the intuition that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://assets.csom.umn.edu/assets/71516.pdf\"><u>Bad Is Stronger Than Good</u></a>. Individuals tend to react more strongly to bad events than good ones (for example, it is relatively routine for someone to experience intensely painful episodes even years after a traumatic event, but much less common for someone to experience similarly intensely pleasurable episodes years after a transcendent event). Relationships tend to be more affected by bad experiences, to the point where that it was estimated that stable relationships need at least a 5:1 ratio of good to bad experiences to remain stable. We have more words for bad emotions than good ones, and more strategies for avoiding bad states than for seeking good ones. We react more and are more averse to (perceived) losses than they are to (perceived) gains. Fear-inducing events can make practically unremovable changes to our brains, which remain even after a behavioral responses have been extinguished through unlearning techniques (the analogy would be cutting only the visible stem of a weed plant; its roots remain intact and ready to regrow another plant when an opportunity emerges). When a pair of \u201cobjectively\u201d equally good and equally bad things happen (e.g. someone gives you $100 vs. someone steals $100 from you), it seems that any aggregation of the two produces not net neutrality but net badness. This would seem to apply even in the case that marginal utility was not significantly diminishing; for example, in the case that you were a millionaire</p><p>One could argue that\u2014like loss aversion\u2014the tendency to be disproportionately averse to bad things is irrational, and that we should even decrease the consideration we give to suffering based on this information (since suffering is \u201cnot as bad\u201d as it feels). I hope there are few who would sincerely believe such an argument, but I will address it just in case. Of course, we should seek to remind ourselves where appropriate and possible that our feelings may not be adaptive. But anyone who has suffered to a significant degree knows that suffering\u2014especially extreme suffering\u2014is not something that can just be argued away. Until technology that can rewire our biology at the deepest level is developed, there will be no solution to the Asymmetry.</p><h2>There Is More Bad Than Good</h2><p>This is something that may have come across in Part 1, but it\u2019s probably still worth covering here. Fortunately, when just considering humans, aggregate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://intranet.newriver.edu/images/stories/library/Stennett_Psychology_Articles/Recent%20Findings%20on%20Subjective%20Well-Being.pdf\"><u>subjective well-being</u></a> seems to be around neutral (in the least developed countries) and positive (in more developed countries). This might unfortunately imply that our ancestors (at least back until the agricultural revolution) lived at best neutral and at worst net negative lives. Though of course it also may imply that we can continue to improve human well-being, which is what matters. So hooray for small victories.</p><p>Okay, we\u2019re done with the feel-good part, because whether or not human well-being is net positive or not pretty much doesn\u2019t matter. The obvious place to turn to next is the non-human animals in our custody, and it\u2019s pretty obvious that their lives are net bad. If you don\u2019t think so, lock yourself in a dark room too small to turn around in and live in your own piss and shit for three weeks and come back and tell me whether you think that life was worth living. Even in the ultra-conservative case where you assign moral weights by neuron count or brain mass, the number of farmed (land) animals is such that together they would almost certainly tip the scale of aggregate well-being to be net bad (for example, in aggregate farmed land animals have about 1/9 the total brain mass that humans do, which is still significant). But you probably shouldn\u2019t assign moral weights by neuron count or brain mass. You wouldn\u2019t think that your baby or your dog deserved less moral consideration because they had less neurons or smaller brains\u2026 I hope. You also (probably) think you have greater moral worth than a single elephant, even though their neuron count and brain mass is far greater than yours. Though it\u2019s unclear exactly how much suffering animals feel relative to humans, it seems that their suffering must be broadly comparable to our own. Perhaps they suffer more because they cannot understand the context of the situation they are in, or because they do not have all the cognitive tools that humans have to soothe themselves (though of course they have some). If, for many species, individual animals\u2019 capacities for suffering are comparable to that of individual humans\u2019, then their total suffering dwarfs both our total suffering and total pleasure.</p><p>And then, of course, there are the wild animals, whose&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/how-many-wild-animals-are-there/\"><u>numbers</u></a> make even those of farmed animals look small. If we hold the assumptions established in the previous paragraph (that capacity to feel pleasure and suffering among sentients is similar), then their suffering or pleasure will predominate. Though it\u2019s true that there\u2019s a lot of suffering out in the wild, does this mean that the suffering must outweigh the pleasure?</p><p>We don\u2019t know as much as we\u2019d like to about wild animals, so any answer is going to be speculative. Nevertheless, the answer seems to be yes. In wild animals,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stafforini.com/library/ng-1995.pdf\"><u>suffering outweighs pleasure, too</u></a>. If both our models for pleasure and suffering are such that there are increasing costs/diminishing returns to greater pleasure/suffering, which seems to be a reasonable assumption, then for any species in which more members are unsuccessful (die from starvation, predation, etc. and/or live frustrated lives) than successful (reproduce), there will be greater suffering. Take the example of a species where, for every successful member, two members will be unsuccessful; this model predicts that unsuccessful members will expend a cost (say 1) in producing suffering (punishment for not being successful) while successful members will expend a cost 2 in producing pleasure (reward for being successful). We would assume that a greater likelihood of success/failure would result in greater resources expended to reward/punishment. But expending twice as many resources into either pleasure or suffering will not yield twice as much pleasure/suffering due to diminishing returns, so it follows that the suffering in a scenario with more offspring who fail rather than succeed is greater than the pleasure. This does not even rely on the assumption that bad is stronger than good; even in the case where pleasure and suffering functions are equal but opposite, the model still holds true. In a case where there were more successful members than unsuccessful ones, we might expect pleasure to predominate, but there are few, if any, examples where this is true (humans might be one). In contrast, we know of many species (e.g. fruit flies) that produce hundreds or even thousands of offspring per female; this is far above the replacement rate, and so many more offspring will fail than succeed.</p><p>To give some intuitions to support the above analysis, one might imagine that for every frog that is successful in mating, dozens of frogs will die before reproduction, often in painful ways (predation, starvation, disease, etc.). To take an example closer to home, for every wild dog that is successful, around five or six others will not be and will once again die, often in painful ways. And then there\u2019s the possibility that even \u201csuccessful\u201d members will die in painful ways or live frustrated lives after reproducing, whereas there\u2019s no posthumous pleasure for an \u201cunsuccessful\u201d member who has already died (unless you believe dogs go to heaven).</p><h2>Badness Can\u2019t Be Offset By Goodness, Especially One\u2019s Badness By Another\u2019s Goodness</h2><p>This is probably one of the hidden intuitions that troubles people when they run into classical utilitarianism. An example of this is a problem that arises where atrocities like slavery and genocide become permissible if a sufficiently large majority derives sufficient pleasure from them and a sufficiently small minority derives sufficiently little suffering from them. A major component of these thought experiments that are focused on are principles like justice, rights, and dignity. These, however, may obscure another problem that these thought experiments expose, which is that it is not obvious that goodness can offset badness. Suffering, specifically extreme suffering, may just be categorically more important than pleasure.</p><p>Let\u2019s go through a toy exercise. Say child A makes fun of child B. A derives pleasure from this, while B derives suffering. Even if A is rolling with laughter while B merely sags in their seat, we (or at least many of us, I think) would still say that it would be better had this situation not occurred. This becomes especially true to us if B\u2019s level of suffering reaches a sufficient level; for example, if B is crying from what A said, then there\u2019s practically no level of pleasure A could derive that would somehow make up for that. One might argue that this would imply that we would need to accept something like enforced political correctness, but this is not necessary because the suffering caused by censorship might plausibly outweigh the suffering caused by collateral damage from stupid expressions of free speech.</p><p>But badness might not be offsetable by goodness, not only for comparisons between self and others, but even within a single person. Imagine you are given a choice: you can either choose to have two hours of a neutral experience, or you can choose to have one hour of incredible torture and one hour of incredible bliss. No bodily harm will come to you in either case, and you will not know which hour will be served first. Which will you choose? In my view, you should choose the two hours of neutrality. A follow-up question to this would be how many hours of incredible bliss you would need to experience to make up for an hour of incredible torture. I am not sure what the average person\u2019s answer to this would be (though I\u2019d guess it would be at least five or six hours of bliss for one hour of torture), but I know my answer is that there is no number of hours of incredible pleasure I would take in exchange for one hour of incredible pain. We can then compare this to a condition where you choose either between one hour of incredible pain or two hours of incredible pain. Obviously we would all choose one hour of incredible pain. So the intuition that becomes clear here is that, even in oneself, pleasure might not compensate for pain. This is demonstrated in a real-life case where a man named Dax Cowart endured an extremely painful event where he suffered severe burns and was forced to live through extreme pain while being treated.</p><p>After his treatment, Dax managed to recover and live what he considered a happy life \u2014 he successfully sued the oil company responsible for the pipeline leak, which left him financially secure; he earned a law degree; got married; and reported to have had \u201csome very, very good experiences\u201d after the accident. Yet even from this position of an accomplished and self-reportedly happy life, he still wished that he had been killed rather than treated. In Dax\u2019s own view, no happiness could ever compensate for what he went through (<a href=\"https://magnusvinding.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/suffering-focused-ethics.pdf\"><u>Vinding, pp 69</u></a>).</p><h2>Implications</h2><p>Cases like these are troublesome for classical utilitarianism, which sees suffering and pleasure as interchangeable both within one person and between different people. By contrast,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/three-types-of-negative-utilitarianism/\"><u>negative utilitarianism</u></a> (which has three different \u201clevels\u201d), which focuses on suffering, has no issues with them. I think the results of these experiments, both philosophical and real, are sufficient to demonstrate that we should at least accept a weak, lexical-threshold form of negative utilitarianism. I think we should very seriously consider a strong lexical-threshold form of negative utilitarianism, and I think we should still consider a strong form of negative utilitarianism. In any case, reducing suffering (especially extreme suffering) should be our greatest priority, whether you identify as a negative utilitarian, classical utilitarian, or something else.&nbsp;</p><h1>Part 3</h1><p>How to reconcile with it</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the first two parts of this series, I talked a lot about Suffering (with a big S), taking a really abstract and general kind of view. And then there were two interludes where I talked about suffering on an individual, visceral level. Here, I want to look at it from an individual, cerebral level. This is for the long haul, for answering questions like \u201cwhy is the world like this?\u201d and \u201chow can I cope with me and everyone I know being murderers and manslaughterers?\u201d. I want to be clear: I can\u2019t exactly be of much help in dealing with most forms of one\u2019s own suffering, especially physical suffering. What I aim to do here is to help to mitigate any suffering caused by the realization of ideas such as the ones I\u2019ve discussed so far. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any silver bullet, just like there isn\u2019t any silver bullet for suffering in general, but there are things that can help.</p><h2>The Dialectic</h2><p>\u201cDialectic (Greek: \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, dialektik\u1e17; German: Dialektik), also known as the dialectical method, refers originally to dialogue between people holding different points of view about a subject but wishing to arrive at the truth through reasoned argumentation\u201d</p><p>\u2014 Wikipedia</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Dialectic has been, without a doubt, one of the most useful concepts in my life. I think many of us use dialectics to some extent in an unconscious manner, and I think there\u2019s so much we could gain from utilizing them to their fullest extent (this sentence is something of a dialectic). The dialectic technique I\u2019d like to use, which I\u2019ll refer to as&nbsp;<i>synthesis dialecticism</i>, is different both from classical logic and from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2811254/#:~:text=The%20third%20feature%20of%20na%C3%AFve,Peng%20%26%20Nisbett%2C%201999).\"><u>naive dialecticism</u></a>. Classical logic does not allow for middle positions and doesn\u2019t provide a good framework for evolving dialogue, while naive dialecticism tends to blindly take the average of competing positions and/or to ignore seeming contradictions altogether. There are many cases in which another tool is needed to make sense of seeming contradictions that may be very difficult to resolve with classical logic and which may go unnoticed by naive dialecticism.</p><p>An example of how synthesis dialecticism can be helpful is in the case of veganism. Someone coming from a framework of classical logic might reason:</p><ol><li>Consumption of any amount of animal products contributes to slaughter and exploitation of animals</li><li>Contributing to slaughter and exploitation makes a person a killer</li><li>Killers should be shamed, punished, and even attacked</li><li>All people who are not strictly vegan should be shamed, punished, and even attacked</li></ol><p>This sort of reasoning, I think, can lead to outcomes that are not good (or not as good as they could be) from a larger perspective. Indeed, it\u2019s possible that applying a framework of classical logic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aHaqgTNnFzD7NGLMx/reason-as-memetic-immune-disorder\"><u>may result in counterproductive or even dangerous fanaticism</u></a> because of its focus on elimination of seeming contradictions.</p><p>At the other extreme, a person who uses a naive dialectical framework may simply try to average the two viewpoints, or to accept both of them. So, for example, one might say that both a vegan diet and a non-vegan diet are equally okay. And while it may be pragmatic to say this to defuse tensions at the dinner table, it\u2019s dangerously complacent to hold too sincerely to this attitude. The analogue of 200 years ago is a person who sincerely believes that slavery is an issue of state\u2019s rights, not individual ones.</p><p>For me, the synthesis of these attitudes is to recognize that factory farming is perhaps the largest injustice we have ever directly perpetrated&nbsp;<i>and</i> that the most effective methods to combat it may be ones that we don\u2019t feel would be most authentic or just. That many people do things that have bad consequences which we should not be complacent about&nbsp;<i>and</i> that they are not horrible people with the intention to do harm. We ought to make compromises where it is pragmatic to do so&nbsp;<i>and</i> continue to work towards animal liberation wherever we can.</p><p>Here are a few that I think have been really useful to me:</p><h2>You\u2019ve made mistakes&nbsp;<i>and</i> you are not a bad person</h2><p>\u201cI don't like the terms \"good person\" or \"bad person\" because it is impossible to be entirely good to everyone.\u201d</p><p>\u2014 Armin Arlert,&nbsp;<i>Attack on Titan</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that very few people are capable of thinking they are bad people.</p><p>For if one placed any significant level of importance on being a good person, as many of us do, and if one defined the goodness or badness of one\u2019s person by the acts they engaged in, then it would be impossible for one to appraise one\u2019s actions as bad, because that would be in contradiction to one\u2019s belief that one was good.</p><p>Even for those of us who can recognize mistakes, we tend to distance them from ourselves. What we did was actually something our past self did, and we criticize that person, who we are no longer. By shunting our sins onto our past selves, we remain clean. Think about it: when was the last time that, while you were doing something, you decided resolutely it was immoral and then continued to do it anyway? I don\u2019t know if I can come up with anything recent. The closest most of us can come is that we have some moral struggle with ourselves, some doubt about what is permissible. Only later do we condemn ourselves as having done wrong.</p><p>Maybe something that contributes to this is how we internalize our actions. My belief is that, when we take some action of great consequence and define ourselves with it, it can be both difficult to deal with and counterproductive. Feelings of guilt and shame can be overwhelming, and shaming oneself and others can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/86044988/cfbc761031787464c1291bb23f2f5f9a90fe-libre.pdf?1652763253=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DShame_and_the_motivation_to_change_the_s.pdf&amp;Expires=1699573364&amp;Signature=MqMnSZU1c1Ju-4Es4MUoSS-0yFYL~eCi4ban~UiC9Bx3o-xZotAAe9TtdU05bXLEdOCEGl9rN8MPkre~jerUYiOkHtTlPSO~tGrswWYXgRDbv80oTV-7aDC~RRdSQGD9WgTLcRoXX079cX3oCkoEZssf00zgYFBWApiKWmuidblGkauR3-EzWr7jx0SWTnKS5Tz7CGPY2g2Alfjr7SuJhFHdkyajfZGjNWfhcEC8yfokJLtbKhXo1N7EuSvGhAumwBHipDbbSxNNX6HYxqjIKX0DIiRxZdPZn4gxXg7-wbeNOhzP-BWqhObOxbyDpvWNNapNS4GVpljPZoy-9~OUlw__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA\"><u>backfire</u></a> (because of the possibility that one will distance oneself from the thing that provoked shame rather than changing behavior; see page 11). I think it\u2019s more accurate to recognize that our actions were bad, or that they had bad consequences, or that there were better actions that could have been taken. Not only that, but at least in theory, this framing is more helpful because it leaves open the possibility of change. To define oneself as a bad person implies somewhat that there is an inability to change, that one will be tainted by this mark of badness no matter what one does. And that is counterproductive, because the point is to change what one does in the future, not to change an inaccessible past. To say that one has done bad things or acted in ways that had bad outcomes not only leaves open the possibility for future actions to be better, but implies that they will be.</p><h2>Silver bullets don\u2019t exist&nbsp;<i>and</i> you can do good without them</h2><p>\u201cThere is no single, simple answer to the question of how we can best reduce suffering\u201d</p><p>\u2014 Magnus Vinding</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raoul_Wallenberg#Mission_to_Budapest\"><u>Raoul Wallenberg</u></a>, a Swedish diplomat during WWII, used his position to save at least hundreds to thousands of Jews in Hungary, and may have been instrumental to a plot that saved the lives of an estimated 70,000 Hungarian Jews. Whatever the case may be, neither he nor anyone else saved all the Jews in Hungary, let alone all the Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe. And it would have been highly unrealistic to expect them to do so. Even for a single train of Jews about to be deported to Auschwitz, there was only so much he could do.</p><p>After Wallenberg had handed over the last of the passports he ordered all those who had one to leave the train and walk to the caravan of cars parked nearby, all marked in Swedish colours. I don't remember exactly how many, but he saved dozens off that train, and the Germans and Arrow Cross were so dumbfounded they let him get away with it.</p><p>Undoubtedly many more dozens of Jews were not able to get a passport, and were deported to Auschwitz. And it must have been terrible if one were on that train, seeing the passports handed through but not being able to get one. Wallenberg himself may have felt regret that he could not have printed more passports, that he could not offer one to every person on that train, that he could not have saved them all.</p><p>I\u2019ve personally gone through periods where I implicitly felt that there were silver bullets, and more than that, that I had one. I definitely held martyr and savior complexes, and I have a sneaking suspicion that I\u2019m not the only one, as these phenomena already have names. Maybe these things never completely go away, though I\u2019ve begun to recognize them for what they are. It was personally painful to recognize that there was really so little I, or anyone else for that matter, could do on the scale of trillions. At the same time, to (relatively) concretely rather than abstractly grasp the idea that I could probably work for the benefit of thousands, and possibly even for the benefit of millions, is something that\u2019s been incredibly motivating.</p><p>Humans tend to engage in binary,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splitting_(psychology)\"><u>black-and-white thinking</u></a>. One is either good or bad. One is either effective or not. One can either save everyone or fail everyone. The reality is, of course, different. Though we cannot save everyone, we can save some. Many, even. And that\u2019s important. Each one of those people who received a passport must have been overjoyed. And perhaps, even if a parent did not receive a passport, they were overjoyed that their child received one. Each one of these people who was saved was one person who was spared the torments of Auschwitz. So even though Wallenberg and others could not save everyone, they still did an enormous amount of good, and are rightly celebrated for their actions.</p><h2><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zu28unKfTHoxRWpGn/you-have-more-than-one-goal-and-that-s-fine\"><u>You have more than one goal,&nbsp;</u><i><u>and</u></i><u> that\u2019s&nbsp;</u><s>fine</s><u> good</u></a></h2><p>\u201c...if you just ease off a little bit on the maximising, then you\u2019ve got a strategy that\u2019s much more robust\u201d</p><p>\u2014 Toby Ord</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps because Effective Altruists (and activists more broadly) have high goals and lofty standards, it can be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MjTB4MvtedbLjgyja/leaning-into-ea-disillusionment#Phase_2__Doubt_comes_in\"><u>disillusioning</u></a> to learn that they (we) are also&nbsp;<i>homo sapiens</i>.

In this way, what appears at first to be merely irrational or wasteful\u2014when inspected more carefully\u2014might be an important protective factor (like how&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-US/misconceptions-and-concerns-about-effective-altruism-and-charity-evaluation#1-the-overhead-myth-looking-at-a-charitys-overhead-costs-is-key-to-evaluating-its-effectiveness\"><u>charities with low overhead are sometimes less effective</u></a>).</p><p>I think this may apply even more broadly. Even if you are a moral realist and you subscribe to one moral system (and even if that system is utilitarianism), what the most moral thing is for you to do is more complicated than you are able to represent to yourself. If you\u2019re a hard-core utilitarian, for example, you might believe that all people in Effective Altruism (EA) ought to work to solve the alignment problem, work as hard as possible, donate all their money to MIRI, and always aim for maximization in everything they do. Thinking through such a world, we can imagine a situation in which everyone in EA working on the alignment problem creates a technical solution, and the world is still destroyed by superintelligent AI because no one was creating policies and institutional changes to properly implement the technical solution. It would have been better had even a few EAs who were interested and competent in policy gone into the policy and institutional work rather than focusing on solving alignment. This is a pretty strawman example, and unfortunately I think models of similar naive simplicity are held by some people out there. I think more complex/less naive optimization models are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/toby-ord-perils-of-maximising-good/\"><u>still brittle</u></a> in that they likely have unforeseen failure modes and these failure modes could be disastrous.</p><h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmavihara\"><u>The Four Brahmaviharas</u></a></h2><p>\u201cIn the same way, in this kind of time, you can let this equanimity to grow; compassion to grow. First, you will have a fraction of compassion, let it grow. A fraction of unconditional friendliness. Let it grow. A fraction of compassion. Maybe you are just having a small action. Just one action. Let it grow.\u201d</p><p>\u2014&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.triplegem.org/wp/?page_id=3680\"><u>Triple Gem of the North</u></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps some who read this will know of the concept of loving-kindness, or&nbsp;<i>metta</i>. And of course, people are aware of the concept of compassion, though they may not have the same understanding of compassion or&nbsp;<i>karuna</i> as how I would define it here. Likely less well-known are the concepts of sympathetic joy (<i>mudita</i>) and equanimity (<i>upekkha</i>). The path to developing a dialectical understanding of these four abodes has been immensely helpful to me, so I hope it can be helpful to you, too.</p><h3>Loving Kindness (<i>Metta</i>)</h3><p>\u201cDarkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.\u201d</p><p>\u2014 Martin Luther King, Jr.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Loving kindness can be described as an opening of the heart and the radiating of a warm and light feeling, and can be defined as the wish to bring happiness and well-being to oneself and others. It\u2019s most readily felt towards people close to us, especially those such as young children and animal companions. The point of practicing&nbsp;<i>metta</i> is to take that affection that we naturally feel to the ones close to us and let it blossom. We learn to love acquaintances, then strangers, and even villains. This may seem strange; how could one love Hitler, for example? And why would we want to love someone who has done so much harm and injustice?</p><p>The far enemy of love is hatred or ill-will. Hatred is an integral part of human nature and of our moralities (indeed, people regularly rank \u201cvillains\u201d such as Hitler as being outside their moral circles,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190302195812id_/http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/a144/ab7fda8ff74602b9ec1f6deadb7261b11542.pdf\"><u>as far as or further out than plants</u></a>). It is natural to hate those who have done evil or those who are callous or sadistic. In some cases, it may even be adaptive (in a limited sense) to do so;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/68596/10.1177_0146167294205012.pdf?sequence=2\"><u>for example</u></a>, the honor culture of the American South likely arose due to a need to protect one\u2019s herds (which could be easily stolen) and to protect oneself (as law enforcement was weak). At the same time, the risks and harms that can come from hateful acts are enormous. In a culture of honor, even single slights can quickly escalate into massive feuds, such as the famous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatfield%E2%80%93McCoy_feud\"><u>Hatfield-McCoy feud</u></a>; in a world of billions of people and weapons of mass destruction, such feuding is simply not an option. As John Green once said, an eye for an eye leaves the whole world monocular.</p><p>The near enemy of love is conditional love.&nbsp;<strong>True love is not conditional on traits, actions, or familial relations</strong>. Hitler did terrible things, and it would\u2019ve been better had he drowned in a river when he was a kid (assuming, of course, no one worse took his place). We can readily acknowledge that many of his desires, intentions, and actions were incredibly wrong. At the same time, we can recognize the once-living being behind the name, and wish he had had the upbringing and environment (and even the innate dispositions) that would\u2019ve allowed him to self-actualize in a benevolent and peaceful way.</p><p>We can extend this notion of unconditional love to ourselves and our relations. Even if one is not a utilitarian, it is hard to deny the argument that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVl5kMXz1vA\"><u>we fall short</u></a> of the moral standards we set for ourselves. I think the ideal response is not to deny this or rationalize it away, nor is it to modify our ethical standards to fit the status quo; rather, it is to hold the fact that we cause suffering and death in our minds while also holding that by virtue of existing we are worthy of love, just as any other being is.</p><p>Though it\u2019s not listed as a near enemy, I think another near enemy of love is indulgence, by which I mean fulfilling another\u2019s superficial desires. Loving Hitler would not mean allowing him to kill all the Jews in the world. Instead, we might wish that he might be freed from the burdens of hatred and narrow-mindedness, and that he might become a better person. Similarly, loving ourselves and our relations does not equate to indulgence; we want to continue to challenge ourselves to do better; to become the people we truly are.</p><p>Practicing loving-kindness is not always easy, and it may be that you are not yet at a place where you can love Hitler. I don\u2019t think I am. The principle is to simply allow our love to grow by not smothering it with feelings of judgment or ill-will. By giving the proper conditions and focus to loving kindness, we can let it sprout from a tiny seed into a beautiful flower. The result is that we feel lighter in our hearts and we are more effective in our interactions with others.</p><h3>Compassion (<i>Karuna</i>)</h3><p>\u201cNo matter who the organism is or what he/she has done, his/her happiness and suffering still count just the same\u201d</p><p>\u2014 Brian Tomasik</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Compassion, from my perspective, is very similar to loving kindness. The main difference is that loving kindness can be defined as focusing on increasing happiness and well-being, while compassion can be defined as focusing on alleviating suffering. Compassion may be the trickiest brahmavihara to define, and the most consequential to understand.</p><p>Part of the difficulty of defining compassion is the word itself and the cultural context it is in. Compassion is from the Latin&nbsp;<i>com</i> +&nbsp;<i>passion</i>, which literally means \u201cto suffer with\u201d. The word that actually has this definition in modern English is empathy, and more specifically visceral/emotional empathy. The distinction between compassion and empathy is unclear but very important (important enough that there\u2019s an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Empathy\"><u>entire book</u></a> written about it).</p><p>So what is the definition of compassion, and how is it different from empathy? Fortunately, some people are doing scientific research on compassion, which requires a (relatively) rigorous definition.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735816300216#s0005\"><u>One definition</u></a> is that compassion is composed of five factors:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Recognizing suffering</li><li>Understanding the universality of suffering</li><li>Feeling empathy for the sufferer (emotional resonance)</li><li>Tolerating uncomfortable feelings aroused in response to the suffering and remaining open to and accepting of the sufferer</li><li>Motivation to act/acting to alleviate suffering.</li></ol><p>The important parts of this definition to me are recognizing suffering, understanding its universality, and being motivated to act to alleviate the suffering in whatever way is possible.</p><p>The far enemy of compassion is cruelty, and this is something we are very capable of. Even for someone like me, who is high in agreeableness and low in dark traits, there have been times where I have felt the urge to be cruel. When we see cruelty, and see its victims, the first thought that should come to our mind is compassion for the sufferer. So often in social movements, we become caught up in who we are fighting against; we feel hatred towards those who perpetrate cruelty. For whatever reason, we rarely stop to feel compassion for the actual ones who suffer. The degree to which we hold compassion for the ones we seek to help in our minds and hearts is precisely the degree to which we stay true to the mission of doing good.</p><p>The second thought should be this: there but for the Grace of God go I. For it is as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn declared: \u201cThe line between good and evil runs not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either \u2014 but right through every human heart\u201d. To some extent, all of us have caused great suffering, and all of us have suffered. We can be grateful that we have not caused or received as much suffering as many others have.</p><p>The near enemy of compassion is pity. Pity is the recognition of suffering without the connection provided by common being/universality of suffering. This results in a feeling of \u201cstanding above\u201d or condescension which makes pity irritating to the one pitied.&nbsp;</p><p>Though it\u2019s not often defined as a near enemy of compassion, I think an even more important one is despair which arises from empathy. Empathy has its part to play in compassion, for without an understanding of the suffering that is occurring, and without an understanding of the badness of suffering, compassionate action is not possible. At the same time, empathy alone is insufficient because while there is an understanding of the suffering, there is no action to alleviate it. I think, especially for EAs, confusion of compassion and empathy is the larger problem and can lead to more dangerous outcomes.</p><p>Emotions might be usefully thought of as measurement devices that detect certain stimuli across a range of situations. (Visceral) empathy might then be thought of as one\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://mindingourway.com/on-caring/\"><u>care-o-meter</u></a>\u201d; an indicator of how much one ought to care in a certain situation. In many ordinary situations in life, the care-o-meter is useful and functions well enough. If we see a little duckling struggling to move because their feathers are saturated with crude oil, our care-o-meters (hopefully for most of us, at least) register that and in a way we suffer with them (our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910013066?via%3Dihub#s0010\"><u>mirror neurons</u></a> may literally make it so we actually feel some of what we conceive their suffering to be).</p><p>The problem arises when we try to use our care-o-meter to gauge situations it was not built for. Increasing the number of individuals we\u2019re trying to care about from one to several&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0100115\"><u>paradoxically decreases our care rather than increasing it</u></a>. And when we reach scales of thousands, millions, or billions of individuals, our care-o-meters cease to be able to reliably tell the difference (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rti.org/sites/default/files/resources/bk-0001-1009_web.pdf\"><u>this example</u></a>, section 5.2 or page 66). It\u2019s like trying to measure the circumference of the Earth with a standard ruler; impossible, because it\u2019s the wrong tool. The implication is that we cannot rely on empathy alone to tell us what we ought to do on a large scale, and that visceral empathy may even lead us in the wrong direction (i.e. by driving us to focus on smaller and more catchy causes, like preserving giant pandas, at the expense of larger and less glamorous causes, like distributing anti-malaria nets). I claim that this holds true for any philosophy of ethics, potentially with the exception of ethics of care.</p><p>In addition to its unreliability on large scales, empathy can be dangerous to the empath. I know this from personal experience. After reading an article by Brian Tomasik one night, I became viscerally aware of the massive amount of suffering that was happening all around me. I felt more than I\u2019d ever felt before the suffering of people and animals and wild animals around the world, from the battery-caged chicken many miles away to the worker ant right outside my window. It felt like I was a vessel for molten fire, and I prayed to God to make all the suffering go away. It was the most painful experience of my life. And I knew that even then, what I felt was a hopelessly small fraction of the suffering my mind was trying to represent. I\u2019m sure many others in helping professions (such as activists and healthcare workers) have similar experiences. And logically, it can be no other way. Imagine someone who is probably already high in empathy being exposed (to one degree or another) to thousands, millions, or billions of beings in massive suffering. To proportionally feel even a \u201cnormal\u201d amount of empathy for each individual would be unbearable. Again, our care-o-meters just aren\u2019t built for that. Trying to empathize with the suffering of the world is like trying to use one\u2019s body to put out a volcano. All you\u2019ll succeed in doing is destroying yourself.</p><p>I\u2019m glad that Effective Altruism has shined a spotlight on effectiveness, and that utilitarianism has motivated people to increase their impartial impact. At the same time, it\u2019s important to recognize that tying your care-o-meter to proportional radical empathy is literally impossible, and that trying to achieve this will leave you miserable and incapacitated while also impairing your decision-making. The mistake we make when we learn about effectiveness is to try to tie what we rationally believe to be true to our care-o-meters. Using them to get ourselves to care at all might be a useful first step, but it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t let ourselves become beholden to them.</p><p>So then, what\u2019s the solution? Well, you can probably guess that I think it\u2019s compassion as I\u2019ve defined it here. One thing that I haven\u2019t mentioned yet is that compassion is the&nbsp;<i>lightly joyful</i> wish to alleviate suffering. This may seem strange and even sacrilegious. At the same time, it\u2019s the recognition and intention that count. Consider this: what might one feel when an infant is crying in distress? The empathetic response would be to get on the ground and start bawling with them, or perhaps more realistically, to feel anger in response to their anger. We know this is not helpful. A more helpful response is the heartfelt and joyful wish to soothe the suffering of the infant, to smile compassionately and say \u201cshhhhh, it\u2019s alright, I\u2019m here now\u201d. This light and beautiful feeling is compassion, and it is my belief that compassion can guide and protect us through the inferno of suffering.</p><h3>Sympathetic Joy (<i>Mudita</i>)</h3><p>\u201cTo help his friends, Frederick shared what he collected. Frederick told the field mice about the yellow corn, the green leaves, and the blue and purple flowers. Frederick warmed and cheered his friends with his words\u201d</p><p>\u2014&nbsp;<i>Frederick</i>, by Leo Lionni</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I love children and non-human animal companions.</p><p>And yes, I know I\u2019m falling right into the idealization of them as angels and cherubs. I know they\u2019re capable of uncaring selfishness and vicious cruelty as well. At the same time, there\u2019s something about them that is irreplaceable; a glimpse of gold in a world of green. Because a child or animal companion whose material, relational, and spiritual needs are taken care of has a joy that is unmatched in this world. It\u2019s the joy of bright eyes and big smiles, of feet pattering on the sidewalk, of a new discovery in every moment. It\u2019s the joy of innocence, both in the spiritual and in the moral sense.</p><p>I always smile when I see children, because I see this joy. Even when they must be quiet and well-behaved, I can see it hiding just below the surface, waiting for a chance to come out. And I feel joy for their joy. I feel sympathetic joy.</p><p>I also feel great joy when I see farm animals cared for in sanctuaries. Knowing that they will never be hurt (again), and knowing that they\u2019ll spend their lives happy and loved, and knowing that THIS IS WHAT I\u2019M FIGHTING FOR is what makes the fight worth it.</p><p>It is important to know that there is suffering, and that this may even predominate in the world. It is also vitally important to keep in mind that there is still joy and good in the world. This joy is like a candle that illuminates the darkness, for this joy is the joy we aim for in all sentient beings. We need causes we can fight for. We need something to remind us that hope\u2014in the sense of not giving up in trying to do better\u2014is always rational, no matter how dire the circumstances.</p><p>The far enemy of joy is envy. It\u2019s very easy to feel envious; I know I\u2019ve felt envious of people ranging from my friends to complete strangers. It\u2019s also very difficult to feel envious, both because of the unpleasantness of the feeling and because of the judgment we bring upon ourselves for feeling envy. We may want to feel happy at someone else\u2019s joy, and we may not be able to bring ourselves to that in that moment, and that\u2019s okay. I think the best response to envy is self-compassion; once one validates and attends to one\u2019s own suffering, one has the capability to turn outward and naturally feel joy for joy.</p><p>The near enemy of joy is intoxication or greed; in essence, it is craving. I believe this to be a subtler version of suffering, especially when considering the craving alone (and not the fulfillment of what is craved, though that could be argued to simply be a temporary release from the craving). Where joy is relaxed and contented, craving tends to be tight, tense, and seeking. This also gives an answer to the question of why one ought not to feel joy towards sadistic joy, for this is not joy but craving; compassion should be felt instead.</p><p>Personally, I also feel joy towards my own joy, in particular towards the joy I had in my younger years. I was very fortunate to have had a life that, up until the beginning of middle school, was relatively pleasant and which had many good experiences. Of course, it wasn\u2019t all good, and I have many happy memories from that time. I\u2019m happy I had that time of innocence, and I\u2019m happy others can have it, too.</p><h3>Equanimity (<i>Upekkha</i>)</h3><p>\u201cThe Oak stood proudly and fought against the storm, while the yielding Reeds bowed low. The wind redoubled in fury, and all at once the great tree fell\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u2014&nbsp;<i>The Oak and the Reed</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Equanimity is a sense of relaxed acceptance of what is. It is the ceasing of all resistance, as one might see in some in the moments before a death they know is coming.</p><p>The far enemy of equanimity is exertion and rigidity. Life appears to require exertion; when we are faced with threats, we become tense. We feel we must adhere to strict rules and schedules. When we are faced with a problem, our first instinct is to push back directly against it. We glorify this straining, this stretching of the self to the limit. Both the need for and the efficacy of this exertion are questionable. One might have had the experience of choking in a sport, where either&nbsp;<a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/reader/151162785?utm_source=linkout\"><u>overthinking</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=9c71b7e18cccf3d707dcb8222a9a5a50ac37aa3c\"><u>stress/tension</u></a> resulted in poor performance in crucial moments. The grasping for control leaves us powerless, and the quest for strength leaves us fragile. Only when we surrender control can we perform at our peak. In general, forcing is going to be less effective because it\u2019s pitting two opposing forces against one another, destroying or weakening both of them. You can strike a rock, and it will break, but strike water with the same force, and soon it will be as if nothing had happened.</p><p>The near enemy of equanimity is indifference. Indifference is why it\u2019s infuriating when someone tries to console you by saying that \u201cthis was part of God\u2019s plan\u201d or \u201ceverything happens for a reason\u201d. My perspective is that indifference is itself a form of exertion, because it is the resistance against connection with self and others, and a denial of what is true. When someone you love is dying, and you\u2019ve made peace with it, that doesn\u2019t equate to being indifferent to their plight. It doesn\u2019t mean that, if a doctor suddenly came in with a miracle cure, you would refuse. It simply means that, when all is said and done, you will bear what must be borne. Perhaps it is well-expressed in the Serenity Prayer: \u201cGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference\u201d.</p><p>To fully unpack the concept of equanimity, and such rich philosophical concepts as radical acceptance, Kierkegaard\u2019s&nbsp;<i>despair</i>, Camus\u2019s&nbsp;<i>defiance</i>, and Nietzsche\u2019s&nbsp;<i>amor fati</i>, will require a lot more writing than I can fit here. So\u2026 sorry for the cliffhanger. Hopefully you can accept it ;)</p><p>You can rest assured that I\u2019ll come back to this topic.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I know I\u2019m not the most qualified to speak on these things, and I\u2019ve only really seriously engaged with suffering-focused ideas for around a year. Nevertheless, I think it\u2019s worth putting out there because I believe that it\u2019s really important to maintain stability and to have the correct motivations. I also hope these reflections will be helpful to some people, if only because they\u2019ll know someone else other than themselves is thinking about these things. Knowing about massive suffering, in addition to being immensely burdensome in itself, can also be incredibly isolating. For one, because many others either cannot or will not understand it. And for another, because it\u2019s easier to react to suffering by isolating ourselves. And then there\u2019s the personal motivation; I know that it can be really difficult and depressing to bear with anything approximating the reality of this world, so I wanted to try my best to give people the tools to bear with that rather than just slapping them with the truth and leaving them to deal with it on their own. I wish only the very best for you, and I hope together we can alleviate the sufferings of many many sentient beings.</p>", "user": {"username": "Kenneth_Diao"}}, {"_id": "cnH3wRvecjqhDQYgx", "title": "My first conversation with Annie Altman", "postedAt": "2023-11-21T21:58:43.682Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "remmelt"}}, {"_id": "rGgxf3qNth2iqEsvv", "title": "The 2023 Giving What We Can Donor Lottery is now open", "postedAt": "2023-11-23T09:13:37.472Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/donor-lottery/\"><u>Giving What We Can Donor Lottery</u></a> is now open with a block size of $100,000 USD!&nbsp;</p><p>Interested in donor lotteries?

One very common view, perhaps the prevailing view, on how consciousness arises seems to be that consciousness is evoked whenever a physical system carries out a suitable computation. I don't know if this position has a name so I will call it the computational view of consciousness for the rest of the post. I am in no way a philosopher nor am I familiar with the great deal of thought that people have no doubt put into these issues but the computational view of consciousness seems to me to be quite a strange position to hold. Therefore, I would be very interested to learn about what others have had to say on the lines of argument I will describe here against this view.</p><h1>The Causal Influence of Mental Events</h1><p>My first reason for being skeptical of this view is that it seems to me to be at odds with the idea that mental events can have a causal influence on the physical world. That our behaviour is influenced by mental events seems to me hard to deny. Surely when I talk about being conscious, the fact that I am conscious is at least part of the cause of my talking about it. How could we have any conception of \"consciousness\" but for our direct experience of it? However, this seems to sit poorly with the claim that consciousness is only evoked by computations being carried out. After all, the operation of a computer can be explained in terms of logic gates, which can be understood in terms of simple mechanical laws, apparently leaving no place for any mental states evoked by the computer to influence the computer in turn<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8l2j50in4ro\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8l2j50in4ro\">[2]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>I have tried to formulate counter-arguments to the above but haven't yet succeeded in finding anything I find particularly convincing. The claim that mental events can have a causal influence on the physical world seems particularly hard to dispute. It just doesn't seem plausible to me that our brains could \"know\" that they had brought about mental events without being influenced by them somehow. However, the idea that the computational view of consciousness is incompatible with mental events influencing the physical world seems more open to attack. Perhaps we could argue that the brain carries out computations differently to a digital computer such that its operation can't be explained in terms of pieces governed by mechanical laws, like logic gates, so there is room for the influence of the mental events evoked by the brain's computational action to form an important part of the brain's operation in turn. However, by introducing a fundamental difference between the causal role played by mental events in the brain and the role they play in a digital computer, we seem to have at least violated the spirit of the computational view of consciousness and it would seem quite strange that brains were influenced by the mental events they bring about but digital computers weren't.</p><h1>How Is \"Carrying Out\" a Computation Defined?</h1><p>The other concern I have with the computational view of consciousness is that it's not clear to me that we can objectively say which physical systems are carrying out computations or which computations they are carrying out. When we say that a computer is performing a particular computation, is that not merely a matter of perspective? Imagine a physical system consisting of a clock and some number of beans. The only thing that changes as the system evolves in time is the number on the clock, which counts the number of seconds that have passed since some initial time.

It would therefore seem that, depending on our perspective, this very simple system could be seen as an implementation of whatever Turing machine we liked. Is it possible to come up with a sensible definition of what it means for a physical system to carry out a computation such that silly arguments like this don't work?</p><h1>Questions</h1><p>I have only begun to think about these issues so I would be keen to hear what people who have thought about these questions much more thoroughly have had to say. How do people who adhere to the computational view of consciousness respond to these kinds of arguments? Are they generally thought of as serious challenges?</p><p>Also, it would seem that nothing in our current understanding of the laws of physics that would predict the occurrence of mental events, let alone their having a causal influence on the physical world. Therefore, if mental events can indeed exert a causal influence on the physical world, it would seem that our current physical theories fail to predict not just mental phenomena but also physical phenomena that depend on the influence of mental events. Is there any consensus on whether this should be seen as an inadequacy of our current theories of physics and whether investigating the laws that govern such phenomena might be a promising route to better understand consciousness?</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fni7ivz3qofs\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefi7ivz3qofs\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>For instance, the question of whether we might create conscious entities via computational simulation and what their experiences would be like seems very important ethically.

We use cutting-edge psychotherapeutic and behavior change methods and deliver those via a layperson-guided self-help program. The format has shown to be as effective and engaging as professional 1:1 therapy in multiple meta-analyses while costing 3 times less in our case (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214782914000244\"><u>Baumeister et al., 2014</u></a>). We are not operating at full scale, using only a minimum viable product of our CBT program, but offer a \u201cback of the envelope\u201d cost-effectiveness estimate for that full-scale scenario below and in more detail with reasoning transparency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nt2U68Ab_KZ-joyEA0f9CMyucfPYcvA3-SmeCKLT4Vs/edit#gid=502154682.\"><u>in this sheet</u></a>.</p><p>By our estimations, after further iterations and scaling efforts as intended for 2024, we will likely be able to deliver our program to 500 participants yearly at a cost of ~$ 350/participant (including overhead costs). This would generate a total of&nbsp; ~100 yearly full-time equivalent (FTE) EAs or $5MM worth of work per year when Rethink Wellbeing is in operation. If just 10% of the value of this additional productivity is donated to top charities or to equally cost-effective activities, the program\u2019s overall cost-effectiveness will outperform <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell\u2019s top charities</a> with a cost of &lt;~$2,000 per life saved. Put in another way, if only one in ten participants would donate their additional income of ~$10,000, this would mean that two additional lives could be saved for a total of ~$3,500 (cost of the program for 10 participants)\u00b3. We are aware that this is more of a promising thought experiment based on the little data we have than a prediction with high certainty.&nbsp; We plan to increase confidence in this estimate through data gathered in 2024.&nbsp;</p><h2>Plan for 2024</h2><ul><li><strong>Q1:</strong> Iterate and expand program and make it more scalable via automation and delegation</li><li><strong>Q2 &amp; Q3:</strong> Run RCT to more accurately assess (cost)-effectiveness and be assessed by GiveWell (N~150)&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Q4:</strong> Deliver the program to more EAs (N~150), determine potential next high-impact audiences, grow the team&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Q3-Q4:</strong> Run pilot tests in new target groups of potential changemakers, selected from communities such as leaders, founders, and students</li></ul><h3><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Hs9X8LirL5GWTFNnN/udvxudj7gn8kljxf43zk\"></h3><p><br>Our current runway will end at the end of January 2024.

We shared this initial skepticism. To ensure reasonable accuracy, we meticulously analyzed our numbers, turning them upside down and inside out multiple times for a conservative and robust analysis. Additionally, three senior researchers independently reviewed our assumptions and reasoning. We're pleased to report that the cost-effectiveness analysis appears sound, and the results, thus far, are promising. Nonetheless, we remain committed to rigorously challenging our thinking and assumptions. If you have any questions or feedback, your input would be invaluable to us!<br>&nbsp;</p><h1>A Big Thank You</h1><p>.... goes to the reviewers of this post for all the helpful comments you made: Thijs Loggen, Stefan M\u00fcller, Justis Millis, Joel McGuire, Victor Wang, and Jennifer Schmitt!<br>... goes to all our funders, participants, facilitators, advisors, and other supporters for making this initiative happen.</p><p>Thank you for being a part of this journey to empower mental wellbeing. Let\u2019s flourish!&nbsp;</p><h1>Last but not least, take good care of yourself and the people around you!&nbsp;</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>\u00b2 We are aware of a potential selection bias for the latter two surveys but expect the prevalence to be at least as high as in the general population.<br><br>\u00b3 &nbsp;We work with the underlying assumption that productivity is related to outcomes such as salary and quality of work. Based on a standard working year of 2,000 hours (assuming full-time employment), a 6-hour-per-week increase over 1.5 years would result in a 25% salary uplift for the additional hours worked. This means the equation is more applicable for freelancers, students, and employees in EA organizations than for employees in non-EA organizations.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Inga"}}, {"_id": "HRrJnoqiqm2BbJHds", "title": "Forget marginal funding week, here's what I can do with 6H of your time.", "postedAt": "2023-11-22T11:13:21.369Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We're working towards treating mental illnesses for $2 per successful treatment.
