However, a survey of <a href=\"https://zenodo.org/record/4067919/files/BSL3_Labs_In_China.xlsx?download=1\">BSL-3 facilities in China</a> found that 53% of associated coronavirus-related Nature publications were produced by Wuhan-based labs between 2017 and 2019, and it is extremely implausible that Wuhan bears 50% of the risk for novel zoonotic virus emergence in all of China! (it's possible that the authors of that survey erred - the do seem ideologically committed to the lab leak theory). Furthermore, I have to the best of my ability evaluated arguments about the presence of the furin cleavage site in the SARS-CoV-2 genome and my conclusion is that it is around 5 times as likely to be present in the lab origin scenario (accounting the fact that the WIV is an author on a proposal to insert such sites into SARS-like coronaviruses; also, I consider anywhere from 1.1 to 20 times as likely to be plausible).

NSABB called for this kind of oversight throughout the research cycle (at least) as early as 2007,&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa02akmtijak\"><sup><a href=\"#fna02akmtijak\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and, in hindsight, it was pretty na\u00efve of me to think that this simple idea was new. In general, it's been a pretty humbling experience to read more of the literature and realise just how many of the arguments that I thought were novel based on their appearance in recent op-eds and tweets can be found in discussions from 10, 20, or even <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.72.6.1981\">50 years ago</a>.<br><br>Alright, one element of your post that I would've framed differently: You put a lot of emphasis on the <i>instrumental</i> benefits of nuanced discussion in the form of building trust and credibility, but I hope readers of your post also realise the <i>intrinsic</i> value of being more nuanced.</p><p>E.g., from the summary&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\"<i>[what you say] does impact how much you are trusted, whether or not you are invited back to the conversation, and thus the potential to make an impact</i>\"</p></blockquote><p>And the very last sentence:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;\"<i>Always make sure \u2018you\u2019re invited back to the table\u2019.</i>\"&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This is a great point, and I really do think it's possible to burn bridges and lose respect by coming across as ignorant or inflammatory. But getting the nuanced details wrong is <i>also</i> a recipe for getting solutions wrong! As you say, proper risk-benefit analysis for concrete dual-use research is almost always difficult, given that the research in question very often has some plausible upside for pandemic preparedness or health more generally.</p><p>And even if you know what specific research to draw red lines around, implementation is riddled with challenges: How do you design rules that won't be obsolete with scientific advances? &nbsp;How do you make criteria that won't restrict research that you didn't intend to restrict? How do you avoid inadvertent attention hazards from highlighting the exact kinds of research that seem the most risky? Let's say you've defined the perfect rules. Who should be empowered to make the tough judgment calls on what to prohibit? If you're limiting access to certain knowledge, who gets to have that access? And so on, and so on.<br><br>I do think there's value in strongly advocating for more robust dual-use oversight or lab biosafety, and (barring infohazard concerns), I think op-eds aimed at both policymakers and the general public can be helpful. It's just that I think such advocacy should be more in the tone of \"Biosecurity is important, and more work on it is urgently needed\" and less \"Biosecurity Is Simple, I Would Just Ban All GOF.\"&nbsp;<br><br>Bottom line, I especially like the parts of your post that encourage people to <i>be</i> more nuanced, not just <i>sound</i> more nuanced.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fna02akmtijak\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefa02akmtijak\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>From <a href=\"https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/mBio.01236-15\">Casadevall 2015</a>: <i>\"In addition to defining the type of research that should elicit heightened concern, the NSABB recommended that research be examined for DURC potential throughout its life span, from experimental conception to final dissemination of the results.\"</i></p></div></li></ol>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "jtm"}}, {"_id": "vCYaevEdDCrCnzTnh", "postedAt": "2023-03-03T10:04:49.986Z", "postId": "HCuoMQj4Y5iAZpWGH", "htmlBody": "<p>On \u201clearning from people outside EA and those who slightly disagree with EA views\u201d I highly recommend reading everything by Dr Filippa Lentzos: <a href=\"https://www.filippalentzos.com/\">https://www.filippalentzos.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Also, subscribe to the Pandora Report newsletter:<br>\n<a href=\"https://pandorareport.org/\">https://pandorareport.org/</a></p>\n<p>Global Biodefense was great but sadly seems to have become inactive: <a href=\"https://globalbiodefense.com/\">https://globalbiodefense.com/</a></p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "freedomandutility"}}, {"_id": "XyPXA7nrCCRsHxfMn", "postedAt": "2023-03-03T16:51:25.134Z", "postId": "HCuoMQj4Y5iAZpWGH", "htmlBody": "<p>Strong +1!!

This apply to essentially all financial companies, and require them to evaluate their clients and counterparties for money laundering risk. If a bank facilitates money laundering it can be punished for this even if it didn't want to do it; all that is required for AML violations is that the bank didn't try hard enough to avoid accidentally helping launder money. These regulations are a big deal, with very large number of people employed in their enforcement and large fines for violations. It is much easier to fine a bank than it is to fine the underlying money launderer. AML rules are effectively a way for governments, which are not really capable of catching money laundering, to outsource the expense and difficulty.</p><p>The equivalent here would be if medical equipment companies, reagent companies, lab animal companies had to do due diligence on researchers and were liable if they lacked sufficient processes to ensure they didn't sell supplies to researchers who performed dangerous experiments.

A company would be likely to be highly conservative in making these judgments, as they would capture none of the benefits of successful and informative GoF research, but would be punished for allowing overly risky or failed GoF research to go forward. In other words, companies would likely refuse to sell to GoF research entirely in order to minimize or eliminate their risk.</p><p>The problem is even more acute if the work of evaluating GoF research was foisted onto companies.

I agree with your point about being careful on terms, and thought it might be useful to collect a few definitions together in a comment.</p>\n<h3>DURC (Dual-Use Research of Concern)</h3>\n<p>DURC is defined differently by different organizations. The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/what-is-dual-use-research-of-concern\">WHO defines</a> it as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>research that is intended to provide a clear benefit, but which could easily be misapplied to do harm</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>while the definition given in the <a href=\"https://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse/Pages/USGOversightPolicy.aspx\">2012 US government DURC policy</a> is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>life sciences research that, based on current understanding, can be reasonably anticipated to provide knowledge, information, products, or technologies that could be directly misapplied to pose a significant threat with broad potential consequences to public health and safety, agricultural crops and other plants, animals, the environment, materiel, or national security</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>ePPP (enhanced Potential Pandemic Pathogen)</h3>\n<p>ePPP is a term (in my experience) mostly relevant to the US regulatory context, and was set out in the <a href=\"https://www.phe.gov/s3/dualuse/Documents/P3CO.pdf\">2017 HHS P3CO Framework</a> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A potential pandemic pathogen (PPP) is a pathogen that satisfies both of the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is likely highly transmissible and likely capable of wide and uncontrollable spread in human populations; and</li>\n<li>It is likely highly virulent and likely to cause significant morbidity and/or mortality in humans.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>An enhanced PPP is defined as a PPP resulting from the enhancement of the transmissibility\nand/or virulence of a pathogen. Enhanced PPPs do not include naturally occurring pathogens\nthat are circulating in or have been recovered from nature, regardless of their pandemic\npotential.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One way in which this definition has been criticized (quoting the recent <a href=\"https://osp.od.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/NSABB-Final-Report-Proposed-Biosecurity-Oversight-Framework-for-the-Future-of-Science.pdf\">NSABB report</a> on updating the US biosecurity oversight framework) is that \"research involving the enhancement of pathogens that do not meet the PPP definition (e.g., those with low or moderate virulence) but is anticipated to result in the creation of a pathogen with the characteristics described by the PPP definition could be overlooked.\"</p>\n<h3>GOF (Gain-of-Function)</h3>\n<p>GOF is not a term that I know to have a clear definition. In the linked <a href=\"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.00188-23\">Virology under the microscope</a> paper, examples range from making Arabidopsis (a small flowering model plant) more drought-resistant to making H5N1 (avian influenza) transmissible between mammals. I suggest avoiding this term if you can. (The paper acknowledges the term is fuzzily defined, citing <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02903-x\">The shifting sands of \u2018gain-of-function\u2019 research</a>.)</p>\n<h3>Biosafety, biosecurity, biorisk</h3>\n<p>The definitions you gave in the footnote seem solid, and similar to the ones I'd offer, though one runs into competing definitions (e.g. the definition provided for biosafety doesn't mention unintentional exposure). I will note that EA tends to treat \"biosecurity\" as an umbrella term for \"reducing biological risk\" in a way that doesn't reflect its usage in the biosecurity or public health communities. Also, as far as I can tell, <a href=\"https://www.biosecurity.gov.au/\">Australia means a completely different thing</a> by \"biosecurity\" than the rest of the English-speaking world, which will sometimes lead to confusing Google results.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "tessa"}}, {"_id": "v65rMK83QZWj4mEnD", "postedAt": "2023-03-07T21:48:55.936Z", "postId": "HCuoMQj4Y5iAZpWGH", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks!

Some broad thoughts in response:</p><p>Re</p><blockquote><p>My impression is that one of the key defenses that the Fauci/NIH/EcoHealth/etc. offered for their research in Wuhan was that it was <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2021/09/09/covid-origins-gain-of-function-research/\">technically not Gain of Function</a>, even if some parts of it might sound like Gain of Function to the layperson, which seems in tension with this claim. Do you think they were wrong about this?</p></blockquote><p>It's hard for me to go into detail on a public platform on this (just to be cautious to my job) but I can broadly say that there's a difference between research that is a) gaining a function, b) gain-of-function as defined by informal norms in the biomedical community, and c) what is formally DURC / GoF research as defined by U.S. government policy. The EcoHealth grants fall confusingly as or as not GoF depending on how GoF is defined.&nbsp;</p><p>Re</p><blockquote><p>Speaking as an outsider, the amount of regulation on what you refer to as ePPP (adding functionality to make diseases more dangerous) seems shockingly low. The <a href=\"https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mBio.00188-23?_ga=2.214861973.322453087.1677791919-1488878016.1667664275\">article you link to</a> tries to make it sound like there are a lot of safeguards, but it seems to me like virtually all the steps only apply if you are seeking federal funding. This is not a standard we accept in other areas! If you are making a car, or building a nuclear power plant, or running a bank or airline, you have to accept extremely intrusive regulation regardless of your funding, and for many things - like nuclear weapons or money laundering - US regulation has world-wide reach.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I fully agree! I think there are many concrete needs in this space including legal regulation over DURC /ePPP/GoF research in the U.S. particularly but also &nbsp;every country that practices such research. To achieve such regulation requires a ton of work, consensus building, and thought into what constructive regulation that captures risk while not alienating / shutting down an entire research field &nbsp;is tough and part of the nuances that I think we as a community need to work towards</p>", "parentCommentId": "W8nm4t6RGfrEqbz9s", "user": {"username": "ElikaSomani"}}, {"_id": "PqdBxRZnFEagwg7F7", "postedAt": "2023-03-17T20:26:19.720Z", "postId": "HCuoMQj4Y5iAZpWGH", "htmlBody": "<p>Great post!
