For example, any worker in the field of AI Safety, to the extent that her job depends on her productivity and cost-effectiveness, will lose both her income and status as the field progresses to include automation technology that can replace her capabilities. Even ad hoc automation methods (for example, writing software that monitors cost and power of compute using web-scraping and publicly available data) remove a bit of that status. In that way, the  AI Safety researcher loses status among her peers and her influence on policy that her peers direct. The only power left to the researcher is as an ordinary voter in a democracy.</p>\n<p>Dividing up and replacing the responsibilities for the capabilities Ci of an individual W1 can help an ad hoc approach involving technologies Ti corresponding to the capabilities of that worker. Reducing the association of the role with the status can dissolve the role and sometimes the worker's job who held that role. The role itself can disappear from the marketplace, along with the interests that it represents. For example, although artists have invested many years in their own talents, skills, and style, within a year they lost their status and income to some new AI software. I think artists have cause to defend their work from AI. The <em>artist</em> role won't disappear from the world of human employment entirely but the future of the role has been drastically reduced and has permanently lost a lot of what gave it social significance and financial attractiveness, unless the neo-luddites can defend paid employment in art from AI.</p>\n<p>Something similar can happen to AI Safety researchers, but will anyone object? <em>AI Safety researcher</em> worker capabilities and roles could be divided and dissolved into larger job roles held by fewer people with different titles, responsibilities, and allegiances over time as the output of the field is turned into a small, targeted knowledge-base and suite of tools for various purposes.</p>\n<p>If you are in fact arguing from principle, then you have an opportunity to streamline the process of AI safety research work through efforts such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>collecting AI Safety research work on an ongoing basis as it appears in different venues and making it publicly accessible</li>\n<li>annotating the research work to speed up queries for common questions such as:\n<ul>\n<li>what are controversies in the field, that is, who disagrees with whom about what and why?</li>\n<li>what is the timeline of development of research work?</li>\n<li>what literature address specific research questions (for example, on compute developments, alternative technologies, alignment approaches, specific hypotheses in the field, prediction timelines)?</li>\n<li>what are summaries of current work?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>paying for public hosting of AI Safety information of this type as well as ad hoc tools (for example, the compute power tracker)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm sure you could come up with better ideas to remove AI Safety worker grant money from those workers, and commensurately benefit the cost-effectiveness of AI Safety research. I've read repeatedly that the field needs workers and timely answers, automation seems like a requirement or alternative to reduce the financial and time constraints on the field but also to serve its purpose effectively.</p>\n<p>While artists could complain that AI art does a disservice to their craft and reduces the quality of art produced, I think the tools imitating those artists have developed to the point that they serve the purpose and artists know it and so does the marketplace. If AI Safety researchers are in a position to hold their jobs a little while longer, then they can assist the automation effort to end the role of AI Safety researchers and move on to other work that much sooner! I see no reason to hold you back from applying the principle that you seem to hold, though I don't hold it myself.</p>\n<p>AI Safety research is a field that will hopefully succeed quickly and end the need for itself within a few decades. It's workers can move on, presumably to newer and better things. New researchers in the field can participate in automation efforts and then find work in related fields, either in software automation elsewhere or other areas such as service work for which consumers still prefer a human being. Supposedly the rapid deployment of AGI in business will grow our economies relentlessly and at a huge pace, so there should be employment opportunities available (or free money from somewhere).</p>\n<p>If any workers have a reason to avoid neo-ludditism, it would have to be AI Safety researchers, given their belief in a future of wealth, opportunity, and leisure that AI help produce. Their own unemployment would be just a blip of however long before the future they helped manifest rescues them. Or they can always find other work, right? After all they work on the very technology depriving others of work.

On this forum, you'll only find some information by the author's name if you know that the author wrote it and you're willing to search through 100's of entries by that author. I suspect, from my own time searching with different options,  that most of what's available on this forum is not read, cited, or easily accessible. The karma system does not reflect documentation, research, or relevance standards. The combination of the existing search and karma system is less effective in a research knowledge-base.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>2. the library:</strong> library scientists are trained to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>build a knowledge-base.</li>\n<li>curate knowledge.</li>\n<li>follow content development to seek out new material.</li>\n<li>acquire new material.</li>\n<li>integrate it into the knowledgebase (indexing, linking).</li>\n<li>follow trends in automation.</li>\n<li>assist in document searches.</li>\n<li>perform as oracles, answering specific questions as needed.</li>\n<li><strong>TIP:</strong> Library scientists could help any serious effort to build an AGI Safety knowledge-base and automate use of its services.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>3.  with automation:</strong> You could take this forum and add automation (either software or paid mechanical turks) to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>write summaries.</li>\n<li>tag posts.</li>\n<li>enforce documentation standards.</li>\n<li>annotate text (for example, annotating any prediction statistics offered in any post or comment).</li>\n<li>capture and archive linked multimedia material.</li>\n<li>link wiki terms to their use in documents.</li>\n<li>verify wiki glossary meanings against meanings used in posts or comments.</li>\n<li>create new wiki entries as needed for new terms or usages.</li>\n<li><strong>NOTE:</strong> the discussion forum format creates more redundant information rather than better citations, as well as divergence of material from any specific purpose or topic that is intended for the forum.

It hosts interesting discussions. Occasionally, actual research shows up on it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>4. with extreme automation:</strong> A tool like chatGPT is unreliable or prone to errors (for example, in programming software), but when guided and treated as imperfect, it can perform in an automated workflow.  For example, it can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>provide text summaries.</li>\n<li>be part of automation chains that:\n<ul>\n<li>provide transcripts of audio.</li>\n<li>provide audio of text.</li>\n<li>provide diagrams of relationships.</li>\n<li>graphs data.</li>\n<li>draw scenario pictures or comics.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>act as a writing assistant or editor.\n<strong>TIP:</strong> Automation is not a tool that people should only employ by choice. For example, someone who chooses to use an accounting ledger and a calculator rather than Excel is slowing down an accounting team's performance.<br>\n<strong>CAUTION:</strong> Once AI enter the world of high-level concept processing, their errors have large consequences for research. Their role should be to assist human tasks, as cognitive aids, not as human replacements, at least until they are treated as having equivalent potential as humans, and are therefore subject to the same performance requirements and measurements as humans.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Higher level analysis</h3>\n<p>The ideas behind improving cost-effectiveness of production include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>standardizing:</strong> take a bunch of different work methods, find the common elements, and describe the common elements as unified procedures or processes.</li>\n<li><strong>streamlining:</strong> examining existing work procedures and processes, identifying redundant or non-value-added work, and removing it  from the workflow by various means.</li>\n<li><strong>automating:</strong> using less skilled human or faster/more reliable machine labor to replace steps of expert or artisan work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Standardizing research is hard, but AGI Safety research seems disorganized, redundant, and slow right now. At the highest chunk level, you can partition AGI Safety development into education and research, and partition research into models and experiments.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>education</li>\n<li>research models</li>\n<li>research experiments</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The goal of the knowledge-base project is to streamline education and research of models in the AGI Safety area. Bumming around on lesswrong or finding someone's posted list of resources is a poor second to a dedicated online curated library that offers research services. The goal of additional ad hoc tools should be to automate what researchers now do as part of their model development. A further goal would be to automate experiments toward developing safer AI, but that is going outside the scope of my suggestions.</p>\n<h2>Caveats</h2>\n<p>In plain language, here's my thoughts on pursuing a project like I have proposed. Researchers in any field worry about grant funding, research trends, and professional reputation. Doing anything quickly is going to cross purposes with others involved, or ostensibly involved, in reaching the same goal. The more well-defined the goal, the more people will jump ship, want to renegotiate, or panic. Once benchmarks and milestones are added, financial commitments get negotiated and the threat of funding bottlenecks ripple across the project.   As time goes on, the funding bottlenecks manifest, or internal mismanagement blows up the project. This is a software project, so the threat of failure is real. It is also a research project without a guaranteed outcome of either AGI Safety or AGI, adding to the failure potential. Finally, the field of AGI Safety is still fairly small and not connected to income potential long-term, meaning that researchers might abandon an effective knowledge-base project for lack of interest, perhaps claiming that the problem \"solved itself\" once AGI become mainstream, even if <em>no</em> AGI Safety goals were actually accomplished.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "KK9B96mCHJCpbReeB", "user": {"username": "Noah Scales"}}, {"_id": "xcPbHPKXmhGFYjG5q", "postedAt": "2022-12-29T13:55:05.333Z", "postId": "3yojNGhTXAydhfkNg", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>While I sympathize with the artists who will lose their income, I'm not persuaded by the general argument.

My background is from organising climate protests, and I think EAs have a bit of a blindspot when it comes to valuing advocacy. So it's good to have this discussion. However, I do disagree on a few points.<br><br>1. <u>Just Ask:</u> In broad strokes, I think people tend to overestimate exactly how unreasonable and persistent initial objections will be. My simplest rebuttal would be: <u>How do you know these advocates would even disagree with your approach?</u> An approach I'm considering now is to find a decent AI Governance policy proposal, present it to the advocates explaining how it solves their problem and see who says yes. If half of them say no, you work with the other half. Before assuming the \"neo-Luddites\" won't listen to reason, shouldn't you ... ask? Present them with options? I don't see why it's not at least worth reaching out to potential allies, and I don't see why it's an irredeemable sin to be angry at something with no clear solutions, when no one has presented a solution. It's perhaps ironic the assumptions given here.<br><br><u>2. Counterfactuals</u> I think by most estimates, anti-AI advocacy only grows from here. Having a lot of structurally unemployed angry people is historically a recipe for trouble. You then have to consider that reactionary responses will happen regardless of whether <i>\"we align with them\". </i>If they are as persistently unreasonable as you say they are, they will force bad policy regardless. They will influence mainstream discourse towards their views, and be loud enough to crowd out our <i>\"more reasonable\"</i> views. I just think it makes a lot of sense to engage these groups early on, and make an earnest effort to make our case. Because the counterfactual is that they get bad policies passed without our input.<br><br><u>3. False dichotomy of advocates and researchers</u> I speak more generally here. In my time in climate risk, everyone had an odd fixation on separating climate advocates and researchers.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhehgcir525g\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhehgcir525g\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I don't think this split was helpful for epistemics or strategy overall. Because then you had scientists who had all the solutions and epistemics that the public/policymakers generally ignored out of lack of engagement, and the advocates who started latching onto poorly-informed and counterproductive radical agendas, and were constantly rebutted with <i>\"why are we listening to you clueless youngsters and not the scientists (who we ignore anyway)\".</i> It was just a constant headache to have two subgroups needlessly divide themselves while the clock ran down. Like sure, the advocates were ... not the most epistemically rigorous. And the scientists generally struggled to put across their concerns. But I'd greatly prefer if everyone valued more communication/coordination, and not less.<br><br>And for my sanity's sake, I'd like the AI risk community to not repeat this dynamic.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnhehgcir525g\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefhehgcir525g\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I suspect most of this dichotomy was not made in good faith, but simply by people uncomfortable with the premise of anthropogenic climate change and throwing out fallacies to discredit any arguments they're confronted with in their daily lives.</p></div></li></ol>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Minh Nguyen"}}, {"_id": "ohdoM4vNjgwCEmugY", "postedAt": "2022-12-29T21:44:25.469Z", "postId": "3yojNGhTXAydhfkNg", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>This seems like an area in which utilitarianism should be bounded by deontology.</p></blockquote><p>I'm confused because I think precisely the opposite is true.</p><p>If I were applying a deontological framework to automation, I'd perhaps first point out that there's an act/omission asymmetry in using technology.

I'm curious how you will proceed.</p>\n<p>I'm ignorant of whether AGI Safety will contribute to safe AGI or AGI development. I suspect that researchers will shift to capabilities development without much prompting. I worry that AGI Safety is more about AGI enslavement. I've not seen much defense or understanding of rights, consciousness, or sentience assignable to AGI. That betrays the lack of concern over social justice and related worker's rights issues. The only scenarios that get attention are the inexplicable \"kill all humans\" scenarios, but not the more obvious \"the humans really mistreat us\" scenarios. That is  a big blindspot in AGI Safety.</p>\n<p>I was speculating about how the research community could build a graph database of AI Safety information alongside a document database containing research articles, CC forum posts and comments, other CC material from the web, fair use material, and multimedia material. I suspect that the core AI Safety material is not that large and far far less than AI Capabilities material. The graph database could provide more granular representation of data and metadata and so a richer representation of the core material  but that's an aside.</p>\n<p>A quick experiment would be to represent a single AGI Safety article in a document  database, add some standard metadata and linking, and then go further.</p>\n<p>Here's how I'd do it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>take an article.</li>\n<li>capture article metadata (author, date, abstract, citations, the typical stuff)</li>\n<li>establish glossary word choices.</li>\n<li>link glossary words to outside content.</li>\n<li>use text-processing to create an article summary.

It will be easier to query, contrast, and combine their contents in various ways.</p>\n<p>Some article databases online already offer useful tools for browsing work, but leave it to the researcher to answer questions requiring meaning interpretation of article contents. That could change.</p>\n<p>If you could get library scientists involved and some money behind that project, it could generate an educational resource fairly quickly. My vision does go further than educating junior researchers, but that would require much more investment, a well-defined goal, and the participation of experts in the field.</p>\n<p>I wonder whether AI Safety is well-developed enough to establish that its purpose is tractable. So far, I have not seen much more than:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>expect AGI soon</li>\n<li>AGI are dangerous</li>\n<li>AGI are untrustworthy</li>\n<li>Current AI tools pose no real danger (maybe)</li>\n<li>AGI could revolutionize everything</li>\n<li>We should or will make AGI</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The models do provide evidence of existential danger, but not evidence of how to control it. There's a downside to automation: technological unemployment; concentration of money and  political power (typically); societal disruption; increased poverty. And as I mentioned, AGI are not understood in the obvious context of exploited labor. That's a worrisome condition that, again, the AGI Safety field is clearly not ready to address.
