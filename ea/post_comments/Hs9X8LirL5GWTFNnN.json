I know CBT is more about providing thinking tools rather than giving concrete advice on what to do/try, but might there be a risk that people who take part will feel like they are expected to show a productivity increase? Would you still recommend to EA clients to take time off generously if someone is having burnout symptoms?

I hope you allow me to quote our program manager, Sam. She crafted a beautifully phrased answer to something similar in a former post:<br><br>\"I\u2019m the Mental Health Program Manager at Rethink Wellbeing, and I\u2019d like to offer my perspective on framing the program as a way to increase productivity. My thoughts are my own, not an official RW statement, but I have given my colleagues a chance to review this message before sending it.</p><p>I agree that basing one\u2019s self-worth on one\u2019s productivity can be a recipe for poor mental health (and rarely is effective at increasing productivity!).[...]</p><p>Despite agreeing with you, there are several reasons why RW highlights productivity in some of our marketing materials.</p><ul><li>Many members of the EA community who struggle with mental health problems are very motivated to increase their productivity (see, e.g., the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/itR4a9x5vCDr8bgPf/2023-ea-mental-health-and-productivity-survey-results\"><u>EA mental health survey results</u></a>, under \u201cTopics people struggle with or would like to improve the most\u201d), so emphasizing this as a possible benefit might encourage people to take care of themselves.&nbsp;</li><li>Sometimes members of the EA community don\u2019t feel like they \u201cdeserve\u201d to engage in self-care for their own sake. If we note the possible benefit to others, it might alleviate some guilt about investing time in one\u2019s own well-being.&nbsp;</li><li>I believe that&nbsp;<i>everyone in the world</i> deserves access to a program like this one (or whatever tools for mental well-being are appropriate for them). But resources are limited. People in the EA community are no more or less deserving than others, but as Jason notes, we can justify prioritizing support to this community if there\u2019s a multiplier effect because it allows them to do more good. Taking into account the productivity / impact increase is important for making strategic decisions when calculating the potential impact of such an intervention; plus, EA funders will want to see that RW is keeping its eye on productivity as an outcome metric.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>With all that said, because we agree that obsessing about impact is often harmful, we&nbsp;<i>aren\u2019t&nbsp;</i>planning to emphasize productivity as a goal throughout the program. We are measuring it as one outcome, since it is a meaningful part of flourishing, even if just one; we also may&nbsp;<i>briefly&nbsp;</i>invite people to reflect on the effects of mental health on productivity if that is an effective source of motivation for them. But during the core of the program, we want to give people a chance to work on exactly this: the dysfunctional relationship they may have with productivity and impact, such as believing one needs to be productive, or close to perfect to be worthy.<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cZwQWeThqgXxmuFpG/apply-for-the-ea-mental-wellbeing-summer-program#fnwedekb0bit\"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p><p>Talking about productivity is a way of getting people in the door by addressing a common core concern for EA community members. However, our model is that helping people increase their well-being, including developing a well-rounded life and engaging in self-care, should have a side effect of increasing their capacity to do good for others \u2026 without needing to focus on it or put any pressure on people. Rather, we hope to alleviate pressure. And participation in the program does not \u201cobligate\u201d people to do any particular EA work or change the world.</p><p>I expect that the team will continue to reflect on how to walk this tightrope in our marketing. It\u2019s tough to get it right, because the messaging lands different ways with different people, so feedback like yours is incredibly valuable.
