EA thankfully is mostly apolitical right now, and going for more developed aesthetics threatens that apoliticality, which is necessary if you want to be normatively and empirically uncertain. It's similar in nature to this comment in your previous post here: <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JQyacxvzoH3Eo4GPo/guided-by-the-beauty-of-one-s-philosophies-why-aesthetics#comments\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JQyacxvzoH3Eo4GPo/guided-by-the-beauty-of-one-s-philosophies-why-aesthetics#comments</a> (Sorry for not pointing to it exactly.)</p>\n<p>This failure mode is so serious and so common such that any efforts that effect that apoliticality need to be very scrutinized first, since there's a whole lot of downside risk, and not too much upside to stronger aesthetics.

It's prone to getting tied in knots and projecting superficial readings onto the situation that don't make any sense. It could be onto something.. but I'm never sure.
