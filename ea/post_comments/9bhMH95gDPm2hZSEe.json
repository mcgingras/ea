re; \"on a long enough timeline\" and \"not a useful claim to make\": The timeline indicated in the claim is \"up to appx 1000 years\". &nbsp;Insofar as humanity has already been on the earth 100X that, and could presumably be around (assuming the absence of tech) for at least that much longer, the stated claim differential is meaningful. &nbsp;And then there is life itself, which would presumably last at least another 500 million years, again when assuming the counterfactual of a complete absence of tech. &nbsp;Overall, this feels like a 'tl;dr', obviating important details.</p><p>2A; \"Hard to parse\" does not directly imply \"not epistemically warranted\". &nbsp;To state otherwise would be an equivocation. &nbsp;To make an assessment of whether 'warranted' or not, would be to have parsed the argument(s), and then evaluated the premises, and correctness/appropriateness of the transforms, etc. &nbsp;Otherwise, until an actual valid parse has been done, all that can be known to the reader (and observers) is that \"claims have been made\".</p><p>Nor does \"hard to parse\" directly imply 'not valid' (ie; correctness) and/or 'not sound' (ie; relevance). &nbsp;Code can be hard to read, and still be correctly executed on a computer to accomplish some practical real world purpose.</p><p>Also, 'hard to parse' is a presentation concern, and thus a social issue, rather than a logical issue. &nbsp;Ie, it is more about rhetoric, rather than about reason, rationality, and truth. &nbsp;While in social process, both matter, they matter in different and in largely non-overlapping ways. &nbsp;The concerns stated (and the associated claims) need to be kept separate. &nbsp;That is merely proper discipline, and anything otherwise is probably just politics (ie, is not really about cooperation in the interest of identifying important relevant truths). &nbsp;Where possible, certainty is always of interest, for its own sake. &nbsp;And it cannot be obtained by any form of rhetoric.</p><p>1B; In regards to 'strong claims about X' and 'thousands of years into the future', there is nothing <i>inherently</i> impossible, reasonable, or impractical about any such conjunction. &nbsp;The heuristic of being a-priori skeptical about any claim in that form is often warranted, but not universally. &nbsp;The interesting cases are the exceptions. &nbsp;To assume, without additional examination (parse), which such claims are to be rejected without further review is simply to say \"I did not read and evaluate the argument\" (and therefore do not know for sure), and not that \"the argument is for sure incorrect\" (based on what, exactly?).</p><p>2B; It is in this sense that Remmelt has shown up differently than most: he spent more than 6 months carefully going over (actually parsing) and challenging -- and attempting to reject -- every single aspect of the arguments I presented. &nbsp;This happened until he had convinced <i>himself</i> as to their merit -- and <strong>not</strong> because I convinced him. &nbsp;Like nearly everyone else, he really really did not want to be convinced. &nbsp;He was as skeptical as anyone. &nbsp;We both had to be patient with one another -- me to write responses -- and him to actually read (parse) and think up new (relevant) questions to ask. &nbsp;This history is largely the reason, that he recommends that people read,. and do more of their own work -- it is the adult standard he held for himself, and he naturally has that expectation as a bias regarding others. &nbsp;At this point, even though <i>no one</i> likes the conclusion, we both feel that it is overall better to know an uncomfortable truth than to remain blind.</p><p>3A; You ask Remmelt to \"reconsider the infallibility of the person\" rather than to 'maybe reassess the correctness of the argument'. &nbsp;The infallibility request seems to hide another subtle equivocation and an ad-hominem. &nbsp;We both know that I am human. &nbsp;What matters is if the argument is actually correct/relevant. &nbsp;We all know has very little to do with myself as a person. &nbsp;To implicitly suggest that he is 'deluded' because you are skeptical (in the absence of actual neutrally interested evaluation) is not really an especially 'truth seeking' action.</p><p>3B; We are both aware that my style of writing, argumentation, and conversing is not easy to read (or parse). &nbsp;It is agreed that this is unfortunate, for everyone, including us. &nbsp;My (necessarily temporary) offer to write at all (and to give of my time to do so -- to assist with others understanding or misunderstanding, and/or to add clarity, where possible, etc) is not infinite, indefinite, or without actual cost, effort, and loss. &nbsp;So I tend to be a bit sparing with where and when, and with who, I will give such time and attention, and concentrate my \"argumentation efforts\", in fewer places, and with fewer people. Usually those who have done a lot of their own work at their own initiative, with patience, clarity, discipline, etc, and to not be showing up with various warning flags of motivated reasoning, actions of rhetoric, known logical falsities presented as truths, etc.</p><p>My choices with respect to maybe providing rebuttals to any adverse commentary on a public forum, remain my own, on a volunteer basis. &nbsp;If it happens that I do not choose to respond (or cannot, due to disability), that does not in itself \"make\" the underlying argument any more or less valid, or relevant, it simply affects whether or not you (the reader, the observer) happen to understand it (as per your own choices regarding your investment of time, etc). &nbsp;That means, mostly, that if you want clarity, you will probably have to seek it yourself, at your own effort, as Remmelt has done. To at least some extent your skepticism, and how you handle it, is your choice. &nbsp;We all know that it is all unfortunate, unpleasant -- the whole package of claims -- but that just is the way it is, at this moment, at least for now. &nbsp;</p><p>Adults will do what is necessary, even if it is hard; even if all of the children around them will ever continue to want live in some sort of easy fantasy.</p>", "parentCommentId": "nzgbYBpuWLGmoWwwb", "user": {"username": "flandry19"}}, {"_id": "bJKxjGfsbfTSz9Ese", "postedAt": "2023-10-05T07:49:46.102Z", "postId": "9bhMH95gDPm2hZSEe", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Forrest, thanks for replying</p><p>I want to make it clear that I bear you or Remmelt no ill will at all, and I apologise if my comment gave the opposite impression in any way.&nbsp;</p><p>For an actual argument regarding 1A &amp; 1B, I suppose I'd point towards David Deutsch's argument that predicting the future orbit of the planet Earth depends both on our projections of planetary physics (~rock solid) <i>but also </i>the future growth of human knowledge, including social knowledge (~basically impossible).

So, yes, my post needs to be re-written, and clarified, and made more accessible, to a wider range of people, and use less opaque language, and not so many tangents, and be easier to parse, etc. &nbsp;Hopefully I will have time for it in the next few weeks.</p><p>As such, because there has been less time for anyone other than myself to have sufficient exposure to the underlying logic, basis, and rationale, I am thus here posting a at least a partial defense of it, as myself, rather than attempting to be relying on anyone else to do it (because it is right to do, etc). &nbsp;Given its rather quickly written nature, not discussing all of the cases and conditions, etc, it will probably get more than its fair share of critiques on this (and other) forums, where it has ended up getting posted. &nbsp;At least I will get some feedback on what sort of things I will need to add to make it more defensible.</p><p>However, obviously, since there are probably far more people with critical views on each large forum like this, and also people who have more time to post than I have time to answer, there is a very good chance that I will not be able to make the reasoning as clear as I would like, to as many responders as I would need to, and thus that there will therefore be a lot of unaligned misunderstandings. &nbsp;Ie, in any 'intellectual evaluative' public space, it is far more likely that negative reactive emotional judgements would occur, proportional to both the social scale and the stakes -- which may seem surprising, but actually makes sense when considering the self definition and skillset(s) of that demographic.</p><p>Thus, all that I can ask in the interim is for people to please be at least a little patient and tolerant while we compose at least some better way to make it more easily understandable as to why <i>it may be the case</i> that we can actually predict <i><strong>some</strong></i> relevant aspects of what would <i>very likely</i> necessarily happen over larger scales/volumes of human social and technical process over longer time intervals, <i>despite</i> the otherwise appearance of this <i>usually</i> being impossible/unreasonable.</p><p>Thank you.</p>", "parentCommentId": "bJKxjGfsbfTSz9Ese", "user": {"username": "flandry19"}}]
