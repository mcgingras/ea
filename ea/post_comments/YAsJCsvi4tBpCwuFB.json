The demand for exposure to FTX surely far outstripped the \u2018supply\u2019.</p>\n<p>All I\u2019m saying is that as a professional investor this is extremely common and uncomplicated, especially for hot venture companies.  I have friends close friends who took tens of millions off the table in 21 through secondaries in far less exciting and earlier stage businesses. On if my neighbors works  at StepStone and entirely focused on venture secondaries.</p>\n<p>My broader actual point was this: I don\u2019t blame Will or Nick or any of the FF people for this - this stuff is super niche financial markets minutia. My broader point/concern is around governance, financial controls, and funding strategy at EA orgs (looking in from the outside and reading a few case reports). If FF had a CFO they should/would have flagged the concentration risk and developed some proposals immediately. At the most basic level I just want you guys to hire some good finance people!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "EuSonQKahzpwQvxnW", "user": {"username": "Daedalus"}}, {"_id": "ggSGQ9aTdnNcfTg8h", "postedAt": "2022-11-17T12:31:00.565Z", "postId": "YAsJCsvi4tBpCwuFB", "htmlBody": "<p>Fully agreed.</p>", "parentCommentId": "mQfFoWXhJ7GuLgr2G", "user": {"username": "Davidmanheim"}}, {"_id": "aFYPRPDxC8Xrzxm7c", "postedAt": "2022-11-18T21:00:54.187Z", "postId": "YAsJCsvi4tBpCwuFB", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>When FTX raised $420 million from an array of big-name investors in October last year, the cryptocurrency exchange said the money would help grow the business, improve user experience and allow it to engage more with regulators.</p><p>Left unmentioned was that nearly three-quarters of the money, $300 million, went instead to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who sold some of his personal stake in the company, according to FTX financial records reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and people familiar with the transaction.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-cashed-out-300-million-during-funding-spree-11668799774?mod=hp_lead_pos4</p>", "parentCommentId": "TmySEmXd6yQjuqCjK", "user": {"username": "Daedalus"}}]
