For a BLL of 2.4 - 10 \u03bcg/dl, IQ loss from 1 \u03bcg/dl increase may be close to 0.5, but above 10, it's closer to 0.2 per 1 \u03bcg/dl increase, and above 20, closer to 0.1. Average BLL in Bangladesh seem to be <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/en/press-releases/third-worlds-children-poisoned-lead-bangladesh-fourth-most-seriously-hit-terms#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Institute%20of,eleventh%20highest%20in%20the%20world.\">around 6.8 \u03bcg/dl</a>, though amongst residents living near turmeric sources of lead, it could plausibly be (much) higher, and thus a lower IQ gain will be had from a 1 &nbsp;\u03bcg/dl reduction in lead.</li><li><strong>Income loss per IQ points loss</strong> - The CEA assumes that 1 IQ point loss leads to a 2.1% reduction in income. However, some work by GiveWell (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qVCZrldHhDI3MNSVfBV66O5WjF-Xzi2dtBNasyq2BII/edit#heading=h.jb5m3s711csx\">here</a>) suggests this might be closer to 0.67% (and there might be some reasons to discount this further, e.g. due to replicability concerns)</li><li><strong>Replicability of intervention</strong> - as noted in the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aFYduhr9pztFCWFpz/preliminary-analysis-of-intervention-to-reduce-lead-exposure#Where_could_our_analysis_go_wrong_\">text</a>, it's hard to estimate how much the Bangladesh program reduced lead exposure by. If Bangladesh's average BLL level is <a href=\"https://www.unicef.org/bangladesh/en/press-releases/third-worlds-children-poisoned-lead-bangladesh-fourth-most-seriously-hit-terms#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Institute%20of,eleventh%20highest%20in%20the%20world.\">around 6.8 \u03bcg/dl</a>, then a 1.64 reduction from the intervention implies this intervention cut BLL by 25% for half of children in Bangladesh. This is great, but I can see several reasons why this may not be informative of future programs' cost-effectiveness<ol><li>Maybe Turmeric is much more prevalent in rural Bangladesh than other regions</li><li>Maybe it was unusually easy to get regulators to agree to introduce / enforce standards</li><li>Maybe it was unusually easy to get producers to switch away from lead chromate</li></ol></li></ol><p>Each of these reasons on their own is fairly weak, but the likelihood of at least one being true gives us reason to discount future cost-effectiveness analyses. More generally, we might expect some regression to the mean w.r.t reducing exposure from tulmeric - maybe everything went right for this particular program, but this is unlikely to be true in future programs. To be clear, there are likely also reasons that this analysis is too pessimistic, and thus on net it may be the case that cost-effectiveness remains at $1/ DALY (or even better). Nonetheless, I think it's good to be cautious, since $1 / DALY implies this program was &gt;800x better than cash transfers and &gt;80x better than GiveWell's top charities - a strong claim to make (though still possible!)</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "22tom"}}, {"_id": "Y78nQ2DFckh9ZjNjA", "postedAt": "2023-08-29T16:05:03.502Z", "postId": "aFYduhr9pztFCWFpz", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks so much for your response! &nbsp;This is excellent feedback and we\u2019re grateful for the interest. &nbsp;</p><p>1. &nbsp;IQ loss: We did go to the experts to estimate based on actual numbers, so we\u2019re reasonably confident about this. &nbsp;And even if it were out by 50 percent, the results are still strong. &nbsp;</p><p>2. &nbsp;Income loss by IQ has been a moving target in the literature. &nbsp;It could be at that lower end -- we used a mid-point of studies. &nbsp;Again, even if we are out by half, the results are positive. &nbsp;</p><p>3. &nbsp;Replicability is certainly an issue. &nbsp;We do know that turmeric is used throughout the country anecdotally, and that other sources of lead are important in Bangladesh (aluminum pots, contaminated sites, perhaps fish). Additionally, we know that no other interventions have been undertaken - expect for a small site clean up that will not impact nationally. &nbsp;We\u2019re happy to report that the government is very engaged and committed, and have asked WB for their support for these other sources. These conditions might be less available in other countries, including Central Asia, India (northern states), Balkans (some) Middle East (some), and North Africa. &nbsp;Not all countries have the issue, but many do. &nbsp;So, yes, viability of replication of this solution will be mixed.

I'm enthusiastic about the lead reduction work Pure Earth and LEEP have been doing.<br><br>Some points for consideration:<br><br>(1) It may be that GBD underestimates the health burden - specifically, the loss in cognitive ability - insofar as the GBD examines the increased risk of intellectual disability and the consequence burden; but there is also a case to be made that loss of cognitive ability by the overall population <i>that nonetheless does not put one below the threshold of intellectual disability</i> would still be a significant loss that a fuller analysis would want to take into consideration.<br><br>(2) I would agree that 8 years is conservative. Generally, to discount for counterfactual introduction, I'm a fan of a applying an annual discount when calculating the aggregate multi-year benefits, rather than coming up with an estimate of \"years brought forward\" - partly because it's easier to calculate (by using data on past introductions of a policy etc, and comparing that against the total number of country-years in which introduction could have potentially happened), but also partly because I worry that the \"bringing forward\" model may overestimate the benefit if your other temporal discounts are significant enough. Given the lack of past policies on adulterated tumeric elimination, I would probably use the rate of introduction of anti-lead paint regulations as a baseline (and adjusting downwards given dissimilarities). In any case, I doubt the discount will be &gt;=1%, since even soda taxes (a far more widespread policy) is barely being introduced at that rate.<br><br>(3) A quick analysis (regressing DALY burden per capita of lead exposure in Bangladesh over time) suggests (surprisingly, to me) potential growth over time; this may be worth looking more into, and taking into consideration on top of the population growth effect.<br><br>(4) I think my biggest concern is just the intervention effect size given (a) reliance on pre-post data with significant potential for endogeneity and confounding. (b) I also suspect the intervention is disproportionately effective here given lead exposure in Bangladesh is extraordinarily high (9th higher per capita).<br><br>(5) Final thing that jumped out at me is the issue of how lead poisoning isn't reversible (at least from quickly scanning the old GBD Comparative Quantification of Health Risks report, so I don't think modelling the intervention as having an impact after 30 years makes sense - rather, the benefit trickles in on a year-by-year basis, as new cohorts are (counterfactually) not poisoned, and have better health/income outcomes. I can't say for sure without having done a deeper analysis, but I suspect this would improve your results, because frontloading benefits tend to increase the overall cost-effectiveness when discounts are high (and you have that 4% discount from GiveWell).<br><br>Hope that's helpful, and do let me know if you want additional inputs!</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Joel Tan"}}, {"_id": "8WHf6CtgDvXCmdjq4", "postedAt": "2023-09-26T13:27:20.890Z", "postId": "aFYduhr9pztFCWFpz", "htmlBody": "<p>Great curation.
