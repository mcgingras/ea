Recently I have also been thinking about this and just posted a short article on <a href=\"https://glozematrix.substack.com/p/make-metta-easier?r=dzkl0&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=copy\">how to make metta meditation a bit easier </a>for people who struggle with it. Maybe it will be useful to some of you, I would love to hear your feedback.</p><p>Here is an excerpt:</p><blockquote><p>Instead of beginning with yourself, you first picture someone with whom you have a really uncomplicated and positive relationship. Wishing them well is much easier. Not only does this help with getting into the groove of building up the feeling of metta, but a certain framing can help you transition the focus to yourself more easily. Personally, I find this works best with a pet.</p><p>For example, I may start with thinking of my dog and wishing him well using my preferred metta phrases. Then I try to imagine viewing myself through the eyes of my dog and also silently saying phrases like \"May <i>You </i>be well.\" To me, it comes very natural to imagine that my dog loves me a lot and is really happy to see me. Because of that, it isn't hard to put myself into the position of my dog, imagining him e.g. being petted by me and wishing me all the best.</p><p>Now comes the interesting part. Mirghafori gives the instruction of \"joining voices\" with, in this case, my dog. That means switching the phrasing to \"May <i>I</i> be well\" instead of <i>You</i>. Instead of viewing myself from the outside perspective of a friend, I now try to have a loving awareness of the body and mind which I experience from the inside.</p></blockquote>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "MaxG"}}, {"_id": "ffm8WBRB8RYAJJXhw", "postedAt": "2022-01-12T16:15:52.153Z", "postId": "QhPyQTXuGt58Nzxnu", "htmlBody": "<p>In part inspired by this post, I did one hour a day of loving-kindness meditation for ten days and the results were <em>phenomenal</em>.

I sleep better, have more consistent energy, enjoy having conversations about work-related stuff more (so I just talk about EA and AI risk more than I used to, which was a big win on my previous margin). I think I maybe work fewer hours than I used to because before it felt like there was a bear chasing me and if I wasn't always working then it was going to eat me, whereas now that isn't the case. But my working patterns feel healthy and sustainable now; before, I was going through cycles of half-burning out every 3 months or so (which was bad enough for my near-term productivity, not to mention long-term producitivity and health). I also spend relatively less time just turning the handle on my mainline tasks (vs zooming out, having random conversations that feel useful but won't pay off immediately, reading more widely), which again I think was a win on my previous margin (maybe reduced it from ~90% to ~80% of my research hours).</p>\n<p>I'm confused about how this happened. My model is that before there were two parts of me that strongly disagreed about whether work is good, and that these parts have now basically resolved (they agree that doing sensible amounts of work is good), because both feel understood and loved. Basically the part that didn't think work was good just needed its needs to be understood and taken into account.</p>\n<p>I think this model is quite different from Charlie's main model of what happens (which is to do with memory consolidation), so I'm especially confused.</p>\n<p>I haven't attained persistent self-love of the sort described <a href=\"https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/how-i-attained-persistent-self-love?s=r\">here</a>.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "KhSNf8iQfkPnJq8Tu", "user": {"username": "SamClarke"}}, {"_id": "SFxYTmpHFxZ3MRGid", "postedAt": "2022-04-08T11:55:11.265Z", "postId": "QhPyQTXuGt58Nzxnu", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for this post Charlie.
