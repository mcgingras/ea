But if I go on too long about X, nobody will read it because it'll be too long. And those who do will pounce on the first seeming error they can find. The longer I go on, the bigger the attack surface. And the more contingent my claims become, so the less likely the whole story is to be true. Almost certainly, nobody is going to follow up or build on what I write. &nbsp;But maybe if I keep my writing short, somebody who <i>does</i> have power and influence will view me as \"voting with my words\" for a general type of intervention that they can actually get enacted. They'll work out the details.</p></blockquote><p>And so when we see calls for \"audits,\" or what elsewhere I've called \"risk management for EA,\" we should understand that these aren't viewed by their authors as fully fleshed-out proposals. They're the seeds of ideas that could be built out by a person who has the power and influence to access money and professional human resources in the EA movement. Pollsters don't call and ask you to draft an entire bill for your favored policies. In the EA movement, we don't even call people to ask their opinion about the direction of the movement. So if people want to have input, the way they can give it is by making one-liners advocating for things like \"audits,\" and hope that somebody in authority will take them up on the suggestion.</p><p>If we want people to explain the details of their proposal in greater depth, we need to make it worth their while. Well-thought-through proposals ought to be known as the sort of thing that can result in offers of grants or jobs. Going forward, I'd reframe the \"criticism\" contest as an \"EA policy proposal\" contest, or even have a range of similar contests addressing criticism, EA policy and governance, cause areas, interventions, and so on. If we can't afford to do that for comments on the EA forum, then EA organizations like OpenPhil, 80k, CEA, and so on ought to have dedicated places for people to make proposals about EA governance, where those proposals are read, taken seriously in some kind of legible manner, and can demonstrably lead to real change even when it's not an EA insider making the proposal.</p><p>If that's not tractable, then I would actually prefer if these organizations could explicitly declare that their organizations are not open to external input or oversight, and that this is a matter of policy. Ideally, they'd explain this, but just a one-sentence declaration about the forms of openness they are or are not open to would be an improvement. For example, one proposal I heard was that EA orgs should publish all of their internal emails going forward. I'm given to understand this is a norm in the Linux community, and that one can read all of Linus Torvalds' cantankerous emails if one so desires. If OpenPhil didn't want to publish their emails, I'd understand. But it would be nice if they had a web page where they explicitly declared that they'd considered and rejected this idea, even nicer if they articulated why, and best of all if they outlined the true argument for why they rejected it, and created a form in which people could submit counterarguments. Perhaps OpenPhil could then put these counterarguments to a vote, and declare themselves obligated to published a response if a counterargument received &nbsp;a certain number of votes.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "AllAmericanBreakfast"}}, {"_id": "RaKjGmvKLzutfHtDX", "postedAt": "2022-11-15T02:09:04.876Z", "postId": "aHPhh6GjHtTBhe7cX", "htmlBody": "<p>Crypto's failures are massive and obvious.

From 1995 to 2002, there were too many scammers, sociopaths, and opportunists who had ridden the initial wave of hype; security protocols were not well-developed; regulation was patchy and unclear; the use cases were often dubious; VCs &amp; major investors were often naive and didn't do their due diligence; billions were lost in bad investments; the NASDAQ lost 78% of its value, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>But then, somehow, between 2002 and today, the Internet changed the global economy and created trillions of dollars of value.

Again, lots of technical promise. Seemed quite a cool community early on; I sipped 0.05 btc from the Bitcoin Faucet in early 2011, then gave in and bought $100 worth (at $8). Then I waited for useful stuff to come of it. And waited. I remember making arguments like \"this is the first time computers can talk to each other and exchange value\" to my friends and family. A few other coins seemed interesting -- Namecoin seemed useful but didn't pan out; I spent some time studying Stellar when it came out too, for similar \"computers can send value\" type reasons. I had started to get bored in 2015 and missed the launch of Ethereum, which was quite a promising thing in retrospect, but I didn't miss the DAO collapse.
