This is not because there was a lack of brilliant economists initially, just that those Stalin had were either cringing on his party lines, hidden in side posts for their own good, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Kondratiev\">dead</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem was both to solve a complex problem (economics) and do it in a way that was acceptable to your masters and Marxist thinking of the time, which made the problem more complex than rocket science.</p><p>Once we move past Stalin (<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/09/24/book-review-red-plenty/\">Red Plenty is very readable on this</a>!) we get people like Kantorovich stepping out of the shadows. They were really smart, inventing new tools we use today and were really brilliant thinkers, but still had to solve not only the problem of the maths, but also the difficulty in understanding the people who they were supposedly commanding and their complexity and agency. On top of this, some tools and analysis are still forbidden to you.</p><p>Compare this with the rocket programme. Brilliant scientists again, solving really difficult problems, but orbital mechanics does not shift its behaviour to ruin your plan based on complicated politics (you may have missed an interaction, but they're a property of your materials and physical forces), and solving physics equations does not contradict Marxist thought (mostly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppressed_research_in_the_Soviet_Union#Physics\">E=MC2 was banned for a period </a>as it apparently contradicted Marx).</p><p>The point of the Soviet Union's failure, or that quote, was not that if it had a few more smart economists or thinkers they would have succeeded, or that economists are somehow better than physicists. The point was that they were trying to do something that could not be done with their or our technology: fully tame and control complexity like it was a space rocket.</p>", "parentCommentId": "X8mChiJfFKDuaS2HH", "user": {"username": "Michael Hinge"}}]
