The market price of something is its instrumental value. A dollar is valuable because of the things you can buy with it, not because of intrinsic worth. On the other hand, human lives, happiness etc. have intrinsic worth. I think that the distinction will persist in almost any imaginable universe although the price ratios can be vastly different. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Squark"}}, {"_id": "Buzai52HHaQ2z5e8A", "postedAt": "2015-02-17T20:38:30.504Z", "postId": "apKTPEcRm6jSFaMya", "htmlBody": "<p>I don't want to turn this into a sermon. </p>\n<p>Too late! :p Just kidding, great post.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "94L7fboWDHw5Wtj5H", "postedAt": "2015-02-18T02:14:37.234Z", "postId": "apKTPEcRm6jSFaMya", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>it costs a few million dollars to save a life in developed nations</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Where does this figure come from? </p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Alexander"}}, {"_id": "mM8dozvJC96z2uymz", "postedAt": "2015-02-18T03:42:08.861Z", "postId": "apKTPEcRm6jSFaMya", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm currently under the impression that American health insurance prices American lives at ~$10mil, but I don't have any sources on hand.
