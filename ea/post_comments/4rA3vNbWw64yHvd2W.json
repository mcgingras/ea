I think winter break is a great time for organizers to take on projects like this. For example, last winter I made <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MZFWRh7vzEDZ8mnYT/group-discussion-facilitator-training-guide\">the facilitator training for EAVP </a>as a winter break project. It was a good learning opportunity for me to take ownership over a project and it turned into a helpful repeatable workshop.&nbsp;<br><br>Sabrina's comment covers a lot of the trainings I would be excited to see. The one I am most excited to see soon is one to help train people to do 1-1s as these seem to be both particularly valuable to run and somewhat intimidating to do (at first!). &nbsp;<br><br>Others that might be useful could be:&nbsp;<br>* Movement building strategy and strategic prioritization for groups&nbsp;<br>* Practicing elevator pitches for EA groups<br>* Applied rationality for group organizers and creating positive epistemic norms<br>&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "jessica_mccurdy"}}]
