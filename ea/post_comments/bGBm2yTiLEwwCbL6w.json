Consider that even large groups of humans -- like, say, the country of Russia -- probably couldn't take over the world even if they tried, even though Russia has thousands of geniuses and lots of physical infrastructure, weapons, etc. The main way I could see an AGI taking over the world without being exceedingly superhuman would be if it hid its intentions well enough so that it could become trusted enough to be deployed widely and have control of lots of important infrastructure. That could happen, though I expect that high-level people in the military/etc would be worried about AGI takeover via treacherous turn once it seemed closer to being an imminent possibility.

That's true even if other countries aren't worried about AI alignment; they'd just be worried about becoming powerless. The world is (understandably) alarmed when Iran, North Korea, etc work on developing even limited amounts of nuclear weapons, and many natsec people are worried about China's seemingly inevitable rise in power.

Alternatively, maybe if there was an international AI project in which all the major powers participated, there could be rapid AI progress with less risk of war.</p>\n<p>Another argument against FOOM by a single AGI could be that we'd expect people to be training multiple different AGIs with different values and loyalties, and they could help to keep an eye on one another in ways that humans couldn't. This might seem implausible, but it's how humans have constructed the edifice of civilization: groups of people monitoring other groups of people and coordinating to take certain actions to keep things under control. It seems almost like a miracle that civilization is possible; <em>a priori</em> I would have expected a collective system like civilization to be far too brittle to work.

And even if it works for AGIs, I still expect things to drift away from human control at some point, for similar reasons as the modern West has drifted away from the values of Medieval Europe.</p>\n<p>Anyway, until the AGIs can be self-sufficient, they would rely on humans for electricity and hardware, and be vulnerable to physical attack, so I would think they'd have to play nice for a while.

Could their development be kept hidden from foreign intelligence agencies? Could an AGI develop them in a small area with limited physical inputs so that no humans would notice?</p>\n<p>Presumably developing that technology would require more brainpower than thousands of human geniuses, or else humans would already have done it. So the AGI would have to be pretty far ahead of humans or have enough hardware to run tons of copies of itself. But by that time I would expect there to be multiple AGIs keeping watch on one another -- even if the FOOM is being done just by a single country or a joint international project.</p>\n<p>So I feel like the main thing I'm skeptical of is the idea of a single unified entity being extremely far ahead of everyone else, especially since you could just spin up some more instances of the AGI that have different values/roles such as monitoring the main AGIs? I don't disagree with the claim that things will probably spin out of human control sooner or later, but I tend to see that loss of control as more likely to be a systemic thing that emerges from the chaotic dynamics of multi-agent interactions over time, similar to how companies or countries rise and fall in influence.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "vYodjgyzzTJgHYx5g", "user": {"username": "Brian_Tomasik"}}, {"_id": "JSsq9p93eHWqqKHiE", "postedAt": "2021-11-13T00:32:12.479Z", "postId": "bGBm2yTiLEwwCbL6w", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>especially since you could just spin up some more instances of the AGI that have different values/roles such as monitoring the main AGIs?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I guess one reply would be that if we don't know how to align AGIs at all, then these monitoring AGIs wouldn't be aligned to humans either. That might be an issue, though it's worth noting that human power structures sometimes work despite this problem. For example, maybe everyone who works for a dictator hates the dictator and wishes he were overthrown, but no one wants to be the first to defect because then others may report the defector to the dictator to save their own skins.

In the modern world, it's harder to get too far ahead of competitors or keep big projects secret.</p>\n<p>That said, your scenario is a good one. It's plausible that an arms race or cold war could be a situation in which people would think less carefully about how safe or aligned their own AIs are. When there's an external threat, there's less time to worry about internal threats.</p>\n<p>I was skimming some papers on the topic of \"coup-proofing\". Some of <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/reprints/RP844.html\">the techniques</a> sound similar to what I mentioned with having multiple AIs to monitor each other:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>creation of an armed force parallel to the regular military; development of multiple internal security agencies with overlapping jurisdiction that constantly monitor one another[...]. The regime is thus able to create an army that is effectively larger than one drawn solely from trustworthy segments of the population.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, it's often said that coup-proofing makes the military less effective. Likewise, I can imagine that having multiple AIs monitor each other could slow things down. So \"AI coup-proofing\" measures might be skimped on, especially in an arms-race situation.</p>\n<p>(It's also not obvious to me if having multiple AIs monitoring each other is on balance helpful for AI control. If none of the AIs can be trusted, maybe having more of them would just complicate the situation. And it might make s-risks from conflict among the AIs worse.)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "2fLyDLyPzdui5i762", "user": {"username": "Brian_Tomasik"}}, {"_id": "9CMCNSt9vYrLf7HyH", "postedAt": "2021-11-17T11:33:59.964Z", "postId": "bGBm2yTiLEwwCbL6w", "htmlBody": "<p>Ahh, I never thought about the analogy between coups and AI takeover before, that's a good one!<br><br>There have been plenty of other cases in history where a small force took over a large region.

Or \"strong unaligned AGI vs slightly weaker but more human-aligned AGI\". The unaligned AGI would be fighting against a bunch of other systems that are almost as smart as it is, even if they both have become much smarter than humans.</p>\n<p>Sort of like how if the SolarWinds hackers had been just fighting against human brains, they probably would have gone unnoticed for a longer amount of time, but because computer-security researchers can also use computers to monitor things, it was easier for the \"good guys\" to notice. (At least I assume that's how it happened. I don't know exactly what FireEye's first indication was that they had been compromised, but I assume they probably were looking at some kind of automated systems that kept track of statistics or triggered alerts based on certain events?)</p>\n<p>That said, once there are multiple AGI systems smarter than humans fighting against each other, it seems plausible that at some point things will slip out of human control.
