They have nothing interesting to do, and not enough space to do it. <strong>They express none of their natural behaviors and are subject to constant horrifying disease, injury, and artificial lighting that leads to torturous sleep deprivation. They spend their days unable to move much, living in feces and ammonia, subject to constant violence, and with horrifying diseases.</strong> Then, they\u2019re cruelly slaughtered, wherein they\u2019re crammed into small crates, leading to many chickens dying, and many more enduring bone-breaking injuries and weather extremes.

There are websites that tell you which products contain vitamin C.&nbsp;</li><li>Avoid processed meat: that is unhealthy. You can look on some websites what counts as processed meat. I think bacon and ham also count as processed.</li><li>Many meat products, especially fresh products, don\u2019t show an expiration date on the package. You can look for some information on the internet how to learn to detect when your meat is expired. If you don\u2019t know how to smell expired meat, don\u2019t keep your meat too long in the fridge, or eat plant-based meat alternatives as they show a best before date on the package.</li><li>In many cases, cheaper meat products may be unhealthier than more expensive meat products.

You're absolutely right we chose to focus on the omnivore-vs-vegetarian comparison, for a variety of different reasons. However, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4191896/\">AHS-2</a> does have some comparisons between omnivores to vegans. From the abstract: \"the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality in all vegetarians combined vs non-vegetarians was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.80\u20130.97). The adjusted HR for all-cause mortality in vegans was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.73\u20131.01)\". So depending on how strict you are being with statistical significance there's somewhere between a small signal and no signal that veganism is better with respect to all-cause mortality than omnivorism.</p><p>I think AHS is the best data we've got on this topic, but I'd be cautious about over-interpreting it. In my mind the biggest criticism is that Adventists are generally more healthy than the typical American (they do a lot more exercise, avoid alcohol and tobacco etc), which leads to extremely pernicious selection bias. For example, it could be that a vegan diet is much healthier than an omnivorous diet <i>if you are the kind of person who spends a lot of time worrying about your health generally</i>, but the risk of getting the wrong nutrients is so high with a vegan diet that it is harmful to people who are not otherwise concerned about their health. So I'm not confident the very slight improvement in overall mortality from switching from a vegetarian diet to a vegan diet can be judged to be a real effect from AHS alone.</p><p>On the other hand, I think I would be confident enough in the AHS data to say that it shows that veg*nism does not entail a tradeoff on the 'years of life lived' axis. The most conservative reading of the data possible would be that a veg*n diet has no effect on years of life lived, and I think it is probably more reasonable to read the AHS study as likely <i>underestimating</i> the benefits a veg*n diet would give the average person. Obviously 'years of life lived' is not the same thing as 'health' so I'm not saying this is a knock-down argument against your main point - just wanted to contextualise how we were using the data in the linked piece.</p>", "parentCommentId": "yGL2pRBzYpYobyPWF", "user": {"username": "Froolow"}}, {"_id": "R8rq6HGDCffzJY5Jx", "postedAt": "2023-06-05T16:29:24.039Z", "postId": "3Lv4NyFm2aohRKJCH", "htmlBody": "<p>I think this kind of reasoning (the justification for eating meat) is very dangerous and leads to atrocities like Sam Bankman-Fried's fraudulent behavior.

You would say yes, because it is not your native language. It will take some effort for you to learn Chinese. But a Chinese person thinks Chinese is easy, and English is difficult. Who is right? In the end, once you have learned to speak Chinese, it is as easy as most other languages that you have learned. Some languages are objectively more difficult than others (like Dutch is probably more difficult than Afrikaans, and English is more difficult than Esperanto), and for the same reason, some diets are objectively more difficult than others. But you make it look like veganism is objectively more difficult than other diets. I disagree with that: just see how much you have to learn for a healthy diet with meat. I think a healthy vegan diet is as difficult as a healthy omnivorous diet, and an unhealthy vegan diet is as easy as an unhealthy omnivorous diet.

In practice (and excluding Impossible Burger), the nutrients that beans/edamame/non-nut sources are rich in are things anyone with a halfway decent plant diet should already be doing well in.

It scores pretty well; above eggs but below steak, salmon, and liver (same ranking whether you include protein or not). For who people who like and can absorb nutrients from Impossible Burger and other fortified products, they seem pretty good, although not quite as dense. And for people who can digest IBs more easily than meat, seems great. I'm still pretty worried about unknown unknowns, and the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@justinmares/why-beyond-meat-impossible-are-bad-for-you-33f1ddb35191\">health nuts have concerns,</a> but I think both of those are beyond the scope of this post, which is about satisficing not optimization.</p><p>You might ask \"why focus on high protein foods?\" &nbsp;Because protein is the hardest and most valuable macronutrient for most diets, and because it's correlated with the subset of vitamins that's richer in meat sources. There are plant sources that are rich in other vitamins (kale is looking at these nutrient/calorie scores and laughing), but except maybe for nuts nothing unfortified is rich in this set. It's mostly fixable, by you have to tetris together the missing nutrients from multiple sources.</p><p>In the reverse situation I would 100% describe kale as nutrient dense to someone eating the Stanard Shit American Diet. I expect it to be less helpful to them than an egg is to a vegan, but for reasons that reflect well on plant-based diets: most of the problems from meat-based diets aren't nutritional deficiencies that can be fixed by eating more things.

My guess is that for the median person full abstention is possible, in the sense that people won't die from it, and the ceiling on how good a vegan diet can be is well above the Standard Shit American Diet. But probably the ideal plant-based diet + a few ounces of beef liver and salmon per week is better than theideal plant-based diet alone, for the median person. I think that amount of optimization is beyond what most people are trying to do, and think it's fair to discount health as an explanation for meat consumption for someone who isn't shipping in grass-finished antibiotic-free hand-massaged liver and installing 3 stage water filters on their entire plumbing system.</p><p>I get why my insistence on tracking that last little bit of optimization, while people kill themselves with cheetos, would feel bad to vegans.

I've seen people (not in EA) say \"vegan is for life. if you ever eat animals again then you're just someone who ate plants for a while\". Vegan Society does say \"as far as is possible and practicable\", but it also says \"one thing all vegans have in common is a plant-based diet avoiding all animal foods such as meat (including fish, shellfish and insects), dairy, eggs and honey - as well as avoiding animal-derived materials, products tested on animals and places that use animals for entertainment\". &nbsp;And I've seen lots of EAs use \"vegan\" to mean \"exclusively plant-based diet\" without political conntations.&nbsp;</p><p>IIUC you want to allow vegans to be imperfect (with the acceptable bar raising with wealth), but are pretty worried about free riders saying \"yay animals! I'm a vegan!\" while not actually doing much that actually matters. That feels very relatable to me but as someone who wouldn't qualify for any definition of vegan I feel uncomfortable having an opinion on where the line should be, and in the meantime want to sidestep the word in favor of more explicit descriptions.&nbsp;</p><p>I accept that for many people it's easier to be fully plant-based than plant-based + a bit of animal products. I think it's valid to argue that \"for the median person, the health benefits of a few ounces of meat are N, which is small, and the risk of relapsing is M, which is large, so you should be safe and stay entirely plant-based. It's not even a health cost if you include the second order effect of excess meat if you relapse\"- but only if you've actually calculated N and M, and ideally looked for improvements on the margin.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnzubsx0s6q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnzubsx0s6q\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; You can't ignore the health costs and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rRkhATuztvfMLFhT8/vegan-nutrition-testing-project-interim-report?commentId=Z26fPExJJyni69Nq8\">tell people it's bad to investigate them</a>, and then claim to know which of N or M*costs is larger.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnu314zdpm8j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnu314zdpm8j\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; And even if ideal-N is small, you still need to do the work to get people on a good plant-exclusive diet.&nbsp;</p><p>And then N and M differ widely across the population. It's entirely possible for the current plant-exclusive population to be best served (incorporating the cost of animal suffering) by staying plant-exclusive, and for a different population to be best served by ameliatarianism. I think it's fair to not get the same social reinforcement from them you would from a fellow vegan, but they don't owe you social reinforcement.

The <i>attribution</i> is an empirical claim, and that's what I was (very poorly) getting at.</p><p>As part of this empirical attribution, there's two different concepts at play here: satiation and satiety (yes, silly naming). Satiation is how much of food can be consumed in one sitting. Satiety is how much a given food will delay or decrease calorie intake in the next meal.</p><p>From the post:</p><blockquote><p>But there isn\u2019t a satisfying plant product that is as rich in as many things as meat, dairy, and especially eggs.&nbsp;</p><p>But there isn\u2019t a satisfying plant product that is as rich in as many things as meat, dairy, and especially eggs.

Whole fresh fruit &amp; veg generally fall in at &lt; 100 calories per cup, whereas meats are 300-600 calories per cup.</li><li>&nbsp;<strong>Fibre. </strong>Fibre limits the absorption of calories, meaning that you can eat more but still absorb the same amount of calories.</li><li><strong>Absorbability. </strong>Conversely, processing (e.g. turning peanuts into peanut butter) separates the peanut's calories from the fibrous cell walls and thus making it more vastly more absorbable. Animal product do not have a fibrous cell walls, meaning they are absorbable off the bat. This means <i>lower</i> satiation per calorie - you eat more calories in a stomach full.</li><li><strong>Thylakoids. </strong>The thing that makes leaves green slows down fat absorption in the gut. Slowing down fat absorption means that un-absorbed calories can reach the end of the intestine (ileum). When this is detected, appetite is decreased dramatically.</li><li><strong>Hardness of food</strong>. Same food, presented hard or soft (e.g. carrots) leads to fewer calories being consumed but no extra calories as compensation in the next meal.</li></ul><p>To be clear, <i>I am willing to grant the premise that \"protein &gt; carb &gt; fat\" in terms of satiation</i>. But this would not be the end of the matter, because cardinality matters too. I don't want to spend an hour digging for numbers at this stage, but I can illustrate what I mean with an example:</p><ul><li>Chicken/beef roughly 45% calories from protein (rest from fat).</li><li>Chickpeas roughly 22% calories from protein (rest from carbs incl. fibre).</li><li>Dry soya chunks rougly 57% calories from protein (rest from carbs incl. fibre).</li></ul><p>Based only on macros (let's say you blitzed the chickpeas into ultra fine hummus and equalised the water content), which of these is going to be more satisfying is going to depend on the ratio of <i>how much</i> less satisfying carbs and fat are (per calorie) compared to protein.

B12 and multivitamins are extremely cheap. This pea protein <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/America-Organic-Flavonoids-Minerals-Friendly/dp/B01DWUEQ7C/\">powder</a> with good reviews is as cheap per gram of protein as chicken breast at my local Costco, and very protein-dense. This makes it cheaper than almost all animal protein sources. Grains and legumes are even cheaper per gram of protein but less protein-dense. Eating a few cheap pills each day and a scoop of protein powder or legumes doesn't sound like \u201ca serious logic puzzle.\u201d</p><p>Also, how are animal products \u201cincredibly nutrient dense\u201d? What nutrients are you referring to? Do you mean per calorie, or per dollar, and compared to what? Micronutrients are much cheaper in supplements than in animal products.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Food allergies and digestion issues mean lots of people struggle to feed themselves even with animal products; giving up a valuable chunk of their remaining options comes at a huge cost.</p></blockquote><p>This sentence has the same hyperbole problem. \u201cStruggle to feed themselves\u201d conjures images of people who literally struggle to get enough calories to survive. Some people do struggle to get enough calories to survive because they\u2019re allergic to a lot of foods, but they're not the target of vegan advocacy. This problem is incredibly rare among wealthy young Westerners. What you probably meant to say is that some people have a hard time having a perfectly healthy diet because of their food allergies.

This is common enough that I've met ex-vegans who had to compromise on their diet for this reason, as well as a vegan who seemed very clearly nutritionally deprived because of FODMAP and gluten allergies but was toughing it out regardless for ethical reasons, so I'd be quite surprised if you've never met someone with multiple allergies that severely constrict their vegan options for getting the full spectrum of known nutrition.

There are vegan traditions making up a minority of certain cultures (although there are allegations that it's more aspirational than obeyed, and because I think it only takes small amounts of meat to gain the nutritional benefits they count as omnivore for my purposes), and there are cultures that can't afford meat and start eating it once they do (and their health improves with it, although of course wealth can improve health lots of ways).</p><p>But the existence of successful lactovegetarian cultures doesn't make lactovegetarianism a health choice for members of east Asian, sub-Saharan African, or Native American cultures<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdwga38ujfra\"><sup><a href=\"#fndwga38ujfra\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;whose members are overwhelmingly lactose intolerant.
