Another excellent example of the invaluable work Rethink Priorities does.</p><p>My observations and takeaways from this latest survey are:</p><ol><li><strong>Overall satisfaction is low.</strong> On a 10 point scale, a 6.77 rating isn\u2019t very good. Only ~12% give a rating of 9 or 10, and &lt;40% give a rating of 8 or higher. (I\u2019m aware that a 6.8 rating on a ten point scale still suggests more satisfaction than dissatisfaction, but given that we're talking about people rating their satisfaction with a community they've chosen to participate in I think we should interpret this result as damning with faint praise).</li><li><strong>The change in satisfaction from pre-FTX to now is quite large.</strong> The original survey in the immediate aftermath of FTX\u2019s collapse found a substantial drop in satisfaction vs. pre-FTX. One&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SFAMvCxnEzaQHNeSL/how-has-ftx-s-collapse-affected-public-perception-of-ea?commentId=rXJnK7BixjvAKSpB3\">commenter</a>&nbsp;at the time observed that \u201c[decreased satisfaction by 0.5-1 points on a 10-point scale is] a big drop! In practice I've only ever seen this type of satisfaction scale give results between about 7/10 through 9.5/10\u2026 so that decline is a real big chunk of the scale's de facto range.\u201d This latest survey suggests that the satisfaction has dropped another ~.2-.4 points. That means from pre-FTX to today, satisfaction has probably dropped something like .7-1.4 points, which is huge for a 10 point scale with a much narrower effective range (and the drop could easily be understated due to selection bias).&nbsp;The mean reversion of satisfaction to pre-FTX levels that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/how-has-ftx-s-collapse-impacted-ea?commentId=yQ4x8aPGQNdtcLLrd\">some expected</a> has not happened.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Selection bias is probably causing us to overstate satisfaction, and understate the degree to which satisfaction has dropped.</strong>&nbsp; As the report notes, selection bias could plausibly cut both ways. That said, I think most people would guess that selection bias is operating in the direction of excluding the least satisfied members from the data set. And the data seems to give some indication to support that view. Looking at the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aF6nh4LW6sSbgMLzL/updates-on-community-health-survey-results#Community_satisfaction_over_time\">distribution of satisfaction scores in late 2022 vs late 2023</a>, we see the reduction in satisfaction over that period coming from fewer people giving high ratings of 9 or 10, and more people giving low ratings of 3-5. But for the lowest ratings, we see basically no change in the number of people giving a rating of 2, and <i>fewer</i> people (almost nobody) now giving a rating of 1. Given falling satisfaction, we should expect more people to be giving these lowest ratings; the fact that we don\u2019t suggests that the least satisfied people are excluded from the sample.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The behavioral changes described in this survey are significant and warrant attention.&nbsp;</strong>The number of people making concrete behavioral changes surprised me (even though <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/how-has-ftx-s-collapse-impacted-ea?commentId=5zLgpfxM768KXLEnG\">I already believed FTX had a significant negative impact on community growth and activity</a>). I was particularly surprised at how many people reported permanently ceasing to promote EA or engage in key EA activities, especially since selection bias likely suppresses the reported numbers. The December 2022 survey indicated <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/g5uKzBLjiEuC5k46A/ftx-community-response-survey-results#What_actions_would_respondents_like_to_see_in_the_next_few_months_\">a community desire for additional transparency, reflections, and post-mortems</a>. This more recent survey suggests the community has been unimpressed by the limited public efforts on these fronts, with concrete negative implications.</li><li><strong>This analysis shows large drops in satisfaction and significant behavior changes, but only gives limited insight into what caused these.&nbsp;</strong>Issues like JDEI concerns and concerns about cause prioritization are clearly reasons why people might be dissatisfied, but it\u2019s not obvious why these longstanding issues should cause people to be more dissatisfied now than they were in late 2022. We can hypothesize that the changes were driven by FTX (and to a lesser extent subsequent scandals), but it would be preferable to look directly at the data. I think it would be very valuable to closely examine the cohort of people who report having changed their behavior. (It would also be interesting to look at a cohort of people who report significant decreases in satisfaction, but it seems more important to understand drivers of behavior change.) For this cohort, I would like to know:<ol><li>What are the largest causes of dissatisfaction? How does this cohort compare to the full sample?</li><li>Does dissatisfaction appear to be driven by one major factor, or a confluence of concerns (as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/how-has-ftx-s-collapse-impacted-ea?commentId=ZKoL9euKJBbN2cHBY\">Luke Freeman has suggested might be the case</a>)?</li><li>How much did reported satisfaction decrease since previous surveys?</li><li>What levels of satisfaction [or sizes of decreases in satisfaction] are associated with behavior change (i.e. can we say something like \u201cif satisfaction drops to 6 or lower [or decreases by 1 or more points], that\u2019s when we start seeing people shift behaviors\u201d?)</li><li>How does perception of issues for this cohort compare to the full sample?</li><li>Do perceptions of issues look different for modest behavior changes (e.g. stopping referring to \u201cEA\u201d but still promoting) vs. larger behavior changes (e.g. permanently stopping promoting)?</li><li>Do we have any insights into the temporarily stopped promoting cohort (a sizeable 15% of the sample)? Do we have any idea whether these are people who stopped promoting for a few months but are now promoting again vs. people who are still not promoting but expect to do so again at some point? I realize the most recent survey might not give enough information to tell, but this seems like a very important issue to understand and something we might want to dig into in the full EA Survey.</li><li>How much overlap is there across the different types of behavior change?&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Updating analyses of community growth seems like it should be a high priority.</strong> The <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TurdGigfQKwxBkKnb/estimating-ea-growth-rates-mcf-memo-1\">last public effort</a> was based on data collected in August 2023. I\u2019ve been a longstanding proponent of conducting regular analyses of community growth, but refreshing that analysis (perhaps with some <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/how-has-ftx-s-collapse-impacted-ea?commentId=n4jEaRjF65WRfwF7E\">methodological</a><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TurdGigfQKwxBkKnb/estimating-ea-growth-rates-mcf-memo-1?commentId=apgFtggb47buAoLZK\"> tweaks</a>) seems particularly important given the results of this survey. Various metrics that are publicly available don\u2019t look great, continuing trends <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/how-has-ftx-s-collapse-impacted-ea?commentId=5zLgpfxM768KXLEnG\">I first noted in October</a> (though note that some of the metrics that performed strongest in the immediate aftermath of FTX, most notably 80k\u2019s metrics, aren\u2019t publicly available):<ol><li><a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/stats/overview\">Donations and donors to EA Funds</a> continue to shrink year over year.

I would argue the same is true for the hugely successful promotion around WWOTF. And demographic factors should generally support an expectation of growth in donation related metrics (almost everyone in the EA community is at an age where they are entering the workforce or increasing their earnings; virtually nobody is at retirement age).

I think that people <i>temporarily</i> stopping promoting EA is compatible with people who are still completely on board with EA, deciding that it's strategically unwise to publicly promote it, at a time when there's lots of negative discussion of it in the media. Likewise with still promoting EA, but stopping referring to it as \"EA\", which also showed high levels across the board.</p><p>I think the prevalence of these behaviours points to the importance of more empirical research on the EA brand and how it compares to alternative brands or just referring to individual causes or projects (see our proposal <a href=\"https://manifund.org/projects/experiments-to-test-ea--longtermist-framings-and-branding\">here</a>). I think it's entirely <i>possible</i> that the term \"EA\" itself has been tarnished and that people do better to promote ideas and projects without explicitly branding them as EA. But there's a real cost to just promoting things piecemeal or using alternative terms (e.g. \"have you heard of \"high impact careers\" / \"existential security\"?\"), rather than referring to a unified established brand. So it's not clear a priori whether this is a positive move.</p><blockquote><p>I was surprised that for the cohort that changed their behavior, \u201cscandal\u201d was just one of many reasons for dissatisfaction and didn\u2019t really stand out.

One possible explanation, other than it just being a co-incidence of factors, is that the FTX crisis and subsequent revelations dented faith in EA leadership, and made people more receptive to other concerns.
