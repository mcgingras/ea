If anyone else reading this has any more data on this point I'd be very interested.

I like the idea of using the venue well to have 2 concurrent workshops or what have you in different rooms, who can mingle during meals and off-hours. It also sounds like you got all the informational stuff out of the way on the first day and thats great, leaving the second for more hands-on stuff. I am also very happy that people didn't have to read intro materials beforehand.&nbsp;<br><br>It does seem really time intensive for organizers though. And money intensive. &nbsp;Have any groups just tried doing daylong things, with no sleepovers/retreat aspect? It would mean renting a much cheaper airbnb for the weekend, with only 2-4 bedrooms (for organizers), but with really nice common areas for everyone during the day, well-located near walking areas and central enough people can drive or uber to twice without a big issue?&nbsp;For students you could offer to subsidize ubers. You can provide snacks, lunch, and dinner. Maybe you do lunch as something simple that can be made in an instapot or the oven (burritos, burgers, vegan chicken tenders), and cater dinner.<br><br>I imagine 2 full saturdays is doable for a lot of people and we have gotten good feedback that people (professionals) would attend &nbsp;a 2 day condensed in-person program. But we havent done an intro course over 2 days yet. Right now we are doing 4 week condensed thing, but we plan to try 2 day as well.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Ivy_Mazzola"}}, {"_id": "evsEZkf6uNqvwzNg8", "postedAt": "2022-11-08T10:22:57.169Z", "postId": "LEDXWzixD56yXsCDp", "htmlBody": "<p>Sorry if this is only tangentially relevant, but I honestly think more courses, discussion groups, and especially virtual programs could benefit from using the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/groups/MCtKD7oex9jhsAWvD\">EA Gather Town</a> for their sessions.

Needless to say, Yellow is pretty awesome.)</p><p>One-off events that people travel to are really great for inspiration, learning seriously, and strong connections. But there are significant obstacles to keeping up those connections after people return home to their daily routines. The environments (locale, incentives, activities) where they made the connections are often very different from their habitual environments &nbsp;where they'd have to find a way to maintain the connections. If they live far apart, they might not be the kind of people who have much bandwidth for communicating online, so the connection fades despite wanting to keep in touch.</p><p>For fostering long-term high-communication connections between EAs, I suspect local or online activities are &nbsp;underexplored. Events that are more specifically optimised for kickstarting a perpetual social activity (e.g. coworking, or regular meetups in a place they can always return to) for those who want it seem more likely to enable people to keep in touch, and EA Gather is great for that. Probably locally hosted activities work too, but I don't know much about them.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnkdf1lmzajz\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefkdf1lmzajz\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Either me or any of the other <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13Kb5umCiub-zepbdHZwQFzz8Z0FqUw42LrAO6_pkxVs/\">stewards</a> could give quick intro tours to newcomers on e.g. how &nbsp;to connect with others via the space, community norms, benefits of coworking, etc. We could also build out or customise the space for what people want to use it for, but we have plenty of space so we might already have what you need for what you want to do.</p></div></li></ol>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Emrik"}}]
