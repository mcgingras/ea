I ask this question to ask how much time you guys think you're operating on. This affects some earn-to-give scenarios like \"should I look for a scalable career in which it might take years, but I could be reliably making millions by the end of that time?\" versus closer-scale scenarios like \"become a lawyer next year and donate to alignment think tanks <i>now</i>.\"&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How worried should I be about local effects of narrow AI?</strong> The coordination problem of humanity as well as how much attention is given to alignment and how much attention is given to other EA projects like malaria prevention or biosecurity are things that matter <i>a lot</i>. They could be radically affected by short-term effects of narrow AI, like, say, propaganda machines with LLMs or bioweapon factories with protein folders. Is enough attention allocated to short-term AI effects? Everybody talks about alignment, which is the <i>real</i> problem we need to solve, but all the little obstacles we'll face on the way will matter a lot as well because they affect how alignment goes!</p><p><strong>Does AI constrict debate a bit?</strong> What I mean by this is: most questions here are somewhat related to AI and so are most EA thinking efforts I know of. It just seems to be that AI swallows every other cause up. Is this a problem? Because it's a highly technical subject, are you too swamped with people who want to help in the best way, discover that most things that are not AGI don't really matter because of how much the latter shapes literally everything else, but simply wouldn't be very useful in the field? Nah nevermind this isn't a clear question. This might be better: <i>is there such a thing as too-much-AI burnout? For EAs, should a little bit of a break exist, something which is still important, only a little less, with which they could concentrate on, if only because they will go a little insane concentrating on AI only?</i> Hm.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is the most scalable form of altruism that you've found?</strong> Starting a company and hopefully making a lot of money down the line might be pretty scalable--given enough time, your yearly donations could be in the millions, not thousands. Writing a book, writing blog posts, making YouTube videos or starting a media empire to spread the EA memeplex would also be a scalable form of altruism, benefiting the ideas that save the most lives. AI alignment work is (and technically also capabilities, but capabilities is worse than useless without alignment) scalable, in a way, because once friendly AGI is created pretty much every other problem humanity faces melts away. Thanks to your studies and thinking, which method, out of these or more that you know, might be the most scalable form of altruism you can imagine?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What book out of the three free books you offer should I give to a friend? </strong>I have not yet read the <i>80,000 Hours</i> guide and nor have I read <i>Doing Good Better</i>, but I <i>have</i> read <i>The Precipice.</i> I want to see if I can convert a align a friend to EA ideas by having them read a book, not sure which one is the best though.

I've noticed that over time, Kurzgesagt seems to have become more and more aligned with the EA style of thinking. Have you met the team personally? What ambitions do they have? Are they planning on collaborating with EA organizations in the far future, or this is just part of one \"batch\" of videos? Are they planning on a specifically-about-altruism video soon? Or, more importantly: Kurzgesagt does not have any videos on AGI, the alignment problem, or existential threats in general (despite flirting with bioweapons, nukes and climate change). Are they planning on one?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How important is PR to you and do you have future plans for PR scalability?</strong> As in, do you have a plan for racking up an order of magnitude more readers/followers/newsletter subscribers/whatever or not? Should you? Have you thought about the question enough to establish it wouldn't be worth the effort/time/money? Is there any way people on here could help?

People care about things like other humans and animals, only some things like scope insensitivity stop them from spending every second of their time trying to do as much altruism as possible.

Most of the thoughts on the followup can be summarised by \u2018yeah, I think doing advising well is really hard\u2019.</p><blockquote><p>Advisors often only have a few pages of context and a single call (sometimes there are follow-ups) to talk about career options. In my experience, this can be pretty insufficient to understand someone's needs.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Yep, that\u2019s roughly right. Often it\u2019s less than this! Not everyone takes as much time to fill in the preparation materials as it sounds like you did. One of the things I frequently emphasised when hiring for and training advisors was asking good questions at the start of the call to fill in gaps in their understanding, check it with the advisee, and then quickly arrive at a working model that was good enough to proceed with. Even then, this isn\u2019t always going to be perfect. In my experience, advisors tend to do a pretty good job of linking the takes they give to the reasons they\u2019re giving them (where, roughly speaking, many of those reasons will be aspects of their current understanding of the person they\u2019re advising).</p><blockquote><p>the person may feel more pressure to pursue something that's not a good fit for them</p></blockquote><p>With obvious caveats about selection effects, many of my advisees expressed that they were positively surprised at me relieving this kind of pressure! In my experience advisors spend a lot more time reassuring people that they can let go of some of the pressure they\u2019re perceiving than the inverse (it was, for example, a recurring theme in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/after-hours-podcast/episodes/alex-lawsen-10-career-mistakes/\"><u>podcast</u></a> I recently released).</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;if they disagree with the advice given, the may not raise it. For example, they may not feel comfortable raising the issue because of concerns around anonymity and potential career harm, since your advisors are often making valuable connections and sharing potential candidate names with orgs that are hiring.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This is tricky to respond to. I care a lot that advisees are&nbsp;<i>in fact</i> not at risk of being de-anonymised, slandered, or otherwise harmed in their career ambitions as a result of speaking to us, and I\u2019m happy to say that I believe this is the case. It\u2019s possible, of course, for advisees to believe that they are at risk here, and for that reason or several possible other reasons, to give answers that they think advisors want to hear rather than answers that are an honest reflection of what they think. I think this is usually fairly easy for advisors to pick up on (especially when it\u2019s for reasons of embarrassment/low confidence), at which point the best thing for them to do is provide some reassurance about this.</p><p>I do think that, at some point, the burden of responsibility is no longer on the advisor. If someone successfully convinces an advisor they they would really enjoy role A, or really want to work on cause Z, because they think that\u2019s what the advisor wants to hear, or they think that\u2019s what will get them recommended for the best roles, or introduced to the coolest people, or whatever, and the advisor then gives them advice that follows from those things being true, I think that advice is likely to be bad advice for that person, and potentially harmful if they follow it literally. I\u2019m glad that advisors are (as far as I can tell), quite hard to mislead in this way, but I don\u2019t think they should feel guilty if they miss some cases like this.</p><blockquote><p>I know that 80K don't want people to take their advice so seriously, and numerous posts have been written on this topic. However, I think these efforts won't necessarily negate 1) and 2) because many 80K advisees may not be as familiar with all of 80K's content or Forum discourse, and the prospect of valuable connections remains nonetheless.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>There might be a slight miscommunication here. Several of the posts (and my recent podcast interview) talking about how people shouldn\u2019t take 80k\u2019s advice so seriously are, I think, not really pointing at a situation where people get on a 1on1 call and then take the advisor\u2019s word as gospel, but more at things like reading a website that\u2019s aimed at a really broad audience, and trying to follow it to the letter despite it very clearly being the case that no single piece of advice applies equally to everyone. The sort of advice people get on calls is much more frequently a suggestion of next steps/tests/hypotheses to investigate/things to read than \u201cok here is your career path for the next 10 years\u201d, along with the reasoning behind those suggestions. I don\u2019t want to uncritically recommend deferring to anyone on important life decisions, but on the current margin I don\u2019t think I\u2019d advocate for advisees taking that kind of advice, expressed with appropriate nuance, less seriously.</p><h3><br><strong>OK, but what specific things are in place to catch potential harm?</strong></h3><p>There are a few things that I think are protective here, some of which I\u2019ll list below, though this list isn\u2019t exhaustive.<br><br><strong>Internal quality assurance of calls</strong></p><ul><li>The overwhelming majority of calls we have are recorded (with permission), and many of these are shared for feedback with other staff at the organisation (also with permission). To give some idea of scale, I checked some notes and estimated that (including trials, and sitting in on calls with new advisors or triallists) I gave substantive feedback on over 100 calls, the majority of which were in the last year. I was on the high end for the team, though everyone in 80k is able to give feedback, not only advisors.</li><li>I would expect anyone listening to a call in this capacity to flag, as a priority, anything that seemed like and advisor saying something harmful, be that because it was false, displayed an inappropriate level of confidence, or because it was insensitive.</li><li>My overall impression is that this happens extremely rarely, and that the bar for giving feedback about this kind of concern was (correctly) extremely low. I\u2019m personally grateful, for example, for some feedback a colleague gave me about how my tone might have been perceived as \u2018teacher-y\u2019 on one call I did, and another case where someone flagged that they thought the advisee might have felt intimidated by the start of the conversation. In both cases, as far as I can remember, the colleague in question thought that the advisee probably&nbsp;<i>hadn\u2019t</i> interpreted the situation in the way they were flagging, but that it was worth being careful in future. I mention this not to indicate that I never made mistakes on calls, but instead to illustrate why I think it\u2019s unlikely that feedback would miss significant amounts of potentially harmful advice.</li></ul><p><strong>Advisee feedback mechanisms</strong></p><ul><li>There are multiple opportunities for people we\u2019ve advised to give feedback about all aspects of the process, including specific prompts about the quality of advice they received on the call, any introductions we made, and any potential harms.</li><li>Some of these opportunities include the option for the advisee to remain anonymous, and we\u2019re careful about accidentally collecting de-anonymising information, though no system is foolproof. As one example, we&nbsp;<i>don\u2019t</i> give an option to remain anonymous in the feedback form we send immediately after the call (as depending on how many other calls were happening at the time, someone filling it in straight away might be easy to notice), but we&nbsp;<i>do</i> give this option in later follow-up surveys (where the timing won\u2019t reveal identity).</li><li>In user feedback, the most common reason given by people who said 1on1 caused them harm is that they were rejected from advising and felt bad/demotivated about that. The absolute numbers here are very low, but there\u2019s an obvious caveat about non-response bias.</li></ul><p><strong>On specific investigations/examples</strong></p><ul><li>I worked with community health on some ways of preventing harm being done by people advisers made introductions to (including, in some cases, stopping introductions)</li><li>I spent more than 5 but less than 10 hours, on two occasions, investigating concerns that had been raised to me about (current or former) advisors, and feel satisfied in both cases that our response was appropriate i.e. that there was not an ongoing risk of harm following the investigation.</li><li>Despite my personal bar for taking concerns of this sort seriously being pretty low compared to my guess at the community average (likely because I developed a lot of my intuitions for how to manage such situations during my previous career as a teacher), there were few enough incidents meriting any kind of investigation that I think giving any more details than the above would not be worth the (small) risk of deanonymising those involved. I take promises of confidentiality really seriously (as I hope would be expected for someone in the position advisors have).</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": "jgxXd5Chquy9Pmynq", "user": {"username": "alexrjl"}}, {"_id": "HsX2bCCzfSc2oy88a", "postedAt": "2023-09-12T23:54:25.106Z", "postId": "ZwswpxAWMZ8F7CvtB", "htmlBody": "<p>As an early career executive assistant, I'm watching the world of admin/ops work rapidly change--currently, for the better due to increased efficiency--with AI tool adoption.

Agree this is a frustrating bottleneck. Would love to see more senior people enter this space and open up new opportunities. Definitely the mentorship bottleneck makes it less valuable to try to enter technical AI safety on the margin, although we still think it's often a good move to try, if you have the right personal fit. I'd also add this bottleneck is way lower if you: 1. enter via more traditional academic or software engineer routes rather than via 'EA fellowships' - and these routes are our top recommendations anyway; 2. are working on AI risk through governance or other non-technical routes.</p><p>I\u2019ll add that it's going to be the case that some people who try to work in AI technical safety won't end up getting a job in the field. But one reason we feel very comfortable recommending it is that the career capital you build in this path is just highly valuable, including for other potentially impactful paths. For instance, you can use ML knowledge to become a valuable advisor to policymakers on AI governance issues. You could upskill in infosecurity and make that your comparative advantage. If you're skilled as an ML engineer, one of your best options may just be earning to give for a while (provided you don't work somewhere actively harmful) \u2014 and this also leaves open the possibility of entering AI safety work down the road if more opportunities open up. As somebody who did a psych/neuro PhD, I can confidently say that the most productive researchers in my field (and those doing the coolest research in my opinion) were people who had a background in ML, so upskilling on these technical fields just seems broadly useful.&nbsp;<br><br>There are many different bottlenecks in the AI Safety space. On the technical side, it has become very competitive to get a job in research labs. If technical research is what you\u2019re aiming for, I would&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rJ9LBoSt9MvXJrbEf/how-to-apply-for-a-phd\"><u>potentially recommend doing a PhD</u></a>, or upskilling in industry. For AI governance, I think there are a ton of opportunities available. I would read through the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://course.aisafetyfundamentals.com/governance\"><u>AI Safety Fundamentals Governance class&nbsp;</u></a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/us-policy-careers\"><u>this EA forum account&nbsp;</u></a>to get more information on good ideas in governance and how to get started in the US government. If you\u2019re feeling totally burnt out on AI safety, I would keep in mind that there are a huge number of ways to have a big impact on the world. Our career guide is tailored to a general audience, but every individual has different comparative advantages; if Shakira asked me if she should quit singing to upskill in ML, I would tell her she is much better placed to continue being an artist, but to use her platform to spread important messages. Not saying that you too could be a global pop sensation, but there\u2019s probably something you could totally kick ass at, and you should potentially design your career around going hard on that. To answer your second question, we're trying to talk to older people who can be mentors in the space and we try to connect younger people with older people outside standard orgs.

If you\u2019re interested in AI Safety technical research, my take is that you should try reading through existing technical research; if it appeals to you, try replicating some papers. If you enjoy that, consider applying to orgs, or to some alignment bootcamps. If you\u2019re not getting any traction on applications, consider upskilling in a PhD program or industry. Some 80k advisors are more keen on independent research/taking time off to upskill; I\u2019m not as keen on this. I would totally fail at structuring my time during an independent upskilling period, and I could see myself becoming quite isolated/anxious/depressed doing this. So I would prefer to see people pick up technical skills in a more structured way.
