In other words, it is particularly costly in political terms for these legislators to move legislation that is perceived as harming ag interests forward.</p><p>The US seems to have fewer cross-cutting cleavages than it used to. I would assume that people who care a lot about factory-farming issues, for whom a politician's position might reasonably be expected to impact their vote, are disproportionately concentrated in large cities. They are disproportionately in the leftmost quintile of the U.S. political distribution. Meanwhile, ag-heavy districts tend to be more conservative, even when the seat is held by a Democrat. I suspect few voters <i>most</i> interested in animal-welfare issues are likely to vote for -- or donate to -- the types of politicians who currently represent ag-interested districts anyway (no matter what their votes are on animal-welfare legislation).&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, there is usually little counterfactual upside (and a significant downside) for a number of critical legislators to support bills opposed by the ag industry. While money and organization play a part, I think the harder issue to address is the nature of US Congressional elections happening by district and state, and the geographic concentration of many interest groups.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, I focusing on the number of factory farmers would understate the ag interests in these districts. Just because someone doesn't have kids doesn't mean they do not factor in the importance of education for the overall welfare of their community. Likewise, one doesn't have to be a factory farmer to realize that agricultural interests play a significant role in the economic welfare of their specific communities. So there is a wider group of people in the district who <i>indirectly </i>benefit from what helps ag interests.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"dqxzj67n3t\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdqxzj67n3t\"><sup><a href=\"#fndqxzj67n3t\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>I think this also holds for a number of politicians not on the ag committees. In many cases, the margin of error for getting something through Congress is pretty low. Bipartisan cooperation is all too uncommon, and Senate rules give a minority faction significant powers to make passing legislation difficult and costly in terms of legislative resources. That means that each legislator's individual vote can be important.&nbsp;</p><p>I also think that focusing on the majority's support for reforms can understate the importance of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrolling\">logrolling </a>/ vote trading in legislatures. Because certain districts care a lot about ag interests, other politicians can and do appeal to those interests in logrolling trades. For example, if you're a Democrat in a relatively conservative district/state, party leadership is going to ask you to cast some votes that are going to make your life more difficult. What is leadership going to offer you in exchange for that vote you cast on (e.g.) abortion that will irritate a decent number of the people who voted for you?&nbsp;</p><p>Ag issues are in a sense ideal trade objects for this kind of logrolling; they are low-cost for the rest of the party (because failure to push welfare bills is unlikely to have negative electoral consequences for anyone) but high-benefit for the receiving politician. That, of course, doesn't mean that lobbying is futile. But I think it helps explain why it may be much less successful than polling numbers would suggest.</p><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"dqxzj67n3t\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fndqxzj67n3t\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"dqxzj67n3t\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefdqxzj67n3t\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>Of course, a given reform bill might not actually hurt the district's broader economic interests -- as opposed to those of big ag companies.

And I'm not sure that this applies to the US context. I think it's useful to distinguish between party polarization (democrats vs republicans) and ideological polarization (liberals vs conservatives). Almost any reform passed in the 1950s-1970s probably had bipartisan support, since the two parties were hardly ideologically polarized at that time. But many of these reforms were absolutely politicized on ideological grounds (liberals typically were in favor of civil rights and environmental reforms. Conservatives were not). I think the anti-slavery movement fits this description as well. Until the last few years before the civil war, the two major political parties (democrats and whigs) both contained large groups of pro-slavery and anti-slavery politicians. So opposition to slavery was bipartisan even though it was clearly polarized on ideological and geographical grounds. Only in the few years before the civil war did the major parties become polarized on the slavery issue.<br>In recent decades, since the two major parties have become more ideologically polarized, it seems like major reforms were politicized on both party and ideological lines (LGBTQ rights and climate change come to mind).<br><br>So, my guess is that most major social reforms in US history were highly politicized on ideological lines, but not necessarily on party lines.
