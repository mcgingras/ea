Somehow I hadn't thought about the value of inactive groups vs no group.</p>\n<p>I know a few university cities in Finland with only 1-2 EAs who don't have time to commit to running a group many hours a week. I will ask them if they'd be interested in this and do a ~10-step manual on how to set up a mini group and how EA Finland can support them.  (Maybe calling it a contact group \ud83e\udd14) Maybe an incentive to start the group (in addition to having a bigger impact) could be that they automatically get invited to EA Finland's organizers only-events and retreats.</p>\n<p>Adding to Yonatan Cales comment, I think I would add just a few bullet points in the manual on what to do (or not do) to avoid having a negative impact. There are lots of good posts and EA community building resources about what could go wrong and how to avoid that but I think most of them are relevant only  later, when a group is committing &gt;1 hour a month to community building.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Karla Still"}}, {"_id": "arexhuxqDCaJSzdEs", "postedAt": "2022-11-24T19:25:00.308Z", "postId": "AoT98q6xrFv3K8CAk", "htmlBody": "<p>Here is now EA Finland's <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rEfnsJzgEuyh_rZNLiM3FLtlImYdrbWUiGQxTLGt48E/edit?usp=sharing\">Start a Mini EA Group in Finland </a>document.
