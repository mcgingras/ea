The subsidy incentivizes research by compensating innovators for their fixed cost investments in R&amp;D and manufacturing capacity. The commitments to buy a certain quantity at a certain price ensure the vaccine is affordable and widely available. The subsidy is conditional on a co-payment (this is the part that is close to marginal cost) from governments in low and middle income countries \u2013 without it, the developer receives nothing. This incentivizes firms to develop vaccines countries will actually use, not just those that meet technical specifications.</p>\n<p>So while patents trade-off innovation incentives with affordable access, AMCs help us achieve both. And the price strategy means that AMCs encourage deployment at scale in a way that most prizes do not.\nAMCs are a kind of inversion to typical \u2018push funding\u2019 \u2013 they instead \u2018pull\u2019 innovation towards a goal by paying for outputs and outcomes. They don\u2019t require funders to choose which research efforts to back in advance \u2013 they can just commit to rewarding the innovations that succeed.
