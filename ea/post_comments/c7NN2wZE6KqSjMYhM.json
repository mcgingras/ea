Only directional airflow into a laboratory (inflow velocity) had a positive effect and is still used today to protect against cross-contamination in non-technically airtight rooms (e.g., BSL-3 laboratories).</p></blockquote><p>I think the above is in tension with Alison seemingly highlighting the importance of a differential pressure gradient in CDC's BSL-3 lab:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Let\u2019s talk about a few more of the things you uncovered. So there\u2019s the duct tape on the door. Are there other examples that you remember particularly vividly from this period of investigation?</p><p><strong>Alison Young:</strong> Yeah, definitely. So that same building with the duct tape, Building 18, has had over the years a whole series of these airflow problems. Whether it\u2019s other power outages, which it also has had, or the airflow systems not working properly \u2014 either being neutral or, on occasions, going positive.</p><p>That negative airflow has been a challenge. And one of the things I\u2019ve learned over time is that that is one of the more complex systems in these labs. Not just this Building 18, but getting that airflow to work properly is something that is very difficult for these facilities. So there have been numerous incidents of that: puffs of air where people are walking by and all of a sudden they feel this puff of air enough that it sort of blew someone\u2019s hair coming out of a lab. Luckily, that particular lab was not hot at the time. So there have been those kinds of things.</p></blockquote><p>In terms of:</p><blockquote><p>Can you be specific about the proposed changes to biosafety precautions you think are misguided, including linking and/or quoting them?</p></blockquote><p>I did not mean to claim some proposed changes to biosafety are misguided. I would also not remove the ones related to directional airflow and a differential pressure gradient unless we have significant evidence they are not needed. On the other hand, I think it is good to be transparent about how much evidence is supporting the precautions.</p>", "parentCommentId": "w4yEufQYBi5kkeE6k", "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}, {"_id": "ia5KbDeGGq5M5WLXi", "postedAt": "2024-01-15T20:12:17.256Z", "postId": "c7NN2wZE6KqSjMYhM", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>\"I got the impression listening to the podcast that directional airflow, and a differential pressure gradient were critical safety measures even today\", not just in BSL-3 labs, but more broadly.

Wedum and his team, as I detail in <a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/alison-young/pandoras-gamble/\"><i>Pandora\u2019s Gamble</i></a>, did intensive investigations trying to determine the source of each of the hundreds of accidental infections associated with Detrick\u2019s biological experiments. These lab-associated infections weren\u2019t occurring just among the scientists performing experiments. The invisible, accidental spread of pathogens outside of the labs was also resulting in infections among secretaries, animal caretakers, dishwashers, carpenters and the occasional spouse.</p><p>Because so few of these infections could be traced to an obvious lab accident, pioneering research was done during this era using high-speed photography to examine how infectious aerosols could be generated by routine lab activities like the removal of stoppers out of bottles or the transfer of liquid specimens between containers. Wedum\u2019s team studied the risks posed by animals used in experiments: not just from biting or scratching workers, but also their ability to spread infectious organisms by shaking their contaminated fur or through human contact with their cage litter. They even studied the risks of microbes contaminating the beards of men working in labs.</p><p>But this kind of intensive study of the risks \u2013 and effectiveness \u2013 of lab procedures and equipment has not been the norm in recent decades, according to experts interviewed for <i>Pandora\u2019s Gamble</i>. While government and private funders have spent billions of dollars on biological research \u2013 including funding experiments that make pathogens more dangerous than what is found in nature, there has been little funding or focus \u2013 since the Wedum era \u2013 on studies to assess lab safety equipment and practices.

These particular labs, which represent <a href=\"https://www.globalbiolabs.org/\">a small fraction</a> of biological research labs around the world, have different layers of engineering than lower level labs. The duct-taped door at the CDC, for example, was in a biosafety level 3 lab that had a reversal of its airflow \u2013 blowing positive (outward) into a clean corridor.</p><p>And while the post here cites a couple of papers questioning the necessity of certain aspects of directional airflow in lab facilities, it's worth noting that these papers, so far, have not resulted in changes in what are considered current best practices for containment at BSL-3 and BSL-4 lab facilities.</p><p>The current 6th edition of <i>Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories, </i>often just referred to as the BMBL, is considered a leading advisory document \"recommending best practices for the safe conduct of work in biomedical and clinical laboratories from a biosafety perspective.\" &nbsp;In it you can find multiple references to the importance of directional airflow in modern labs. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/labs/BMBL.html\">https://www.cdc.gov/labs/BMBL.html</a>&nbsp;</p><p>But the bottom line is that there remains a significant need for applied biosafety research on a wide range of engineering and human factors.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Alison Young"}}, {"_id": "mGsmqpnutbCJ2piPu", "postedAt": "2024-01-16T10:12:14.681Z", "postId": "c7NN2wZE6KqSjMYhM", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>Overall it looks to me like Young is trying to give a high level introduction to biosafety, including giving specific examples of historical failures to explain why you care how the air is flowing.

The post was supposed to be a little bit of a call to being curious and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GW3cxBurTNKHs352S/controlling-for-a-thinker-s-big-idea\">controlling for a thinker\u2019s big idea</a> rather than confidently pointing to conflicts. It is also worth noting that optimal number of biosafety failures (and maybe even pandemics?) is not 0. As Bryan Caplan <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/bryan-caplan-stop-reading-the-news/#cold-open-000000\">said</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Whenever there is a disaster, the normal reaction is, \u201cSomething has to be done to stop this from ever happening again.\u201d Again, the question is: Maybe we should just stay the course, because this is the right number of disasters to have? Which horrifies people. But look, we shouldn\u2019t have earthquake codes so strict that no building ever collapses, no matter what, because the effect on housing costs would be astronomical. So why don\u2019t you tell me what is the correct number of houses to collapse in earthquakes [or airflow issues in biosafety labs]? And then we\u2019re only going to cover it in the media if we exceed that number. You just imagine people\u2019s heads exploding, like, \u201cNo, we have to cover every single one so that we can have the proper reaction!\u201d This proper reaction is what makes housing costs too high.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, it still makes sense to be aware of the risks, and I think it is great that Alison has contributed to that!
