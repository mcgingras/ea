Yeah I kind of knew that writing on this topic was unusually likely to make people unhappy with me. But I'm still not certain what if anything I should have done differently. I don't really want to not share thinking I think may be (nontrivially) helpful for some people just because it will make others unhappy with me (if there's a deeper harm than \"making people unhappy with me\" which I'm not tracking, that might change my view). And I also don't really want to make it about my issues, something I suspect that many people have spent more than enough time engaging with already (though I'm super happy to have peripheral conversation on that, it feels like putting it in the post proper would be an error by making it more about me than I think it should be).</p><p>I guess I'm leaning towards agreeing it would have been better to acknowledge the issue up-front, and posted a longer comment at the time of making the post talking a little about this, saying that of course people might reasonably have suspicion of my judgement on some of these topics, but for obvious reasons I've spent some time dwelling on them and wanting to share what I've got, etc.</p><p>BTW, as I'm alluding to there: it's not total coincidence that this is a topic that I've been thinking about, since one of several generators for the thinking was \"without fixing my mistaken beliefs, what kind of basic shift in orientation might nonetheless have helped me to avoid past errors\". I don't think it's a *majority* generator, and think e.g. SBF is a larger part. However, finding a frame which simultaneously seemed to give good answers to \"how could things have been different to reduce issues with SBF\" and also \"how could I have oriented differently to reduce risk of harmful errors in the vicinity of attraction\" provided some boost to my thinking that there was really something helpful and worth sharing.</p>", "parentCommentId": "ihdbMCXHRggzK3BYj", "user": {"username": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt"}}, {"_id": "tgFbbRc3JRSS9327h", "postedAt": "2024-02-27T21:27:24.455Z", "postId": "cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw", "htmlBody": "<p>I imagine this summary not being super helpful to people.</p><p>More specifically:</p><ul><li>I think the executive summary is fine</li><li>The first sentences of each of Key points 1, 2, and 3 are all sort of pointing to the same point<ul><li>If they were combined in one key point that would probably work</li><li>Unfortunately the second sentence in each case is making a different point, so the flow could be a bit confusing<ul><li>The second sentence of Key point 2 doesn't feel very key</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Key point 4 is pretty good</li><li>Key point 5 kind of feels like nonsense (like if I squint I can see what it's saying, but I don't expect it to be helpful for any readers of the summary)</li><li>Key point 6 is not inaccurate, but I wouldn't have guessed it was very key</li></ul><p>Of course it's possible I'm too close to the source material to judge well!

In other words, I think every time a male transgresses towards a female, it is possible to frame it in terms of wholesomeness, asocial behavior, etc. But this might miss the point that when it comes to the frequency of transgressions, they are much more frequent from males towards females than the other way around, so it seems such individualistic analysis misses an important driver of all such behavior.&nbsp;<br><br>In danger of writing too long, it is a bit like safety incidents on airplanes: Each incident can be explained in terms of a missing bolt, or the missed replacement of some seal.

In short, I completely agree that sometimes you need visionary thought or revolutionary action. At the same time I think revolutionary action -- taken by people convinced that they are right -- can be terrifying and harmful (e.g. the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution\">Cultural Revolution</a>). I'd really prefer if people engaging in such actions felt some need to first feel into what is unwholesome about them, so that they're making the choices consciously and may be able to steer away from the most harmful versions.</p><p>On your third point, I kind of feel the other way? Like I think it feels wholesome to have a certain level of support for staff, but lots of cushy benefits doesn't really feel wholesome, and I feel is more likely to come from people in an optimizing \"how do we make ourselves attractive to staff?\" mindset. (Am I an outlier here? Does it feel wholesome to you to have cushy benefits for staff?)</p><p>Edit: On the third point, I do think that emphasising wholesomeness would lead to fewer people pushing themselves to the point of burnout. I have mixed feelings about this. The optimistic view is that it would help people to find healthy sustainable balances, and also help reduce people being putoff because of seeing burnout. The pessimistic view is that it would lead to just less work, and also perhaps less of a culture of taking important things very seriously.</p>", "parentCommentId": "fyzETdbRoEhxrmtyq", "user": {"username": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt"}}, {"_id": "4iCTakDr2MtLqSQPJ", "postedAt": "2024-03-01T04:37:12.012Z", "postId": "cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for writing this, a pleasure to read as always.</p><p>I must admit I come away being rather confused by what you mean by 'wholesomeness'. Is wholesomeness basically consequentialism but with more vibes and less numbers? Your account makes it seem quite close to consequentialism. It also seems really close to virtue ethics - you try to differentiate it by saying it rejects <i>\"focus[ing] single-mindedly on excelling at one virtue\" </i>but my impression was that virtue ethics was all about balance the golden median anyway. And then it seems pretty close to sincerity/integrity also.</p><p>I was especially confused by this section:</p><blockquote><h3>Clean / traditional living</h3><p>Working a normal respectable job, going to church on Sundays, staying sober and off drugs, avoiding sexual promiscuity or strange counterculture \u2014 these are all kinds of \u201cclean\u201d living that might sometimes be called \u201cwholesome\u201d.</p><p>Often they will also be somewhat wholesome on my concept. Over-indulgence in general, and addiction in particular, are unwholesome as they ground in an imbalanced sense of priorities. And, all else equal, there is something wholesome about comporting with the culture around us. However, all else is not always equal. There\u2019s something wholesome about letting people do the things they\u2019re drawn to, and unwholesome about puritanically suppressing that. Moreover, there\u2019s something important and wholesome about people experimenting \u2014 both for their own learning, and ultimately to find better ways for things to be.</p></blockquote><p>Apparently the activities I think most people would be most likely to label wholesomeness are only <i>\"often... somewhat\"</i> wholesome. And I think most people would basically never describe experimenting with drugs as wholesome. Maybe it might be good, but if it is good its good for some other reason (like it's educational), not because its wholesome.</p><p>I think you actually have a really revisionist account of 'wholesomeness' - so revisitionist I think you should probably just pick a new word. It seems like you are trying to rely on some of the vibes of the word while giving it a new meaning which fixates on the word 'whole' to the neglect of the actual historical denotation. Samwise is one of the most wholesome characters I know, but it's not because he was attending to the whole of Middle Earth - it's because of his courage and humility, and his loyalty to Frodo, Rosie and the Shire. A good officer - or Denethor - comes much closer to attending to the whole, but that doesn't mean his batsman isn't more wholesome.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Larks"}}, {"_id": "mGeLzvrKw9bmNcGNQ", "postedAt": "2024-03-01T09:44:52.640Z", "postId": "cDdTbDPQW8s6XTgJw", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>Is wholesomeness basically consequentialism but with more vibes and less numbers?</p></blockquote><p>I think it's partially that (where the point of the vibes is often that they're helpful for tracking things which aren't directly good/bad, but have an increased chance of causing good/bad things down the line). It's also a bit like \"consequentialism, but with some extra weight on avoiding negative consequences to things you're interacting with\" (where the point of this is that it distributes responsibility in a sensible way across agents).</p><blockquote><p>I think you actually have a really revisionist account of 'wholesomeness' - so revisitionist I think you should probably just pick a new word.</p></blockquote><p>I agree that my sense is somewhat revisionist, although I think it's more grounded in the usual usage than you're giving it credit for. I did consider choosing a different word, but after talking it through with some folks felt better about \"wholesome\" than the alternatives. The main way in which I care about the vibes of the existing word is for people putting it into practice. I think if people ask of an action they're considering \"what are the ways in which this might not be wholesome?\", it will be easy to feel answers to that question. If I try to define \"holistically-good\" and then people ask \"what are the ways in which this might not be holistically-good?\", I think they'll more get caught up in explicit verbal models and not notice things which they might have caught as answers to the first question.&nbsp;</p><p>Put another way: one of my guiding principles for this is to try to have an account of things such that I think it could lead to people doing the good ambitious versions of EA, but such that I find it hard to imagine SBF trying to follow it could have made the same mistakes, even if there was motivated cognition towards doing so. Stuff about side constraints doesn't really feel robust enough to me. If there's a new term it could be vulnerable to a lot of reinterpretation.
