As you said, you focused on US and UK. But was it your intent to try to extrapolate that as a global value so we can show how cost-effective global poverty interventions are? Then if you do the same surveys about how much more poor workers would demand to be paid because of a risky occupation, the value of statistical life would be much smaller. So I ended up doing a broad distribution for the global value <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13753-016-0097-2\">here</a>. Note that I sidestepped the discounting issue by saying that the value of statistical life is growing, so we should not have to discount the current values.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Denkenberger"}}, {"_id": "us62zzzg8KWwzha3C", "postedAt": "2018-10-11T16:54:28.725Z", "postId": "XpuWDpTeeYn37SFui", "htmlBody": "<p>I found this very useful in clarifying my thinking in how to measure charitable projects of different types (Education, Job Creation, Health, etc.)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "JohnGalt"}}]
