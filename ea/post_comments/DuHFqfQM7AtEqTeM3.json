I also had these questions come up in my own mind while learning this epistemology.</p><p>Here is how I understand the terms you mentioned:</p><p><i>Knowledge</i>&nbsp; &nbsp; Information with influence. Or information that has causal power (ie. genes, ideas). Fundamentally knowledge is our best guesses.</p><p><i>Understanding</i> &nbsp; Is part of a knowledge transfer process, which varies from subject to subject. It is the rebuilding of knowledge in ones own mind. In people it\u2019s an attempt to replicate a piece of knowledge.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Trail and Error - Yes, I agree Alpha zero has more knowledge than Stockfish, but it\u2019s not new knowledge to the world. Please let me try to explain, because this question also puzzled me for a while. A kind of trail and error happens in evolution as well. Genes create knowledge about the environment they live in buy replicating, with different variations (trial), and dying (error). Couldn\u2019t a computer program do the same thing, only faster? I think it can. But in a simulated environment that people created. The difference is, genes have access to a niche in the physical world, where they confront problems in nature. They solve these problems or they go extinct. A computer program doesn\u2019t have the same access to our physical environment. Therefore people must simulate it. But we still don\u2019t know enough about our own environment to simulate it accurately enough, we have huge gaps in our knowledge about the laws of nature.</p><p>When a chess program, programs it\u2019s own rules and step out of its\u2019 game, that would hint at AGI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Creativity in AI art generators - What you are seeing does not involve the creative process. Original art is being displayed and can be misunderstood as creative. It\u2019s an algorithm made by people, to combine a variation of images, based on our inputs. The images are new an have never been seen before. But it\u2019s not a creative, problem solving process that is happening.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I agree, there will be many cases where our AI will be useful and help people solve their problems, like Elisa whom you mentioned. People are still behind the scenes pulling the strings. And when people create new knowledge (like a deeper understanding phycology) we will include it in our programs and Elisa will work much better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I really appreciate your questions.
