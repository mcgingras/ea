Some thoughts on your essay:</p>\n<p>1) Re the hotel name, I feel like this should primarily be made with the possibility of paying non-EAs in mind. EAs will - I hope - hear of the project by reputation rather than name, so the other guests are the ones you're most likely to need make a strong first impression on. 'Effective Altruism Hotel' definitely seems poor in that regard - 'Athena' seems ok (though maybe there's some benefits to renaming for the sake of renaming if the hotel was failing when you bought it)</p>\n<p>2) &gt; Another idea for empty rooms is offering outsiders the chance to purchase a kind of \u201ccatastrophic risk insurance\u201d; paying, say, \u00a31/day to reserve the right to live at the hotel in the event of a global (or regional) catastrophe. </p>\n<p>This seems dubious to me (it's the only point of your essay I particularly disagreed with). It's a fairly small revenue stream for you, but means you're attracting people who're that little bit more willing to spend on their own self-interest (ie that little bit less altruistic), and penalises people who just hadn't heard of the project. Meanwhile, in the actual event, what practical effect would it have? Would you turn away people who showed up early when the sponsors arrived for their room?</p>\n<p>If you want an explicit policy on using it as a GCR shelter, it seems like 'first come first served' would be at least as meritocratic, require less bureaucracy and offer a much more enforceable Schelling point.</p>\n<p>3) As you say, I think this will be more appealing the more people it has involved from the beginning,  so I would suggest aggressively marketing the idea in all EA circles which seem vaguely relevant, subject to the agreement of the relevant moderators - not that high a proportion of EAs read this forum, and of those who do, not that many will see this post. It's a really cool idea that I hope people will talk about, but again they'll do so a lot more if it's already seen as a success.</p>\n<p>4) You describe it in the link, but maybe worth describing the Trustee role where you first mention it - or at least linking to it at that point.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Arepo"}}, {"_id": "ZjR4wPWorRnK5Hk6C", "postedAt": "2018-06-04T22:29:42.197Z", "postId": "JdqHvyy2Tjcj3nKoD", "htmlBody": "<p>I agree with all of these points, esp #2. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "FZZgFQEPBebWjkyma", "user": {"username": "Khorton"}}, {"_id": "K8Kxiqh3P5EmsdLiv", "postedAt": "2018-06-05T13:13:07.219Z", "postId": "JdqHvyy2Tjcj3nKoD", "htmlBody": "<p>Kudos for doing this.

However, the position that we should discourage funding the bottom 95% of projects seems really extreme to me, and it also seems like a really crude way to address downside risk.</p>\n<p>Even if there is some downside risk from any given project, the expected value is probably positive, solely based on the fact that some EA thinks it's a good idea.  <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/the-moral-value-of-information-amanda-askell/\">Value of information</a> is another consideration in favor of taking action, especially doing research (I'm guessing most people who move to Blackpool will want to do research of some sort).</p>\n<p>As for a good way to decrease downside risk, I would like to see a lot more people do what Joey does in <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/xj/500_prize_for_anybody_who_can_change_our_current/\">this post</a> and ask people to provide the best arguments they can against their project (or maybe ask a question on <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/\">Metaculus</a>).</p>\n<p>The issue with downside risk is not that the world is currently on a wonderful trajectory that must not be disturbed.  Rather, any given disturbance is liable to have effects that are hard to predict--but if we spent more time thinking and did more research, maybe we could get a bit better at predicting these effects.  Loss aversion will cause us to overweight the possibility of a downside, but if we're trying to maximize expected value then we should weight losses and gains of the same size equally.  I'm willing to believe highly experienced EAs are better at thinking about downside risk, but I don't think the advantage is overwhelming, and I suspect being a highly experienced EA can create its own set of <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/16g/anonymous_comments/a0p\">blind spots</a>.

Consequently, optimizing for initial success seems more important than optimizing for future expansion. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The best feasible EA candidate is likely to have less external validation of managerial capability than a similarly qualified external candidate, who might be a hotel manager already!

I have several thoughts on the idea and on the comment threads so I will number them.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>For long term sustainability working towards some paying/donation shorter term guests and some stipend non-paying long term guests seems practical and doable. Another name for a Bed &amp; Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner, is a spa. A growing market that is largely not directly advertised to in mainstream ad campaigns is the over 50 year old bracket. They have more time and money, and also likely more concern for health. A vegan diet can be a healing diet. A quiet relaxing bird watching venue may be very desirable for a stress reducing get away. Marton Mere Local Nature Reserve is nearby and sounds underutilized from the online descriptions as it has no parking of its own and no gift shop/organized tours etc.. Bus transport from the hotel for spa type guest might also include educational tours by some non-paying residents whose altruistic goals are wetland or bird sanctuary oriented. The murmurations  and beach front nearby would fit nicely into a spa type program.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Athena was the goddess who sprang forth from Zeus in full armor and ready for battle. She is considered the &quot;Goddess of wisdom, war and the crafts, and favourite daughter of Zeus, Athena was, perhaps, the wisest, most courageous, and certainly the most resourceful of the Olympian gods.&quot; <a href=\"https://www.ancient.eu/athena/\">https://www.ancient.eu/athena/</a> . I don't think you could think of a more effective altruistic champion if you had two years to focus on that. I also wouldn't recommend highlighting some letters of a name more than others. Passers-by would likely just think your sign needed a fresh coat of paint. If the goal was a mixed set of paying/donating guests and nonpaying EA workers than a simple name for the mainstream would be ideal. Passersby might stay for the birdwatching and good food and then become interested and active in the EA work. EA activists would already be aware of your hotel - springing forth fully ready to support EA work in a variety of ways.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>EA workers interested in relocating to a hotel/spa like resort might have projects that coincide with health management, quantity food production, stress reduction, wetland management or ocean health. Your location might be the magnet for the project.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Preventative health or non-pharmaceutical health care is difficult to fund and often faces roadblocks from lobbyists or government that funds more profit oriented health care. The population as a whole is getting sicker on average, young and old, and increased heat is going to negatively impact the chronically ill more than the person of ideal health. Increased temperature increases oxidative stress on the body and increases volatile chemical release into the atmosphere which adds additional oxidative stress to the body, whether healthy or chronically ill. Increased temperatures are associated with increased irritability and violence.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Homelessness and lack of jobs that support living costs within commuting range is an increasing problem in many or most areas. Group living situations are not allowed in many zoning areas so as a model project of something different your hotel project is a prototype. Having donating/paying guests could help support more amenities such as tour buses or an exercise facility onsite and better fund a healthy menu and adequate staff to prepare it. Nonpaying EA guests might volunteer or also be working on quantity food production projects and be interested in a test group for recipe development. The production of healthy food that is low cost and easy to prepare would be an effective altruistic need for refugee or climate crisis response as well as urban homeless populations. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Hotel Manager position does sound like more staff or volunteers would be needed to delegate some responsibility for daily chores and food production. I am a Registered Dietitian with food safety training and some experience in quantity food production for baked goods and overseeing the work of a full-time dietary manager for a residential facility kitchen. It is a lot of work and part of the work can be achieved by starting with a set of quantity food recipes and menu. If that is provided by a wholesale food business it can mean a menu and recipes based on processed foods that are quicker to prepare but are likely not providing as much health for an increased grocery expense. Bulk ingredients are cost effective and healthy but need time to prepare. Dividing the job into a person focused on hotel and dietary management and another person focused on EA project support and review of applications might be a good idea. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Menus and recipes and kitchen management for a vegetarian cafeteria may be available already, why re-invent the wheel - the best cafeteria food I've ever eaten was not at a hospital. It was at the university where I did my post Bachelor's credentialing program for dietetics, Andrews University. They only have vegetarian food. <a href=\"https://www.andrews.edu/shp/publichealth/\">https://www.andrews.edu/shp/publichealth/</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I am interested in your idea and the Hotel Manager or Trustee positions but am not a U.K. resident, however I have a current passport and the virtual world is already at our fingertips.

The long term benefits and sustainability of group living has been an interest of mine for decades. In the U.S. many problems can be traced back the closing of public residential mental health facilities. Mental health patients now are overly represented in homeless and prison populations and the cost of total care is likely more than a group home would cost.

Upvoted for that.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While it's really impressive how low the rent at the hotel will be, rent cost is rarely a major reason for a project's funding constraints</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Do you realise that the figure cited (3-4k a year) isn't rent cost? It's total living cost. At least in my case that's 4 times as little as what I'm running on, and I'm pretty cheap. For others the difference might be much larger.</p>\n<p>For example a project might have an actually high-impact idea that doesn't depend on location. Instead of receiving $150k from CEA to run half a year in the bay with 3 people, they could receive $50k and run for 3 years in Blackpool with 6 people instead. CEA could then fund 3 times as many projects, and it's impact would effectively stretch 6<em>2</em>3=36 times further.\nComing from that perspective, staying in the world's most expensive cities is just non-negotiable. At least for projects (coding, research, etc) that wouldn't benefit an even stronger multiplier from being on-location.\nAnd this isn't just projection. I know at least one project that is most likely moving their team to the EA hotel.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Instead, the hotel could become a hub for everyone who doesn't study at a university or work on a project that EA donors find worth funding, i.e. the hotel would mainly support work that the EA community as a whole would view as lower-quality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm pretty sure EA projects find many projects net-positive even if they don't find them worth funding. For the same reason that I'd buy a car if I could afford one. Does that mean I find cars lower-quality than my bicycle? Nope.</p>\n<p>Imo it's a very simple equation. EA's need money to live. So they trade (waste) a major slice of their resources to ineffective endeavors for money. We can take away those needs for &lt;10% the cost, effectively making a large amount of people go from part-time to full-time EA. Assuming that the distribution of EA effectiveness isn't too steeply inequal (ie there are still effective EA's out there), this intervention is the most effective I've seen thus far.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "vLtqSuEh7ZPm7jwYT", "user": {"username": "toonalfrink"}}, {"_id": "p4CxHuLnf8EZndJzw", "postedAt": "2018-06-18T14:14:29.859Z", "postId": "JdqHvyy2Tjcj3nKoD", "htmlBody": "<p>I've not yet had anyone say it's a dealbreaker (and of course people are allowed to buy meat from takeaways - or microwaveable burgers etc - with their spending money if they are really craving it..).

A junior researcher, without an access to a supervisor who has in-depth knowledge of the given subject domain, is likely to end up tapping in the dark and trying out all kinds of paths that are far from being optimal.

It's not meant to be a long-term lifestyle for an EA. I think it's meant to give less financially comfortable EAs a bit of freedom and breathing space between projects/careers.</p>\n<p>I think this gap exists. The funder who says, &quot;I know you don't have the time or energy to make a grant-proposal-standard case for why I should support you yet. And that's why I'm going to.&quot; Maybe I'm wrong. But hey, let's build it and see if they come :-)</p>\n<p>I also think that often the way in which funding is offered is important. In my case, if I started to struggle financially, I'd be excited and proud to move into the EA Hotel. On the other hand, I'd feel somewhat embarrassed and burdensome to move back in with my parents, I've turned down financial support from three close EA friends because of what it might do to our relationship (and accepted very gratefully from two other less close EA friends &lt;3), and I hate the thought of people questioning my motives as a community organiser if I accept a higher salary at EA London. I can also imagine people treating the EA Hotel as a last resort because e.g. future employers might think it looks like a cult. My point is more that it's a different kind of option, and people have all sorts of reasons for not wanting to accept funding that they need. (Note that the personal, somewhat emotional relevance probably makes me slightly biased in favour of this project overall.)</p>\n<p>Then again, maybe I'm being too blase. I have no idea how many EA project ideas aren't getting funded due to lack of coordination / management time / funds in a particular area, and how many aren't getting funded because funders think they <em>shouldn't be</em> funded. The term &quot;crucial considerations&quot; makes me immediately think, &quot;Ah. Yes. Yes, it's very easy to do well-intentioned harm.&quot; And actually I think I place an unusually high value on private research relative to action (publicising research can be pretty <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf\">action-y</a>), which might warrant a small group of community leaders withholding a lot of funding without much explanation until they've done a lot more research...Unfortunately, I also think it makes sense to be pretty suspicious of that approach.</p>\n<p>No conclusions. Just some considerations for y'all.</p>\n<p>(Incidentally, rejection is usually at least a bit hurtful. I wouldn't be surprised if all the job/funding rejections in our community - especially alongside all the headhunting, careers advice, talent gap talk, &quot;EA's not funding-constrained&quot; talk, pressure to reach relentlessly higher and reprioritise every 5 minutes etc. - was driving a lot of the enthusiasm for funders with more relaxed standards, including the upvotes on this article relative to the Charity Entrepreneurship one.)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "vLtqSuEh7ZPm7jwYT", "user": null}, {"_id": "8p3xJYe4idwHycfAx", "postedAt": "2018-07-05T23:09:30.177Z", "postId": "JdqHvyy2Tjcj3nKoD", "htmlBody": "<p>The Unilateralist's Curse refers to situations where many people oppose a project and only one person supports it.

So this could almost be considered a fully general counterargument against funding any project.  (Note that this thinking directly opposes replaceability: replaceability encourages you to fund projects no other funder is willing to fund; this line of reasoning says just the opposite.)  Anyway, I think the EA Hotel could easily be <em>less</em> vulnerable to adverse selection effects, if it appeals to a different crowd.

People like Joey and Paul Christiano have offered prizes for the best arguments against their beliefs.  I don't believe OpenPhil has ever done this, despite having a lot more money.</p>\n<p>In general, funding doesn't do much to address the unilateralist's curse because any single funder can act unilaterally to fund a project that all the other funders think is a bad idea.  I once proposed an <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/19d/update_on_effective_altruism_funds/asa\">EA donor's league</a> to address this problem, but people weren't too keen on it for some reason.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it doesn't seem clear to me that &quot;the fact that some EA thinks it's a good idea&quot; is sufficient grounds to attribute positive expected value to a project, given no other information</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's a thought experiment that might be helpful as a baseline scenario.  Imagine you are explaining effective altruism to a stranger in a loud bar.  After hearing your explanation, the stranger responds &quot;That's interesting.  Funny thing, I gave no thought to EA considerations when choosing my current project.  I just picked it because I thought it was cool.&quot;  Then they explain their project to you, but unfortunately, the bar is too loud for you to hear what they say, so you end up just nodding along pretending to understand.  Now assume you have two options: you can tell the stranger to ditch their project, or you can stay silent.  For the sake of argument, let's assume that if you tell the stranger to ditch their project, they will ditch it, but they will also get soured on EA and be unreceptive to EA messages in the future.  If you stay silent, the stranger will continue their project and remain receptive to EA messages.  Which option do you choose?</p>\n<p>My answer is, having no information about the stranger's project, I have no particular reason to believe it will be either good or bad for the world.  So I model the stranger's project as a small random perturbation on humanity's trajectory, of the sort that happen thousands of times per day.  I see the impact of such perturbations as basically neutral on expectation.  In the same way the stranger's project could have an unexpected downside, it could also have an unexpected upside.  And in the same way that the stranger's actions could have some nasty unforeseen consequence, my action of discouraging the stranger could also have some nasty unforeseen consequence!  (Nasty unforeseen consequences of my discouragement action probably won't be as readily observable, but that doesn't mean they <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias\">won't exist</a>.)  So I stay silent, because I gain nothing on expectation by objecting to the project, and I don't want to pay the cost of souring the stranger on EA.</p>\n<p>Suppose you agree with my argument above.  If so, do you think that we should default to discouraging EAs from doing projects in the absence of further information?  Why?  It seems a bit counterintuitive/implausible that being part of the EA community would increase the odds that someone's project creates a downside.  If anything, it seems like being plugged into the community should increase a person's awareness of how their project might pose a risk.  (Consider the EA hotel in comparison to an alternative of having people live cheaply as individuals.  Being part of a community of EAs = more peer eyeballs on your project = more external perspectives to spot unexpected downsides.)  And in the same way giving strangers default discouragement will sour them on EA, giving EAs default discouragement on doing any kind of project seems like the kind of thing that will suck the life out of the movement.</p>\n<p>I don't want to be misinterpreted, so to clarify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I am in favor of people discouraging projects if, after looking at the project, they actually think the project will be harmful.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I am in favor of bringing up considerations that suggest a project might be harmful with the people engaged in it, even if you aren't sure about the project's overall impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I'm in favor of people trying to make the possibility of downsides mentally available, so folks will remember to check for them.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I'm in favor of more people doing what Joey does and offering prizes for arguments that their projects are harmful.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I'm in favor of people publicly making themselves available to shoot holes in the project ideas of others.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I'm in favor of people in the EA community trying to coordinate more effectively, engage in moral trade, cooperate in epistemic prisoner's dilemmas, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In general, I think brainstorming potential downsides has high value of information and people should do it more.  But a gamble can still be positive expected value without having purchased any information!  (Also, in order to avoid bias, maybe you should try to spend an equal amount of time brainstorming unexpected upsides.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I think it may be reasonable to focus on projects which have passed the acid test of trying to think of plausible downsides (since those projects are likely to be higher expected value).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But I don't really see what purpose blanket discouragement serves.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "g9vkaZrboGYPCGpMu", "user": {"username": "John_Maxwell_IV"}}, {"_id": "ZbD4i9qv4nRpSNAKZ", "postedAt": "2018-07-16T12:40:02.209Z", "postId": "JdqHvyy2Tjcj3nKoD", "htmlBody": "<p>The OpenPhil/OpenAI article was a good read, thanks, although I haven't read the comments on either post or Ben's latest thoughts, and I don't really have an opinion either way on the value/harm of OpenPhil funding OpenAI if they did so &quot;to buy a seat on OpenAI\u2019s board for Open Philanthropy Project executive director Holden Karnofsky&quot;. But of course, I wasn't suggesting that centralised action is never harmful; I was suggesting that it's better on average [edit: in UC-type scenarios, which I'm not sure your two examples were...man this stuff is confusing!]. It's also ironic that part of the reason funding OpenAI might have been a bad idea seems to be that it creates more of a Unilateralist's Curse scenario (although I did notice that the first comment claims this is not their current strategy): &quot;OpenAI\u2019s primary strategy is to hire top AI researchers to do cutting-edge AI capacity research and publish the results, in order to ensure widespread access.&quot;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we think that &quot;individuals underestimate potential downsides relative to their estimations concerning potential upsides&quot;, why do we expect funders to be immune to this problem? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Excellent question.

If they didn't have much power then I'd say go for it. If their project would have large consequences before anyone else could step in I'd say stop. As I said before, &quot;I currently still think the EA Hotel has positive expected value - I don't think it's giving individuals enough power for the Unilateralist's Curse to really apply.&quot; I genuinely do expect the typical idea someone has for improving the status quo to be harmful, whether they're an EA or a stranger in a bar. Most of the time it's good to encourage innovation anyway, because there are feedback mechanisms/power structures in place to stop things getting out of hand if they start to really not look like good ideas.

Perhaps we agree that: In your typical real-life scenario i.e. where an individual does not have unilateral power, we should encourage them to pursue their altruistic ideas.

I don't think there should be &quot;blanket discouragement&quot;. I think the typical project that someone/an EA thinks is a good idea is in fact a bad idea, but that they should test it anyway. I do think there should be blanket discouragement of actions with large consequences that can be taken by a small minority without the endorsement of others (eg. relating to reputational risk or information hazards).]</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "ditHMZogDyaaK8Cti", "user": null}, {"_id": "P8Rg7fx5HccgcfJzF", "postedAt": "2018-08-09T17:37:20.460Z", "postId": "JdqHvyy2Tjcj3nKoD", "htmlBody": "<p>The <a href=\"https://eahotel.org\">website</a> is now up at eahotel.org.

I expect that these economies of scale effects will become even more valuable as the number of people in the hotel grows.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "8MZHHzfPjyiWB2Sfr", "user": {"username": "John_Maxwell_IV"}}, {"_id": "hZgbY6pRZuF22fGJD", "postedAt": "2018-08-24T18:14:25.934Z", "postId": "JdqHvyy2Tjcj3nKoD", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>These chores don't go away if you live in an expensive housing market or make a high income.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you have a high income, though, you can pay other people to do them: for example, instead of cooking you could buy frozen food, buy restaurant food, or hire a cook.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I expect that these economies of scale effects will become even more valuable as the number of people in the hotel grows.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My experience with cooking is that above about 6-10 people the economies of scale drop off a lot.

There are at least three being alluded to here:</p><p>1) Fighting the akrasia of craving animal products</p><p>2) The hassle of finding vegan premade food (else of having to prepare meals for yourself)</p><p>3) Reduced productivity gains from missing certain nutrients (else of having to carefully supplement constantly)</p><p>Of these, the first basically irrelevant in the hotel - you can remove it as a factor by just not giving people the easy option to ingest them. The second is completely irrelevant, since it&#x27;s serving or supplying 90% of the food people will be eating.</p><p>So that only leaves three, which is much talked about, but so far as I know, little studied, so this &#x27;inconvenience&#x27; could even have the wrong sign: the only study on the subject I found from a very quick search showed <a href=\"https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/288281\">increased</a> productivity from veganism for health reasons; also on certain models of willpower that treat it as analogous to a muscle, it could turn out that depriving yourself (even by default, from the absence of offered foods) you improve your willpower and thus become more productive.  </p><p>I&#x27;ve spoken to a number of people who eat meat/animal products for the third reason, but so far as I know they rarely seem to have reviewed any data on the question, and almost never to have actually done any controlled experiments on themselves. Honestly I suspect many of them are using the first two to justify a suspicion of the third (for eg, I know several EAs who eat meat with productivity justifications, but form whom it&#x27;s usually *processed* meat in the context of other dubious dietary choices, so they demonstrably aren&#x27;t optimising their diet for maximal productivity).</p><p>Also, if the third does turn out to be a real factor, it seems very unlikely that more than a tiny bit of meat every few days would be necessary to fix the problem for most people, and going to the shops to buy that for themselves seems unlikely to cause them any serious inconvenience.</p>", "parentCommentId": "Rs6uREtDhiTGdRyCu", "user": {"username": "Arepo"}}, {"_id": "mptqDFwftkC8JBxSX", "postedAt": "2019-03-20T02:23:17.829Z", "postId": "JdqHvyy2Tjcj3nKoD", "htmlBody": "<p>The inconvenience I had in mind is not in your list, and comprises things in the area of, &quot;Prefer to keep the diet I&#x27;m already accustomed to&quot;, &quot;Prefer omnivorous diets on taste etc. grounds to vegan ones&quot;, and so on. I was thinking of an EA who is omnivorous and feels little/no compunction about eating meat (either because they aren&#x27;t &#x27;on board&#x27; with the moral motivation for animal causes in general, or doesn&#x27;t find the arguments for veganism persuasive in particular). I think switching to a vegan diet isn&#x27;t best described as a minor inconvenience for people like these.</p><p>But to be clear, this doesn&#x27;t entail any moral obligation whatsoever on the hotel to serve meat - it&#x27;s not like they are forcing omnivorous guests to be vegan, but just not cooking them free (non-vegan) food. If a vegan offers me to stay at their house a) for free, b) offers vegan food for free too, c) welcomes me to, if I&#x27;m not a fan of vegan food, get my own food to cook at their house whenever I like - which seems basically the counterfactual scenario if I wasn&#x27;t staying with them in the first place, and d) explains all of this before I come, they&#x27;ve been supererogatory in accommodating me, and it would be absurd for me to say they&#x27;ve fallen short in not serving me free omnivorous food which they morally object to.</p><p>Yet insofar as &#x27;free food&#x27; is a selling point of the hotel, &#x27;free <em>vegan</em> food&#x27; may not be so enticing to omnivorous guests. Obviously the offer is still generous by itself, leave alone combined with free accommodation, but one could imagine it making a difference on the margin to omnivores (especially if they are cost-sensitive). </p><p>Thus there&#x27;s a trade-off in between these people and vegans who would be put off if the hotel served meat itself (even if vegan options were also provided). It&#x27;s plausible to me the best option to pick here (leave alone any other considerations) is the more &#x27;vegan-friendly&#x27; policy. But this isn&#x27;t because the trade-off is in fact illusory because the &#x27;vegan-friendly&#x27; policy is has minimal/minor costs to omnivores after all.</p><p>[Empirically though, this doesn&#x27;t seem to amount to all that much given (I understand) the hotel hasn&#x27;t been struggling for guests.] </p>", "parentCommentId": "8tY2gdBmD2hiup8iF", "user": {"username": "Gregory_Lewis"}}, {"_id": "yMLGjXHfydB8EKz9J", "postedAt": "2020-10-12T11:47:16.142Z", "postId": "JdqHvyy2Tjcj3nKoD", "htmlBody": "<p>I&apos;ve just stumbled across this and it seems like an incredible idea to me.
