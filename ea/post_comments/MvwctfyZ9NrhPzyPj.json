It's totally possible Lightcone has long-term contractor or grant recipient relationships that are fully above board and happy for all involved; however, I know some organizations do not. This can be a cost-saving mechanism for the organization that comes at the expense of not just their adherence to employment law, but also security for their team (e.g. everything from eligibility for benefits, to increased individual tax burden, to ineligibility for unemployment compensation).</p>", "parentCommentId": "wL5cRSwFEdgiZzwyc", "user": {"username": "Rockwell Schwartz"}}, {"_id": "6EYBoT2ZkuQsrQqHv", "postedAt": "2023-09-08T20:31:49.753Z", "postId": "MvwctfyZ9NrhPzyPj", "htmlBody": "<p>Rockwell - these norms might sound fair, reasonable, and helpful, at first glance.</p><p>But they show, IMHO, a strong latent sex-negativity, drug-negativity, and cohousing-negativity that is the diametrical opposite of EA's traditional subculture -- at least until recent years, when 'safetyism' seems to have become prioritized over fun, collegiality, and alternative lifestyles.</p><p>Take the issue of 'power differentials', for example. Some people are really attracted to people who are more powerful, higher status, higher prestige, more influential, more famous, wealthier, and/or older. (There is a LOT of psychological research on these kinds of status-seeking mate preferences, which are very common across cultures.) Such people might prefer to 'date coworkers', especially when there is a power differential. This is especially true for the significant proportion of people involved in 'power exchange' relationships (e.g. the BDSM subculture, including Dom/sub relationships). (This is salient to me because I teach Human Sexuality courses at college, and I do research on anti-BDSM and anti-polyamory stigma and prejudice).</p><p>So, prohibiting 'power-differential dating' sounds extra 'safe' at first glance. But it would marginalize and stigmatize everybody who's already in a 'power-differential' relationship, or who wants to be -- especially among people who take their EA identity seriously, and who would prefer to date other EAs. (Also, of course, stigmatizing 'power-differential dating' often boils down to ageism, and the stigmatization of relationships that involve 'age gaps'.)</p><p>Likewise with the notion that EAs should never promote drug use among coworkers, including legal drugs, and alcohol. Let's be honest here. The expansion of many of our 'moral circles' involved psychedelic experiences that allowed us to think about animal sentience, AI, long-termism, and future people in new ways. For those of us with Aspergers (like me) or other autism-spectrum traits, psychoactive drugs such as MDMA helped us develop empathy, compassion, and capacities for social perspective-taking and connection. For those of us with social awkwardness and introversion, light recreational drugs such as alcohol, cannabis, or modafinil can be crucial in loosening up enough to make friends and network at parties and social events. If EA strongly discourages substance use in all EA-adjacent social events, cohousing communities, and friendship circles, then we may be socially handicapping everyone who isn't neurotypical extrovert.... and we may be keeping our moral circles from growing.</p><p>So, in short, I think for any proposed changes to EA subculture norms, we should think very carefully about how these new norms might affect the full range and diversity of people involved in EA, given their actual preferences, experiences, and relationships.&nbsp;</p><p>And we should think about whether the new norms are contrary to the traditions of the EA subculture as it's developed over the last dozen years. In my view, EA is a wonderful subculture, full of fascinating and principled people, with unique perspectives and priorities, and I think this has been due, in no small measure, to the relatively sex-positive, drug-positive, and cohousing-positive features of 'Trad EA' culture.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "NmYQavdvXjzvF8QRK", "postedAt": "2023-09-08T21:01:00.676Z", "postId": "MvwctfyZ9NrhPzyPj", "htmlBody": "<p>(Speaking for myself, in a personal capacity) When I see posts like this, I'm more than a bit confused about which funder/grantee relationships people are thinking about should be included.</p><blockquote><ul><li>Live with their funders/grantees, especially when substantial conflict-of-interest mechanisms are not active</li><li>Date their funders/grantees, especially when substantial conflict-of-interest mechanisms are not active</li><li>Date the partner of their funder/grantee, especially when substantial conflict-of-interest mechanisms are not active</li></ul></blockquote><p>Does it include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Actual active funder of an actual active grantee?&nbsp;<ul><li>eg Alice was the primary investigator of Bob's grant.

When I think over my ~15y in the workplace I can find examples of essentially all of these, in my life or a close coworker, that I wouldn't classify as probably a bad idea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Live with coworkers, especially when there is a power differential and especially when there is a direct report relationship</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In ~2016 one of my housemates who I'd been friends with for 5+ years recruited another of my housemates (who I'd been friends with for 10+ years) to join an EA-aligned company. The next year they recruited me as well. None of us reported to each other, but both of them were tenants of mine (my wife and I owned the house) and we were something like three of five people working for the company in Boston at the time.</p>\n<p>I do think there was risk here, but I also think it was a pretty small one, and this would not have been a good reason for either me or my other housemate to say \"sorry, not going to consider this job\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Date coworkers, especially when there is a power differential and especially when there is a direct report relationship</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In ~2018 while I was working on a team of ~20 at a tech company, two of my coworkers (reporting peers of each other, but I think maybe one was the tech lead of the other) realized they liked each other.  They talked to our manager and HR, one of them moved to another team, and they started dating.  As of when I last caught up with them a few months ago they were still together.  There was definitely risk here, but from the outside it seems like the process for handling it was good, and it would be really sad for both of them if this relationship hadn't happened.</p>\n<p>In ~2008 my girlfriend (now wife) and I applied for a seasonal job where we'd both be working in the kitchen.  We disclosed this relationship to the hiring manager, and while I would normally have reported to the person in my girlfriend's role they set things up so I'd report to someone else.  This wasn't an issue, and I think refusing to hire us because we were dating would have been worse for both the employer and us. Some coworkers dated each other while we were there, and I think this was generally positive.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, cases where the organization does not adjust the org chart in response to relationships are <em>much</em> more risky and almost always a bad idea.  Managers shouldn't date their reports, and neither should anyone date someone where they have significant power over their career. This does mean sometimes choosing between exploring the possibility of a relationship and continuing specific career plans.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Promote drug use among coworkers, including legal drugs, and including alcohol and stimulants</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Something like every place I've worked made alcohol available to employees in social situations, plus caffeine in ~all situations. If this had been cocaine I think we'd clearly see that as promoting cocaine consumption.</p>\n<p><em>Pressuring</em> people to consume drugs seems quite different, and that I'd agree is almost never a good idea.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Live with their funders/grantees, especially when substantial conflict-of-interest mechanisms are not active ... Date their funders/grantees, especially when substantial conflict-of-interest mechanisms are not active</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In ~2015 when I was earning to give a large portion of my earnings went to CEA, which employed my wife (who I also lived with). When the EA Infra fund became available I started donating there instead, because a dynamic where I was donating to my wife's employer didn't seem ideal, but I don't think this was so risky that I should have refrained from donating to CEA until then.</p>\n<p>How risky this category is depends a lot on how large a portion of the relationship each party is. In ~2015 my donations to CEA were ~$85k, which (I think) was a single-digit portion of their fundraising and my wife was one of ~20 employees. There's also a sense in which this is different because once I earned the money it was legally joint property with my wife, though at the time our agreement was we each chose where our earnings went.</p>\n<p>I do agree that this category is generally pretty risky, though, and how you handle CoI matters a lot.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Date the partner of their funder/grantee, especially when substantial conflict-of-interest mechanisms are not active</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No direct experience with this one (not polyamorous) thought it seems like a slightly weaker case of the previous one.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Retain someone as a full-time contractor or grant recipient for the long term, especially when it might not adhere to legal guidelines</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I agree we should follow the law on contractors vs employees, but I don't actually understand what this is trying to get at beyond that?  What's the sort of situation it's trying to avoid?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Offer employer-provided housing for more than a predefined and very short period of time, thereby making an employee\u2019s housing dependent on their continued employment and allowing an employer access to an employee\u2019s personal living space</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In ~2017 I was considering accepting an offer to work for a for-profit EA-adjacent startup in Africa, and the offer to provide housing was a strong positive. In moving to a very different environment, having the support of coworkers who've gone through something similar sounded really valuable.</p>\n<p>From ~2016-2020 my wife and I employed a series of au pairs to watch our kids, which included providing them a room in our house.</p>\n<p>In ~2008 my girlfriend (now wife) and I worked at a seasonal job in a rural area, which included on-site housing.  Not having to commute was a strong positive.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>Now, for all of these I can also easily imagine cases where the risk was not worth it and it went poorly, but I think \"probably shouldn't do\" is too strong overall.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jeff_Kaufman"}}, {"_id": "reQKnehkZRApvYJ2m", "postedAt": "2023-09-14T17:48:39.267Z", "postId": "MvwctfyZ9NrhPzyPj", "htmlBody": "<p>These comments are helpful but I'm still having a difficult time zeroing in on a guiding heuristic here.

I see no issue dating co-workers including ones more/less senior than you but I think there is a real problem dating someone in your chain of command because then there are conflicts of interest at play.
