This is the notion that many people just want to say why things will fail in order to justify why they don't have to try.<br><br>I'm not sure if this is a useful concept (upvote downvote).

In this example. The readers of the New York Times have a lived experience that not much changes and that most grand plans fail. Of course William MacAskill will not be sucessful.

A policy like rent control is bad <a href=\"https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/rent-control-increases-rents\">because it leads to lower supply of rental properties and increases prices outside the rent controlled area</a>. On that basis, it would not be cheems mindset to oppose it.</p><p>Instead, cheems mindset is automatically dismissing an idea on the basis that it cannot be done, or would be hard to do- it would be cheems mindset to oppose introducing rent control legislation because you were worried about staffing levels in [the housing department], for example.</p></blockquote><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn3mk4x9wq11q\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref3mk4x9wq11q\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The two most famous internet dogs two Shiba Inus who the intnet names Doge and Cheems.
