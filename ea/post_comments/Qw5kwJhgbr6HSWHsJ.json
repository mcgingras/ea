I like these heuristics, and will try to apply them.</p><p>On the intuition behind how to interpret statistical power, doesn't a bayesian perspective help here?</p><p>If someone was conducting a statistical test to decide between two possibilities, and you knew nothing about their results except: (i) their calculated statistical power was B (ii) the statistical significance threshold they adopted was p and (iii) that they ultimately reported a positive result using that threshold, then how should you update on that, without knowing any more details about their data?</p><p>I think not having access to the data or reported effect sizes actually simplifies things a lot, and the Bayes factor you should update your priors by is just B/p (prob of observing this outcome if an effect / prob of observing this outcome if no effect). So if the test had half the power, the update to your prior odds of an effect should be half as big?</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "tobycrisford"}}, {"_id": "nNZbKqAFWb9qwmdzy", "postedAt": "2024-01-18T18:36:25.136Z", "postId": "Qw5kwJhgbr6HSWHsJ", "htmlBody": "<p>Yeah, I think a Bayesian perspective is really helpful here and this reply seems right. &nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "rrnSXnqjXthAMisei", "user": {"username": "Nathan_Barnard"}}, {"_id": "dnMe823wJqkJHkyd6", "postedAt": "2024-01-19T12:31:14.888Z", "postId": "Qw5kwJhgbr6HSWHsJ", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>What\u2019s more, in areas that use primarily observational data there\u2019s a really big gap between fields in how often papers even try to use causal inference methods and how hard they work to show that their identifying assumptions hold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Just highlighting this paragraph because I think it's extremely important.
