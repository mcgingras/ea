EA assessments of climate change tend to be far too simplistic, failing to grasp how the interplay between felt temperature rises, soil fertility collapse, fresh water depletion and biodiversity loss are creating the perfect conditions for a major collapse in global food production. In addition to this there seems to be a perception that climate change is not neglected, perhaps driven by the large amount of media coverage that it receives. However, media coverage is in no way translating into meaningful funding or the implementation of effective solutions, as my Canadian case study will highlight.</p><p>I will first discuss some alarming trends at a global level, so as to show the true probable severity of climate change. I will then present a summary of my assessment of Canadian climate policy, which will serve as a case study for showing the huge gap between official policy targets and realistic outcomes. I undertook a three month research project into Canadian climate policy all of my detailed research notes and references can be found <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/canadian-climate-policy/full-report\">here</a>.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><i><strong>Reframing the climate change debate</strong></i></h2><p>Before beginning my assessment of Canadian climate change policy, I believe it\u2019s worth taking the time to reframe how we talk about climate change globally, in particular how mainstream reporting metrics and language fail to convey the likely severity of temperature increases, resource exhaustion and biodiversity loss.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Most important is the need to move away from the use of global average temperatures, which show heating across all of the world\u2019s atmosphere as one simple number. This approach substantially understates how large you can expect any future temperature increase to feel, primarily because the air temperature increases much more over land than it does over sea. Even on land the heating experienced is far from uniform, with hotter areas forecast to experience a greater amount of heating than more temperate areas. When these factors are combined with the high population growth predicted in hotter countries, one report finds that 3.0 degrees celsius of averaged global warming translates to an average temperature increase as felt per individual of 7.5 degrees celsius.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.9jxewhrxiew0\"><sup><u>1</u></sup></a> The same report estimates that 30% of the world\u2019s predicted population will then be living in areas with an average temperature equal to or above the hottest parts of the Sahara desert by 2070.<br>The climate science organisation \u2018Climate Action Tracker\u2019 models probable global average warming in 2100 to be 2.5 - 2.9 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels under current global policies and actions.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.v45m20c7kfr2\"><sup><u>2</u></sup></a> However this estimated temperature rise depends heavily on how they have discounted the effectiveness of current published net-zero plans for different countries. While these are clearly discounted by Climate Action Tracker, It is likely these are still given more credence than they deserve - as my research in the Canadian context will highlight. This means estimates, possibly erring on the side of optimism, see the world on course for 3 degrees average warming, or an average felt temperature increase of 7.5 degrees celsius.&nbsp;<i>(Note I have contacted Climate Action Tracker to ask how they have assessed key Canadian emissions sources for use in their model - I\u2019m awaiting a response)</i>.<br>Furthermore, with a projected global population of nearly 11 billion people by 2100,<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.afz6acqhl57e\"><sup><u>3</u></sup></a> managing to protect and distribute our fragile resources of food production and clean water will clearly be a huge challenge. While future food production models predict declining global crop yields for every degree of global warming,<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.xumns2ym4d0n\"><sup><u>4</u></sup></a> these models only capture the relatively simplistic relationship between temperature and crop yields, and fail to capture the alarming rates of soil fertility collapse and globally depleting water reserves. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Intensive agricultural techniques have caused nearly a third of the world\u2019s arable land to be abandoned in just a 40 year period,<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.iawk0bga14i1\"><sup><u>5</u></sup></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.icjedziq9qyf\"><sup><u>6</u></sup></a> highlighting the extreme vulnerability of our food supply chains and the unsustainable nature of intensive modern farming practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>At the same time total global water use is outstripping replenishment from rainfall, meaning that over half of the world\u2019s aquifers are considered to be in a state of depletion.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.ox5nubau9pz8\"><sup><u>7</u></sup></a> This is primarily driven by agriculture which accounts for 70% of global water use,<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.80rzgb5tv8hg\"><sup><u>8</u></sup></a> meaning that the world\u2019s main growing regions are also the areas suffering some of the worst water depletion. Approximately half of the world\u2019s population currently live in water scarce regions, and 27% of the global population lives in severely water-scarce areas.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.jdsp3isxybtq\"><sup><u>9</u></sup></a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>I could have listed other equally worrying ecological trends that feed into and worsen food and water security, such as the rapid wetland and biodiversity loss currently occurring, with the former being essential for freshwater storage.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.bczokdvc29ya\"><sup><u>10</u></sup></a> But for brevity I\u2019ve chosen to highlight how unsustainable current agriculture is. Clearly intense temperature changes in the areas people live, combined with collapsing soil fertility and depleting water reserves bring to the fore the far more urgent need for major societal and technological changes to mitigate the effects of climate change and modern land and resource practices.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><i><strong>Methodology&nbsp;</strong></i></h2><p>For the purpose of my research, climate change policy is represented by Canada\u2019s \u20182030 Emissions Reduction Plan\u2019,<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.ijh4nfaqg1fe\"><sup><u>11</u></sup></a> which is the government\u2019s published roadmap outlining its policies and funding support for reducing the country's emissions 40% below 2005 levels by 2030. This plan is supposed to be a stepping stone toward Canada\u2019s target of net-zero by 2050. The plan was published in March 2022 and so represents a fairly up to date snapshot of the Federal government's strategy toward climate change.<br>To assess this policy I reviewed it against a list of nearly one hundred different solutions which are considered highly effective ways to combat climate change. I derived the original list of solutions from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drawdown.org/solutions/table-of-solutions\"><u>Project Drawdown</u></a>, before tailoring these solutions to Canada and adding a few additional solutions I considered important. In total I researched nearly one hundred different solutions. I selected seventy of these as being particularly effective or relevant to Canada and grouped them into nine categories.&nbsp; You can see my detailed research notes (organised by sector and solution) in the below airtable:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://airtable.com/shriWx2DMjjJYavum\">https://airtable.com/shriWx2DMjjJYavum</a><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><i><strong>Assessment of Canadian climate policy&nbsp;</strong></i></h2><p>I have grouped my research into nine different emissions producing areas of society, which broadly mirrors how the Canadian government has categorised emissions in its reduction plan. I have also included an additional category for funding, as this was a substantial research area in its own right. For this summary report I have only briefly outlined the most material findings, meaning that many important aspects are omitted. For a more complete picture see my full report (or for those interested in specific solutions or cause areas, all of my research is organised by sector and solution <a href=\"https://airtable.com/shriWx2DMjjJYavum\">here</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Electricity - 2019 emissions 61 MT Co2e, 2030 stated target 14 MT</strong></i><br>Currently Canada has one of the greenest energy grids in the world, with 82% of its energy coming from renewable sources (mostly hydro) and nuclear. Phasing out coal plants is forecast to reduce annual emissions by 13 MT, with the only other clear reduction policies relating to a carbon tax and carbon capture funding, aimed at natural gas power stations. How these reductions will be achieved is unclear, with environmental groups voicing strong and rational criticisms of why carbon capture technology is completely ineffective.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.3zcb5dc75daw\"><sup><u>12</u></sup></a> I think it is very uncertain as to whether Canada will achieve its forecast 47 MT emissions reduction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Canada will need to double or triple its generating capacity by 2050 if it is to meet the power demand caused by electrification of current fossil fuel dependent activities (e.g. electrification of transport and heating).<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.cg03cppmiqe8\"><sup><u>13</u></sup></a> However Its own energy regulator estimates that Canada is on course for just a 25% increase in generating capacity by 2050.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.xd480rcuzzql\"><sup><u>14</u></sup></a>&nbsp;<br>Grid infrastructure projects are complex and usually take decades from inception to completion. Canada is failing to meaningfully scale its grid capacity, meaning that solutions which depend on electrification (such as electric vehicles and heat pumps) are certain to either fail or have their adoption delayed by decades.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Transportation - 2019 emissions 186 MT Co2e, 2030 stated target of 143 MT&nbsp;</strong></i><br>Canada's emissions from transport are currently significantly underestimated as it does not include emissions from international air travel and international shipping. Its main policy is to support electric passenger vehicle uptake, which is one of the few solutions it is adequately funding. However it has no clear plan for decarbonising heavy goods transport which emitted nearly as much as passenger vehicles in 2019. There are also major battery supply constraints which make rapid electric vehicle uptake by 2030 seem unlikely.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.bf1ajr4gth0e\"><sup><u>15</u></sup></a> In the longer run Canada does not have the grid capacity to seriously scale electric vehicle adoption, and with electric vehicles accounting for just 5.2% of new car sales in 2021<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.sn1bfz733iq3\"><sup><u>16</u></sup></a> - making the forecast emission reductions by 2030 seems unlikely.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Essential Environments &amp; Carbon Sinks [30 MT reduction forecast against this category]</strong></i><br>Canada contains roughly a quarter of the world's wetlands, a fifth of the world's temperate rainforest and the longest coastline in the world. Unfortunately Canada does not track the environmental health of lands which are not directly managed for industry, meaning that emissions from degrading wetland/peatland, seafloors damaged by bottom trawling and non-managed forests are not measured. Even small amounts of damage to these environments can cause huge emissions, and what evidence I could find indicates that substantial damage is probably occurring.&nbsp;<br>I estimate that Canada's wetlands could contain 550 GT of Co2e (roughly eleven years worth of current global emissions),<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.2hx6rwdj47ik\"><sup><u>17</u></sup></a> and they are being damaged by drainage put in for activities such as logging and mining. It is impossible to quantify the current rate of damage, but the few areas where wetlands have been measured generally show declines in their extent,<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.y5exgga87ch0\"><sup><u>18</u></sup></a> with approximately 70% of wetlands lost from the southern areas of Canada.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.jej12wp8z1j1\"><sup><u>19</u></sup></a>&nbsp;<br>Furthermore, despite having a huge and extensive wilderness, key metrics for biodiversity loss and ecosystem health are alarming. Global trends for insect collapse show that 80% of insects (measured by total weight) have died off in a period that could be as short as the last 30 years.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.3e4izppy8rtu\"><sup><u>20</u></sup></a> There have been no major studies of insect population trends in Canada, but insect eating birds (a rough proxy for insect populations) have experienced the worst rate of decline of any bird type, decreasing by 60% in Canada since the 1970\u2019s.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.lfpnn5crh4pe\"><sup><u>21</u></sup></a><br>There are also alarming trends in grassland conversion to agricultural land and continued fish stock declines (see full report) - though as for virtually all major ecosystems in Canada there is very limited data. In summary, biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse seem likely to be occurring in many areas, and Canada is probably underestimating it\u2019s official emissions by hundreds of megatonnes per year (driven by C02e released from wetlands, trawled coastlines and grassland converted to agricultural land).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Food Production - 2019 emissions 73 MT Co2e, 2030 stated target of 71 MT</strong></i><br>Direct Co2e emissions from farming are a much smaller issue than the side effects caused by modern farming techniques. The key issues facing Canada are soil fertility collapse and increased droughts in the prairies (80% of Canada's farmland).<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.47hfh9awxzhy\"><sup><u>22</u></sup></a>The&nbsp; global rate of arable land collapse is very high, with several studies concluding that up to a third of global cropland collapsed and became unusable in the last 40 years,<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.4821ilbuznrf\"><sup><u>23</u></sup></a> with wealthier Western countries generally having the worst rates of soil fertility collapse (for example the US may have lost up to half of its cropland since 1980).<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.cr0cohyp4fgi\"><sup><u>24</u></sup></a><br>The Canadian government has no official figures on the rate of abandoned farmland, but it seems likely to be in line with other Western countries. The prairies experienced a dramatic increase in irrigation needs of 74% between 2012 and 2018, with the main driver being reduced rainfall during the growing season.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.ext33pg0t5k9\"><sup><u>25</u></sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>To prevent continued soil fertility collapse would require moving away from intensive modern farming techniques to potential lower yield but more traditional mixed crop approaches, but currently the economic incentives and risks are far too great to make this a viable option for farmers.&nbsp;<br>Globally livestock products generate only 17% of calories and drive nearly 80% of agricultural land use - clearly marking this area of agriculture out as unsustainable in light of the resource exhaustion it drives.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.it3t00je5hmc\"><sup><u>26</u></sup></a> Like most high income countries Canada spends a huge amount subsidising livestock products, an estimated $8 - $10 billion per annum (two to three times more than my estimate of its climate change spending).<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.mr8y00omk94c\"><sup><u>27</u></sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Even though Canada is spending $620 million over 6 years to encourage better farming practices, this funding is surely far too little to reduce the risks farmers take in changing production methods. Policies to cause major change in agriculture would in all likelihood require government sponsored insurance schemes and strong legislation to force behaviour change, none of which are forthcoming. Such substantive policies are not part of any of the major political parties' agendas,<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.23m9i223tkh5\"><sup><u>28</u></sup></a> and without political cognisance and will for such actions - it appears inevitable that current trends will continue.&nbsp;<br>Perennial crops and fermentation produced protein offer two hugely exciting technologies which could provide meaningful scalable solutions to the issues associated with agriculture at present. Perennial crops only need to be planted every few years, meaning that farmland does not need to be regularly tilled - which is the main driver of soil carbon loss. Current research on this area appears to be carried out by a very small number of institutes, so a very small amount of government funding could help rapidly decrease the time it takes to develop viable perennial crops.&nbsp;<br>Fermentation produced protein is a new technology that can produce large quantities of protein not only economically, but critically, from a very small land area. This area of research received substantial private investment in 2021 of $1.7 billion globally,&nbsp; but to scale as a major food industry it will almost certainly need major government support for the scaling of production facilities.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.w3mxn1uxioi9\"><sup><u>29</u></sup></a><br>Neither perennial crops or fermentation produced protein are considered in Canada's emissions reduction plan.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Oil &amp; Gas - 2019 emissions 191 MT Co2e, 2030 stated target of 110 MT&nbsp;</strong></i><br>Current emissions from methane leaks are undoubtedly underestimated, potentially resulting in a current under-reporting of emissions of 50 Mt Co2e per year. This is due to emissions being modelled rather than measured, with actual measurements usually being 50% - 100% greater than modelled figures.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.nefjwo7qn01w\"><sup><u>30</u></sup></a> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Canada\u2019s two key policies, a carbon tax and methane leak legislation, are extremely weak when scrutinised, providing limited incentive or enforcement for emissions reductions. Forecast emissions reduction seems very unlikely.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Industry - 2019 emissions 100 MT Co2e, 2030 stated target of 69 MT</strong></i><br>Canada is likely to make some small emissions reductions from projects to electrify steel production, currently amounting to a 6 MT Co2e annual emissions reduction.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.2xodbypdax7n\"><sup><u>31</u></sup></a> However most other industries do not have non emitting processes which they can transition to.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.e3t7edqj1q9u\"><sup><u>32</u></sup></a> Worse still Canada is using deliberately biassed carbon accounting choices for logging. Large areas of unlogged forest are included, with Co2 absorbed by these forests offsetting emissions from logging. However emissions from wildfires (which occur naturally) in these same areas are excluded from logging\u2019s carbon accounting,&nbsp; meaning that actual annual emissions of Co2e are almost certainly 80 MT or more than currently reported.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.rwarydbeyprm\"><sup><u>33</u></sup></a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Buildings - 2019 emissions 91 MT Co2e, 2030 stated target of 53 MT</strong></i><br>Heating and cooling accounts for 85% of energy used by Canadian buildings, and there are a large variety of solutions needed to reduce this.&nbsp; While some emissions reductions seem likely to occur, largely driven by phasing out HFC as a refrigerant and the adoption of LED lights, most of the recommended building retrofits such as more insulation, electric heat pumps and smart thermometers are seeing only small adoption rates. In the government's own report it cites the Pembina study, which estimates that Canada needs to spend $21 billion per year from now until 2040 to make the building sector net-zero. The Canadian government is spending $2.6 billion spread over the next seven years, and is relying on the private sector voluntarily investing almost all of the required capital - something it shows no sign of doing.&nbsp;<br>Additionally Canada\u2019s new model building codes are weak and may have serious conceptual flaws due to how compliance is measured.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.pv4lsjhkpm4f\"><sup><u>34</u></sup></a> As a result, the forecast 42% emissions reduction seems unlikely.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Waste Management - 2019 emissions 28 MT Co2e, 2030 stated target of 13 MT</strong></i><br>The largest source of emissions in this sector is methane leaks from landfills. Current legislation does not force methane capture and flaring at large but now inactive landfills,<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.unxoe5ah20sf\"><sup><u>35</u></sup></a> and without such stringent legislation it is hard to see how meaningful emissions reductions will be achieved. The true state of Canada\u2019s waste management is quite shocking. Now that it can no longer export nearly half of its lower grade recycling to Asia,<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.qhlbholox89i\"><sup><u>36</u></sup></a> provinces have discovered that they do not have ways of recycling many lower grade materials. Waste management is heavily loss-making for provinces and municipalities, and with no federal financial support promised there is little ability to invest in improved infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br><i><strong>Large Scale Carbon Sequestration Projects - No emissions reductions forecast with this technology</strong></i><br>As global trends show only increasing Co2 emissions year on year, it seems wise to start attempting to develop large scale carbon capture technologies which could remove and offset a substantial amount of the world's emissions in the future. These would currently be expensive and radical projects that would require huge government support. There are no such projects currently active globally, and Canada does not appear to have plans to lead the way in developing this technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Funding&nbsp;</strong></i><br>The government claims to be spending $100 billion on climate change. However, when this is spread over its deployment timeframe and low interest loans are stripped out (as they are presumably intended to be repaid), I estimate their annual climate change spending to be between $3.5 - $5.0 billion. I present it as a range as there is controversy over some of the funding support the government has offered heavy industry and oil and gas, with many viewing this as subsidising harmful environmental practices. It is worth pausing to consider that this is substantially less than the annual subsidies that the government gives to root cause climate change activities, such as livestock farming - which has received an average of between $8 - $10 billion per year.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.8zxyqjsyi3wz\"><sup><u>37</u></sup></a> For context, some estimates place the required annual level of spending needed to reach net zero by 2050 at over $100 billion per year.<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fRLmtuJGrKheEII403uJ80eQna2zZg9V788SMii6VYQ/edit#bookmark=id.wxcyraup738t\"><sup><u>38</u></sup></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><i><strong>Conclusion</strong></i></h2><p>Having researched Canadian climate change policy in depth, it seems apparent to me that there is no realistic prospect of a meaningful reduction on the reported 739 MT of Co2e emitted in 2019. Although Canada may make small reductions in certain specific areas such as electric vehicles, steel production and alternative refrigerants - these reductions are likely to be small in comparison to the underreported emissions occurring from forest fires, wetland drying and methane leaks from oil transportation, which probably represent many hundreds of megatonnes of unreported emissions.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>On ecological issues government regulation is extremely weak. Strong lobbying from fisheries, logging, mining, industry and oil and gas invariably manages to alter and distort legislation before enactment - so that little change is ultimately required from industries when new environmental laws are eventually passed.&nbsp;<br>Climate change has numerous root cause issues, and is inextricably intertwined with ecological and environmental factors. Scientific research increasingly occurs in silos and as a result the holistic effects of biodiversity loss, habitat loss, soil fertility collapse, water depletion and a dramatically warming landmass are not painted as one complete portrait. The combination of the effects seems destined to push our current global food supply chain into disarray, and possible collapse in many regions.<br>As a wealthy nation with huge carbon stores in the form of vast wetlands, grasslands, forests and coastal waters - one would expect Canada to be in a strong position to act as a custodian to some of the world\u2019s last great areas of wilderness. Instead Canada seems dependent on its extractive industries - and shows that a high standard of living does not on its own create the circumstances for benevolent environmental stewardship.<br>Clearly political will, environmental awareness and economic ideologies play major roles in preventing stronger environmental legislation and meaningful government funding support. Unless Canadian voters can be convinced that climate change is more severe, more urgent and more dangerous than is usually perceived - then I fail to see how the political will can be summoned to respond to climate change with the sweeping legislative changes and large scale funding commitments so clearly required.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Endnotes</h1><p>1.&nbsp; \u201c3 billion people could live in places as hot as the Sahara by 2070 unless we tackle climate change\u201d, World Economic Forum, last modified May 13th, 2020, https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/temperature-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-niche-emissions-hot/</p><p>2. &nbsp; \u201cTemperatures\u201d, Climate Action Tracker, last modified November 9th, 2021, https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/</p><p>3.&nbsp; \u201c3 billion people could live in places as hot as the Sahara by 2070 unless we tackle climate change\u201d, World Economic Forum, last modified May 13th, 2020, https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/temperature-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-niche-emissions-hot/</p><p>4.&nbsp; Chuang Zhao et al., \u201cTemperature increase reduces global yields of major crops in four independent estimates\u201d, PNAS Vol 114 | No.35, August 15th, 2017, https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1701762114</p><p>5.&nbsp; Oliver Milman, \u201cEarth has lost a third of arable land in past 40 years, scientists say\u201d, The Guardian, last modified December 2nd, 2015, https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/02/arable-land-soil-food-security-shortage</p><p>6.&nbsp; Duncan Cameron et al.,\u201cGrantham Centre briefing note: December 2015 A sustainable model for intensive agriculture\u201d, December, 2015, https://grantham.sheffield.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/A-sustainable-model-for-intensive-agriculture-Grantham-Centre-briefing-note-December-2015.pdf</p><p>7.&nbsp; \u201cA Map of the Future of Water\u201d, The Pew Charitable Trusts, March 3rd, 2019, https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/trend/archive/spring-2019/a-map-of-the-future-of-water</p><p>8.&nbsp; Alberto Boretti &amp; Lorenzo Rosa,\u201dReassessing the projections of the World Water Development Report\u201d, npj Clean Water 2, 15, July 31st, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41545-019-0039-9&nbsp;</p><p>9. &nbsp; Alberto Boretti &amp; Lorenzo Rosa,\u201dReassessing the projections of the World Water Development Report\u201d, npj Clean Water 2, 15, July 31st, 2019, https://doi.org/10.1038/s41545-019-0039-9</p><p>10.&nbsp; Wetlands Disappearing Three Times Faster than Forests, United Nations Climate Change, last modified October 1st, 2018, https://unfccc.int/news/wetlands-disappearing-three-times-faster-than-forests</p><p>11. &nbsp; Environment and Climate Change Canada, \u201c2030 Emissions Reduction Plan\u201d, (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022), https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2022/eccc/En4-460-2022-eng.pdf</p><p>12.&nbsp; \u201cBuyer Beware: Fossil Fuels Subsidies and Carbon Capture Fairy Tales in Canada\u201d, Environmental Defence, March 2022, P12 https://environmentaldefence.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Buyer-Beware-FFS-in-2021-March-2022.pdf</p><p>13.&nbsp; Environment and Climate Change Canada, \u201c2030 Emissions Reduction Plan\u201d, (Environment and Climate Change Canada, 2022), P40, https://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2022/eccc/En4-460-2022-eng.pdf</p><p>14.&nbsp; \u201cCanada\u2019s Energy Futures 2021 Fact Sheet: Electricity\u201d, last modified May 24th, 2022, https://www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/canada-energy-future/2021electricity/</p><p>15.&nbsp;&nbsp;Battery-mineral shortage likely to impede Canada's goals for electric vehicles, industry expert says\u201d, CBC News, last modified April 28th, 2022, https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/critical-minerals-supply-canada-1.6433301</p><p>16.&nbsp; \u201cAutomotive Statistics\u201d, Statistics Canada, last modified July 21st, 2022, https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/topics-start/automotive</p><p>17.&nbsp; Project Drawdown estimates that the world\u2019s wetlands contain 500 - 600 GT of carbon.

It is sad to see it being misrepresented to thousands of general viewers who might turn away from even critically engaging with these ideas based on a biased general overview. It could be worth engaging with her and her viewers in the comment section, to both learn what longtermism might be getting wrong so as to update our own views, and to discuss some of the points she raises, more critically. I'm concerned that EA would become too strongly associated with longtermism which could make thousands of these viewers avoid EA.</p><p>Some of the points I agree with:</p><ul><li>Her discomfort with the fact that many major ideas of EA and longtermism have all originated from a handful of philosophers all located at Oxford or related institutes.</li><li>This quote from Singer that she cites: \u201c<i>..just how bad the&nbsp;extinction of intelligent life on our planet&nbsp;would be depends crucially on how we value lives that have not yet begun and perhaps&nbsp;never will begin</i>\u201d. I agree that this is an important crux that makes for a good argument against longtermism, or for a more cautious advancement on the longtermism front.</li></ul><p>Some of the points that I disagree with:</p><ul><li>\u201c<i>Unlike effective altruists, longtermists don\u2019t really care about famines or floods because those won\u2019t lead to extinction</i>\u201d. She mistakes prioritizing long term future over short term as an implication that they don\u2019t \u201ccare\u201d about the short term at all. But it is a matter of deciding which has more impact, among many extraordinary ways of doing good which includes caring about famines and floods.</li><li>\u201c<i>So in a nutshell longtermists say that the current conditions of our living don\u2019t&nbsp; play a big role and a few million deaths are&nbsp;acceptable, so long as we don\u2019t go extinct</i>\u201d. Nope, I don\u2019t think so. Longtermism merely states that causing the deaths of a few billion people might be worse. Both (a million deaths and a billion deaths) are absolutely unacceptable, but I think what she misses is the trade-offs involved in doing good and the limited amount of time and resources that we have. I am surprised she misses the point that when one actually wants to do the most good, then one has to go about it in a rational way.</li><li>\u201c<i>Have you ever put away a bag of chips because you want to increase your chances of having more children so&nbsp;we can populate the entire galaxy in a billion&nbsp;years? That makes you a longtermist</i>.\u201d Nope, I don\u2019t think longtermism advocates for people going out of their way to make more children.</li><li>She quotes a few opinion pieces that criticize longtermism: \u201c<i>.. the fantasy that faith in the combined power of technology and the market could change the&nbsp;world without needing a role for the government</i>\u201d, \u201c<i>..longtermism seems tailor-made to allow tech,&nbsp;finance and philosophy elites to indulge&nbsp;their anti-humanistic tendencies..</i>\u201d. Ironically, I think longtermists are more humanistic given that one of their primary goals is to ensure the long-term sustenance of humanity.&nbsp; Also, as far as I know, longtermism only says that given that technology is going to be important, it is best that we develop it in safer ways. It does not necessarily promote ideas of pushing for technological progress just for the sake of it. &nbsp;It also does not impose a technocractic moral worldview when it advocates for extinction risk prevention or prioritizing the survival of humanity and life as a whole.</li></ul><p>With regards to Pascal Mugging that she brings up, I am uncertain how this can be resolved.

Since then there has been increased attention on and funding for pandemic preparedness efforts within EA. I consider this to be a particularly promising application of simulation models, so I wanted to write a post which makes the case for this specifically being a large opportunity for EA. I would be excited to support people working in this area, I also welcome any criticism or feedback in the comments.</p><h1>My Background</h1><p>I am not an epidemiologist; my background is as a software engineer and researcher in simulation and AI. I now work as a research engineer in AI safety. Previously I spent over 6 years working on building simulations for decision making and training at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://defence.improbable.io/\"><u>Improbable Defence</u></a>. While there I published research on developing simulation models of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h1>Recap - what are agent-based models (ABMs)?</h1><p>Agent-based models are computer simulations which model the behaviour of many agents at the individual level. This is in contrast to other modelling techniques which model aggregated or macro variables. Each individual agent (e.g. a person) is represented explicitly in the simulation, which allows agents to have heterogeneous attributes and behaviours. This enables you to capture interactions between agents, allowing for nonlinear feedback effects. This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://prajwalsouza.github.io/Experiments/Epidemic-Simulation.html\"><u>interactive web demo</u></a> is a fun example of a simple epidemic simulation ABM, it allows you to play around and investigate how the characteristics of agents and their interactions can affect disease spread.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kWsRthSf6DCaqTaLS/what-complexity-science-and-simulation-have-to-offer#Tools___Simulation_and_computational_experiments_\"><u>This section</u></a> of my forum post on simulation and complexity science has a more detailed explanation of ABMs.</p><h1>Why are ABMs a good fit for modelling pandemics?</h1><p>The heterogeneous nature of ABMs make them particularly useful for epidemiological modelling. In the real world different people have idiosyncratic behaviours and varying levels of vulnerability to a virus. ABMs can capture interactions between agents and exponential growth which are core dynamics of disease spread. Much of this relies on individual behaviour, such as the level of adherence to lockdowns, and movement patterns of the population. The concepts of disease spread are relatively straightforward to map to the state of an agent in a computer simulation: people are either infected or not, or at different stages of infection.&nbsp;</p><p>These models can be initialised from datasets representing a population in the real world. They can also simulate policy interventions at a more granular level than alternative modelling techniques (such as only a fraction of the population being locked down), which helps to explore counterfactual scenarios.</p><h1>What role did ABMs play in the pandemic?</h1><p>ABMs, along with other types of epidemiological models, had a sizeable impact on decision making during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The famous (or infamous) Imperial College model from Neil Ferguson et. al. was credited as one of the factors causing the UK government to change course and institute a lockdown in March 2020, by predicting 500,000 deaths in the UK if no action was taken (see this article in Nature:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01003-6\"><u>Special report: The simulations driving the world\u2019s response to COVID-19</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Post-hoc modelling analysis of the pandemic is already providing useful insights and decision making recommendations for future pandemics. I collaborated on a research project which used an ABM incorporating real population movement data to understand the effects of the timing of the original March 2020 lockdown. We used this model to estimate the counterfactual number of deaths if the lockdown had been instituted a week earlier (see the paper here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953621007930\"><u>A dynamic microsimulation model for epidemics</u></a>). This was part of the Royal Society\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/Health%20and%20wellbeing/ramp/\"><u>RAMP initiative</u></a> for modelling the pandemic.</p><h1>Making ABMs more useful, a retrospective</h1><p>Despite influencing government policy the Ferguson model was clearly flawed, not least because it didn\u2019t take into account how people would have adjusted their behaviour in the absence of a government mandated lockdown. It didn\u2019t capture the complex mix of epidemiological, social, behavioural and economic factors which are crucial to an effective pandemic policy response. It even lacked any form of realistic people movement, having only a very abstract notion of spatial interaction.</p><p>None of this is the fault of the team working on this model; they were limited by lack of previous investment in these models. Their model was hastily repurposed from a model of a different disease (Influenza). It consisted of messy and untested code, which doesn\u2019t meet modern modern software engineering standards, limiting its flexibility, maintainability and scientific credibility.</p><p>However this points to the potential for drastically improving the usefulness of these models, if we can invest properly in developing them ahead of time for the next pandemic.</p><h2>Multi-domain modelling</h2><p>There is no reason in principle why ABMs cannot include factors and dynamics from many different domains such as social science and economics. The core epidemiological ABMs can be \u201ccoupled\u201d to other models and data sets, including travel, geographic data and economic models. This can capture important feedback effects between these different systems.</p><p>A key factor dominating decision making in a pandemic is behavioural: e.g. how will people react to extended lockdowns, what will the rate of compliance be? Obviously such things are uncertain in advance, but we can at least incorporate the best behavioural science research into these models to narrow the uncertainty. We can incorporate the demographics, existing opinions and political polarisation of the population, and attempt to capture the dynamics of dissemination of information and misinformation on social media, for example to forecast rates of vaccine uptake.</p><p>How might such multi-domain models have helped during the pandemic? If we had had such models we might have been able to better predict some of the second order impacts of lockdown policies, which seemed to take a lot of people by surprise. This includes the shock to supply chains, the labour market and the health care system. Doyne Farmer\u2019s group at Oxford University has done some excellent analysis of the impact of covid on the labour market:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/oxrep/article/36/Supplement_1/S94/5899019\"><u>Supply and demand shocks in the COVID-19 pandemic: an industry and occupation perspective</u></a>. This forum post:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vCf8vo9YyczEC7JKX/how-can-economists-best-contribute-to-pandemic-prevention\"><u>how can economists best contribute to pandemic prevention and preparedness?</u></a> discusses some interesting avenues for relevant economic research. In particular the section on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vCf8vo9YyczEC7JKX/how-can-economists-best-contribute-to-pandemic-prevention#Better_integrated_assessment_models\"><u>Integrated Assessment Models</u></a> covers the idea of using integrated multi-domain models.</p><p>The takeaway point is that these various real world systems feed back into each other, including the underlying spread of the disease itself. Improved simulation models would be able to capture these multi-domain interactions. This is an advantage of the agent-based modelling paradigm. More flexible and granular representations of heterogeneous agents allow models from different domains to be combined, for example each individual agent is an actor in an epidemiological model, but it can also have its actions determined by a model from behavioural psychology, and exist as a node in a simulated social network. This is much harder to achieve in alternative modelling paradigms, such as differential equations of macro variables.</p><p>On the other hand I don\u2019t want to understate the challenges of coupling models from different domains. These are not just challenges of computational performance (discussed in the next section). This includes unsolved scientific modelling problems, such as how to handle the combined sources of uncertainty from multiple models, and how to ensure all models represent the world in a consistent way. In my view these challenges are a major reason why this type of multi-domain modelling has been relatively neglected. This presents an under-explored opportunity for large impact.</p><h2>Computational performance and scale</h2><p>Current models are far from capturing the scale and complexity of the real world. We need to improve both detail, to capture sophisticated individual agent behaviours, and scale. The world is highly interconnected, which is why global pandemics are a problem in the first place, so we need the ability to model much larger geographic areas, while retaining fidelity.</p><p>This is an ambitious goal. The current crop of tools for building ABMs fall far short on these dimensions. There are popular open source tools such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/\"><u>NetLogo</u></a>, however this is more geared towards ease of use for educational purposes, rather than scale and performance. In my opinion none of the existing openly available tools have the right combination of performance and ease-of-use for modellers.</p><p>Most ABMs are built by academic groups, who tend to lack dedicated software engineering resources. Modern high performance computing techniques such as GPU hardware acceleration have the potential to vastly speed up agent-based simulations. In the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.improbable.io/blog/improbable-synthetic-environment-technology-accelerates-uk-pandemic-modelling\"><u>work I mentioned previously</u></a> my colleague and I got a model written by academics to run&nbsp;<strong>10,000 times faster</strong>, from multiple hours to seconds, by re-writing the core of the model to run on GPUs.</p><p>The utility of a model for decision making is highly dependent on its speed. Being able to run the model quickly allows many more scenarios to be tested, in a tighter scientific feedback loop. It also enables sophisticated statistical calibration techniques which can match the model output to real-world observed data, and help to deal with uncertainty.</p><p>Running complex, multi-domain models simulating millions or billions of agents will require an enormous amount of computing power, however with Moore\u2019s law and the advent of cloud computing there is more computing power available today than ever before.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/trends-in-gpu-price-performance\"><u>This article</u></a> estimates that the amount of floating point operations per second available per dollar doubles every 2.5 years. The field of pandemic modelling has not yet been able to effectively harness this increase in available computing power.</p><h2>How can these models be used?</h2><p>The sole purpose of modelling is not just making point predictions, since that is incredibly difficult in practice, but it can help illuminate the distribution of possible outcomes. This can make the true potential impact and cost of such disasters much more visible and salient ahead of time (much like the Ferguson model did, although it\u2019s a shame that the model itself was so limited). This permits far less room for deniability or wishful thinking from governments and key decision makers. Models can act as a focal point for coordination and group decision making.</p><p>I\u2019m convinced that there could have been much more effective modelling of vaccine rollout ahead of time during the pandemic. This could have helped understand different scenarios with varying levels of vaccine effectiveness, and the implications of having vaccines which can prevent severe disease outcomes but not transmission.</p><p>Simulations can be used for \u201cwargaming\u201d exercises, where decision makers can train and practice by running through simulated pandemic scenarios. This is common in other domains, particularly training for military exercises. Looking ahead, simulations could help us understand and prepare for situations with hypothetical novel viruses. Properties of the model can be varied to produce different scenarios, such as infectiousness of the virus, place of geographical origin, the speed of vaccine development and rollout, and the evolution of new variants. We could even simulate scenarios that have never occurred before, such as the deliberate release of a bio-engineered pathogen, or a nightmare scenario where more than one novel pathogen is released at once.</p><p>Running a simulation many times (Monte Carlo simulation) can help us measure uncertainty. This enables sensitivity analysis to understand the effect of varying different parameters. This can help identify promising intervention points with high potential impact. It could even inform what advice EA affiliated groups give to governments on how to tackle future pandemics.</p><p>Simulation models incorporating economics could help estimate the potential cost of future pandemics in financial terms. This can strengthen the case for investing in preparation, and help quantify the expected value of interventions and targeted research. A major challenge for policy makers during the pandemic was navigating the (perceived) tradeoff between public health and the economy. We are in need of much better tools to help policy makers balance these different factors.</p><p>Viewing simulated scenarios can serve as a stark reminder of the importance of preparing for future disasters. In my experience output from a simulation can be very persuasive for nontechnical decision makers, if it is presented in the right way.</p><p>More speculatively, these models could serve as tools to plan for societal recovery from a pandemic, or at least help us understand the medium to longer term impact on society of a truly disastrous pandemic. How long would a full recovery take?</p><h1>Is epidemiological modelling neglected?</h1><p>A counterpoint to the idea of investing more in epidemiological models is that they are not particularly neglected. There were countless epidemiological models developed during the pandemic, many of them of the agent-based variety. However in my view almost all of them lacked key features most valuable for understanding and preparing for future pandemics. This includes the multi-domain integration described above. They also tend to be built by relatively small academic groups, who don\u2019t have the professional software development capabilities to build models which are flexible, performant and with easy to use interfaces for nontechnical users.</p><p>Existing modelling work is not focussed on hypothetical worst case pandemic scenarios, an aspect which EAs and longtermists care relatively more about. ABMs focused on the tail of the distribution could thus be impactful. The field of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deepuncertainty.org/\"><u>decision making under deep uncertainty</u></a> has relevant techniques for systematically discovering highly unfavourable scenarios.</p><h1>What can the EA community do?</h1><p>I would posit that there is a large opportunity for EA-minded people to build multi-domain simulation models to aid pandemic preparedness. A further use of such models could be to help make decisions on allocating EA funds to other pandemic prevention efforts, such as research on improved PPE and vaccine challenge trials.</p><p>Critical components that we currently lack are better software tools and libraries for building multi-domain simulations. This will require scalable infrastructure for complex models, data pipelines and user interfaces. Some private companies are working on simulation tools, for example&nbsp;<a href=\"https://defence.improbable.io/\"><u>Improbable Defence</u></a> (my former employer) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hash.ai/\"><u>Hash.ai</u></a>. However these companies are not focused on pandemic modelling. They are tech companies with the sole concern of building proprietary software platforms, as opposed to the scientific modelling work required to build credible and useful models. A successful multi-domain pandemic modelling effort would benefit from open and collaborative modelling. In my view both the software tools and the scientific modelling work must go hand-in-hand. This is analogous to the field of Deep Learning, which is just as much an engineering effort as a scientific one.</p><p>There are very few existing organisations that promote this close collaboration between software engineers and scientific modellers / academics, particularly in pandemic modelling.</p><p><strong>A new EA-funded organisation could create this environment for developing multi-domain pandemic models.</strong></p><p>There are some existing examples of organisations that have aspects of what I\u2019m imagining:</p><ul><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/our-work/programs/global-health/institute-for-disease-modeling\"><u>Institute for Disease Modeling</u></a> (part of the Gates foundation). I haven\u2019t looked into their work in much detail, but it seems that they have built openly accessible agent-based simulation tools for modelling multiple different diseases (e.g. Malaria). It seems that they are more focussed on existing diseases than on preparing for future pandemics. They have a list of their modelling tools&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.idmod.org/tools#quickstart\"><u>here</u></a>, including an ABM tool called EMOD which&nbsp;<i>\u201csimulates the spread of disease to help determine the combination of health policies and intervention strategies that can lead to disease eradication\u201d</i>. However this doesn\u2019t seem to be under active development; the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/EMOD\"><u>EMOD GitHub repo</u></a> hasn\u2019t been updated since 2019.</li><li>While writing this blog post I came across an organisation called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gleamproject.org/\"><u>Gleam</u></a>, who are a group of academics&nbsp;<i>\u201cusing big data and computational modeling to fight infectious diseases\u201d</i>. They have an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gleamproject.org/tools/gleamviz-abm\"><u>ABM tool</u></a> which claims to incorporate realistic population movement at a global scale, which definitely looks like a step in the right direction!</li><li>We can also look at relevant examples from other domains, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://clima.caltech.edu/\"><u>Climate Modeling Alliance</u></a> based at CalTech. They are a consortium of scientists and engineers&nbsp;<i>\u201cbuilding a new Earth system model that leverages recent advances in the computational and data sciences\u201d.&nbsp;</i></li></ul><p>Perhaps there are opportunities to collaborate with or fund existing organisations. If someone is seriously considering working on this then a sensible first step could be to reach out to the team behind EMOD at the Institute for Disease Modelling. It would be interesting to know if they have considered targeting it at modelling novel pathogens.</p><p>If any of these ideas have piqued your interest, or you are considering working in this area, then I am more than happy to discuss further.</p><p>I should make it clear that I myself have switched from working on simulations for decision making to AI safety, for a variety of reasons. But that doesn\u2019t mean I am any less excited for someone to take forward the ideas outlined in this post. I believe large scale, multi-domain simulation models have a high expected value for dealing with future pandemics.&nbsp;</p><p>Many thanks to David Manheim, Toby Weed, Max Reddel and Simon Grimm for reviewing a draft of this post (all errors and misguided opinions are my own!).</p>", "user": {"username": "rory_greig"}}, {"_id": "EbXpKWoCdQmeFFxJN", "title": "Should reducing government funded animal experiments be on the agenda for EA?", "postedAt": "2022-10-29T13:58:25.973Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Justin Goodman from the White Coat Waste Project campaigns to reduce government-funded animal experiments.

Using government spending databases, White Coat Waste Project (WCW) was the first organization to reveal in early 2020 that U.S. taxpayer dollars had been shipped to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for dangerous coronavirus experiments on animals, which many experts believe caused the pandemic. WCW also found emails showing that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was concerned about these dangerous experiments as early as 2016. But, bizarrely, the agency allowed them to proceed anyway. Other FOIA requests also exposed that, early in the pandemic, close confidants of NIH leadership expressed concern that a lab leak may have caused the COVID-19 outbreak.</p></blockquote><p>This suggests that the activities of the White Coat Waste Project might be good both for the cause of animal welfare and for the cause of biosafety. Neither Animal Charity Evaluators nor OpenPhil have evaluated the White Coat Waste Project. It might be worth putting more EA money into it because it helps with multiple causes that EAs care about.

How original. I was going to write about how there\u2019s an increasingly visible EA \u201carchetype\u201d (rationalist, longtermist, interested in AI, etc.) that embodies an aesthetic few people feel warmly towards on first impression, and that this leads some newcomers who I think would be a great fit for EA to bounce off the community.</p><p>But as I outlined my critique, I had a scary realization: If EA adopted my critique, I\u2019m not confident the community would be more impactful. Maybe, to counter my proposed critique, AI alignment is just&nbsp;<i>the</i> problem of our century and we need to orient ourselves toward that unwelcome reality. Seems plausible. Or maybe EA is rife with echo chambers, EA exceptionalism<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh5eclr7f487\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh5eclr7f487\">[1]</a></sup></span>, and an implicit bias to see ourselves as the protagonist of a story others are blind to. Also seems plausible.&nbsp;</p><p>And then I thought about other EA strategy takes. Doesn't a proposal like<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cvzEpGgmQ8BefiwGt/making-effective-altruism-enormous\"><u> \u201cmake EA enormous</u></a>\u201d also rest on lots of often implicit assumptions? Like how well current EA infrastructure and coordination systems can adapt to a large influx of people, the extent to which \u201cEffective Altruism\u201d as a brand can scale relative to more cause-area-specific brands, and the plausible costs of diluting EA\u2019s uniquely truth-seeking norms.&nbsp;<i>I\u2019m not saying we shouldn\u2019t make EA enormous, I\u2019m saying it seems hard to know whether to make EA enormous</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefikjf11bp3lo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnikjf11bp3lo\">[2]</a></sup></span><i>\u2013 or for that matter to have </i><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/minimal-trust-investigations/\"><i>any</i></a><i> strong strategy opinion.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Nevertheless, I\u2019m glad people are thinking about course corrections to the EA movement trajectory. Why? Because<strong> I doubt the existing \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d trajectory is the optimal trajectory.</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrj3ttqyd82\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrj3ttqyd82\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><ul><li>I don\u2019t think anyone is deliberately steering the EA movement. The Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) does at some level with EAG(x)\u2019s, online discussion spaces, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aWdEWeysSsptm6jkv/cea-s-plans-for-2021\"><u>goals</u></a> for growth levels, but ask them and they will tell you&nbsp;<i>CEA is not in charge of all of EA</i>.&nbsp;</li><li>EA thought leaders also don\u2019t claim to&nbsp;<i>own</i> course-correcting all of EA. While they may nudge the movement in certain directions through grants and new projects, their full-time work typically has a narrower scope.&nbsp;</li><li>I get the sense that the EA movement as we see it today is a conglomeration of past deliberate decisions (e.g., name, rough growth rate, how to brand discussion and gathering spaces) and just natural social dynamics (e.g., grouping by interests and vibes, certain people feeling more comfortable in some spaces than others, etc.).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>This unintentional \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d trajectory being the best for the EA movement seems&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/omoZDu8ScNbot6kXS/beware-surprising-and-suspicious-convergence\"><strong><u>suspicious</u></strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>I\u2019m not saying that any particular person or institution&nbsp;<i>should</i> be steering the EA movement; there are strong reasons why centralization could be very counterproductive. But, if we agree that \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d isn\u2019t best, I think we should be aiming to have more productive, action-guiding conversations about EA movement strategy to get us on the right track. And that involves concretely stating what aspects of the community you think should change and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/reasoning-transparency/\"><i><u>why</u></i></a><i>&nbsp; </i>you think they should change. Hopefully, the frameworks outlined help these discussions.</p><h1>Domains in which EA could course-correct&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1><p>The best possible EA trajectory is the one that helps the most sentient beings live lives free of suffering and full of flourishing, over the long term.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2v48svoysos\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2v48svoysos\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Or something like that. Reasonable people disagree on most parts of that sentence, like how much to morally care about consequences vs. rules, how much to morally weigh different types of sentience, how much to morally weigh suffering vs. flourishing, and how much to discount the value of future lives. But I\u2019ll use this optimum as a first approximation for the ideal movement and leave solving ethics for another write-up.</p><p>So, is EA currently on this best possible trajectory? As argued above, I doubt it. I think a fair bit of how EA has grown and identified itself is pretty unplanned (i.e., evolved from social dynamics and people kind of just doing things that way rather than deliberate, debated decisions), and I don\u2019t expect this would land the EA movement in the ideal trajectory.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref68lh8bxp3v4\"><sup><a href=\"#fn68lh8bxp3v4\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>If we grant that EA is likely not on the ideal trajectory,<strong> in what ways could we nudge EA toward the ideal trajectory?</strong> That\u2019s the purpose of this section.

make updates that could pay compounding returns. You know, long-term thinking.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Option value:&nbsp;</strong>The best course corrections leave room to course correct away from the course correction.

All mistakes that remain are my own.</i></p><p>In GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness models for health interventions, an important factor in the analysis is how much the intervention increases beneficiaries\u2019 incomes later in life, likely through increased ability to work or productivity. In some analyses, this can be a considerable factor with it accounting for around 30% of the Against Malaria Foundation\u2019s impact, as well as being the crucial factor in their past recommendations of deworming charities. While this is both reasonable to account for and based upon solid evidence, the way these effects are currently assessed for new interventions is likely to systematically underestimate the developmental benefits from understudied early life health interventions due to their model having inappropriate priors. Specifically, their model assumes a null effect, or something close to it, for effective early life health interventions on later life incomes and proxy indicators in the absence of direct academic evidence, despite there being a wealth of evidence that effective health interventions almost always affect income later in life.</p><p>Additionally, GiveWell\u2019s modelling could also be improved by allowing for interventions affecting health capital to have positive and negative economic spill-overs to untreated populations.&nbsp;As spill-overs from health capital at the macro-level are often estimated to be at least as big as the micro-level direct effect at the macro level (Bloom et al 2019), the direction and magnitude of these spill-overs could affect the extent to which GiveWell chooses to recommend interventions on the basis of developmental effects. Indeed, GiveWell recognises this as an issue by applying an ad hoc general equilibrium adjustment to down-weight the effects of deworming and it is unclear why this is not applied to the development effects of other interventions, as similar mechanisms are likely to be at play.</p><p><u>GiveWell's Development Effects Model</u></p><p>The current GiveWell development effects model assigns each intervention a score of 0 to 4, based on the strength of the evidence and the relevant effect sizes, to several categories that are correlated with or directly underlie&nbsp;consumption later in life and then constructs a weighted average of these scores. Then, the score is compared to the average for malaria treatment (2.2 in figure 1) for which there are two well-identified econometric studies providing direct evidence (Bleakley 2010; Cutler et al 2010).&nbsp;In figure 1, you can see this model being implemented, with New Incentives\u2019 vaccinations - an intervention for which they have less direct evidence - being estimated to be half as impactful as seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC).

However, these assumptions are highly unlikely to be correct as the variables themselves are not independent. This is most obvious for interventions with a large body of convincing evidence on the direct effects, the outcome of interest, in which case the other information is of no additional use. Another potential failure mode, where GiveWell is more likely to apply this method, is that lesser studied health interventions are penalised for having no studies of decent quality within specific categories. In practice, this means that an early life health intervention \u2013 a category all GiveWell\u2019s top charities lie within \u2013with reliable effects on mortality is unlikely to be considered more than 27.5% as effective (through the mortality, morbidity, and plausibility categories) as malaria treatment at achieving developmental effects. As a wide range of factors that affect early life mortality also affect later life incomes in the same direction as malaria treatment, implicitly assuming that the developmental effects will be significantly smaller is a strong assumption that requires investigation. Some examples of early life health shocks that both cause early life mortality and reduce later life incomes include pneumonia (Bhalotra and Venkataramani 2015), waterborne disease (Beach et al 2016), and air pollution (Isen et al 2019). Furthermore, if we extend the search to allow for proxies for later life incomes such as height, weight, and cognitive performance as well as shocks that occur in-utero the number of relevant health shocks expands rapidly (see Almond, Currie, and Duque 2018 for a review). Consequently, it is no surprise that quasi-experimental evidence, using difference-in-differences, has since emerged suggesting that receiving the same set of vaccinations encouraged by New Incentives increased the incomes of recipients in India by 14% (Summan, Nandi, and Bloom 2022) and that the introduction of the measles vaccine alone had an effect of 1% in the US (Atwood 2022).</p><p>Considering this evidence, I believe that the best way forward would be for GiveWell to examine the relevant economic literature to form a prior probability on how early life health interventions\u2019 effects on mortality are likely to translate to developmental benefits. Then, movements can be made away from this prior in a Bayesian manner if specific unexpected evidence, direct or indirect, emerges that warrants it.</p><p><u>General Equilibrium</u></p><p>Studies identifying the effect of an early life health shock typically do so relative to a control group of individuals who were not exposed to the health shock within the same region a few years beforehand. Therefore, if the shock has spill-over effects onto the earnings of those unexposed to the shock within the same region these studies will not accurately capture the full developmental effects of that intervention. These spill-overs could even affect the policy recommendations from studies such as Bleakley (2010) that conducts its analysis at the ten year cohort level if spill-overs occur between cohorts<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[1]</a></sup></span>. As some of the income effects these health improvements come from increased cognitive ability and education (Atwood 2022) , many of these mechanisms will be the same as for human capital &nbsp;Commonly proposed mechanisms for spill-over effects from human capital include knowledge and idea spill-overs, the signalling model of education, changes in relative factor prices, shifts in investment behaviour, and political economy effects<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[2]</a></sup></span>. &nbsp;In addition, better health is likely to affect population size and fertility rates which will have their own effects on incomes.</p><p>Indeed, these effects could be practically relevant, with macroeconomic attempts to identify the effects of health capital on growth in GDP per capita frequently finding effects over twice as large as the corresponding microeconomic estimates&nbsp;or spill-overs that reduce them to zero depending on the context and assumptions (Bloom et al 2019).&nbsp;Although I do not currently have the time or training to properly assess this macroeconomic literature, large spill-overs are very plausible in developing countries, especially given what we already know about human capital spillovers that share some common mechanisms. The most direct evidence of human capital spill-overs in the developing world thatI am aware of is Khanna (forthcoming)\u2019s assessment of an Indian school building program exploiting sharp cut-offs in a district\u2019s eligibility for the program to achieve quasi-experimental variation. Using this cut-off to learn about the program\u2019s effect on the proportion of workers achieving more education as well as its effect on the wages of more and less educated workers separately, Khanna (forthcoming) is able to estimate that general equilibrium spill-overs reduced the program\u2019s impacts on income by over 30%, primarily by reducing the wages of workers who would have received an education regardless.&nbsp;These effects were partially, but not fully, offset by an increase in wages for previously unskilled workers.&nbsp;Although it is impossible to identify the exact mix of different spill-overs present here, these results are certainly consistent with a relative factor prices explanation where the skill premium decreases as human capital increases. Similarly, Angrist (1995) found that the skill premium in Palestine decreased after a large school-building program was undertaken but, unlike Khanna (forthcoming), did not develop a model to separate out the different welfare effects.</p><p>Pertinent evidence of potential negative spill-overs also comes from Barton et al (2017) identifying that public sector teaching jobs in Kenya come with rents equivalent to a doubling of income using a cut-off in the hiring algorithm as a regression discontinuity. As Kenya is not an outlier within Africa for its permanent teachers being well-paid relative to its economy (Bold et al 2017) and achieving an education is necessary for acquiring this job, it is plausible that some of the productivity gains from health improvements are directed towards zero-sum competition for rents from rationed civil service jobs. A final source for which there is some evidence of negative spill-overs from health capital &nbsp;is that saving lives can depress wages by reducing the capital stock per worker, with Cervellati and Sunde (2011) finding that decreases in mortality are associated with reduced economic growth within countries that have not undergone the demographic transition.</p><p>Alongside potential negative effects, positive spill-over effects could also occur from investments in health capital. For example, they could free up time for mothers who would have to spend less time pregnant to reach their desired family size and also have to spend less time caring for the sick. Additionally, positive spill-overs could also occur through a human capital channel as ideas are non-rival and spreading them can enhance productivity. Some examples of knowledge spill-overs include the wages of native workers increasing in cities that receive highly skilled STEM workers (Peri, Shih, and Sparber 2013) and inventors increasing their productivity when they move to cities with many other specialists in their field (Moretti 2021). Although some of this is unlikely to transfer to developing countries, it is still possible that some spill-overs could occur as important knowledge may not be held by others within a firm, or other workers may induce more effort to keep up with more productive peers. Some examples of these factors being relevant include a randomised field experiment showing that job training increases productivity among the worker\u2019s peers (De Grip and Sauermann 2012) and supermarket checkout workers increasing their output when more productive workers come on shift (Mas and Moretti 2009).</p><p>As discussed above, there are several ways in which increases in one person\u2019s health capital could affect another\u2019s earnings, with these effects potentially being large relative to the individual-level microeconomic effects. Thus, I believe it would be beneficial for GiveWell to perform a more comprehensive survey of the evidence to reach an informed conclusion on this topic, given its importance to their recommendations. Personally, my suspicion is that this would likely cause developmental effects to be down-weighted by their models, as potential sources of negative spill-overs seem particularly acute within developing countries and positive ones seem likely to be attenuated. Nevertheless, a firm conclusion would require greater examination of the relevant macroeconomic evidence.</p><p><u>Conclusion</u></p><p>In sum, I believe that GiveWell\u2019s development effects models contain two implicit assumptions that materially affect their recommendations and may not be fully accurate. The first assumption is that understudied early life interventions effective in reducing mortality will have weaker developmental effects than a malaria treatment saving the same number of lives, which may prove untrue upon a systematic analysis of the relationship between early life health shocks and later life earnings. This assumption could cause GiveWell to recommend more heavily studied early life interventions over lesser studied ones, even when a rational bayesian would expect the lesser studied one to be more cost-effective. The second assumption is that higher earnings from increased health capital for one individual does not affect those of others. Assuming a lack of spill-overs could cause GiveWell to over or underestimate the cost-effectiveness of interventions where a significant portion of their impact comes through development effects, depending on whether the spill-overs are negative or positive respectively.</p><p>Both of the issues outlined are solvable. The first can be solved by forming an appropriate prior about the development effects of an effective early life health intervention from&nbsp;the literature and then adjusting from it when more direct information on the intervention becomes available. Meanwhile, the second can be solved by assessing how likely spill-overs are to occur in a given context by weighing a mixture of micro and macroeconomic evidence.</p><p><u>References</u></p><p>Acemoglu, D., 2010.

This is true in college seminars, but more generally in small social gatherings of any type.&nbsp;</p><p>When I've taught my 'Psychology of Effective Altruism' class (syllabus <a href=\"https://www.primalpoly.com/s/syllabus-EA-2020-spring-final.docx\">here</a>), it's sometimes hard to get ordinary college students interested in abstract Effective Altruism ideas. I teach at a large American state university that is not very selective in student admissions, so there is a wide range of cognitive abilities and curiosity levels in the college juniors and seniors who take my EA class. They sometimes struggle to follow abstract presentations of key EA concepts such as scope-sensitivity, tractability, neglectedness, charity effectiveness, utility, sentience, and longtermism.&nbsp;</p><p>But they all love superhero movies. Whatever their religious affiliation, they're all familiar with the DC and Marvel pantheons of demi-gods. For better or worse, these superhero pantheons are at the heart of modern global entertainment culture. In a politically polarized era when people can't agree on much, and tend to stay within their partisan news media bubbles, superhero movies and TV series offer some rare common ground for thinking about issues of power, altruism, existential risk, counterfactuals, moral dilemmas, etc.</p><p>So, I've found it useful to provoke class discussions with some superhero thought experiments, such as: \"If you had all of Superman's superpowers for 24 hours, and you wanted to do the most good in the world during that one day, what would you do?\" (For a sample of about 150 replies to this question on Twitter (from ordinary followers, not from college students), see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/primalpoly/status/1585701965786271745\">here</a>.)</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/98f6da10807a9b926e5e12f24cc7aed182738aeca27c1e88.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/98f6da10807a9b926e5e12f24cc7aed182738aeca27c1e88.png/w_83 83w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/98f6da10807a9b926e5e12f24cc7aed182738aeca27c1e88.png/w_163 163w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/98f6da10807a9b926e5e12f24cc7aed182738aeca27c1e88.png/w_243 243w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/98f6da10807a9b926e5e12f24cc7aed182738aeca27c1e88.png/w_323 323w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/98f6da10807a9b926e5e12f24cc7aed182738aeca27c1e88.png/w_403 403w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/98f6da10807a9b926e5e12f24cc7aed182738aeca27c1e88.png/w_483 483w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/98f6da10807a9b926e5e12f24cc7aed182738aeca27c1e88.png/w_563 563w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/98f6da10807a9b926e5e12f24cc7aed182738aeca27c1e88.png/w_643 643w\"></figure><p>This question usually provokes immediate and spirited discussion. Almost all students are familiar with Superman's imaginary superpowers, and almost all accept the premise that Superman is a good guy with good intentions.&nbsp;</p><p>The most frequent initial responses usually involve geopolitical vigilante justice, on the principle that the fastest way to do good is to eliminate bad guys -- through killing them, jailing them, or otherwise neutralizing them. So, many students will start off saying 'Superman should simply kill foreign leader X', where X is whoever the American news media is currently demonizing as the Global Bad Guy. &nbsp;However, other students will usually point out that political assassinations often create martyrs, generate adverse publicity, and provoke blowback, so the longer-term effects may be neutral or negative. This can lead to a good discussion of unintended consequences, counterfactuals, moral legitimacy, public sentiment, and the global catastrophic risks of geopolitical instability.&nbsp;</p><p>Other students will sometimes suggest that our hypothetical EA Superman should simply do what classical Superman has done ever since the comics started in 1939 -- monitor the news, look for people in distress, and go save the individuals and small groups who can be saved. This typically leads to a good discussion of scope-sensitivity: why should Superman save a few people at a time through heroic actions, when he might be able to save many more through delivering water, food, or medicines to the needy? Or through infrastructure projects like digging canals, tunnels, and harbors, building dikes and dams, or delivering metal-rich asteroids to Earth? Students enjoy debating which kinds of interventions would be the best use of Superman's time -- and the 24-hour time limit in the question makes the opportunity costs of each intervention salient.&nbsp;</p><p>It's also easy to nudge these discussions into epistemic questions about how Superman could find out which interventions are actually most effective. He's very powerful, but he's not omniscient, so where could he turn for good evidence? How much of his time should he spend scanning peer-reviewed papers on Google Scholar, applying his super-speed to scholarly lit reviews? Does he have any time to run experiments himself, and to evaluate their short-term or long-term impact? Which world experts should he consult with, before he does anything?</p><p>And what if Superman has moral uncertainty about what really counts as 'doing the most good'? The EA superhero thought experiments almost always lead to energetic discussions about different moral frameworks, such as deontology, consequentialism, and virtue ethics. Many students start out assuming that Superman is a deontologist at heart, respecting universal rules of goodness and right. But they quickly realize that almost every large-scale intervention involves some tradeoffs and imposing some risks on innocent people, so some consequentialist reasoning is almost always needed.&nbsp;</p><p>Many students are primed by science fiction movies to think about global catastrophic risks, so they suggest that Superman should eliminate nuclear weapons, or other weapons of mass destruction. But they often realize that Superman flying around and using his heat vision to destroy the US and Russian nuclear arsenals could be very destabilizing, unless handled very carefully, with appropriate warnings to world leaders. This can lead to a discussion about the need for Superman to cooperate with existing power structures, political institutions, national leaders, journalists, social media influencers, etc. Should EA superheroes by bound by global governance protocols (such as the 'Sokovia Accords' that constrained the Avengers)?</p><p>Other students will argue that Superman should use his powers for intimidation, blackmail, or extortion to force powerful people and groups to act better. He can impose credible threats of death and mayhem. But, given the 24-hour time limit, how can he ensure that his threats will have any lasting impact? This can lead to a discussion about which promises are credible, which interventions will really work long-term, and which metrics should be used to assess the success of different interventions.&nbsp;</p><p>In any class of 20 or so students, a few will be vegans and/or interested in animal welfare issues. They will sometimes argue that Superman should focused on ending factory farming, or disrupting the meat supply chain. This can provoke a discussion about the relative importance of human versus non-human animal suffering, and whether Superman, as an alien intelligence, should have any special sympathy with humans compared to other sentient beings on Earth. This can also lead to a discussion of wild animal suffering, and whether Superman could do anything useful to reduce it.</p><p>Apart from Superman, it can also be instructive to consider the EA-relevant capabilities of other popular superheroes. Apart from super-strength, other superpowers typically include super speed (Flash, Quicksilver), regenerative powers (Deadpool, Wolverine), psionic abilities (Professor X, Scarlet Witch), extreme wealth and technology (Batman, Iron Man), control over nonhuman animals (Aquaman, Ratcatcher), changing size (Antman, Wasp), stealthy assassination (Black Widow, Elektra), and weather control (Thor, Storm). Each superpower opens new possibilities for EA interventions that students can debate. Should Tony Stark/Iron Man focused more on developing regenerative medicine, and less on developing nanotechnology suits? Should Professor X use mind control to impose moral enhancement on humans? Should Aquaman nudge the behavior of aquatic animals to reduce wild fish suffering?</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://www.comicbasics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Top-10-Marvel-Superheroes-That-Have-Doctorates.jpg\"></figure><p>Students also enjoy debating which supervillains could do the most harm -- or the most good -- if they wanted to shift the cosmic balance of total sentient utility.</p><p>These are just a few examples of the kinds of discussions that the EA superhero thought experiment can provoke in college classes. I've found that these discussions are easy, engaging, vivid, and memorable ways to introduce many EA concepts to students. They often end up realizing that it's a lot harder than they thought at first to do good, effectively, with minimal side-effects and blowback. They also get tuned into issues of epistemic uncertainty, moral uncertainty, and opportunity costs pretty easily.&nbsp;</p><p>I'd welcome any comments, feedback, or further suggestions about how to teach EA principles through thought experiments and discussion prompts centered around popular culture.</p>", "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "57oW7A9FpoaX76vnK", "title": "What should I ask Ajeya Cotra \u2014 senior researcher at Open Philanthropy, and expert on AI timelines and safety challenges?", "postedAt": "2022-10-28T15:28:44.836Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Next week for <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/\">The 80,000 Hours Podcast</a> I'm interviewing <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/ajeya-cotra/\">Ajeya Cotra</a>, senior researcher at Open Philanthropy, AI timelines expert, and author of <em>Without specific countermeasures, the easiest path to transformative AI likely leads to AI takeover</em>.</p>\n<p>What should I ask her?</p>\n<p>My first interview with her is here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/ajeya-cotra-worldview-diversification/\">Ajeya Cotra on worldview diversification and how big the future could be</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of Ajeya's work includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Y3sWcbcF7np35nzgu/without-specific-countermeasures-the-easiest-path-to-1\">Without specific countermeasures, the easiest path to transformative AI likely leads to AI takeover</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hCsxvMAGpkEuLCE4E/why-ai-alignment-could-be-hard-with-modern-deep-learning\">Why AI alignment could be hard with modern deep learning</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IJ6Sr-gPeXdSJugFulwIpvavc0atjHGM82QjIfUSBGQ/edit#heading=h.r808lkmw6i0l\">Forecasting TAI with biological anchors</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/QAqghTmp7FSMcJ4ch/ama-ajeya-cotra-researcher-at-open-phil\">AMA: Ajeya Cotra, researcher at Open Phil</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "user": {"username": "Robert_Wiblin"}}, {"_id": "KhaiTTPMHdndAjMsq", "title": "European citizens' initiative for vegan meal registered by EU Comission", "postedAt": "2022-10-28T12:48:53.397Z", "htmlBody": "<p>There is a new European Citizens\u2019 Initiative (ECI) entitled \u2018European citizens' initiative for vegan meal' <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_6244\">registered</a> on October 18<sup>th</sup> 2022 by the European Commission.</p><h1><strong>ECI process</strong></h1><p>The European Citizens\u2019 Initiative (ECI) is a mechanism which enables EU citizens to participate in the development of EU policies.

That means overall population immunity will be lower and will lead to more covid cases than otherwise, which will increase the strains on NHS services this winter.&nbsp;</p><p>This is an area in which EAs might have a potentially very large impact for small investment by creating a simple website to encourage people who would be willing to pay for a booster to give their email address. That list could then be used to convince Pfizer or another company to choose to make covid booster vaccines privately available in the UK, just as they will be in the US from January 2023 and as flu vaccines currently are in the UK.</p><h1><strong>The Issue</strong></h1><p>Pfizer's bivalent vaccine (vaccinating against both the original covid and Omicron variants) is being rolled out in the UK via the NHS. The original vaccination and initial booster programme in the UK started with the most vulnerable and frontline health workers, and expanded down risk profiles until all adults in the UK had been offered the opportunity to have a vaccine and a booster.&nbsp;</p><p>However,&nbsp;<i>the plan is more limited for Pfizer's bivalent booster vaccine</i>. This winter the UK has opted for a policy which will see&nbsp;<i>only</i> the most vulnerable and frontline health workers being offered the vaccine. Unlike flu vaccines, where anyone can walk into a pharmacy and pay a small fee for a flu vaccine if they are not entitled to a free vaccine, that will not be possible for covid boosters. To put this in perspective:</p><p>Number of people&nbsp;<strong>who were vaccinated</strong><a href=\"https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/vaccinations\">&nbsp;<u>in the UK</u></a>:</p><ul><li>First dose: ~54M</li><li>Second dose: ~51M</li><li>Booster: ~40M</li></ul><p>Those to be&nbsp;<strong>offered a bivalent booster</strong>:</p><ul><li>Estimated total to be&nbsp;<i>offered a bivalent booster</i>:<a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/2022/08/nhs-to-roll-out-variant-busting-booster-jab-from-september-ahead-of-winter/\">&nbsp;<u>26M</u></a></li></ul><p>In other words, even with 100% uptake of the booster, this leaves a potentially willing 28M adults without even the&nbsp;<i>option of a booster</i> from the NHS or privately.</p><p>It is of course entirely right to start rollouts to the most vulnerable \u2013 and to expand those groups as widely as possible. The issue is that there is no option, other than travel to the US, for the majority of willing UK adults to receive a bivalent vaccine. It is clear that, all other things being equal, more population immunity is better. Waning immunity in millions of UK adults will reduce ongoing pandemic mitigation. That is particularly a problem when the winter burden of covid and flu on the NHS is expected to be large, impairing outcomes for treatment of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PaulMainwood/status/1567801206935781376?t=kHinWuTVO_76i3qia4M8HA&amp;s=19\">other illness</a>.</p><p>I understand that there is no longer any shortage of vaccines; vaccine takeup in the UK has been lower than expected. Although it might be better for the NHS to provide boosters free of charge to all who want them, the Government has decided not to do that. But in any case, it would be strictly better for all concerned,&nbsp;<i>including those who do not get a booster</i>, if the number of covid cases were reduced by making it possible for people to pay a modest fee for a booster if they are not entitled to a free one.</p><p>Pfizer has stated that it will be selling vaccines in the US from 2023 when the US Government stops providing them free of charge. In the UK flu vaccines are sold privately and are administered in pharmacies by trained staff members.<strong> Currently, there is no public argument or expectation that the bivalent vaccine should be available for purchase in the UK.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>However, there may be a solution. Based on confidential discussions with sources that I cannot name but who I believe to be in a position to know, I understand that it is already lawful for pharmacies to sell and administer the booster in the UK to willing individuals. But Pfizer believes that there would be insufficient demand in the UK for this to make commercial sense. I think there are serious reasons to doubt this, and that there would be substantial demand. If we can demonstrate that demand, we could hugely increase UK covid booster vaccine uptake this year.</p><p><strong>I believe this is a highly tractable opportunity that the EA community can meaningfully impact, with little investment and potentially huge gains. This is particularly the case for interested coders, graphic designers and social media engaged EAs.</strong> Pfizer currently intends to sell the vaccine in the US for around $110-130 per dose; UK costs should be lower given lower labour and healthcare costs. I believe there are significant numbers of UK adults who would be willing to pay for a booster now - over 12 months since their last vaccines with no other way to get a booster.</p><h1><strong>Proposal</strong></h1><p>A small group of coders, graphic designers and social media engaged EAs could produce a website, appealing to the general population of the UK, to 1)&nbsp;<strong>make clear the advantages of continued vaccination for Autumn for the adult population at large - not just those in high risk categories</strong>,&nbsp;<i>in order to</i> 2)&nbsp;<strong>compile a list of email addresses of UK adults willing to pay for a bivalent vaccine</strong> (Autumn Booster).</p><p>I suspect that a simple landing page with a signup form and sharing mechanisms would achieve more signup than a simple google form. A shareable, appealing information campaign could gather signups at very low cost. I would also suggest A/B testing and the simultaneous use of a google form, and/or use of other petitioning sites. I suggest the goal should be to&nbsp;<i>get the most UK signups, with email addresses,&nbsp;</i>by&nbsp;<i>exposing this to the most UK adults not currently within the booster categories</i>.</p><p><strong>A project of this kind can be done incredibly quickly by the people with the right skill sets (code, graphic design, social media reach)</strong>, and could plausibly have significant upsides in lives saved and health outcomes improved with minimal investment. News could be spread by EAs and others through social media and private sharing.</p><h2><strong>Next Step: Form the Group</strong></h2><p>For anyone interested, and with the right or relevant skill set, can you please post below (preferably) or contact me individually so I can put you in contact with one another. This is not a project I feel I am the best to run and handle. I am convinced there are members of the community better suited for that than I am, but I would be very willing to help form the group to then step back (although of course please do feel free to do this within the comments below and cut me out entirely!).</p>", "user": {"username": "Lawrence Newport"}}, {"_id": "HMdSMjKbrBMJbsunk", "title": "How often does One Person succeed?", "postedAt": "2022-10-28T19:32:46.932Z", "htmlBody": "<h3>Disclaimer</h3><p>The following post is not a study on the campaigns or movements started by a single person. Neither does it deal with the data generated by the successful implementation of a project. Instead, this post is trying to present a case study of an ongoing campaign and several potentially failed attempts, commonly deserted in the process along with their data. This post will mainly contain Indian references, and everything is backed by the remains of the evidence.&nbsp;</p><h3>First</h3><p>As of October, there is one very hyped news going on involving the demise of a student in one of the top institutions of India.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"q1pwr67mycj\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq1pwr67mycj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq1pwr67mycj\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The outlook of this kind of story may come as a shock to many, and become unbelievable as you dive deeper. In reality, this is a fairly common scenario and the only shocking thing is that it came to the surface. For those who are unfamiliar- big tech giants often have their Indian roots in these universities&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"tlkek93t9ec\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftlkek93t9ec\"><sup><a href=\"#fntlkek93t9ec\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which was often dubbed as the best hub for a technical career among my peers.&nbsp;</p><h3>Second</h3><p>We don't encounter such kind of news often; maybe once a year, twice at max. And it's obviously a big issue throughout the world: students suffering from poor mental health, several unfortunate events, and several actions for prevention and improvement. What's concerning about the cases happening in India, especially in its highly regarded premier institutions is: they are way bigger and more disturbing than what gets mentioned in the ones coming out. (Also, one should not confuse the cases coming out as automatically the biggest ones.)</p><h2><strong>Third</strong></h2><p>In the last two weeks, there have been two more such tragedies in a similar institution, mine. (There is no footnote available as the info isn't and won't be out) I know because of the vague condolences meeting emails I received, followed by customary mail for mental health awareness. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to go to those meetings(reason mentioned further in the post), but most of the people on campus know how these things are handled and long gave up hope. Both of those deaths are deemed suicides on the campus, from academic harassment which is dubbed and used as academic pressure.</p><p>Last year, after being on the brink of such a scenario myself and immediately after the tragedy of another colleague in June, I decided not to complete my remaining master's and to take on a project of my own in which I would be making efforts to get addressed every kind of harassment and discrimination against me in the previous 5 years before graduating. There were clear instructions and provisions available on how to do what and what to do when, and I had more than enough factual evidence from my time studying in college to get the so-called 'resolution'. And by the way, I (used to) study at IIT Delhi, in the capital, which according to the general(Indian) consensus comes above the one mentioned in the <i>First </i>part and at times first overall in the country.</p><p>After that, all hell broke loose. Evidently, more suicides followed. I was harassed for months, stalked, kicked out of the campus, forced to take my complaints back, and the incidents after that are too sensitive to be explained here further. The policies, provisions, policymakers, and even sub-provisions weren't even there. And I checked it all. It took months. As my physical health degraded, the concept of mental health was used to turn my illiterate family against me, hence cutting off necessary basic resources, and then again the incidents that followed are too sensitive to be explained here further. After making sure I was incapable of taking any further action, my case was buried silently with silence.</p><p>This is the point where most of us are hinted to <i>perish</i> along with all our data. I considered it too. Then I moved on and chose the worse option; and filed a report Human Rights Commission, which was also in the capital. Surprisingly, they were good at harassing too, which later became obvious(surveillance was still on). I still filed my report, waited, got an automated response, waited, got an order, waited, and then kept waiting. Later I found out that the order was also an automated response. It's sent to everyone but nobody follows it, and after that nothing happens. Unless you hire a lawyer and sue them, which is not the scenario if you're filing a report there. Because you can't afford anything else. A simple, foolproof coping mechanism. That's the human rights commission for you. Similar results were obtained from numerous other provisional sources of help(some might have gotten suspicious of my last name and left), including the ones who actually made the mental health act in 2017.</p><p>(w<i>hich came in 2018 actually, prior to that if you survived your 'attempt', you'd already committed a crime</i>)</p><h2><strong>Last</strong></h2><p>After several <i>failed attempts</i> of various kinds, some of which are dubbed as successful, I filed a third-grade 100+ pages petition in July of this year as a <i>petitioner-in-person, </i>which(you might have guessed if you clicked on 1st footnote,) is again delayed to date solely because I am representing <i>myself</i>.

The first level we hit is that of a citizen and a citizen really has a small individual lever but can en-masse generate \"demand of change\" which in turn shapes policies and the technologies we build.&nbsp;</p><p>I consider lifestyle choices, consumer choices, voting, raising your voice, supporting a cause, etc all forms of a similar mechanism of protest that a citizen can make use of. &nbsp;A citizen can then become an activist, engineer, entrepreneur, scientist, politician, business leader or philosopher.</p><p>Each of these professions has a particular role in society and a particular lever.</p><p>&nbsp;An activist generates awareness through creating noise around a certain issue or translating that issue for a more general public.

This blog post has a lot of long-term strategies that everyone can benefit from.</li></ul><h2>Why am I writing this?</h2><p>About six months ago, I wrote about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rvCwxS6m8KeGiLte9/how-to-get-an-ea-aligned-job-my-experience\"><u>how I got my EA-aligned job</u></a>, which many people found very useful. It so happened that I left the role I had got before writing that post and was looking for a job again! This was a fantastic opportunity to test out some new strategies and share them with you.&nbsp;</p><p>It took me exactly a month to find my first paid short-term contractor offer in an EA charity for 7 weeks. I got an idea to run my own project after two weeks of looking for a job. I also got a full-time offer for a job that\u2019s a really good fit roughly three months after I left my previous job. So, these methods work, but of course, I haven\u2019t seen their full long-term impact yet.&nbsp;</p><p>This is my personal account, not a research paper and a claim that \u201cit will work in 100% of cases for anyone\u201d, and it doesn't reflect the views of my employer.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting that I\u2019m a generalist which may have made it somewhat easier for me to get a job than for a specialist as I could apply for many things. You can pick and mix these ideas at your own discretion and adjust my advice to your own situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Your (good) network will get you a job</h2><p>Tl;dr: grow your network before you need a job and your network will find you your next job. Some of the best jobs are not advertised, and referrals can make a difference.</p><p>A better and bigger network will make job hunting a lot easier. I said it once and I\u2019ll say it again: do not, ever, stop networking, even if you already have a job. It\u2019s the best time to grow your network when you\u2019re involved in some kind of a project. People will want to speak to you because you are a part of an organisation or can help them as a part of your role.</p><p>When I got my previous EA role, I connected with as many people as possible to make the project succeed. I added roughly 30 people to my high-quality connections (people I could ask for a favour). I added even more people into \u201cthey know I exist\u201d kind of connections.</p><p>When I left my job, I made a couple of posts on LinkedIn and Slack about being available for work. I got messages from people suggesting jobs and projects. Almost all of these people were from my \u201cnew\u201d network from this recent job. I\u2019m convinced that I would never get as many new opportunities if not for these new relationships. The final job offer I got was from a person who I met because of my \u201cnew\u201d role I got back in 2021.</p><p>The main takeaway here is that&nbsp;<strong>it\u2019s already too late</strong> to build your network when you\u2019re looking for a job. Of course, job search can grow your network, but you can\u2019t use it if you don\u2019t have it yet.</p><p>Here are some top tips on easy ways to build a habit of building your network. You don\u2019t have to use all of them at the same time.</p><ul><li><strong>Take part in random 1:1s</strong> in your organisation/Slack space. For example, Slack has a Donut app that allows everyone to match with a random colleague for a chat each week. If you don\u2019t have it in your team - suggest setting it up. No connection is ever useless. You never know what and who other people know. You can help spark an idea for a project the other person will do.</li><li><strong>Join relevant EA-Slacks</strong> that your organisation has access to. Write a short message to introduce yourself and join discussions. If you\u2019re not working, some Slack (such as EA Communities) allow EA-aligned members who don\u2019t currently work in EA.</li><li><strong>Use LinkedIn, even if you only do so once a month.&nbsp;</strong>Post about your work and add as many people from relevant organisations as you can. Write a short intro message about why you\u2019re adding them.</li><li><strong>Add your current work collaborators on LinkedIn</strong>. Not everyone does it, but it\u2019s an easy way to stay in touch. If they are not on LinkedIn, make a note of their email address. If you\u2019re leaving your job, message everyone you worked with. Say you\u2019d like to stay in touch and collaborate in the future.</li><li><strong>Schedule informational interviews, or ask for short specific requests</strong>. Such as, \u201chey, I\u2019m doing X, I see that you\u2019ve been an active contributor to the community about X, do you have any communities I should join or articles I should read?\u201d. \u201cHey, I see you\u2019re doing Y job and heard a lot of good things about your work, I also want to do Y jobs, could you tell me A, B, C please?\u201d In such requests, don\u2019t ask to be a mentee but focus on very short requests that anyone can do. Sometimes you\u2019ll develop deeper relationships later.</li><li><strong>Use offline and online events to connect</strong>, as people participating have a much lower bar for connecting. I\u2019ve noticed that at EAG I can get a meeting with pretty much anyone. Outside of EAGs, I need to ask people for introductions, as my LinkedIn messages are not always as successful. You can just go to a part of these events, like for speed introductions.</li><li><strong>Ask for introductions</strong>. If you are reading this post, chances are you already know at least one person in EA. Who does this person know? Ask them to introduce you to some relevant people. A follow-up on a meaningful introduction is very close to 100% if it\u2019s done through your mutual connection. Ask them to send an email or a LinkedIn/Facebook message to introduce you two.</li><li><strong>Create a list of people you\u2019d like to connect with</strong>: are they leaders of your favourite EA orgs? Are they good with fundraising or operations? Then, connect to these people using the methods above. When I was more junior I was really afraid of writing to more senior and experienced people but most of time they do reply and want to help, especially if you\u2019re working for the same or similar cause. Everyone likes to be seen as an expert, so it\u2019s quite flattering to be asked for ops or leadership tips. Always ask. Worst case scenario they\u2019ll ignore you.</li><li><strong>A top tip for removing barriers to connecting is to set up a Calendly link</strong>. This way it\u2019s easier for people to set up calls with you whenever it\u2019s convenient for them. It\u2019s quite polite to ask for 30 minutes of their time if you have a specific request. Some EAs will also be looking to grow their network and will be open to having an intro chat for 30 minutes.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Set up a spreadsheet or a project where you\u2019ll track how many people who you've connected to</strong>. If you\u2019re generally quite introverted, networking can feel very unnatural and having a systematic approach to it can help. Set yourself a target of one person a week, or two a month. At the end of the year, you\u2019ll end up with 20-50 meaningful connections!&nbsp;</li><li><strong>You need to remember that you two people benefit from connecting, not just you.&nbsp;</strong>Some people find it hard to network and think that they somehow bother other people. The other person will be happy to also add you to their network. So by reaching out you\u2019re doing someone a favour, not only asking for one!</li></ul><p>You can find more in-depth info in<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lQBk2p0-PLWw00V-qfKF9yWzKXNPy2YyPCVLW4-Qb2w/edit#\"><u> this networking guide for job seekers.</u></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Tell people you\u2019re looking for a job</h2><p>Tl;dr: Message people you know (and don\u2019t know) to say you\u2019re looking. Otherwise, they won\u2019t know and won\u2019t think of you if an opportunity arises.</p><p>This is a bit of an obvious one, but I have to write about it. Don't be afraid of telling people you are open to work. If you don\u2019t tell people, they won\u2019t know, and they won\u2019t send opportunities your way.</p><p>A super easy way of doing this is creating a template message and sending it to your network. Something like this: \u201c<i>Hey, I\u2019ve left my role and now looking for other roles! You\u2019re well connected in the X space, and I\u2019d really appreciate it if you could forward me any potentially suitable roles in X you spot. I\u2019m looking for remote roles with A, B and C, but open to other stuff</i>\". Don't be too precise to avoid missing out on interesting roles. At the same time, do give people an idea of what you're looking for to increase the likelihood that the roles will be suitable.</p><p>Some people will ignore this as they\u2019re busy, but they may hear about a job and will think of you. Most people may not be able to think of opportunities straight away. However, they may come back to you later in the next 1-6 months and suggest a role or collaboration. This actually happened with my current full-time job offer. I casually messaged the CEO that I\u2019m open to work, we bounced some ideas off each other about what we can do. Two months later she got back to me offering to participate in an application process for a role at her organisation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Offer to solve the employer's problem to access hidden opportunities</h2><p>Tl;dr: Don\u2019t say \u201c<i>I\u2019m looking for a job in PM</i>\u201d. Be more specific and put the organisation\u2019s needs first. Say \u201c<i>I can help increase capacity by organising your team</i>\u201d. Prepare a short pitch/offer on how you can solve the organisation\u2019s problem.</p><p>If you\u2019re still only applying for advertised jobs, you\u2019re missing out. As a rough estimate, at least 10% of the jobs never get advertised. Logically, they don\u2019t have as many applicants, so you have a higher chance of getting them. To access them, you need to do a bit more investigating and outreach work.</p><p>Changing your profile to \u201cOpen to work\u201d on LinkedIn is a must. Posting about looking for work everywhere will help. However, I\u2019ve found that it's not very effective until you actually tell people what you can do, and how your skill can solve their problem.</p><p>For example, in my LinkedIn post, I said something like this:&nbsp; \u201c<i>I have great project management skills</i>\u201d. That's vague and doesn\u2019t tell anyone anything of significance. Statements that worked much better were tailored and sent via private messages. \"<i>If you need help with fundraising, I can do it</i>\u201d. Or \u201c<i>I can see that your team has recently grown, would you like me to train them in project management?</i>\u201d</p><p>The latter was even more successful when someone else tipped me about what the org actually needed. If you get the problem wrong, you can either not get any interest or, worst case, mildly offend someone, which is not a big deal. Sometimes, the org will respond to say that that\u2019s not a problem, but your profile shows that you can solve another problem.</p><p>No one is interested in giving a job specifically to you. All employers are concerned with how you (read: someone) can solve their problem. How you can help meet their organisational goals. If you're predicted to be the best at doing exactly that, then the employer will move heaven and earth to convince you to join them. If not, then they can\u2019t care less, even if you\u2019re the most impactful and talented EA in the whole world.&nbsp;</p><p>When I started my 2022-job search, I came across&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cultivatedculture.com/how-to-get-a-job-anywhere-no-connections/\"><u>Austin Belcac\u2019s newsletter.</u></a> He advises job seekers to spend quality time diagnosing the organisation\u2019s problem (by googling and networking) and then presenting a solution in a pretty slide deck. I haven\u2019t done this, partly because my other strategies worked well, and partly because I didn't have the time. But I do think that if you really want to work for a specific org and have a bit of time, it\u2019s worth having a go.</p><p>Be org-led. Always aim to understand as much as you can about what they really need, rather than what you\u2019d really like to provide. It\u2019s not about you at this stage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Do the reverse: create your own \u201cwish list\u201d and send it to employers</h2><p>Tl;dr: Create a 1-2 page Google doc (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16jw0eoMDNFB_SeD_Ry6nei1XMLhKmkvi7yCCtsH69-o/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>download a free template here</u></a>)&nbsp;about you and your skills and share it with as many people as you\u2019d like to get their feedback. They will likely reach out to you with opportunities and/or suggestions.</p><p>Have you ever wished that you didn\u2019t have to apply for endless jobs and the employers just headhunted you? If you\u2019re relatively early in your career like me, the answer is likely yes.</p><p>A really cool way of achieving a similar impact is reversing the process of hiring by creating a short document about who you are, what you\u2019re good at, and what you\u2019re looking for. I\u2019ve borrowed this idea from Judith Rensing when she successfully used it in 2021.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16jw0eoMDNFB_SeD_Ry6nei1XMLhKmkvi7yCCtsH69-o/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>You can download a free template here.</u></a></p><p>It worked really well for me. I wrote this document originally to clarify my own thoughts and get some feedback about my career plans and it ended up being very useful in securing two roles, one temp and one permanent. I shared it individually or within my trusted communities, but not publicly. Some potential EA employers saw it too. Some people very kindly provided feedback on phrasing and how I can improve this document, which was useful.</p><p>There are some advantages and disadvantages of this strategy.</p><h3>Advantages</h3><ul><li>You can position yourself in the best way possible without having to fit your individuality in application forms. The employers will know you better than other candidates, as you\u2019ve provided all this extra information.</li><li>You can attract employers who have similar culture to the one you prefer. Some employers told me that they really liked my ideal culture descriptions and appreciated my approach to management.</li><li>If you know what you want pretty well, you can weed out a lot of employers who are not a good fit. If you\u2019re saying \u201cI want autonomy\u201d but the potential employer wants an executor of their instructions, the job is not for you and it saves you both a lot of time.</li><li>The employers who hired me used my document to create a role for me in the end and match my wishes to what I will be able to do in the organisation. I found that it really helped us come up with a win-win for both parties.</li></ul><h3>Disadvantages</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gicYG5ymk4pPzrKAd/doing-good-is-a-privilege-this-needs-to-change-if-we-want-to\"><u>In my post about inclusion in EA</u></a>, I spoke about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gicYG5ymk4pPzrKAd/doing-good-is-a-privilege-this-needs-to-change-if-we-want-to#:~:text=Some%20people%20can,give%20their%20input.\"><u>how hiring without a proper process can be bad for decision-making down the line.</u></a> If you hire someone using the document I outlined, then you may end up hiring someone you like, or \u201ca second you\u201d. Ideally, when hiring, we need to have a wide pool of candidates with the right skills. This will help to hire someone who can provide a different perspective on things. Otherwise, we may hire someone from our bubble who happens to be in the right place at the right time.</li><li>Sometimes, there isn\u2019t a way to send such a document. For example, if you\u2019re applying for an existing job, you have to fit the format, otherwise, it\u2019s not very respectful of the recruiter\u2019s time. You have to use different channels to distribute your document. I recommend that you send it under a different pretext. For example, don't say \u201chire me\u201d but say \u201cplease provide feedback on my next steps and recommend what role can be a good fit\u201d.</li><li>There is no way you can tailor this information to all employers. Some employers may find that you\u2019re not a good fit for, say, a recruiter role, as you said that you\u2019d like to start a charity. In a normal application, you\u2019d never say things that are not in line with that particular job. Here you have no way of not disclosing it because it\u2019s \u201ca one-size fits all document\u201d. In a way, it\u2019s a good thing, as you don\u2019t waste any time applying for roles that won\u2019t be a good fit.</li><li>Some people can be put off by certain statements or misunderstand them. For example, one of my management descriptions was that I want the role responsibilities to be clear. But I got some feedback that it comes across like I want to be micromanaged. That was definitely not the case and is actually the opposite of what I was asking. I wanted more autonomy to operate within a role without having to go back to clarify who was the decision maker. Additionally, some people could have been put off by how demanding I was about what manager/culture I wanted, which is fair. I knew that there were so many jobs I could do, that being picky was a good strategy to have to do fewer applications. As a bonus, I did end up getting a role that was exceptionally a good fit for me.</li></ul><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Don\u2019t be afraid to take temp opportunities</h2><p>I\u2019ve noticed that many people don\u2019t like temp roles because they are not as good as permanent offers. In my experience, temp roles are an amazing opportunity to showcase your work in a real environment, and sometimes they can lead to more permanent roles. They are also a great way to figure out if this type of work is for you.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Apply for \u201cjob search\u201d funding</h2><p>Tl;dr: some foundations may give you a small grant so that you don\u2019t have to worry about living costs while you\u2019re looking for a perfect role.</p><p>This is a rarer option, as it\u2019s not publicly advertised, but you can apply for a small grant to cover your living costs while you\u2019re job hunting. I\u2019ve seen it done by a couple of foundations, because they believed that the individual is very impactful. They believe that supporting them for a couple of months will ensure that they will stay in the movement and eventually find an impactful job.</p><p>I think it\u2019s great, but in my experience, working is much better than \u201cexploring\u201d without working. I like working and wanted to make an impact for another organisation. Plus I wanted to experience working in another team and learn new skills. This decision is now paying off as the temp job that I had for 7 weeks gave me skills that I\u2019m using in my current job.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>You can fundraise for your role</h2><p>Tl;dr: If your org doesn\u2019t have the money to hire you, you can offer to help fundraise for your role.</p><p>This is not that new, but I\u2019ve experienced it a lot during this job search. It\u2019s potentially a promising way of getting jobs in underfunded new projects. It\u2019s also very uncertain. After initially getting a lot of interest in my profile, some organisations said: \u201c<i>we would love to hire you but we have no budget</i>\u201d. We decided to fundraise for my salary. Some organisations will do it for you, some will ask you to help. But this is a great way of getting a job when the org is small or under-resourced. If you can say how you\u2019ll add value, and why the org will be better off after hiring you, this is a good way to get hired. It also showcases that you have initiative, fundraising skills, understanding of the whole organisation and the movement in general, not just your role.</p><p>This does have disadvantages though. Firstly, you will have to be patient and you may need to wait for quite some time. Sometimes, the funding won\u2019t come for a while and you\u2019ll need to apply for something else or take a temp role. My suggestion is to leave it a good month or two at least and keep applying for other jobs/keep conversations going. Until you\u2019ve got an offer and ideally, a signed contract, you shouldn\u2019t stop searching for other opportunities. Just because the org is fundraising for your position, doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re the only one who can have that position. One organisation said they\u2019ll still advertise the role, not hire me automatically, which is fair enough. I successfully fundraised for a role at one organisation, but they changed their mind about hiring a new person.</p><p>Secondly, you may need to consider the likelihood that the funding will be available in the future. You should do it for all jobs though. If the organisation didn\u2019t have the money to pay you in the first place, there have to be future resources they can apply to. Or you have to believe that the organisation will have this future. Unless, of course, you are only interested in a short-term contract yourself.</p><h2><br>Go broad with your search</h2><p>Tl;dr: It\u2019s worth reevaluating what you want from a career while you\u2019re looking for a job. Try and think broadly and consider more options, as it will help you discover new uses for your skills and will lead to better choices.</p><p>When I left my previous job, I found it hard to come up with a clear idea of what I wanted to do. This is partly why I created the \u201cwish list\u201d document (described above), as I wanted to list all my skills and figure out what I should do next.</p><p>The last time I job searched in EA in 2021, it took me five months to get an offer. This time, it took me only one month, partly because I went very broad. I was still picky but picky about the right things.</p><p>In 2021, my motto was: \u201c<i>I only want to do jobs related to animal welfare and only specific levels of responsibility, such as management or top management</i>\u201d. When I left my most recent job, I thought \u201c<i>I should just start another charity</i>\u201d. This was too narrow, however, as it just followed the pattern of what I did and didn\u2019t really allow for creativity.</p><p>This time in 2022, my mission was: \u201c<i>I want an impactful job for which I\u2019m a good fit, something I can enjoy doing and learn a lot</i>\u201d. This allowed me to apply for a lot more potential jobs and thus gave me more creative solutions. When I wrote my wishlist document, I was very vague about specific roles I wanted, which attracted a lot of potential opportunities I would never have even thought of, but was potentially a good fit for.</p><p>Even if you already know exactly what you want to do, I would still encourage you to go broad, even if it\u2019s just an exercise of a couple of hours of brainwriting. Don\u2019t be too set on one or two ideas, be open to other opportunities - you can\u2019t know everything you can be good at. You may have some amazing transferable skills that will come very useful in a job that you might very much enjoy and make a lot of impact. I found out a lot about myself and my skills during some of the applications when I broadened my search. In the end, I only chose one job, but I\u2019m a lot more confident that this is the right job for me because I applied for about 13 jobs this time.</p><p>The world where you had one career all your life is gone. Professionals are all about transferable skills and learning new skills quickly to meet the demands of a job that is the most impactful and right for you at the time.</p><p>I also recommend that you share your thoughts with fellow community members who will be able to provide feedback. They may trigger some of your thought processes and eventually help make better decisions. Here are some examples of feedback I got from sharing my \u201cwishlist document\u201d, which was super valuable (rephrased for clarity):</p><ul><li>\u201c<i>You should consider being a community builder with your skills</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>Director of Operations roles always involves monotonous work, so it may not be a good fit for you if you don\u2019t like admin</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>You can do fundraising-related roles but this is mainly a specialist role, and you said you would prefer something more generalist</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>You\u2019ve got an excellent profile for a charity founder</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>It looks like you shouldn\u2019t apply for org X because the culture is very different from what you want</i>\u201d</li><li>\u201c<i>You should chat to X, Y, Z about this as they may want to collab with you</i>\u201d</li></ul><p>\u201cGoing broad\u201d with your job search will improve the quality of your final choice. Adding even a couple more alternatives will help create better evaluation criteria. You\u2019ll be more satisfied with your choice as you\u2019ll feel that you\u2019ve explored many options.</p><p>You can also \u201crelax into\u201d the job-hunting process if you apply for multiple roles, as you will feel that you have many options and don\u2019t absolutely have to get that one dream job. I felt that during my interviews, I could be open and honest with potential employers. I asked a lot of questions, as I felt I had a lot of choices and wasn\u2019t afraid of putting them off by being demanding. When I got rejections, I also felt fine as I had other things going for me and wasn\u2019t desperate to get one particular job.</p><p>The only thing to watch out for is that \u201cgoing broad\u201d with your search is a lot more time-consuming and emotionally draining than applying for one or two roles. Job search is already really hard, it makes it twice as hard if your uncertainty is higher. It also takes much more time. If you are successful, you\u2019ll participate in more application processes. If you\u2019re applying for a variety of roles, you\u2019ll have to do different trial tasks, which will stretch your comfort zone. I didn't work and I had full 8-hour days including weekends from applying, doing trial tasks, and attending interviews.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Show your work!</h2><p>Tl;dr: publish your past work or create new work, like a project or a blog post to become more visible. It's not only a good way to get on people's radars but to also showcase your skills.</p><p>This is by far my favourite point here because it\u2019s the most creative and it\u2019s a lot of fun too. The key to this method is to publish your work or start projects that are more or less visible. People who liked what you did may reach out and offer you opportunities. For example, I started<a href=\"https://impactfulanimal.substack.com/\"><u> this animal advocacy newsletter</u></a>. Within a couple of days/weeks, I got offers to participate in a couple of hiring processes. People a) noticed that I existed b) saw my work and thought it was good c) made a connection between what they wanted to be done and what I could do.</p><p>I got an offer to participate in a hiring process for a product manager in 2022 because I wrote a post about<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tMZwSMGPATKG3eYiP/job-profile-project-manager\"><u> being a project manager back in 2021</u></a>.</p><p>You don\u2019t even necessarily have to do something new: think back to the work you\u2019ve already done. Do you have some blog posts already? Maybe some design work you did, or a useful resource you created?</p><p>You can create a portfolio website where you can host all your work in one place and plug it where people may find value in it. Even commenting on the forum/LinkedIn is a good idea, as people will see you as someone thoughtful with an opinion.</p><h2><br>Consider starting your own project</h2><p>Tl;dr: if you can\u2019t find a job/volunteering opportunity you\u2019re excited about, consider starting your own project.</p><p>Sometimes you may feel that you haven\u2019t done enough work that you\u2019d like to showcase. That there are no organisations you\u2019d like to volunteer for and you can\u2019t seem to get any jobs that you\u2019d like to do. In this case, you may feel that you\u2019ve got some time on your hands. This may be a good opportunity to start your own project!</p><p>Your project doesn\u2019t have to be massive or overly complicated. It can be anything from a couple of hours spent on writing up a blog to 6-12 months projects, or even a new organisation. I remember back in 2021 I ruled it out as I felt that I wasn\u2019t qualified enough. But then I found out that starting new projects can be one of the most impactful things you can do. I tested my fit and realised that I really enjoy working in start-ups and setting things up.</p><p>Of course, you shouldn\u2019t start any project just to occupy yourself or be visible. It\u2019s worth considering the counterfactuals, and if your project can potentially do any harm. A good first step would be to talk to someone about your project idea, or simply write about it and post it on the forum. You may even find collaborators and will likely get good feedback about your idea.</p><p>There are many funding opportunities for new projects if you wish to do them full-time. With a bit of perseverance, and if your project is any good, you\u2019re likely to get funding for it eventually. However, it\u2019s not a given that you\u2019ll definitely get the money immediately. If you have to pay the bills in the meantime, you may want to do your project part-time and find another job to cover your living costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Choose your manager</h2><p>Tl;dr: your manager can make or break your success in a job. Concentrate on choosing someone who you\u2019ll get on well with.</p><p>When I think back about what made my best jobs a good fit so far, they all had a manager I got on well with. Conversely, most not-so-good-fit jobs had a manager that I didn\u2019t click with as much. When I went to interviews this time round, I concentrated on figuring out whether I liked the manager as a person.</p><p>It's often said that work is not personal, but you'll be spending a huge chunk of your week collaborating with this person. If you get on, you'll simply have a higher quality of life.</p><p>Good manager/employee communication is a very important factor in your job success. Recruiters often say \u201cdon\u2019t choose a job, choose a manager\u201d. While what job you do is important, a good manager can make or break your success in that job. You need to make sure that you \u201cclick\u201d, or that your working style aligns. Being on the same wavelength is another way to describe it.&nbsp;</p><p>Think back to when you met your partner/best friend, or someone within the community that you get on well with. Try to remember how you felt and then look for these signs in your new manager. The famous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-airport-test-the-interview-assessment-you-didnt-know-you-were-getting\"><u>airport test</u></a> can help. Ask yourself \u201cWould I want to be stuck in an airport with this person?\u201d&nbsp;</p><h2><br>Add your name to talent databases</h2><p>Tl;dr: Add your name to a relevant database or two, and there is a chance employers will contact you about opportunities.</p><p>Lately, I keep hearing that people find jobs via specialised databases. Either an employer doesn't want to run a hiring round, or they are trying to get more candidates for their existing round.</p><p>There are no guarantees and these are not the same as applications.</p><p>Some databases I discovered so far (feel free to comment with more and I\u2019ll add them):</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://airtable.com/shr2uaKcpsMNx3fc6\"><u>Pineapple Operations Database</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://gfi.org/resource/adding-yourself-to-gfis-talent-database/\"><u>Alt Protein Talent Database</u></a></li></ul><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Dealing with rejections creatively</h2><p>Tl;dr: rejections are good and necessary if you want to find a good fit.</p><p>I wrote&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rvCwxS6m8KeGiLte9/how-to-get-an-ea-aligned-job-my-experience#:~:text=Don%E2%80%99t%20take%20the,point%2010%20below.\"><u>a little bit about this</u></a> in my previous post, but I thought I\u2019d include my updated thoughts and techniques about this. The whole idea about looking for a job creatively is about finding the right fit both for you and for the employer. Understanding this made me feel good about rejections, rather than hurt. Here are a couple of reasons why:</p><h3>Rejection can lead to an opportunity</h3><p>If you get a rejection email, make sure to write back to thank the employer for the opportunity to participate. In addition, state that you\u2019ll be happy to participate in another hiring process and will appreciate any recommendations in their network. This works especially well for near-miss candidates.&nbsp;</p><h3>You don\u2019t want just any job</h3><p>When I was a new graduate, I wanted any job, any opportunity. Now I\u2019ve been working for 10+ years, I no longer want multiple offers and a lot of interest from everyone. I want the right fit, a good culture, a boss I get on well with, interesting work that allows me to grow, and work on something I truly believe in. I don't want a job that's not a good fit because I won't enjoy it and it will make me unhappy. Whenever I got a rejection, I told myself that it wasn't the right job for me. If I was such a perfect fit, and I\u2019m genuinely the best candidate and would enjoy it a lot, I'd get it.</p><h3>You can\u2019t possibly be a good fit for everything</h3><p>A lot of people take rejection really personally because they take it as an attack on their skills and personality (this includes me in the past). They behave as if they are supposed to get all the jobs they apply for because they want to be the best for all the jobs. Based on what I said about choosing a good manager/job/culture fit, you can see that even if you\u2019re multi-talented, super experienced and a genius, only a very small number of jobs will be a good fit for you.</p><p>You will only know some things about the job after you start it. When you\u2019re rejected from a job, it makes your life easier as it reduces your choices. The employer sees that you are not a good fit, which spares you the need to go in and find that out after you take the job.</p><h3>It\u2019s about solving the employer\u2019s problem at the right time</h3><p>It\u2019s never about you personally, or about your skills and experience, but about you being able to solve the employer\u2019s problem in comparison to other candidates at that precise time. There are a lot of internal and external factors that you will never discover, and none of them depend on you. Understanding this makes me feel a lot better equipped for rejection. When you look at it this way, it makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if you\u2019re choosing between a Mac and a Dell for your computer, you may select Dell because it runs your specialised texts to speech software that Mac doesn\u2019t. Macs are obviously really good, but you don\u2019t select them because they don\u2019t solve your particular problem.</p><h3>Choose the employer who chooses you</h3><p>The best way to start a job is to get an employer who is 100% convinced that you're the best candidate. They should believe in you and have trust in you to get the job done. Otherwise, you\u2019re not starting on the right foot from the get-go, as they'll doubt your every move when you start working. If someone rejected you, they don't choose you and you don't want to work for them either.</p><h3>Sometimes you\u2019re just not a good culture fit</h3><p>Finding a job is largely about finding a culture that you like and will thrive in. I think a lot of new people looking for a job underestimate this point, because they may believe that all work is the same as long as they have the skills to do it. I also used to believe this and now I\u2019ve learnt from experience that while there is no such thing as objectively good or bad culture, there is definitely a good and bad culture fit for you personally.</p><p>Culture is the atmosphere in the real or virtual working environment. It's the expectations for behaviour from all employees. Culture is all about how the company operates, its values, and how people communicate - formally and informally. How much freedom you have to make decisions, how the conflicts are resolved and any unspoken rules you should follow.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to read the culture from the outside and usually, you will have to work in an organisation for a while to understand what kind of culture they really have. There are a couple of things you can do to get about 30% of the information before you start.&nbsp;</p><p>You can ask questions at your interview that will help you suss the culture out, or observe how your interviewers communicate with each other. You can ask other people who work there for their feedback about what it\u2019s like. When selecting an employee to talk to, I\u2019d pick someone as similar to you as possible, in terms of role/team/skills/ambition/personality type. For example, an organisation that seems toxic to you may be a perfect place for someone because you have different working styles.</p><p>Don\u2019t hesitate to withdraw from applications if you believe that you\u2019re not a good culture fit. Don\u2019t get upset if you\u2019re not chosen and you\u2019re not sure why. Just like you, employers are trying to figure out if you\u2019ll fit well within the team. If they think you won't, they spared you the time to start and find that out for yourself.</p><h3>Maximising your rejections means that you try many things and that you are ambitious</h3><p>I loved&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Pc3CFbYxPXgyjoDpB/seven-ways-to-become-unstoppably-agentic\"><u>this post</u></a> where the author talks about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Pc3CFbYxPXgyjoDpB/seven-ways-to-become-unstoppably-agentic#:~:text=rejections.%20See%20below!-,2.%20my%20concrete%20strategy%20to%20thrive%20on%20rejections,-If%20you%20are\"><u>maximising your rejections</u></a>. I think that it makes a lot of sense when you flip the situation from \u201comg I got rejected, poor me\u201d to \u201cwow, what a thing to be rejected from\u201d, and \u201clook at how many things I tried outside of my comfort zone\u201d. I now have a list where I list all my rejections and it looks pretty impressive. Something that used to depress me now makes me very proud of all the shots I took.</p><p><br><br>Thanks for reading!

I focus on EA and left-wing guests, and have been pretty involved in both communities for the last 5 years. Some example guests: Rutger Bregman, Leah Garc\u00e9s, Lewis Bollard, Spencer Greenberg, Nathan Robinson, Malaika Jabali, Emily Bazelon, David Shor, and Eric Levitz.&nbsp;</p><p>I just released a <a href=\"https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-most/33-habiba-islam-on-the-left-dkyEMLzNTHi/\">long conversation</a> with Habiba Islam, an 80K career advisor and lefty, about the relationship between EA and the left.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not an attempt to paper over differences between the two communities, or pretend that EA is more left-wing than it is. Instead, I tried to give an accurate description of both communities, where they are in hidden agreement, where they actually disagree, and what each can learn from the other.&nbsp;</p><p>Habiba is so sharp and thoughtful throughout the conversation. We're very lucky to have her!</p><p>I hope this could be a good reference text as well as an onboarding ramp for leftists who might be open to EA.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there's a real gap in the EA media-verse on the intersection of left-wing politics and EA, and we're almost certainly missing out on some great people and perspectives who would be into EA if they were presented with the right arguments and framing.&nbsp;</p><p>I have no delusions that all leftists would be into EA if they only understood it better, but I think there are tons of bad-faith criticisms and genuine misunderstandings that we could better address.

To this date I haven't found any organization that meets a good transparency requirement. Unfortunately, most of what I find doesn't meet even a basic transparency requirements.</p><p>OK, much of this confusion could be explained by the fact that I am just a newcomer to this philanthropic universe and I still don't understand how basic things work here.</p><p>But I am not so sure.</p><p>Shouldn't transparency be friendly and easy to access for all lay people? After all, when a charity asks for donations I think they expect it coming from the general public, which includes people who are strange to this organization and also not savvy about philanthropy.</p><p>On performing those experiments above I open their websites and in most cases the \"transparency page\" is nowhere to be found. They just claim that your donations are being spent in a \"good way\" and lots of them claiming \"we are 100% transparent\".</p><p>Correct me if I am wrong but for me it seems like the whole philanthropic industry is almost entirely running on a faith based trust. Why?</p><p>Why faith based trust if we could easily achieve evidence based trust?</p><p>OK, let me breathe for a moment....</p><p>I am not clueless here, people. I know I am touching a delicate subject and also know that as a newcomer we would better keep our mouth shut until we understand the terrain, and I would do just that in case we were talking about peripheral problems...</p><p>But, I believe that trust is as crucial to philanthropy as light is crucial to daylight and I am having a difficulty time navigating this new terrain when I am not able to understand a core aspect of the industry and it is how the \"opaque transparency\" is the standard \"transparency\" and how everyone seems to be fine with that.</p><p>I am holding this post for months... I am not the kind of person who likes controversies when entering a new community: this may only put me in isolation when what I want is the opposite.</p><p>But can't hold it anymore... please say I am wrong and I am not seeing the obvious, that most of charities/NGOs are indeed transparent but I was unable to find the right page in their website, even though this kind of page should be easy to find by a monkey.</p><p>There is a common argument:</p><p>\"But why demand so much transparency? If some organization is indeed doing their job honestly, showing or not their detailed finances wouldn't make their good acts less good\".</p><p>I have seen this argument more than a few times on the Internet and I hope that not a lot of people use this rationale to donate or else I would lose my hope in humanity. This argument is so naive and problematic that I don't even know where to start, so many things wrong with it.</p><p>First: if an organization is not publishing detailed financial reports, we should even assume honesty in the first place, so the thought \"... if they are honest ....\" is bogus, because we can't know that.</p><p>Moreover, it requires a lot of ignorance about basic human psychology to believe that an organization would behave in the same way regardless of them being transparent or opaque. Lack of transparency fundamentally change human behavior by simply giving enough room for all kinds of questionable stuff that even a reasonable person/organization is capable of doing and are very likely to be doing due to all kinds of pressure, rationalizations and the basic human tendency to find the easiest path.</p><p>Transparency brings the honesty inside people. Lack of transparency incentivizes and facilitates questionable \"honesty\" or no honesty at all. So no, we can't say things like: \"If they are honest anyway why demand transparency?\". Organizations fundamentally change their behavior under public scrutiny, and change for the better.</p><p>So, I am sorry to bring this not so positive subject here.

But it also brought about a time with many philosophical and cultural experiments that is now known as the hundred schools of thought. That\u2019s when Confucianism was born \u2013 the philosophy of Kong Fuzi who believed that self-improvement led to a spiritual transformation. Confucianism encouraged respect for your parents and obedience to authority, rulers and the state. The ethics depended on relationships between people rather than the actions themselves: A son beating their father is not okay, but the opposite is.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylWORyToTo4&amp;ab_channel=CrashCourse\"><u>*</u></a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cjnCux2yOM&amp;ab_channel=WallStreetJournal\"><u>*</u></a></p><p>There were a few other popular philosophies at the time; for example legalism. Legalists were strong proponents of heavy punishments for wrongdoings, a powerful military and a strong state, they believed people were selfish and needed heavy guidance.</p><p>Then there were the mohists \u2013 at the time, they were the confucianists\u2019 main rival. Mohists believed that we should care about other people as much as we care about ourselves. And that we should take whatever actions benefited the most people. They proposed owning no luxury and consuming less.</p><p>The rivalism ended in 221 BC when the legalism-influenced Qin conquered China and took strong measures against all competing schools of thought \u2013 apparently legalism had won. That all changed when the dynasty ended just 15 years later and Confucianism turned out to be the new popular ideology.<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qin_dynasty\"><u>*</u></a> Since then, all Chinese dynasties embraced Confucianism until the Qing dynasty ended in 1912. When Mao and the communist party started ruling China in 1949 it got suppressed, but it remained popular and it\u2019s being revived today.</p><p>The popularity of Confucianism is a great example of value lock-in: a situation where one set of values wins against others and stays in place for a very long time.</p><p>Other examples include Christianity and Islam: The bible and the Quran are still the best-selling books today!</p><h2><strong>Risks of locking in current values</strong></h2><p>In general when we look at values from the past \u2013 be it 10, 50 or 200 years ago \u2013 it feels like we progressed towards the better. There\u2019s no way we would want those \u201coutdated\u201d values to still persist. But what makes a lot of us so sure that our current values are good? They might be better in some ways, but just like we do now, people in the future will probably look at our current values and find a lot of them abhorrent. They will probably be glad we overcame those \u201coutdated\u201d values.</p><p>Right now a lot of pretty different worldviews are competing against each other \u2013 similar as in the time of the hundred schools of thought in China. No one school of thought has won \u2013 yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Now what is interesting about this with regards to the long term future: How does a school of thought win against others? How do values get locked in? What values from today do we want to lock in \u2013 if any? Which ones are maybe already locked in even though they might not be what is best for humanity?</p><p>This video is part of a series based on Oxford philosopher Will MacAskill\u2019s new book called What We Owe The Future. The book makes the case for caring about our longterm future and explores what we can do to have a positive impact on it. In a previous episode we told the story of Benjamin Lay, an inspiring abolitionist. In another one we argued why caring about our longterm future is important.</p><p>Will MacAskill mentions three ways values could get locked in in the future: If we set up a world government, through space colonisation, and through the development of powerful AI. The latter is perhaps the scariest. So far, Artificial Intelligence is narrow \u2013 meaning, machines only know how to perform narrow tasks, like beating us at chess. No AI can actually fully replicate human intelligence over all possible tasks. When AI exceeds human capabilities across all domains, and that might happen at some point sooner rather than later, there\u2019s the massive risk values would be locked in that are not what is best for humanity. Perhaps by the AI somehow imposing them on us.&nbsp;</p><p>This is already happening to some degree today through social media algorithms.&nbsp;</p><p>We know this topic is incredibly broad and complex. We\u2019re also not sure whether this really would happen. After all, it sounds a bit ridiculous. We will talk more about AI in our next video on existential threats, so subscribe and ring that notification bell to get notified when it comes out!</p><p>So how do we keep the wrong values from being locked in?&nbsp;</p><p>In general: We should try to keep our minds as open as possible for as long as possible. As such, we should promote free speech and create a marketplace of ideas wherever possible. Whenever multiple schools of thought are encouraged, it gets less likely for one of them to win and be locked in.</p><p>One idea we like a lot is the idea of ideological charter cities: autonomous communities with their own laws that try out different ideas as an experiment \u2013 to see how well some theories translate into the real world without the specific policies being difficult to reverse. One real life example again happened in China not that long ago. In 1979 a special economic zone was created around the city of Shenzhen \u2013 with more liberal economic policies than in the rest of the country. The average yearly income there grew by a factor of two hundred over forty years, the experiment inspired broader reforms across the country. Since then, hundreds of millions of people in China have gotten out of poverty.</p><p>The idea of an ideological charter city could also be tried out by marxists, environmentalists or anarchists! That way we could see which ideas work best in the real world and learn something from it.</p><p>Another thing that can help is to have more open borders. If people are allowed to migrate more easily, people can vote with their feet which countries\u2019 values they prefer.</p><p>Then there are values that are already helping us to get to morally better societies. Reason, reflection and empathy are probably among them. Engaging in good faith arguments, being open to other people\u2019s viewpoints, empathising with people not in our inner circle \u2013 all those practices can help getting to an improved point of view and better morals.</p><p>There\u2019s a paradox here: Making sure values don\u2019t get locked in means locking in values like these. But this is a paradox we\u2019re happy to live with.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>If you thought this was interesting, you should definitely check out Will\u2019s book.

Introduction: the evidence for Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention</h2><p>GiveWell currently endorses four&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\"><u>top charities</u></a>, with first place going to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.malariaconsortium.org/\"><u>Malaria Consortium</u></a>, a charity that delivers Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention (SMC). GiveWell provides more context on its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium#DoesItWork\"><u>Malaria Consortium \u2013 Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention</u></a> page and its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/seasonal-malaria-chemoprevention\"><u>Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention intervention report</u></a>. That report is built around a Cochrane review of seven randomized controlled trials (<a href=\"https://www.mmv.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/access/SMC_Tool_Kit/publications/Meremikww-ipt-review.pdf\"><u>Meremikwu et al. 2012</u></a>). GiveWell discounts one of those studies (<a href=\"https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-7-123\"><u>Dicko et al. 2008</u></a>) for technical reasons and includes an additional trial published later (<a href=\"https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/2373852/1/Tagbor_et_al-2016-Tropical_Medicine_&amp;_International_Health.pdf\"><u>Tagbor et al. 2016</u></a>) in its evidence base.&nbsp;</p><p>No new research has been added since then, and GiveWell\u2019s SMC report was last updated in 2018. It appears as though GiveWell treats the question of \u201cdoes SMC work?\u201d as effectively settled.</p><p>I argue that GiveWell should revisit its conclusions about SMC and should fund and/or oversee a high-quality replication study on the subject. While there is very strong evidence that SMC prevents the majority of malaria episodes, \u201cincluding severe episodes\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.mmv.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/access/SMC_Tool_Kit/publications/Meremikww-ipt-review.pdf\"><u>Meremikwu et al. 2012</u></a>, p. 2), GiveWell\u2019s estimate that every $5,000 of SMC saves a life in expectation is shaky on three grounds related to research quality: 1) the underlying effect size is small, relative to the sample size, and statistically imprecise; 2) SMC is often tested in places receiving other interventions, which threatens external validity because we don\u2019t know which set of interventions bests maps onto the target population; and 3) the evidence comes from studies that are pre-<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691617751884\"><u>credibility revolution</u></a>, and therefore lack quality controls such as detailed pre-registration, open code and data, and sufficient statistical power.</p><h2>2. Three grounds for doubting the relationship between SMC and mortality</h2><h3>2.1 The effect size is small and imprecisely estimated</h3><p>Across an N of 12,589,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mmv.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/access/SMC_Tool_Kit/publications/Meremikww-ipt-review.pdf\"><u>Meremikwu et al</u></a>. record 10 deaths in the combined treatment groups and 16 in the combined control groups. Subtracting the one study that GiveWell discounts and including the one they supplement with, we arrive at 10 deaths for treatment and 15 for control. As the authors note, \u201cthe difference was not statistically significant\u201d (p. 12), \u201cand none of the trials were adequately powered to detect an effect on mortality\u2026However, a reduction in death would be consistent with the high quality evidence of a reduction in severe malaria\u201d (p. 4).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefriylxog0a\"><sup><a href=\"#fnriylxog0a\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>Overall, the authors conclude, SMC \u201cprobably prevents some deaths,\u201d but \u201c[l]arger trials are necessary to have full confidence in this effect\u201d (p. 4).</p><p>As a benchmark, a <a href=\"https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=NEUDC2022&amp;paper_id=294\">recent study on deworming</a> (N = 14,172) estimates that deworming saves 18 lives per 1000 childbirths, versus about 0.4 for SMC.</p><p>GiveWell <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/seasonal-malaria-chemoprevention#Does_the_reduction_in_malaria_incidence_cause_a_similar_reduction_in_mortality?\">forthrightly acknowledges this \"limited evidence\" on its SMC page</a>, and explains why it believes SMC reduces morality to a larger degree than the assembled studies suggest directly. This is laudably transparent, but the question is foundational to all of GiveWell's subsequent analyses of SMC. Especially given the organization's strong <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/07/05/update-on-givewells-funding-projections/\">funding position</a>, GiveWell should devote resources towards bolstering that limited evidence through replication.</p><h3>2.2 It\u2019s unclear which studies map directly to the target population</h3><p>Of the seven studies analyzed by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mmv.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/access/SMC_Tool_Kit/publications/Meremikww-ipt-review.pdf\"><u>Meremikwu et al.</u></a>, four test SMC in settings where both treatment and control samples are already receiving anti-malaria interventions. Two studies test SMC along with \u201chome-based management of malaria (HMM)\u201d while two others test SMC \u201calongside ITN [insecticide treated nets] distribution and promotion\u201d (p. 9).</p><p>GiveWell\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/seasonal-malaria-chemoprevention#Possible_negative_/_offsetting_impacts\"><u>SMC intervention report</u></a> notes that SMC + ITN trials found \u201csimilar proportional reduction in malaria incidence to trials which did not promote ITNs.\u201d This finding is useful and interesting, but not does not self-evidently help us estimate the effects of&nbsp;<i>just&nbsp;</i>SMC on mortality, which is the basis of GiveWell\u2019s cost-benefit analyses. To make the leap between the four studies that include co-interventions and those that don\u2019t, we need an additional identifying assumption about external validity, such as:</p><ul><li>any interaction effect between SMC and co-interventions is negligible or negative, which makes these estimates minimally or downwardly biased;</li><li>the target population will have a mix of people receiving ITNs, HMM, or neither, and, therefore, we should aggregate these studies to mirror the target population.</li></ul><p>GiveWell does not take a position on this. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/seasonal-malaria-chemoprevention#Possible_negative_/_offsetting_impacts\"><u>SMC intervention report</u></a> says that the organization has \u201cnot carefully considered whether Malaria Consortium\u2019s SMC program is operating in areas where ITN coverage is being expanded.\u201d It does not mention HMM.</p><p>If we only look at the two studies that estimate the relationship between just SMC and mortality, we see that five children died in the combined control group (N = 1,139), while four died in the combined treatment group (N = 1,122). Every death of a child is a tragedy; but this difference is not a strong basis for determining where the marginal dollar is most likely to save a life, and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vQpk3cxdAe5RX9xzo/we-are-in-triage-every-second-of-every-day\">we are always triaging</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This issue merits more careful attention than it currently receives from GiveWell. At a minimum, the SMC intervention page might be amended to note GiveWell\u2019s position on the relationship between co-interventions and external validity. More broadly, an SMC replication could have multiple treatment arms to tease out the effects of both SMC and SMC + co-interventions.</p><h3>2.3 The provided studies lack the quality markers of the credibility revolution</h3><p>As Andrew Gelman puts it, \u201c<a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/09/21/what-has-happened-down-here-is-the-winds-have-changed/\"><u>What has happened down here is the winds have changed</u></a>;\u201d as recently as 2011, \u201cthe replication crisis was barely a cloud on the horizon.\u201d In the ten years since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mmv.org/sites/default/files/uploads/docs/access/SMC_Tool_Kit/publications/Meremikww-ipt-review.pdf\"><u>Meremikwu et al.</u></a> was published \u2013 as well as in the six years since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/2373852/1/Tagbor_et_al-2016-Tropical_Medicine_&amp;_International_Health.pdf\"><u>Tagbor et al.

Known for his works on animal ethics and global eradication of poverty, Singer wrote this essay in 1972 upon realising a large-scale famine in the Bengal region of India and pitiful consideration from affluent nations towards providing aid to the people suffering. His essay was read worldwide and aged well. Later his recognition, Singer went on publish several other works in the same field and become one of the most valid and influential philosophers of the <i>twenty-first</i> century.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref470it2pac5c\"><sup><a href=\"#fn470it2pac5c\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><h2><strong>Lessons To Learn</strong></h2><p>Right from the very start, Singer asked to change the entire moral conceptual scheme of the society that is allowing us to take the value of life for granted. As shaped by the modern era, for some people, death by starvation is not considered such a big deal among other contemporary measures of demise like- cancer or death by natural causes, or being caught in a war, or fighting your inner demons. Singer carefully guided those people to read no further his essay. As for others, he argued a general policy should be adopted- <i>if it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.</i></p><p>The above-mentioned quote may seem like wishful thinking, or a moral goal to reach, or an obvious rule of thumb, or a ripoff from the Spiderman, depending on the category you belong to. But in reality, today, very few people can actually adhere to such an orthodox principle, because most consider it a little too orthodox to follow; and/or they are already <i>doing the best they can. </i>The latter is the bread and butter of the populous regions and hence Singer clarifies what he meant by <i>anything of comparable moral importance</i> in detail, followed by the example of a<i> child in a pond </i>which is well-known and widely used as an analogy in various forms today.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffzupopk0zca\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfzupopk0zca\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://youtu.be/PHgdXWZLs9g\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PHgdXWZLs9g\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p><br>One of the factors which allow people to abstain from following the above-mentioned principle is <i>Proximity </i>or simply put, the location of where they are and where help is required. This also includes those who are willing to help only the people of their own community or country. In his essay, the author argues that for achieving equality in our nation, we have to stop using the excuse of distance for discriminating against the people outside when it comes to necessary aid. Equality must not be considered only inside our own devised moral circle, rather we should expand our range to maintain the universal notion of equality.&nbsp;</p><p>Even when deciding to put our foot forward, many obtrusions come our way. One that is prevalent is the surrounding filled with knowns and unknowns, but none is concerned about the issues of the outside. In such a case, one feels less guilty about doing nothing if one can point to others, similarly placed, who have also done nothing. The author argues that we live in a world where we can't use the excuse of unawareness anymore; hence, to counter that, people often overestimate the number of people supporting or doing something for a particular cause. In any disaster scenario, the available resources are always going to be way less than the estimate, as the people who should provide the resources are not always doing their job by following the same overestimation by others. We should not assume that the government is always doing what is required when it comes to helping other nations. Foreign policy and politics don't align with the values of ethics and humanitarianism and are often run by compromised officials. Singer stressed the fact that most of the major evils like poverty, overpopulation, pollution etc. are dealt with on a divided stand but in fact, are problems in which everyone is almost equally involved.</p><p>In the last part of the essay, Singer highlighted the value of charity and the major ideas associated with the concept of giving money. It is a commonly accepted virtue that doing charity is a kind act, but 'not' doing charity is considered as that an equally respected choice. The author criticises this notion in great detail. He argues that, if a person is well-fed and affluent enough to contribute, the choice of not helping should be considered morally wrong. The value of money, used to satisfy our unnecessary needs, is a lot more for someone in need of food and warmth. The author states that Utilitarian theory plays a key role to prevent us from even exploring ways to help others and urges people to consider adopting either the strong or moderate approach to revise their moral values.</p><h1>Reflection On <strong>Today</strong></h1><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:89.49%\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/30d079d6a4077b5af3837636564c4346a9cfc12b49f82d6f.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/30d079d6a4077b5af3837636564c4346a9cfc12b49f82d6f.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/30d079d6a4077b5af3837636564c4346a9cfc12b49f82d6f.png/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/30d079d6a4077b5af3837636564c4346a9cfc12b49f82d6f.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/30d079d6a4077b5af3837636564c4346a9cfc12b49f82d6f.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/30d079d6a4077b5af3837636564c4346a9cfc12b49f82d6f.png/w_1000 1000w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/30d079d6a4077b5af3837636564c4346a9cfc12b49f82d6f.png/w_1200 1200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/30d079d6a4077b5af3837636564c4346a9cfc12b49f82d6f.png/w_1400 1400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/30d079d6a4077b5af3837636564c4346a9cfc12b49f82d6f.png/w_1600 1600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/30d079d6a4077b5af3837636564c4346a9cfc12b49f82d6f.png/w_1800 1800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/30d079d6a4077b5af3837636564c4346a9cfc12b49f82d6f.png/w_2000 2000w\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/CT1m6HtlX6Z/\">Pictures </a>taken by the author, do tag me if used anywhere else</figcaption></figure><p>50 years after Peter Singer posed the imperative question to end his essay\u2014<i>What is the point of relating philosophy to public (and personal) affairs if we do not take our conclusions seriously? \u2014 </i>the sights of the <i>70s &nbsp;</i>are reminiscent<i> </i>if we are willing to look at them.

According to the book <a href=\"https://theprecipice.com\">The Precipice</a> by Toby Ord, around <i>two dollars </i>a day is recognised as a threshold for extreme poverty. According to the latest reports, at least 1/3 of the global population with extreme poverty belongs to India, with at least 667 million people expected to be in extreme poverty by 2022.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdbx6f85ssu7\"><sup><a href=\"#fndbx6f85ssu7\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The stark feature of this report is, as before, there is still no data provided by the government. The estimates were made by the data provided by (CPHS), conducted by the CMIE, which the citizens, living in India, know is riddled with discrepancies.</p><p>According to my very educated guesstimate, the numbers would correspond to the threshold of 1.5$ a day rather than 2$, and there are several millions of people in between. As of 2022, most jobs(for educated individuals) provide a pay of a maximum 4$ a day and the figure hit 2.5$ when it comes to hands-on jobs with more than 10 hrs of absolute work. That means the guy serving you a 6$ coffee in 5 minutes is eating a meal worth 2 dollars after a six-hour shift of serving 60 coffees.&nbsp;</p><p>These figures are only valid for the forecast major metro-regions of &nbsp;India(which are a lot) because the pattern gets much darker and fictional if data is extracted from the rural underdeveloped regions of the country. The chances of that are next to none. The common trend pertaining to the rurals is to move to a metro city or region, to find work or opportunities to work. This is quite a normal scenario, frequent and adopted throughout the world by people struggling. The difference here is the duration and education. Because the pay is so poor and the balance is so much inclined, those who get lucky enough to get involved in a job, to avoid living in slums, and which requires no use of education find themselves stuck there years later with the same 2$ a day wage and 20$ in the bank account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn470it2pac5c\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref470it2pac5c\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>qz.com/810197/the-most-influential-ethicist-alive-says-the-world-is-actually-becoming-a-better-place/amp</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnfzupopk0zca\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreffzupopk0zca\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/videos-books-and-essays/famine-affluence-and-morality-peter-singer</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnw3feekbz1f\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefw3feekbz1f\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>www.unicef.org/press-releases/two-months-war-ukraine-creating-child-protection-crisis-extraordinary-proportions</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnwj3hl5tycq9\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefwj3hl5tycq9\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>unicef.org/press-releases/we-cannot-abandon-children-afghanistan-their-time-need</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fndbx6f85ssu7\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefdbx6f85ssu7\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>theprint.in/india/covid-reversed-poverty-decline-made-7-1-cr-people-poor-says-world-bank-at-least-1-3-from-india/1157031/</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Mayank Modi"}}, {"_id": "ztJBqjN6iDMQBAjAr", "title": "GiveWell should use shorter TAI timelines", "postedAt": "2022-10-27T06:59:03.977Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>GiveWell\u2019s discount rate of 4% includes a 1.4% contribution from \u2018temporal uncertainty\u2019 arising from the possibility of major events radically changing the world.</li>\n<li>This is incompatible with the transformative artificial intelligence (TAI) timelines of many AI safety researchers.</li>\n<li>I argue that GiveWell should increase its discount rate, or at least provide a justification for differing significantly from the commonly-held (in EA) view that TAI could come soon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Epistemic Status:</strong> timelines are hard, and I don\u2019t have novel takes, but I worry perhaps GiveWell doesn\u2019t either, and they are dissenting unintentionally.</p>\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JvEHiKWWwtvT3YanA/givewell-misuses-discount-rates\">accompanying post</a> I argued GiveWell should use a probability distribution over discount rates, I will ignore that here though, and just consider whether their point estimate is appropriate.</p>\n<p>GiveWell\u2019s current discount rate of 4% is calculated as the sum of three factors. Quoting their explanations from this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g2tf7Fu8-iG_8TgnJkEx9G5TlEyrcv7PXPokmPZaUMc/edit\">document</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improving circumstances over time: 1.7%.  \u201cIncreases in consumption over time meaning marginal increases in consumption in the future are less valuable.\u201d</li>\n<li>Compounding non-monetary benefits: 0.9%. \u201cThere are non-monetary returns not captured in our cost-effectiveness analysis which likely compound over time and are causally intertwined with consumption. These include reduced stress and improved nutrition.\u201d</li>\n<li>Temporal uncertainty: 1.4%. \u201cUncertainty increases with projections into the future, meaning the projected benefits may fail to materialize. James [a GiveWell researcher] recommended a rate of 1.4% based on judgement on the annual likelihood of an unforeseen event or longer term change causing the expected benefits to not be realized. Examples of such events are major changes in economic structure, catastrophe, or political instability.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I do not have a good understanding of how these numbers were derived, and have no reason to think the first two are unfair estimates.  I think the third is a significant underestimate.</p>\n<p>TAI is precisely the sort of \u201cmajor change\u201d meant to be captured by the temporal uncertainty factor.  I have no insights to add on the question of TAI timelines, but I think absent GiveWell providing justification to the contrary, they should default towards using the timelines of people who have thought about this a lot.  One such person is Ajeya Cotra, who in August <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AfH2oPHCApdKicM4m/two-year-update-on-my-personal-ai-timelines\">reported</a> a 50% credence in TAI being developed by 2040.  I do not claim, and nor does Ajeya, that this is authoritative, however it seems a reasonable starting point for GiveWell to use, given they have not and (I think rightly) probably will not put significant work into forming independent timelines.  Also in August, a broader <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/#Summary_of_results\">survey</a> of 738 experts by AI Impacts resulted in a median year for TAI of 2059.  This source has the advantage of including many more people, but conversely most of them will have not spent much time thinking carefully about timelines.</p>\n<p>I will not give a sophisticated instantiation of what I propose, but rather gesture at what I think a good approach would be, and give a toy example to improve on the status quo.  A naive thing to do would be to imagine that there is a fixed annual probability of developing TAI conditional on not having developed it to date.  This method gives an annual probability of 3.8% under Ajeya\u2019s timelines, and 1.9% under the AI Impacts timelines.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-7tqvJM6oDutTDcnz4-1\" id=\"fnref-7tqvJM6oDutTDcnz4-1\">[1]</a></sup>  In reality, more of our probability mass should be placed on the later years between now and 2040 (or 2059), and we should not simply stop at 2040 (or 2059).  A proper model would likely need to dispense with a constant discount rate entirely, and instead track the probability the world has not seen a \u201cmajor change\u201d by each year.  A <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ebYdBNpGnshhm2Gkq/neartermists-should-consider-agi-timelines-in-their-spending\">model</a> that accomplishes something like this was published on the EA Forum in July, and suggests interventions that actualise their benefit sooner should be favoured in shorter timelines worlds.</p>\n<p>Clearly, TAI is not the only such event that could upend the world, so the contribution of temporal uncertainty to the discount rate should be greater than that just from AI.  Thus, the temporal uncertainty parameter, and therefore the overall discount rate, seems to be significantly too low.  If we instead use a discount rate of 7%, this reduces the cost-effectiveness of the deworming charities by 45-46%, while a discount rate of 5% would still lead to a reduction in cost effectiveness of 19%, both compared to the current value of 4%.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-7tqvJM6oDutTDcnz4-2\" id=\"fnref-7tqvJM6oDutTDcnz4-2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>All this relies on judgement calls in the challenging domain of forecasting AI timelines where reasonable people can and do disagree dramatically, so if GiveWell decides they have long timelines this is fine. However, if this is the case it should be communicated in a better justification for the time uncertainty parameter.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-7tqvJM6oDutTDcnz4-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>If there is an annual probability, x, of TAI for the next 18 years, and a 50% chance of TAI within 18 years, then (1-x)^18=0.5 =&gt; x=1-2^(-1/18)=0.038.

I remember wishing there was a group out there that shared at least one of my ideals. Instead, I found one that shares three: global reduction of suffering, rationality, and longtermism. However, with each conference I attend, posts I read on the forum, and organizations being created, I notice most of them fall into a few distinct categories. Global development/health, animal welfare, biosecurity, climate change, nuclear risk/global conflict, and AI Safety. Don\u2019t get me wrong, these are some of the most important areas to possibly be working on (I\u2019m currently focusing 90% of my energy on AI Safety, myself). But I think there are at least five other areas that could benefit substantially from a small growth in interest.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Interplanetary Species Expansion</strong></h2><p>This might come as the biggest surprise to be on the list. After all, space exploration is expensive and difficult. But there are very few out there who are actually working on how to change humanity from being a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure\">Single Point of Failure System</a>. If we are serious about longtermism and truly decreasing x-risk, this might be one of the most crucial achievements needed. Any x-risk is most likely greatly reduced by this, even perhaps AGI*. The sooner this process begins, the greater the reduction in risk, since this will be a very slow process. One comparatively low-cost research area is studying biospheres and how a separate ecosystem and climate could be created in complete isolation. And this can be studied on Earth. It\u2019s been decades since someone has attempted creating a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_ecological_system\"><u>closed ecological system</u></a>, and advancement in this could even improve our chances of surviving on Earth if the climate proves inhospitable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Life Extension</strong></h2><p>~100,000 people die from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/44/5/1332\"><u>age-related diseases&nbsp;</u></a>every day. ~100 billion people have died in our history. (Read that again.) Aging causes an immense amount of suffering, both to those who suffer from it for years, and to those who must grieve. It also causes irrecoverable loss, and is perhaps the greatest tragedy that is treated as normal. If every person who dies of preventable diseases like malaria is a tragedy, I do not see the difference in those dying of other causes also being a tragedy. Even if you do believe extending the human lifespan is not important, consider the alternative case where you\u2019re wrong. If your perspective is incorrect, then ~100k more tragedies happen for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZYNADOHhVY\"><u>every day</u></a> we delay solving it.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Cryonics</strong></h2><p>This is related to Life Extension, but even more neglected, and probably even more impactful. The number of people actually working on cryonics to improve human minds is easily below 100. A key advancement from one individual in research, technology, or organizational improvement could likely have enormous impact. The reason for doing this goes back to the idea of irrecoverable loss of sentient minds. As with life extension, if you do not believe cryonics to be important or even possible, consider the alternative where you\u2019re wrong. If one day we do manage to bring people back &nbsp;from suspended animation, I believe humanity will weep for all those that were needlessly thrown in the dirt or the fire: for they are the ones there is no hope for, an irreversible tragedy. The main reason why I think this isn\u2019t being worked on more is because it is even \"weirder\" than most EA causes, despite making&nbsp;<a href=\"https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html\"><u>a good deal of sense</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Nanotechnology</strong></h2><p><s>80k lists</s> &nbsp;a survey provided on the 80k website** places nanotechnology as having a 5% chance of <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/existential-risks/\">causing human extinction</a>, the same as artificial superintelligence***, and 4% greater than nuclear war. Many do not seem to dispute the possible danger of nanoweapons. Many agree that nanoweapons&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/oqBJk2Ae3RBegtFfn/my-thoughts-on-nanotechnology-strategy-research-as-an-ea\"><u>are possible</u></a>. Many agree that nanotechnology is expanding, even if it\u2019s no longer in the news. So, where are all the EAs tackling nanotech? Where are the organizations devoted to it? Where are the research institutions?**** Despite so many seeming to agree that this cause is important, there seems to be a perplexing lack of pursuit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Coordination Failures</strong></h2><p>Most of humanity\u2019s problems come from coordination failures. Nuclear war and proliferation is a coordination failure: everyone would be safer if there were no nukes in the world, and very few people (with some obvious current world exceptions) actually benefit from many entities having them. Climate change is partially a coordination failure: everyone wants the benefits of reducing it, but no one wants to be the only one footing the bill. A large amount of AGI risk will likely be from coordination failures: everyone will be so concerned about others building dangerous AGI that they will be incentivized to build dangerous AGI first. Finding fundamental ways to solve this could not only radically decrease x-risk, but would probably make the lives of everyone unbelievably better. This is a big ask, though. It\u2019s likely that most attempts at this will fail, but even a 1-5% chance of success I think is worth putting far more effort into. We have already seen some achievements. As Eliezer Yudkowsky notes in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://equilibriabook.com/\"><u>Inadequate Equilibria</u></a>, Kickstarter achieved a way for people to contribute to a project, but only if the project got enough funding to actually be created, so that no one ended-up wasting their own money. The Satoshi Nakamoto Consensus created a way for contracts to be enforced without the need for government coercion. These were insights from a few individuals, with inspiration from a wide variety of domains. It is likely there are many others waiting to be discovered.</p><p><br><br><br><br>*I do not think AGI risk is prevented by having multiple human bases, but I think the high uncertainty around how an AGI might kill us all does pose the chance that other home worlds might be safe from it. This is contingent on 1: the AGI not wishing to expand exponentially, and 2: the AGI not being specifically interested in our extinction. All other x-risks I know of (nuclear war, climate change, bioweapons, etc.) are all substantially reduced by having other bases.</p><p>**80k actually places AI risk closer to <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\">10%</a>, and nanoweapons <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/atomically-precise-manufacturing/\">much lower</a>.</p><p>***I believe this is far too low for AGI.</p><p>****There are a few.

We believe we\u2019ve recently made some progress on this front, developing <a href=\"https://www.redwoodresearch.org/s/causal-scrubbing\">an algorithm called \u201ccausal scrubbing\u201d</a> which allows us to automatically derive an extensive set of tests for a wide class of mechanistic explanations. This algorithm is only able to reject hypotheses rather than confirming them, but we think that this still makes it way more efficient to review the research produced by all the participants.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Our current plan is to require researchers in this program to do causal scrubbing on all serious research they produce and submit to the internal review process. (They can do exploratory analyses with whatever techniques they like.)</li></ul><p><strong>Improved proofs of concept.</strong> We now have several examples where we followed our methodology and were able to learn a fair bit about how a transformer was performing some behavior.</p><ul><li>We&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/3ecs6duLmTfyra3Gp/some-lessons-learned-from-studying-indirect-object\"><u>recently investigated</u></a> a somewhat complex behavior in GPT-2-small, which we call \u201cindirect object identification\u201d (\u201cIOI\u201d). IOI is the model behavior where, given a sequence such as \u201cBob and Alice went to the store and Alice gave an apple to\u201d, the model predicts \u201cBob\u201d rather than \u201cAlice\u201d. Our research located and described the mechanism inside GPT-2-small that performs this behavior, i.e. which heads of the network are involved and what roles they play. Though our investigation into GPT-2-small was much less comprehensive than e.g. the description of how an image classification model detects curves in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/\"><u>Distill Circuits thread</u></a>, we think our research here suggests that transformer language models&nbsp;<i>do&nbsp;</i>have some crisp circuits that can be located and described.</li><li>We did <a href=\"https://www.redwoodresearch.org/s/causal-scrubbing#page=71\">causal-scrubbing-based analysis</a> of a two-layer attention-only language model in order to get a detailed sense of the interactions in a model that were important for the performance of the \u201c<a href=\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/in-context-learning-and-induction-heads/index.html\"><u>induction heads</u></a>\u201d. We also used <a href=\"https://www.redwoodresearch.org/s/causal-scrubbing#page=33\">causal scrubbing to assess hypotheses</a> about a transformer trained to classify strings of parentheses as balanced or unbalanced. In both these cases, we found that we could apply our methodology pretty straightforwardly, yielding useful results that we\u2019ll publish very soon.</li></ul><p><strong>Tools that allow complicated experiments to be specified quickly.&nbsp;</strong>We\u2019ve built a powerful library for manipulating neural nets (and computational graphs more generally) for doing intervention experiments and getting activations out of models. This library allows us to do experiments that would be quite error-prone and painful with other tools.</p><h2>Who should apply?</h2><p>We're most excited about applicants comfortable working with (basic) Python, any of PyTorch/TensorFlow/Numpy, and linear algebra. Quickly generating hypotheses about model mechanisms and testing them requires some competence in these domains.</p><p>If you don\u2019t understand the transformer architecture, we\u2019ll require that you go through preparatory materials, which explain the architecture and walk you through building one yourself.</p><p>We\u2019re excited about applicants with a range of backgrounds; prior experience in interpretability research is not required. The primary activity will be designing, running, and analyzing results from experiments which you hope will shed light on how a model accomplishes some task, so we\u2019re excited about applicants with experience doing empirical science in any field (e.g. economics, biology, physics). The core skill we\u2019re looking for here, among people with the requisite coding/math background, is something like <strong>rigorous curiosity</strong>: a drive to thoroughly explore all the ways the model might be performing some behavior and narrow them down through careful experiments.</p><h2>What is doing this sort of research like?</h2><p>Mechanistic interpretability is an unusual empirical scientific setting in that controlled experimentation is relatively easy, but there\u2019s relatively little knowledge about the kinds of structures found in neural nets.</p><p>Regarding the ease of experimentation:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>It\u2019s easy to do complicated intervention experiments. If you\u2019re curious about whether the network, or some internal component of it, would have produced a radically different output had some feature of the input been different, you can re-run it exactly and just change that feature. There\u2019s little to no hassle involved in controlling for all the other features of the run.</li><li>You can extract almost any metric from the internal state of the model at any time.&nbsp;</li><li>You can quickly run lots of inputs through the model all at once if you want to characterize average behaviors.</li><li>See Chris Olah\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://colah.github.io/notes/interp-v-neuro/\"><u>note on neuroscience versus interpretability</u></a> for more on this point.</li></ul><p>Regarding the openness of the field:</p><ul><li>Large and important questions, like \u201cHow much similarity is there in the internals of different models?\u201d and \u201cTo what degree are model behaviors implemented as modular, human-comprehensible algorithms?\u201d are still mostly unexplored.</li><li>We\u2019re early on in the process of discovering commonalities across models like induction heads - we don\u2019t currently know how much there tends to be simple, universal algorithms that show up across models, versus each model being idiosyncratic.</li></ul><p>REMIX participants pursue interpretability research akin to the investigations Redwood has done recently into <a href=\"https://www.redwoodresearch.org/s/causal-scrubbing#page=71\">induction heads</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/3ecs6duLmTfyra3Gp/some-lessons-learned-from-studying-indirect-object\"><u>indirect object identification (IOI) in small language models</u></a>, and<a href=\"https://www.redwoodresearch.org/s/causal-scrubbing#page=33\"> balanced parenthesis classification</a>, all of which will be released publically soon. You can read more about behavior selection criteria&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LkBmAGJgZX2tbwGKg/help-out-redwood-research-s-interpretability-team-by-finding\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>The main activities will be:</p><ul><li>doing exploratory analyses to generate hypotheses about how a language model (probably GPT-2-small) performs some behavior</li><li>evaluating your hypotheses with <a href=\"https://www.redwoodresearch.org/s/causal-scrubbing\">our causal scrubbing methodology</a></li><li>iterating to make hypotheses more fine-grained and more accurate</li></ul><p>The mechanisms for behaviors we\u2019ll be studying are often surprisingly complex, so careful experimentation is needed to accurately characterize them. For example, the Redwood researchers investigating the IOI behavior found that removing the influence of the circuit they identified as primarily responsible had surprisingly little effect on the model\u2019s ability to do IOI. Instead, other heads in the model substantially changed their behavior to compensate for the excision. As the researchers write, \u201cBoth the reason and the mechanism of this compensation effect are still unclear. We think that this could be an interesting phenomenon to investigate in future work.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Here\u2019s how a Redwood researcher describes this type of research:</p><blockquote><p>It feels a lot of time like you're cycling between: \"this looks kind of weird and interesting, not sure what's up with this\" and then \"I have some vague idea about what maybe this part is doing, I should come up with a test to see if I understand I correctly\" and then once you have a test \"oh cool, I was kind of right but also kind of wrong, why was I wrong\" and then the cycle repeats.</p><p>Often it's pretty easy to have a hunch about what some part of your model is doing, but finding a way to appropriately test that hunch is hard and often your hunch might be partially correct but incomplete so your test may rule it out prematurely if you're not careful/specific enough.</p><p>It feels like you're in a lab, with your model on the dissection table, and you're trying to pick apart what's going on with different pieces and using different tools to do so - this feels really cool to me, kind of like trying to figure out what's going on with this alien species and how it can do the things it does.</p><p>It's really fun to try and construct a persuasive argument for your results: \"I think this is what's happening because I ran X, Y, Z experiments that show A, B, C, plus I was able to easily generate adversarial examples based on these hypotheses\" - I often feel like there's some sort of imaginary adversary (sometimes not imaginary!) that I have to convince of my results and this makes it extremely important that I make claims that I can actually back up and that I appropriately caveat others.</p></blockquote><p>This research also involves a reasonable amount of linear algebra and probability theory.

My inside view is that the expected direct value does in fact pay for the dollar cost of this project, and probably even the time cost of the organizers. However, there are strong reasons for skepticism\u2013this is a pretty weird thing to do, and it\u2019s sort of weird to be able to make progress on things by having a large group of people work together. So the decision to run this program is to some extent determined by more boring, capacity-building considerations, like training people and getting experience with large projects.</p></blockquote><h3>How useful is this kind of interpretability research for understanding models that might pose an existential risk?</h3><p>This research might end up not being very useful. Here\u2019s Buck\u2019s description of some reasons why this might be the case:</p><blockquote><p>My main concern is that the language model interpretability research we mentioned above was done on model behaviors which were specifically selected because we thought interpreting these behaviors would be easy. (I\u2019ve recently been calling this kind of research \u201cstreetlight interpretability\u201d, as in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect%5C\"><u>the classic fallacy where you only look for things in the place that\u2019s easiest to look in</u></a>.) These model behaviors are chosen to be unrepresentatively easy to interpret.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>In particular, it\u2019s not at all obvious how to use any existing interpretability techniques (or even how to articulate the goal of interpretability) in situations where the algorithm the model is using is poorly described by simple, human-understandable heuristics. I suspect that tasks like IOI or acronym generation, where the model implements a simple algorithm, are the exception rather than the rule, and models achieve good performance on their training trask mostly by using huge piles of correlations and heuristics. Our preliminary attempts to characterize how the model distinguishes between outputting \u201cis\u201d and \u201cwas\u201d indicate that it relies on a huge number of small effects; my guess is that this is more representative of what language models are mostly doing than e.g. the IOI work.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>So my guess is that this research direction (where we try to explain model behaviors in terms of human-understandable concepts) is limited, and is more like diving into a part of the problem that I strongly suspect to be solvable, rather than tackling the biggest areas of uncertainty or developing the techniques that might greatly expand the space of model behavior that we can understand. We are also pursuing various research directions that might make a big difference here; I think that research on these improved strategies is quite valuable (plausibly the best research direction), but I think that streetlight interpretability still looks pretty good.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Another concern you might have is that it\u2019s useful to have a few examples of this kind of streetlight interpretability, but there are steeply diminishing marginal returns from doing more work of this type. For what it\u2019s worth, I have so far continued to find it useful/interesting to see more examples of research in this style, but it\u2019s pretty believable that this will slow down after ten more projects of this form or something.</p></blockquote><p>Overall, we think that mechanistic interpretability is one of the most promising research directions for helping prevent AI takeover. Our hope is that mature interpretability techniques will let us distinguish between two ML systems that each behave equally helpfully during training \u2013 even having exactly the same input/output behavior on the entire training dataset \u2013 but where one does so because it is deceiving us and the other does so \u201cfor the right reasons.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrpsfd9ibl4i\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrpsfd9ibl4i\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>Our experience has been that explaining model behaviors supports both empirical interpretability work \u2013 guiding how we engineer interpretability tools and providing practical knowhow \u2013 and theoretical interpretability work \u2013 for example, leading to the development of the <a href=\"https://www.redwoodresearch.org/s/causal-scrubbing\">causal scrubbing algorithm</a>. We expect many of the practical lessons that we might learn would generalize to more advanced systems, and we expect that addressing the theoretical questions that we encounter along the way would lead to important conceptual progress.</p><p>Currently, almost no interesting behaviors of ML models have been explained \u2013 even for models that are tiny compared with frontier systems. We have been working to change this, and we\u2019d like you to help.</p><p>For other perspectives on this question, see Chris Olah\u2019s description of the relevance of thorough, small-model interpretability&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/CzZ6Fch4JSpwCpu6C/interpretability\"><u>here</u></a> and Paul Christiano\u2019s similar view&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/oWN9fgYnFYJEWdAs9/comments-on-openphil-s-interpretability-rfp\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p><i>Apply&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/redwoodresearch/5a66fff4-0d11-4954-830a-9228635cea59\"><i><u>here</u></i></a><i> by November 8th to be a researcher in the program, and apply sooner if you want to start ASAP.

In the 2000s, the means of production might be computer chips, data, etc. We currently suck at controlling/regulating this.&nbsp;</li></ul>", "user": {"username": "madhav-malhotra"}}, {"_id": "NRa7ndwZ6kmtJXKqx", "title": "EA-Aligned Political Activity in a US Congressional Primary: Concerns and Proposed Changes", "postedAt": "2022-10-28T07:36:27.704Z", "htmlBody": "<h2>Summary</h2><p>This post shares my observations of the approach of the EA-aligned political action committee Protect our Future (POF) in a US Congressional Primary in North Carolina. Writing anonymously, I share my experience talking informally with roughly 20 individuals and observing the race through the media and as a citizen. I express concerns with POF's limited explanation of the rationale for their spending in this race, their limited explanation of why they selected their endorsed candidate, and advertisements that did not address their stated rationale for supporting the candidate. I explain my concern that the association of EA with large scale political spending and limited transparency could have harmful reputational effects. (This post is meant to provide constructive comments, and it should not be taken as a critique of POF's intentions or broader impact.) Finally, I propose a few changes that POF or other groups could make moving forward to mitigate possible harm, such as publishing the criteria used to evaluate candidates, providing a specific rationale for each endorsed candidate, and providing additional transparency on funding sources.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>I am writing this post to share my firsthand experience observing the Democratic primary in the 4th Congressional District of North Carolina this past spring. The political action committee (PAC) Protect our Future (POF), funded predominantly by prominent EA Sam Bankman-Fried, spent heavily (roughly $1 million) in this race to support the successful nomination of current NC State Senator Valerie Foushee. The 4th District is overwhelmingly Democratic, and Foushee has &gt;99% odds of winning the seat in the general election on November 8th, according to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s forecast as of October 26th.</p><p>I decided to write this post, my first on the EA Forum, in order to share concerns that came out of my observation of this race. Given the highly anecdotal nature of my experiences, and the success of Foushee\u2019s campaign so far, these critiques should be viewed with some skepticism. Nonetheless, as EAs become a larger force in politics, I hope that these concerns and the accompanying suggestions could be useful for EAs engaging in large scale political spending.&nbsp;</p><p>I have no prior connection with or relationship to Sam Bankman-Fried or Protect our Future. <strong>I hope that these critiques and suggestions will be received as good faith concerns about specific practices, rather than any sort of personal attack or criticism of POF\u2019s goals, intentions, or broader impact.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Personal background&nbsp;</h2><p>I work in state government/politics in North Carolina. I\u2019m worried that writing this post with my name attached to it could negatively impact my work, so I\u2019ve decided to stay anonymous. I did not work or volunteer for any of the candidates in this race, though I am part of a group that endorsed one of the candidates (Nida Allam). I had no role in that endorsement. I was uncertain about who I'd vote for until a few weeks before the election, but I did end up voting for Nida Allam. Those factors could certainly influence how I view this situation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>My experience of the election</h2><p>The concerns expressed in this post stem from conversations I had with political professionals and politically engaged but nonprofessional individuals in the run up to and the aftermath of this primary election. I also read a variety of local and national news articles that examined the role of money in the election, including the financial support from POF. In total, I talked casually with roughly 10 political professionals and 10 nonprofessionals about these topics. I did not necessarily discuss all aspects of the election or POF's role with everyone. Each of these individuals live either in or near the 4th district. I would estimate that I also consumed roughly 10 news items about the spending in the race in particular, as well as many more about the race more generally (possibly around 50.) I think this represents only a surface-level examination of the election and the underlying issues. Nonetheless, I think it\u2019s possible that even that could provide some useful avenues for further thought and consideration by the community and, in particular, EAs involved in large scale political spending. I was particularly motivated to write this post because I haven\u2019t seen many write ups that reflect on-the-ground experience with the impacts of EA-aligned political spending. I certainly think a much more scientific and in-depth analysis on this topic could be useful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Concerns with POF\u2019s approach</h2><h3><i>Limited information on the rationale for the spending</i>&nbsp;</h3><p>POF has stated that they support NC State Sen. Valerie Foushee because they believe she will be a leader on pandemic preparedness. As far as I can tell, however, POF gave no outward explanation of its endorsement of Foushee until the media questioned their purpose. As of the time of writing, the group has a limited <a href=\"https://www.protectourfuture.us/\">website</a> listing its endorsements, contact information, and key principles (1 paragraph and 5 additional bullet points). My sense is that this is not atypical for PACs involved in US politics. Nonetheless, I think that EAs involved in politics should help promote good governance and societal values of trust and openness by going beyond the typically meager information provided by PACs. SBF\u2019s significant financial stake in cryptocurrency, which could be affected by Congressional activity, makes the need for transparency even greater. In nearly every conversation I had about the election where POF\u2019s political spending came up, individuals expressed varying levels of confidence that POF\u2019s spending was truly related to SBF\u2019s economic interest in cryptocurrency, and a few expressed the feeling that thinking otherwise would be naive. I point this out to demonstrate that, at least among the very politically engaged people I spoke to, few if any took POF\u2019s claim of interest in pandemic prevention seriously. (To be clear, I do not doubt POF's intentions here, but some individuals without prior knowledge of SBF and EA seemed to.)</p><p>I believe this perception may have been exacerbated by a number of choices that could be altered moving forward. Notably, POF provided little explanation of Foushee's interest or achievements in pandemic preparedness, as well as little information on what policies she would support if elected.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><i>Ads unrelated to the rationale for POF's support&nbsp;</i></h3><p>Campaign ads produced by POF, as far as I saw, didn't mention pandemic preparedness. (Example:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ak0d6ygLGlE\"><u>Protect Our Future ad backing Valerie Foushee</u></a>) The ads I saw were focused on Foushee\u2019s personal background and unrelated policy issues. I believe that this could have raised further suspicion about the motives of POF and SBF and the potential role of his financial interests in cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p><p>I do want to note my uncertainties about this critique in particular. An alternative ad campaign that focused on pandemic preparedness or was more explicit about the reason POF supported Foushee may have been less likely to sway voters. As such, it\u2019s definitely possible that this was a worthwhile tradeoff.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><i>No clear reason for POF's support of Foushee over other candidates</i></h3><p>Additionally, I didn't notice an effort to distinguish why Foushee would be a better candidate on pandemic preparedness than other candidates. It's possible that POF chose not to explain this part of their thinking in order to avoid harming their second choice candidate. It is also possible that they simply wanted to run a positive campaign and didn't want to attack any candidates. That said, I do think it would have been possible to be more clear about what made Foushee a uniquely strong candidate while avoiding those pitfalls.&nbsp;</p><p>Together, I believe that these three factors could make a neutral observer question POF\u2019s stated motivations, particularly in the midst of a political environment in the US where secretive political spending in support of business interests is common.&nbsp; (To reiterate, I don't question POF's interest in pandemic preparedness. I'm only stating that others without prior knowledge of POF or SBF reasonably might based only on what they saw in this race.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Why this matters - the risk of reputational effects</h2><p><i>NOTE: In the interest of full disclosure, I want to acknowledge my personal biases in this area. In general, I think engaging in politics without greater transparency could be marginally harmful to the political system. I believe that it could further normalize and support a campaign finance system that privileges the interests of wealthy individuals and groups. I think it may also contribute to the public perception of an unfair or \u201crigged\u201d system, a belief that can itself be corrosive to democracy. This perspective likely makes me more concerned with the actions of POF than I might otherwise be, so it may be worth keeping that in mind in regard to the following perspective.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My concern with these practices is predicated on the reputational effects that I believe they could have on the EA movement. Multiple critiques I have seen recently in the press (<a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/168047/longtermism-future-humanity-william-macaskill\"><u>link</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2022/08/20/understanding-longtermism-why-this-suddenly-influential-philosophy-is-so/\"><u>link</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2022/08/21/longtermism-philosophy-elon-musk/\"><u>link</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/09/05/longtermism-philanthropy-altruism-risks/\"><u>link</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/07/the-dangerous-ideas-of-longtermism-and-existential-risk\"><u>link</u></a>) have described EA/longtermism as predominantly funded by and/or linked to a select group of very wealthy elites. I worry that this public perception could limit opportunities to grow the movement in the future. By engaging in political activity that partially aligns with this perception without doing the utmost to be transparent and demonstrate the altruistic rationale for the activity, I worry that POF could negatively affect the reputation of the movement.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, I worry that individuals may be introduced to EA for the first time in conjunction with activity that they perceive to be negative. The political news site Politico site recently ran a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/04/democratic-megadonor-sam-bankman-fried-00049048\">profile</a> of SBF that mentioned his interest in EA. I have read Politico regularly (3-5x a week) for the past decade, and this is the first time I have seen EA mentioned. While articles on SBF\u2019s activity in North Carolina\u2019s most prominent newspaper, the News &amp; Observer, don\u2019t directly mention effective altruism, an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article260975442.html\"><u>article</u></a> quotes POF as stating that it supports candidates with a \u201clong term view on policy planning especially as it relates to pandemic preparedness and prevention.\u201d Other parts of the article also hint at POF\u2019s interest in longtermist causes. I regularly read this newspaper as well, and I have never seen previous coverage of longtermist or EA-related work. It concerns me that others may first come into contact with EA through articles that associate it with big-money political groups with limited transparency, a realm of politics that some see as problematic.&nbsp;</p><p>In talking with other political professionals about the race and the support of POF, I occasionally brought up my previous knowledge of SBF and his interest in EA to address their concerns about the true rationale for the spending. These individuals had not previously heard about EA, and I don\u2019t imagine that introducing them to it through this context made them particularly like to take an interest in it. (Certainly, none showed interest during our discussions, which differs from my previous experience describing EA in different contexts.) Should these people, or others who learned about EA from the articles mentioned previously, encounter the movement again, I\u2019m concerned that they will be less likely to find it appealing or take action with EA principles in mind. I don\u2019t have evidence to determine if this is the case, but I think it should give us pause.&nbsp;</p><p>I do not write this post with the goal of stopping POF or other EA-aligned political groups or donors from engaging in this kinds of spending. I very much appreciate the value of working within an imperfect system to make positive change - otherwise, I wouldn't be working in US politics. Nonetheless, I think there may be simple changes that POF or other EA-aligned groups could make to reduce some of the reputational risks to EA posed by large scale political spending. I outline some possible changes below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Proposed changes to minimize the possibility of harm</h2><p><i>NOTE: This is intended only to exemplify some of the changes that could be made. There may be many better ideas that would achieve the same ends.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><i>Publish criteria for evaluating candidates</i></h3><p>This could include issue positions, personal qualities, past experience, vote history, or previous actions. Many advocacy groups in the US, such as the National Rifle Association and the League of Conservation Voters, have trackers that evaluate and provide specific grades to legislators based on their previous actions or statements. Had POF established clearer public-facing criteria, they could have highlighted those specifics when contacted by news organizations, or highlighted them in their advertisements or mailers.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><i>Provide a clear rationale for each candidate</i></h3><p>This could be based on a system like the trackers mentioned above, or it could be written individually for each candidate. Either way, this would help provide a clearer explanation of why a group is supporting one candidate over another, particularly in a primary that includes a number of candidates with many similar policy positions.&nbsp;</p><h3><br><i>Provide additional transparency on funding sources</i></h3><p>I suspect that the limited information about POF\u2019s funding sources and motivations contributed to perceptions that it was intervening on behalf of crypto interests. I don\u2019t doubt that some people would have believed this whether or not POF was more transparent about the source of its funds (and potentially even more so in that scenario). It\u2019s also possible that this would have had minimal impact on those beliefs. Nonetheless, I think this practice could be an important part of demonstrating a group\u2019s commitment to transparency and helping to promote trust in the group's stated intentions, which could be important in preventing reputational harm to EA.</p><p>Notably, these proposed changes may set EA-aligned groups apart from other groups in a way that is disadvantageous politically. They could also impact the effectiveness of the activity by watering down a more politically powerful message. Personally, I think that this might be a worthwhile price to pay to avoid possible reputational harms to the broader EA movement, but that trade-off is worth considering in more depth.</p><p>---</p><p>I hope that this post will provide a useful perspective for those involved in large scale EA-aligned political spending. I\u2019d be happy to answer any questions I can or provide any clarification, and I would welcome any feedback that could improve this post or help me contribute more effectively in the future.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "NC_EA"}}, {"_id": "WD7bFkWrR3Bu9dMnN", "title": "We\u2019re hiring!

Nonprofit research organization&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.faunalytics.org\"><u>Faunalytics</u></a> has released a pivotal new study about animal welfare from the perspective of Chinese consumers, which includes results and recommendations for animal advocates, alternative protein companies, and researchers.</p><p>Read the full study here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/chinese-consumer-attitudes/\"><u>https://faunalytics.org/chinese-consumer-attitudes/</u></a></p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>Despite being comparatively neglected until recently, the suffering of animals in Asia is starting to command more attention from global animal advocacy activists. In particular, as the largest country in the world by both human and farmed animal population, and among the largest when measured by economy and land mass, China plays a central role here. However, the key question of how best to improve outcomes for farmed animals in China remains difficult to answer, due to the recency of the movement and a comparative lack of research on the topic.&nbsp;</p><p>Although China\u2019s per capita meat consumption is lower than most wealthier, Western countries (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions\"><u>Ritchie &amp; Roser, 2017</u></a>), the country\u2019s size and the rapid growth of its meat industry means that it houses and slaughters more farmed animals than any other country in the world (<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/global-animal-slaughter-statistics-charts-2022-update/\"><u>Faunalytics, 2022</u></a>). Despite this, animal welfare remains a relatively fringe issue in China. Because of the scale of China\u2019s agriculture industry, even small changes have the potential for an outsized effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For these reasons, research on animal protection in China is crucial. While previous reports (including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/growing-a-community-farmed-animal-protection-in-china/\"><u>Phase 1 of this study</u></a>) have focused more on China\u2019s animal protection community, this report seeks to shed light on Chinese consumers, and in particular, explore advocate assumptions that we identified in Phase 1.&nbsp;</p><p>After seeking input from members of the farmed animal protection community in China, we conducted focus groups regarding the attitudes of Chinese consumers towards meat consumption, the concept of farmed animal welfare, and identified different types of messaging and strategies for encouraging movement growth.</p><p><strong>Research Team</strong></p><p>This research was led by Jah Ying Chung (Good Growth), supervised by Dr. Jo Anderson (Faunalytics). Jack Stennett (Good Growth) contributed to analysis and writing. The focus groups were led by moderators from Daxue Consulting with support from lead researcher Jah Ying Chung.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Understanding Chinese consumers\u2019 attitudes towards animal welfare, meat consumption, and various related concepts is essential for the sustainable growth of the animal welfare movement and the alternative protein industry in China. This report highlights the perspectives of various demographic groups towards these issues and their responses to certain messaging.</p><p>Some of the findings in this report diverged from those in the Phase 1 report, which suggests that the assumptions held by advocates working in China are not fully reflected in the actual attitudes and behaviors of Chinese consumers. Most notably, animal welfare was not generally perceived as a foreign concept, foreign influence was not reported as a major factor influencing dietary behaviors, and opposition to foreign influence was only stressed following a message that highlighted foreign actors. Another important discrepancy is that many participants expressed a greater sense of personal responsibility towards animal protection than expected.&nbsp;</p><p>Although there was not a strong understanding of animal welfare concepts prior to the discussion, most individuals quickly developed an accurate understanding of the concepts, and mostly expressed some interest in the concept. Importantly, there was a willingness to purchase higher-welfare products, even if health and food safety were more significant drivers of this willingness than the welfare of the animals. Finally, many participants reported that they had changed their mind regarding animal welfare issues during the group discussions, and may change their purchasing behavior in the future, indicating that messaging interventions and discussion groups could be worth exploring as interventions for belief and behavior change in China.</p><p>The report also captured some strategies that may be effective in animal welfare messaging. Focusing on the health, food safety, taste, and quality benefits of higher welfare, plant-based diets, or alternative protein products could be effective strategies to promote changes in consumption behaviors. Highlighting specific aspects of health, such as supporting child growth or helping with certain medical conditions, may be particularly effective for targeting certain consumer groups.&nbsp;</p><p>Localizing the relevant concepts is likely to be an important strategy to improve support for animal welfare in China. However, prior to this, animal welfare concepts were interpreted in a localized way by participants, connecting to participants\u2019 awareness of the situation in China, memories of better treatment of animals in the past, positive relationships between humans and animals, and culturally significant concepts such as harmony and reciprocity. Focusing on these aspects of the animal-human relationship may be important in building support for the animal welfare movement and increasing concern for farmed animals.</p><p><a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/chinese-consumer-attitudes/\"><strong><u>Read the full study here</u></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>", "user": {"username": "JLRiedi"}}, {"_id": "ZJpPvxXdimPgxFp2j", "title": "Announcing the Founders Pledge Global Catastrophic Risks Fund", "postedAt": "2022-10-26T13:39:07.698Z", "htmlBody": "<p>At Founders Pledge, we just launched a new addition to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/funds\"><u>funds</u></a>: the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/funds/global-catastrophic-risks\"><u>Global Catastrophic Risks Fund</u></a>.

The focus on international security is a current specialty, and we expect the areas of expertise of the fund to expand as we build capacity.</p><h2><strong>Current and Future Generations</strong></h2><p>This Fund is designed both to tackle threats to humanity\u2019s long-term future and to take action now to protect every human being alive today. We believe both that some interventions on global catastrophic risks can be justified on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/carl-shulman-common-sense-case-existential-risks/\">simple cost-benefit analysis</a> alone, and also that safeguarding the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/05/opinion/the-case-for-longtermism.html\">long-term future of humanity</a> is among the most important things we can work on (and that in practice, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KDjEogAqWNTdddF9g/long-termism-vs-existential-risk\">they often converge</a>). Whether or not you share our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/the-case-for-longtermism-and-safeguarding-the-future\">commitment to longtermism</a> or believe that reducing existential risks is particularly important, you may still be interested in the Fund for the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KDjEogAqWNTdddF9g/long-termism-vs-existential-risk\">simple reason</a> that you want to help prevent the deaths and suffering of millions of people.</p><p>To illustrate this, the Fund may support the development of confidence-building measures on AI \u2014 like an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hZfuxAp4yhsjmYXBNHtHZxeYabVK1kwalTl711cyW0A/edit#heading=h.xmeze0twgtme\">International Autonomous Incidents Agreement</a> \u2014 with the aim of both mitigating the destabilizing impact of near-term military AI applications, as well as providing a focal point for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/isTXkKprgHh5j8WQr/strategic-perspectives-on-long-term-ai-governance\"><u>long-termist AI governance</u></a>. Some grants will focus mainly on near-termist risks; others mainly on longtermist concerns.</p><p>Like our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/funds\">other Funds</a>, this will be a philanthropic co-funding vehicle designed to enable us to pursue a number of grantmaking opportunities, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Active grantmaking</strong>, working with organizations to shape their plans for the future;</li><li><strong>Seeding new organizations and projects</strong> with high expected value;</li><li><strong>Committing to multi-year funding</strong> to give stability to promising projects and decrease their fundraising costs;</li><li><strong>Filling small funding gaps</strong> that fall between the cracks of traditional philanthropy;</li><li><strong>Pooling donations</strong> to support projects beyond the reach of individual donors;</li><li><strong>Partnering and collaborating with other funders</strong> and organizations;</li><li><strong>Making expert-advised grants</strong> by working with domain experts and current and former policymakers; and</li><li><strong>Responding to dynamic opportunities</strong>, like short-lived policy windows.</li></ul><p>One particular use case we want to highlight is an improved ability to partner and collaborate with other funders. There are several scenarios when individual donors are unable to support a project, including when funding requirements are very large, when grant recipients would prefer multiple donors, and when a diverse group of supporters sends an important signal about an organization to the public.</p><p>We see the GCR Fund as a complement to existing efforts and envision collaborating across the funding landscape. For example, we are in touch with our partners at various longtermist grantmaking organizations and envision potentially co-funding certain projects with them. Moreover, the GCR Fund is complementary to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/funds/patient-philanthropy-fund\">Patient Philanthropy Fund</a>, a Founders Pledge-incubated project to invest and grow philanthropic resources until they are needed most \u2014 donors to both funds can allocate their giving according to their beliefs and predictions about the optimal timing of philanthropy.

I wrote it because I feel that s-risk prevention is a somewhat neglected priority area in the community, and because a single, comprehensive introduction to s-risks did not yet exist. My hope is that a coherent introduction will help to strengthen interest in the topic and spark further work.</p><p>Here\u2019s a short description of the book:</p><blockquote><p>From&nbsp;<i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i> to&nbsp;<i>Black Mirror</i>, we are all familiar with the tropes of dystopian science fiction. But what if worst-case scenarios could actually become reality? And what if we could do something now to put the world on a better path?</p><p>In&nbsp;<i>Avoiding the Worst</i>, Tobias Baumann lays out the concept of risks of future suffering (<strong>s-risks</strong>). With a focus on s-risks that are both realistic and avoidable, he argues that we have strong reasons to consider their reduction a top priority. Finally, he turns to the question of what we can do to help steer the world away from s-risks and towards a brighter future.</p></blockquote><p>For a rough overview, here\u2019s the book's table of contents:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Part I: What are s-risks?</strong></p><p>Chapter 1: Technology and astronomical stakes</p><p>Chapter 2: Types of s-risks</p><p><strong>Part II: Should we focus on s-risks?</strong></p><p>Chapter 3: Should we focus on the long-term future?</p><p>Chapter 4: Should we focus on reducing suffering?</p><p>Chapter 5: Should we focus on worst-case outcomes?</p><p>Chapter 6: Cognitive biases</p><p><strong>Part III: How can we best reduce s-risks?</strong></p><p>Chapter 7: Risk factors for s-risks</p><p>Chapter 8: Moral advocacy</p><p>Chapter 9: Better Politics</p><p>Chapter 10: Emerging technologies</p><p>Chapter 11: Long-term impact</p></blockquote><p>And finally, some blurbs for the book:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cOne of the most important, original, and disturbing books I have read.

This submission explores a simple counterfactual: how much value GiveWell could create by reallocating a small fraction of their giving from less-effective top charities to more-effective top charities. Specifically, I consider the following <em>extremely conservative</em> scenario:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I consider only charities that received funding from GiveWell in a given calendar year.</li>\n<li>I rank these charities by their estimated cost-effectiveness within that year.</li>\n<li>I take <em>10%</em> of the funding GiveWell provided to the least-effective charity, and reallocate that money to the most-effective charity that GiveWell funded that year.</li>\n<li>I consider the net units of value created by this reallocation (units from the more effective charity, minus units lost from the less effective charity), using GiveWell's units where 1 unit is equivalent to a dollar to GiveDirectly.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Depending on the year, this reallocation would be equivalent to donating $3-$20 million to GiveDirectly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://karthiktadepalli.com/givewell-reallocation/ce_reallocation.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<p>I recommend ignoring the 2020 value for reasons described later. If you prefer to think of this effect in terms of the total value created by GiveWell, this would increase the value created by GiveWell by 1-5%. In other words, if you consider the total welfare of GiveWell's allocation to be its total allocation, weighted by the cost-effectiveness of each charity allocation, then this reallocation increases the total welfare from GiveWell allocations by 1-5%.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://karthiktadepalli.com/givewell-reallocation/ce_reallocation_frac.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<p>These graphs contains the sum and substance of my argument. Under extremely conservative assumptions about what reallocations are feasible, GiveWell can do good equivalent to millions of dollars in cash transfers, without spending a single penny. The rest of this post is going to defend these assumptions.</p>\n<h2>Are cost-effectiveness estimates reliable enough to make decisions on, beyond a cutoff?</h2>\n<p>A reasonable objection might be that our cost-effectiveness estimates are probably unreliable beyond orders of magnitude differences, so prioritizing based on smaller differences may not be optimal. Indeed, GiveWell <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models\">makes this point</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We view cost-effectiveness analyses as valuable for helping us identify large differences in the cost-effectiveness of organizations we're considering for a recommendation and to encourage staff to think through relevant issues related to charities' work. However, although we spend significant staff time on our cost-effectiveness analyses, we consider our cost-effectiveness numbers to be extremely rough. We do not make charity recommendations solely on the basis of cost-effectiveness calculations and will rely heavily on other factors, such as an organization's track record, when we are comparing organizations with cost-effectiveness estimates that are not very different.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nonetheless, I think the cost-effectiveness increases implied by this reallocation more than meets GiveWell's bar for a decision-relevant increase. From the <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/change-our-mind-contest\">contest announcement</a>: (emphasis my own)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A competitive entry will propose a concrete change to our cost-effectiveness analysis with <strong>meaningful implications</strong> for how we should change the way we allocate funding. Roughly, a critique should imply <strong>at least a 10% change</strong> to our bottom-line cost-effectiveness estimate for a given program.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We don't care about a program's cost-effectiveness estimate for the sake of that program; we care about a program's cost-effectiveness because we want to guide our marginal dollar. And if GiveWell feels comfortable changing their allocation decisions based on a 10% change in bottom-line cost-effectiveness, how about a 150-250% increase in the cost-effectiveness of their marginal dollar?</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">yr</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">least_ce</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">min_ce</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">most_ce</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">max_ce</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">ce_increase</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2017</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">AMF</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">4.236179</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Deworm the World</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">10.524693</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">248%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2018</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">AMF</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">5.927971</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">SCI Foundation</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">9.373362</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">158%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2019</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Helen Keller International</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">12.622352</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">AMF</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">17.203267</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">136%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2020</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Malaria Consortium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">14.116310</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Helen Keller International</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">21.422753</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">152%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2021</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Malaria Consortium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">8.993284</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Helen Keller International</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">23.641911</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">263%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2022</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Malaria Consortium</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">10.211880</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Sightsavers</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">20.811753</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">204%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Moreover, I think that underlying GiveWell's caution about using cost-effectiveness is a <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/\">cluster thinking</a> worldview. GiveWell does not want to let speculative cost-effectiveness estimates override practical knowledge about organizations and what good they can do. I am very sympathetic to this worldview, and I would say I subscribe to it myself. But my comparison is not across the universe of charities, with all the speculation that entails. My comparison is across <em>charities that GiveWell funded within a given year.</em> In other words, GiveWell has already shown that they believe in the track record of these organizations and are confident in recommending them. Cluster thinking is invaluable on the <em>extensive</em> margin: whether to recommend a charity or not. It is much less helpful on the <em>intensive</em> margin, or how much to fund them, especially when I am proposing such a modest change in the funding levels.</p>\n<p>In short, these cost-effectiveness changes are substantial, and even if you worry about taking cost-effectiveness numbers literally, this is applying them in a very modest way that even a cluster-thinker should be fine with.</p>\n<p>That being said, the objection to this exercise that I find most compelling is based on the unreliability of cost-effectiveness estimates. In particular, the table above shows that the best charity in one year can become the worst charity in another year, and vice versa. This is an issue, and I can't fully address it in this analysis since our cost-effectiveness estimates are just that: estimates. There is no ground truth that we can reference. This is why I've tried to be as conservative as possible so that the benefits of this reallocation are believable enough to offset the uncertainty of shifting cost-effectiveness. At the end of the day, we can only make decisions with the cost-effectiveness numbers we have, so I still think this is a defensible practice.</p>\n<h2>Can charities absorb this money?</h2>\n<p>An obviously important constraint is that GiveWell can't give charities more money than they can absorb. This is why I excluded charities that did not receive any money in a year, since that could indicate they were unable to absorb funding for that year. Nonetheless, you might worry about the intensive margin as well: maybe this reallocation can't be absorbed by charities, even if they received money for that year. Below, I calculated how much this counterfactual increase would be as a percentage of that charity's real allocation from GiveWell.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">year</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">given_to</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">initial_budget</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">reallocation</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">pct_increase</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2017</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Deworm the World</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">$3.5M</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">$0.46M</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">13%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2018</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">SCI Foundation</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">$7.8M</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">$0.49M</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">6%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2019</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">AMF</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">$7M</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">$0.26M</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2020</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Helen Keller International</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">$1.5M</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">$2.37M</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">158%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2021</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Helen Keller International</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">$11M</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">$0.23M</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">2%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2022</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">Sightsavers</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">$7.8M</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">$2.22M</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">28%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>For all years except 2020 and 2022, the proposed reallocation is a trivial fraction of the money that GiveWell provided that charity anyway. For 2020, the proposed reallocation is outrageous, which is why I recommend ignoring the welfare gains from 2020 in the initial graph. For 2021 and 2022, I can compare these estimates to the charity's stated room for more funding, as reported in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16XOOB1oWse1ICbF0OVXUYtwWwpvG3mxAAQ6LYAAndQU/edit#gid=1377543212\">GiveWell's CEA of 2020</a>. In 2021, Helen Keller International would have received an extra $230,000, compared to their projected room for more funding of $2.7 million, meaning they could have absorbed all that money. In 2022, Sightsavers would have received $2.2 million, but they would have only had a need for $1.6 million, so around 70% of that money could have been absorbed.</p>\n<p>In short, charities could almost certainly absorb the money from this proposed reallocation.</p>\n<h2>Is reallocation bad for reliability?</h2>\n<p>There are tremendous benefits to charities having reliable funding. Funders should aim to minimize volatility in their funding, because volatility prevents charities from planning and reduces the amount of good they can do. Since cost-effectiveness estimates can change year-to-year, and my analysis uses estimates from the given year (since this is the decision-relevant estimate that GiveWell has access to), doesn't this kind of reallocation create unacceptable volatility in funding for charities?</p>\n<p>This is a valid objection to counterfactuals such as \"eliminate one less-effective charity from the Top Charities Fund\". But this exercise is not about extreme reallocations; it's about a 10% reallocation. I can't say that I have as much experience working with charities as the folks at GiveWell, but I find it hard to believe that would inhibit a charity's planning capacity. This is especially true because GiveWell doesn't even <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/top-charities-fund\">fund its top charities every year.</a></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Cost-effectiveness prioritization is hard, but I started this post with Toby Ord's quote to emphasize that the stakes are very high. This is true even when you're on the tails of the cost-effectiveness distribution - when you're far beyond the easy case of a median charity or a 90th percentile charity, when you're choosing between 99.9th percentile charities and 99.99th percentile charities. The combination of GiveWell's large allocations and the substantial spread in cost-effectiveness between their funded charities means that the gains from reallocation are enormous. I think all of us would regard $3 million spent by GiveDirectly as a tremendous amount of good, and we should take these gains when they come quite literally for free, and are a very conservative lower bound on the gains we could get from reallocation.</p>\n<p>As a final note, I've picked 10% as a sensible, conservative fraction, so that even the most skeptical cluster thinker can see the value of this reallocation. I'm sure that someone at GiveWell with more knowledge can pick a more appropriate funding reallocation, so I've calculated the returns to many different reallocations:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://karthiktadepalli.com/givewell-reallocation/reallocation_fraction.png\" alt=\"image\"></p>\n<p>In short, GiveWell should take its cost-effectiveness analyses a little more seriously than they currently do---doing so could create millions in value at no extra cost.</p>\n<p><em>All details of this analysis, including how I compiled cost-effectiveness estimates and the Top Charities Fund allocations, are available in <a href=\"https://github.com/karthiktadepalli1/givewell-reallocation\">this GitHub repo.</a></em></p>\n", "user": {"username": "therealslimkt"}}, {"_id": "JvEHiKWWwtvT3YanA", "title": "GiveWell Misuses Discount Rates", "postedAt": "2022-10-27T06:57:14.362Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>GiveWell currently uses a time discount rate of 4% for all their cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs).</li>\n<li>I argue that it is a mathematical mistake to pick any single best guess value to use for the CEAs.\n<ul>\n<li>Instead, GiveWell should use a probability distribution over possible discount rates.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>This is not just an aesthetic judgement for mathematical puritans; it materially changes the CEAs, notably by making all the deworming interventions more attractive relative to other interventions.\n<ul>\n<li>This is because deworming interventions rely on multi-decadal effects, and so a lower discount rate would make them much more valuable.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Epistemic Status</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>On the object level, I cannot think of any reasons to justify GiveWell's current modelling choice over my proposal.</li>\n<li>However, I still doubt my conclusion because on the meta level it seems like an obvious thing that would be surprising if no one at GiveWell had ever thought of doing, which is evidence I am missing something important.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Main</strong></p>\n<p>GiveWell\u2019s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tytvmV_32H8XGGRJlUzRDTKTHrdevPIYmb_uc6aLeas/edit#gid=1362437801\">CEAs</a> are an impressive attempt to model many different factors in assessing the near-term impacts of various interventions.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-2P5Htvi3XdEj7mvYx-1\" id=\"fnref-2P5Htvi3XdEj7mvYx-1\">[1]</a></sup>  I will ignore all of this complexity.

Thus, while GiveWell\u2019s method is mathematically unsound, it gives the correct answer in this case.  It could well be that GiveWell has considered this, and decided not to explain this in their CEAs because it doesn\u2019t change the answer.  I think this would be a mistake in communication, but otherwise benign.</p>\n<p>The one place where I believe this mathematical mistake translates into an incorrect answer is in the use of discount rates. From GiveWell\u2019s explanatory <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g2tf7Fu8-iG_8TgnJkEx9G5TlEyrcv7PXPokmPZaUMc/edit\">document</a>:</p>\n<p>\u201cThe discount rate's primary effect in the cost-effectiveness analyses of our top charities is to represent how much we discount increases in consumption resulting from the long run effects of improved child health for our malaria, deworming and vitamin A charities (which we call \"developmental effects\"). It also affects the longer-run benefits from cash transfers. We don't discount mortality benefits in our cost-effectiveness analyses.\u201d</p>\n<p>This figure shows the cost-effectiveness of all the charities in the CEA spreadsheet, when varying the discount rate.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-2P5Htvi3XdEj7mvYx-4\" id=\"fnref-2P5Htvi3XdEj7mvYx-4\">[4]</a></sup></p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995151/mirroredImages/JvEHiKWWwtvT3YanA/wpytfe9bcehvi9biioit.png\" alt=\"cost-effectiveness vs discount rate\"></p>\n<p>Deworming interventions, shown in dashed lines, vary considerably in the discount rate because their path to impact relies on multi-decadal earnings increases for the recipients.  The other interventions are less sensitive to the discount rate because more of their impact comes via direct mortality reduction, which is not subject to a discount rate in GiveWell\u2019s analysis.  However, all CEAs include an analysis of long-term income changes, so display some sensitivity to the discount rate.</p>\n<p>The GiveWell approach of making their best point estimate of a random variable and using it for subsequent calculations breaks down here because the cost-effectiveness is not linearly proportional to the discount rate.

This post lists some observations and lessons I took away from them about how I would want to run a retreat.</p><p>I\u2019ve probably written some suggestions with more confidence than is warranted - I have strong opinions that are weakly held. For brevity, I've not always delved into my reasoning for every specific point, but I'm happy to expand in the comments! I\u2019ve shared early versions of this advice with a couple of people running retreats, and it seemed to be helpful. &nbsp;</p><p>Not all of this advice will apply to any one retreat, I think the best way to read this is to take what makes sense given your goals and use those. I think most of these suggestions are useful for community retreats; and maybe ~30-60% are useful for professional retreats. I'd be really excited for more people to share their reflections on what's worked and what hasn't.&nbsp;</p><h1>Nail the 'vibes'</h1><p>Your goal is (probably) to help people make friends. For this reason, the vibes matter. Take time to observe how the attendees are interacting, and regularly ask the most perceptive or senior attendees how it\u2019s going. It\u2019s important to preserve participants\u2019 intention, energy, and eagerness to participate proactively.</p><h2>Go light with the schedule &amp; be flexible with content</h2><p>Creating a schedule is always difficult, but when in doubt I advocate for cutting things (ruthlessly). I think that attendees will ultimately care more about the overall flow and atmosphere than that extra session.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Have a shorter \u2018work\u2019 day of (high quality) scheduled events</strong> to leave enough time for chilling and socializing (e.g., 10am-5pm). This will give participants time to make friends and prevent them getting too tired.&nbsp; That being said - make sure the content you do have is excellent.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Be willing and able to pivot </strong>- don\u2019t be scared to throw out the schedule and do something else if you feel participants aren't resonating with the content you have, or someone makes a suggestion that seems good.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Factor in downtime </strong>for attendees to recover from travel.</li></ul><h2>Make people feel comfortable and relaxed&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><strong>Try to avoid people coming late</strong>: It can feel bad to miss the first day. If people must come late,&nbsp;batch latecomers and have someone give them an orientation&nbsp;and introduce them to other participants. Consider introducing latecomers to someone beforehand, so they know at least one non-organizer when they arrive.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Check in with folks: </strong>Organizers can&nbsp;identify and periodically check on (e.g.) the 30% of participants who are most likely to feel out of place: for example, newer EAs or people who are less well-connected.</li><li><strong>Look out for each other: </strong>The German funconference had&nbsp;\u2018<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11XILo8NAwRdfuvfBwOS2rL5BHh2mJEnjc4eobVZo14s/edit#heading=h.7ucxaf5zvszr\"><u>awareness facilitators</u></a>\u2019 who would support you in case of physical &amp; mental health problems or if you felt like someone crossed your boundaries, and who would keep information confidential. I thought this was a really good thing to have.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Help people get to know each other before the retreat: </strong>You can share a \u2018names and faces\u2019 deck of all the attendees for people to read, and also print them and put them out in the common areas.</li><li><strong>Consider activities which allow people to seek help and be vulnerable, if it makes sense: </strong>I have found <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/xAqRkrnjJTMZ6YmZA/appendix-how-to-run-a-successful-hamming-circle\">Hamming Circles</a> during retreats to be quite helpful and a positive experience (and others who've participated say the same). However, they can be very intense and it's likely that I had a positive experience because I only opted into them when I already trusted the people around me, felt open to the experience, and when the activity was being run by someone who was experienced in running these kinds of activities.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Think about ways to facilitate group bonding</h2><p>Big group bonding activities can be really magical and powerful, but it\u2019s hard to create them successfully.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The first and last events are good opportunities for group bonding,</strong> because people are most likely to attend them. In the final activity at the India community retreat, everyone had paper taped to their back and wrote notes on each others\u2019 paper. Almost every participant wrote something for each other, and it was a really fun, physical activity - at one point half the people in the room were in a long chain writing on each others' backs. You didn't have to write something for everyone, but everyone wanted to share the positive energy with each other.</p><p><strong>Physical sports &amp; games are great</strong>. They\u2019re fun, shake up the routine and can push people a little outside their comfort zone. Ideally,&nbsp;book a venue with a big outdoors area and bring basic sporting equipment like table tennis rackets, balls, frisbees etc. You could also play some more unusual games like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugger\">Jugger</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quidditch_(real-life_sport)\">Quidditch</a> or capture the flag. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Encourage ownership through participation: </strong>Consider having&nbsp;\"unconference\" elements to your retreat, where participants can propose their own events. I think it's a great way to help the retreat feel more meaningful and encourage different kinds of connections between participants. You can have a big chart in a common area where people can propose events and (before the event) an editable / commentable schedule page.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Have one event that everyone participates in.</strong> For example, the EA funconference had an open mic night around a campfire which included an epic beatboxing/rapping duo performing \u2018500 million, but not a single one more\u2019. At the community builders in Asia retreat, we had a really fun karaoke night featuring songs from over 10 countries. These kinds of events felt really important for bonding. The atmosphere felt very wholesome - they weren\u2019t \u201cparties\u201d, and there wasn\u2019t much alcohol consumption.</p><h2>Encourage intentionality&nbsp;</h2><ul><li><strong>If you're a main organiser, be present:</strong> Find someone to handle as much of the operations work for you, so you can be present with the participants and help make their experience great. You will have a big impact on setting the tone of the event and making connections with participants.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Communicate your goals: </strong>Communicate with participants a lot beforehand about the retreat\u2019s goals. Older community members can and should shape the experience of newbies. They should talk to newer people and figure out what makes them excited to attend. Share the agenda in advance and get people to do pre-event reflections or give suggestions on goals.</li><li><strong>Morning huddles: </strong>Huddles are pre-assigned groups of participants. I\u2019m confused by them - they seem like a really good idea, but in practice, I\u2019ve seen them have mixed success. They are probably most feasible on Day 1 (and maybe 2). It's easier to get huddles to meet at a fixed start time - e.g. the first activity at the beginning of the retreat. Morning huddles can be tough if folks wake up at different times or are scheduling 1-1s, and as the day progresses people get more scattered.&nbsp;<ul><li>It seems generally good for huddle leaders to be more experienced, friendly and welcoming folks, who are willing to go out of their way to foster a good environment, but otherwise I like randomizing huddles to help people meet new folks.</li><li>It could be cool to experiment with creating huddle group chats a few days in advance of the conference and having huddles meet virtually before the retreat starts to reflect on their goals.</li><li>For community retreats, participants could share personal goals rather than impact-related goals (people will likely share those goals with each other anyway). At the fUnconference, people shared goals like \u2018I want to get out of my comfort zone\u2019 or \u2018I want to make friends\u2019. Their huddle participants then tried to help them achieve those goals, which was really nice.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><h1>Get the venue right, but don't worry about being fancy</h1><p>The venue is one of the most important practical aspects that influences the vibe - by influencing participants' initial impressions and shapes what kind of interactions participants can easily have. Some thoughts:</p><ul><li><strong>Prioritize accessibility and logistics support in a venue. </strong>The ideal venue for most retreats is &lt;1 hour drive from a big city, accessible by public transport and one where venue staff can handle a lot of the basic logistics set-up.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Consider a venue that can accomodate 1-1s and different kinds of social spaces: </strong>It's nice to have a central common area for coordination, but also enough (indoor &amp; outdoor) nooks for 1-1s. If you want to have a party night, I'd try to find a venue where you could also have a separated quieter area for those who prefer it.</li><li><strong>Try to have a space available 24/7: </strong>Have a (ideally large, comfy &amp; relaxed) room available 24/7 - it's a shame to have to cut a night short because there's no where to go, and it's also sad to be in your hotel room early in the morning if the venue hasn't opened yet.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>It's okay for participants to have some communal chores or share rooms:</strong>&nbsp; the funconference had communal chores, and I think this added to the overall atmosphere - it was really nice to see everyone chipping in and helping out. It's also fine to share rooms or bathrooms (unless someone has accessibility-related needs) - but for more professional retreats, I'd ensure roommates have similar sleeping schedules.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Some small things that can make a big difference:&nbsp;</strong>Basic toiletries, charging wires for all phones, lots of blankets, spicy condiments (e.g. hot sauce and chili powder), fruits and other healthy snacks at your snack table like protein bars, nuts, veggie sticks &amp; dips, and some unhealthy snacks.</li><li><strong>Communications: </strong>Keep daily announcements &lt;5 mins, make a schedule on Notion, a&nbsp;Slack channel&nbsp;in your local workspace and two&nbsp;group chats - one for announcements and one for informal chatting. Schedule message announcements for all events, because people sometimes forget.</li></ul><hr><p><i>Thanks to all the lovely organisers who ran some fantastic retreats this year!&nbsp;</i><br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnhpwill6seut\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefhpwill6seut\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I think we&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ETECpBwiqhbZuJpmG/should-we-call-them-something-other-than-retreats\"><u>should call them something other than retreats</u></a> if they are more professional / work-related</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "vaidehi_agarwalla"}}, {"_id": "qx6vWLwpn7joKwwAZ", "title": "Why some people believe in AGI, but I don't.", "postedAt": "2022-10-26T03:09:17.273Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I have learned a lot since my posts on the EA and LessWrong forums in response to the call from the <strong>Future Fund Worldview Prize. </strong>I<strong> </strong>received many insightful comments from people who just didn't want to give up on the idea of AGI. I decided to briefly summarise the main arguments from the comments as well as some related posts, because I feel this has really clarified the essential points.</p><p>The announcement is quite specific that they want to call into question \"Future Fund's fundamental assumptions about the future of AI\", which is that \"artificial intelligence (AI) is the development most likely to dramatically alter the trajectory of humanity this century\". These are bold beliefs considering the possibility that \"all of this AI stuff is a misguided sideshow\". It was my intention to show that in fact it IS a misguided sideshow, which calls into question the size of the impact AI will have on society. But this lead many people to misinterpret my views on whether or not AI might pose dangers for us in the future. My feeling on this is exactly what is stated in the call: \"AI is already posing serious challenges: transparency, interpretability, algorithmic bias ....\". I agree. The real question I was concerned with is whether or not a more profound version of AI is coming soon, which could be called AGI or even more dramatically, Superintelligence (<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/superintelligence\">Nick Bostrom</a>). This is where I think the claims and predictions are unrealistic.</p><p>There are many arguments people advance in support of their belief that there will be such a change. As far as I can tell, most of these boil down to a kind of extrapolation, a view that is eloquently captured by another <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kRNLsBLoCryMMipoJ/why-i-think-strong-general-ai-is-coming-soon-1\">post</a> in this stream: \"We've already captured way too much of intelligence with way too little effort. Everything points towards us capturing <i>way more</i> of intelligence with very little additional effort.\" The problem with this argument is that it is very similar to arguments made in the late 1950s in a previous wave of AI optimism. For example Licklider (1960) points out that \"Even now, Gelernter's IBM-704 program for proving theorems in plane geometry proceeds at about the same pace as Brooklyn high school students ..... there are, in fact, several theorem-proving, problem-solving, chess-playing, and pattern-recognizing programs ... capable of rivaling human intellectual performance in restricted areas..\" and the U.S. Airforce \"estimated that it would be 1980 before developments in artificial intelligence make it possible for machines alone to do much thinking or problem solving of military significance.\" We all know where those estimates ended up. One possibly saving grace lies in Nick Bostrom's argument that the computational power in those days was not sufficient so we should not have expected the algorithms to really achieve these goals, and more powerful hardware might reverse the failure. Nevertheless, Nick also concedes that advances in an alternative \"bottom-up\" form of learning and cognition are probably also required.</p><p>This is the second prong in the argument for AGI, that in fact we are now firmly entrenched in a &nbsp;\"bottom-up\" paradigm that will overcome the limitations of past approaches. The argument is that Deep Learning (DL) has not only given us models that can perform impressive tasks in the areas of visual perception and language, but has given us a new scientific paradigm which better approximates properties of thinking and learning which humans have. In fact the need for a paradigm shift is now acknowledged by both critics and advocates of AI. In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryMarcus/status/1573852514189180928\">this exchange</a> Gary Marcus and Yann LeCun both paraphrase the old parable: \u201cOkay, we built this ladder, but we want to go to the moon, and there's no way this ladder is going to get us there\u201d (LeCun). What we need is a rocket ship, and B<a href=\"https://www.noemamag.com/what-ai-can-tell-us-about-intelligence/\">rowning and LeCun</a> argue that this rocket ship must jettison the old ideas like Newell and Simon's \"Physical Symbol System Hypothesis\", which states that \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action.\". This, then is the often unstated reason for the optimism that this time the <strong>current successes will continue continue all the way to AGI</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>My <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZXTqMektxs2LNyMim/my-argument-against-agi\">argument</a> defeats the Browning and LeCun position that DL and gradient descent learning supply an alternative that can dispense with the Physical Symbol System Hypothesis. <strong>This undermines the main reason to believe that DL approaches will deliver on their promises any more than the systems of the 50s did.</strong> Many people misunderstood the argument and thought I was proving that AGI was impossible. But this is not true. <strong>The argument undermines the claim that DL systems that are currently the object of research are sufficient to achieve AGI</strong>. It leaves open the possibility that in 500 years we might finally get there using some new advances that we cannot yet imagine.</p><p>Some people thought my argument was that AI had to discover exactly the same algorithms that the human mind uses, but this is not the case. We know even from computer programming that similar functions can be implemented in many different ways, and even using different programming languages. The point is that there must be some fundamental properties of the implementation, such as the use of variables and control structures, a syntax of expressions that can be used by a compiler/interpreter, and so on. This is an analogy of course, but my claim is that some cognitive processes seem to involve symbol systems and there is no reason to believe that DL has shown this to be false, and therefore cannot eliminate the need for these systems. Another misunderstanding is that neural networks can't implement symbol systems. The fact is that they can, as the classic <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./epxing/Class/10715/reading/McCulloch.and.Pitts.pdf\">paper</a> \"A LOGICAL CALCULUS OF THE IDEAS IMMANENT IN NERVOUS ACTIVITY*\" by McCulloch and Pitts shows. The point is that such neural networks are severely limited, and there is at the moment no serious effort to implement systems with complex symbol manipulating abilities. In fact this is precisely the kind of effort that Browning and LeCun discourage.</p><p>So there it is. People who believe that AGI is imminent, do so because the prevailing winds are saying that we are finally onto something that is a closer match to human cognition than anything we have ever tried. The winds sound like a storm, but they are really just a whimper.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "cveres"}}, {"_id": "nocZECBmPJGcSS7yx", "title": "The Giving Store- 100% Profits to GiveDirectly", "postedAt": "2022-10-26T12:48:55.550Z", "htmlBody": "<p>TLDR: Here's a<a href=\"https://consumergivingstore.org/\"> link to a store selling housewares, kids/babies supplies, pet products and out door products <strong>where 100% of the profits go to GiveDirectly.</strong></a><strong> Now, shipping is 100% free on all items in the store!</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My name is Ellie Leszczynski and I am the Social Media Director for the Consumer Power Initiative (also known as CPI), founded by Brad West.

So I went on the EA website and ordered my free book - \u201cDoing Good Better\u201d by William MacAskill. I am now looking forward to reading his new book, \u201cWhat We Owe the Future,\" as well. And I really am amazed by the community that has been developed around using our time, money, grit, and creativity to maximize our positive impact for everyone, including even insects raised in alternative farming or consciousness being generated by machine learning.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a vast world with a lot of moving parts and ideas going on in it, and the <a href=\"https://consumerpowerinitiative.org/\">Consumer Power Initiative</a> is taking initiative to promote an altruistic mission that doesn't take much to share and spread. As example, I would like to introduce you to an online shop called the <a href=\"https://consumergivingstore.org/\">Consumer Giving Store</a>. The Giving Store directs all of the profit that it generates to <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a>, a highly-rated charity that does direct cash transfers to the global poor. The storefront was designed by Kagen Zethmayr, one of the members of the Consumer Power Initiative, and coded by Madhav Malhotra, an EA who was inspired by a discussion with Brad in the comments of one of his posts. You may already be familiar with it. At the Giving Store, you can buy products curated from a variety of sources at no-more-than-retail prices, whose sole purpose in being sold in this venue is to generate profits toward a worthy cause without added cost to the consumer.&nbsp;</p><p>This fits into the broader idea of the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WMiGwDoqEyswaE6hN/making-trillions-for-effective-charities-through-the\">Profit for Good</a> model (also called \u201cGuided Consumption\u201d), which the Consumer Power Initiative is trying to promote and normalize. The Giving Store not only allows people to help GiveDirectly by buying goods, it also allows them to send a signal to the broader world that consumers care and want to help in what ways they can.</p><p>We believe that the general public will choose to buy goods from Profit for Good Companies (\u201cPFGs\u201d) when they can do it without paying more or sacrificing quality. We are confident in the proposition that, however flawed and/or selfish members of the general public may be, they would rather the beneficiaries of effective charities, such as those that help the global poor, get the benefits of profit generated from their activity rather than the people who currently get said benefits: the very wealthy, especially if not even doing the work involved in this activity. The general public at large, however, cannot create this infrastructure or the initial steps for the community. This project will need EAs and others who put additional effort in trying to make the world a better place. Brad discusses the different players in the Profit for Good and their motivations <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8hoDr4prXoDwjJhuo/guided-consumption-theory-a-virtuous-dance-between\">here</a>. Vincent van der Holst reviews some of the advantages Profit for Good firms have <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mq97ho2PMBbphDJzK/why-guided-consumption-can-work\">here</a>.</p><p>I gather that EA is all about how we can use our resources and our time to have the highest positive impact in the world. And using consumer sentiment and our economies to further effective charities could really transform the world with everyday choices! We would like to thank you in advance for any purchasing you might do on the Giving Store website.<br>With the understanding that EAs are very time- and resource-constrained, we would really appreciate it if you could take a few moments to follow and share about us on our social media.

This also does not take into account the other 2/3 times where if not saving a life the donation goes on to improve someone's well-being/health. Additionally the concrete information about blood donation and how it is used is lacking and claims about each donation saving up to 3 lives are inaccurate at best and misleading at worst. Furthermore statements of \"1/3 of blood is used for emergencies\" may be because 1/3 of blood donated is universal and thus 100% of a universal blood donator's blood may be used in an emergency - greatly improving the impact for them; this seems unlikely but these points hopefully show that the 1/30 estimate is likely to be conservative rather than optimistic.</p>\n<p>This would make each donation roughly equivalent to a (1/30*5000) $166 donation to the Against Malaria Foundation for maybe an hour of time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blood.co.uk/the-donation-process/after-your-donation/how-your-body-replaces-blood/#:~:text=The%20average%20adult%20has%20around,fluids%20that%20have%20been%20lost.\">[1]</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.blood.co.uk/why-give-blood/how-blood-is-used/#:~:text=Donated%20blood%20or%20components%20are,line%20into%20a%20blood%20vessel.&amp;text=Usage%20varies%20between%20hospitals%20depending,blood%20donations%20are%20used%20appropriately.\">[2]</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.transfusionguidelines.org/transfusion-handbook/7-effective-transfusion-in-surgery-and-critical-care/7-3-transfusion-management-of-major-haemorrhage#:~:text=Major%20haemorrhage%20is%20variously%20defined,excess%20of%20150%20mL%2Fminute.\">[3]</a></p>\n", "user": {"username": "ATinyFish"}}, {"_id": "CZg7wSmLeaijwS4r7", "title": "How to reconsider a prediction", "postedAt": "2022-10-25T21:28:32.050Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>An approach to reconsidering a prediction</h1><ol><li>separate what you believe about the situation from what it might actually be.</li><li>ignore ideas of relative likelihood of consequences of the situation.&nbsp;</li><li>consider the list of consequences (events) independently from each other, as endpoints of separate pathways.</li><li>backtrack from those separate pathways to new ideas of the Actual Situation.</li></ol><p>You can use the summary graphic below to help you follow those steps.</p><h2>A graphic representing a prediction</h2><p>Here's my simple model of the result of a prediction.

The coal production provides additional power needed for more AC in those cities and China works to bring people back.

Their Event B alternatives are unlikely for most effective altruists(for example, a 1/10 chance of extinction because AGI run amuck).&nbsp;</p><p>Here are my suggestions for broadening effective altruist models of risk. It might help EA folks to:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;look skeptically at their Event A, the likely (and positive) future, and find its flaws, supposing that the actual situation were different than they believe.</li><li>&nbsp;make up some &nbsp;Event C's, alternatives to Event A and Event B, supposing that you don't know the likelihood off any Event, but want to consider all plausible ones.&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, suppose that an Event C were the most likely event and then explore what that implies about the current actual situation.</li></ul><h2>A few final words</h2><p>The cognitive aid I offered here is just to make you think a little harder, not about likelihood values but about your list of events that you consider potential consequences of the current situation. Broadening that list can help you feel greater uncertainty, and that feeling can guide you away from obvious mistakes that unwarranted confidence in the future causes.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, usually people with strong beliefs are thought to be the overconfident ones, but I think that exploring the possible without the constraint of partial credences can also offer relief from unwarranted confidence. You might worry that responding to such uncertainty without constraining its alternatives numerically (even if the probability numbers are made up) results in distress and indecision. However, real situations of broad uncertainty are precisely when denial tends to kick in and opportunities for positive change are ignored.&nbsp;</p><p>Concentrating on how to feel more positive expectations of the future is actually dangerous in situations of broad uncertainty. Concentrating on mapping out the steps to the alternatives and continuing to check whether you're still on the pathway to one or another alternative is wiser. You're looking for ways to get your pathway to quickly diverge away from negative futures and toward positive ones rather than remain ambiguous. Your uncertainty about which pathway you are on is your motive to find a quick and early divergence toward a positive future. So long as there's great uncertainty, there's great motivation.</p><p>I have offered a few ideas of how to respond with unweighted beliefs, for anyone interested.

The report aims merely to raise awareness of this topic and introduce the idea for discussion, but not yet strongly suggest it is a cost-effective intervention on par with other interventions-see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nhsdeCEZAaBQQaro8/using-artificial-intelligence-machine-vision-to-increase-the-1#3__Uncertainties\">uncertainties</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nhsdeCEZAaBQQaro8/using-artificial-intelligence-machine-vision-to-increase-the-1#4__Limitations_of_this_report\">limitations</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nhsdeCEZAaBQQaro8/using-artificial-intelligence-machine-vision-to-increase-the-1#3__Potential_for_harm\">potential for harm</a>.</p><h2>What's the problem profile?</h2><ul><li>HWC is increasing&nbsp;due to human expansions and climate change, (<a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/report/future-all-need-human-wildlife-coexistence\">Gross et al., 2021</a>) and is starting to be considered in government strategies and policy.&nbsp;The expected future impact of innovative and effective solutions to HWC could be even larger than currently appreciated.</li><li>Lethal control or other methods which significantly impact animal welfare are still widely used (such as culling), despite preventative non-lethal strategies growing in more recent wildlife management approaches.</li><li>Currently deployed AI systems directed towards HWC could be expanded further within the next 10-20 years as they become more reliable, more effective, and cheaper. We should not assume they will prioritize WAW concerns, or be widely used for animals of WAW concern, so this should be embedded before they are potentially rolled out at scale.</li><li>There are already companies working on AI solutions for specific problems involving endangered species, such as protected areas using AI assisted technology for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/paws-artificial-intelligence-fights-poaching-ranger-patrols-wildlife-conservation\">poacher detection. T</a>here is already proof-of-concept of an NGO-backed early warning AI system,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.resolve.ngo/blog/WildEyes-AI-Helping-to-Save-Wild-Elephants-and-Prevent-Human-Elephant-Conflict.htm\">\u2018WildEyes\u2019</a>, with this type of solution being&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indiaai.gov.in/article/tamil-nadu-to-use-ai-to-reduce-elephant-deaths-on-railway-tracks\">invested in</a> by&nbsp;a local governmental department in Tamil Nadu, India. Buy-in from a range of stakeholders (especially when it benefits humans and profits too) offers a way in with conservationists and researchers who may not otherwise consider WAW. Research and development (R&amp;D) on AI-assisted HWC mitigations would likely attract researchers who would not otherwise consider or be motivated by WAW concerns.</li></ul><h2>What should we be doing differently?</h2><p>A very tentative theory of change: if machine vision-based methods prevent HWC, they could be adopted, even on a small scale \u2192 helps drop prices \u2192 allowing for systems to be more widely adopted \u2192 leads to more support and R&amp;D \u2192 continued price drops and adoption \u2192 could create space for legislation to ban harmful or lethal methods of animal control \u2192&nbsp;preventing HWC could reduce apathy&nbsp;and antagonism&nbsp;towards \u201cproblem species\u201d and make it easier for people to consider the welfare of animals, while also directly reducing negative WAW effects of HWC.</p><ul><li>This report highlights two examples of HWC where advocates could influence AI-assisted mitigation to directly affect substantial numbers of animals, and spread welfare considerations in software and norms:<ul><li>Wind turbine collisions are a leading anthropogenic cause of bat deaths and cause a significant number of bird deaths (600,000 to 949,000 bats and 140,000 to 679,000 birds annually in North America). We should expect fatalities to increase due to expansions in wind power.</li><li>Culling of crop-raiding species. In one year, the USDA\u2019s Wildlife Services culled 1,028,642 European starlings responsible for agricultural crop damage, because other mitigations are ineffective. Despite this, starlings still cause extensive damage each year. More effective mitigation measures would hold value and could prevent culls.</li></ul></li><li>There are a number of research and advocacy directions to address these:</li><li>Conduct cost-effectiveness estimates on different HWC mitigations; in some cases, Randomized controlled trials (RCT) and Cost-Effectiveness Analyses (CEAs) may find mitigations other than AI-assisted ones are more effective.</li><li>Improved research and data collection of how many animals HWC affects. For example, estimating bird and bat turbine fatalities is difficult, (hence wide ranging estimates); utilizing cameras and automated detection could help us collect more accurate data.</li><li>Research on improving accurate small object detection from a distance, so that automated detection and curtailment systems at wind farms can reliably detect smaller species.</li><li>Utilizing machine vision techniques in long-wave infrared cameras placed near wind turbines could allow them to detect bats and avoid fatalities.</li><li>Researchers could apply machine learning techniques, utilizing large amounts of existing data on well-studied animal populations, or use machine vision to gather this data to predict where mitigation will be most effective. E.g., identifying high-risk areas for wildlife where turbines should not be erected.</li><li>R&amp;D into flock detection systems which could be integrated with automated deterrents to prevent wide-scale crop damage by flocks of starlings - if effective, this could be adopted in favor of wide-scale culling.</li><li>Extending protected status to a wider number of bats, and utilizing this to get leverage over wind energy companies.</li><li>Adding more bird species/a species with a large population to protected species acts and/or automated curtailment detection lists covered by already deployed AI mitigation technologies could reduce their fatalities by&nbsp;&gt;60%.</li><li>Funders and researchers can also engage in institution-building to create a robust interdisciplinary field at the intersection of AI development and wildlife management:<ul><li>Establish an interdisciplinary conference tying experts from engineering, AI, animal welfare, ecology, animal behavior, conservation, and perhaps even from the social sciences to discuss examples and opportunities for AI to increase the effectiveness of HWC mitigations, or even wildlife management methods more generally, that improve animal welfare.</li><li>Create an accessible applied methods journal for publication of this interdisciplinary work.</li></ul></li><li>See section 3 for the uncertainties and section 4 for the limitations of this report.</li></ul><h1>2. How much would interventions speed up adoption of effective AI mitigations?</h1><p>I think the development of AI-assisted technology that could help alleviate HWC will continue. Forecasts from respected researchers (<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/AfH2oPHCApdKicM4m/two-year-update-on-my-personal-ai-timelines\">Cotra 2022</a>) and community platforms like Metaculus<a href=\"#fn-WBcso52Aef7pNXAW4-1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, give good reasons to think AI systems might be readily capable of much more WAW work within 10-20 years. To give an example of the speed of adoption of HWC mitigation technology, WildEyes took just over five years to go from idea to development to deployment. However, it does benefit from addressing a well-known HWC (human-elephant conflict) and a charismatic species of public concern. Technological solutions proven to work better, or at least as well, as current mitigations are better candidates for being adopted even without added pressure from the WAW movement. Currently endangered species are both the lowest hanging fruit and the most likely to already be assisted without further effort. However, these are almost by definition affecting small numbers of individuals. I am skeptical that AI-assisted mitigation systems will be widely deployed for the other species WAW focuses on, or that they will be developed with animal welfare considerations at the center, unless there are deliberate interventions. The crossover of WAW and AI in HWC is a minority concern. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wildlabs.net/\">WILDLABS</a> is a network bringing together a global conservation technology community, but it is not specific to AI technology and only 4% of all members belong to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wildlabs.net/groups/human-wildlife-conflict?tab=about\">HWC group</a>.&nbsp;There are also special issues in journals on AI in conservation, e.g., in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors/special_issues/sensors_AI_wildlife_conservation\"><i>Sensors</i></a>, and there are some articles in high impact journals like&nbsp;<i>Nature and Frontiers</i>, however a focus on animal welfare is missing - and there needs to be more opportunities for interdisciplinary, rather than field-focused, work and discussions. The possibility of AI systems being rapidly rolled out in 10-20 years adds urgency to trying to get WAW concern established in AI system use, as opposed to trying to establish this later when the systems are already widely deployed without WAW considerations.</p><h1>3. Uncertainties</h1><p>As this is an initial report with very preliminary/foundational ideas, there are some uncertainties:</p><ul><li><strong>Key counterfactual:</strong> If randomized control trials and cost-effectiveness analyses find non-AI mitigations are significantly more effective than AI assisted mitigations.</li><li><strong>Number of animals affected:</strong> Existing HWC estimates are mostly regional, but better data on national and global numbers of animals could make this a more or less pressing area to work on. However, estimates of bat deaths alone suggest working on this would be impactful.</li><li><strong>Species-specific problems</strong>: It may not be possible to customize system parameters for the species we care about most.</li><li><strong>Conflict-specific problems</strong>: The physical locations where most conflict occurs may not always be amenable to these technologies.</li><li><strong>Social factors in HWC:</strong>&nbsp;To the extent that attitude change is an important outcome of such interventions beyond the direct impact on animal fatalities, there is substantial uncertainty about whether and how it is affected. It has been suggested that antagonism towards animals or species may remain robust over time and there are deeper-seated factors (such as misinformation or cultural beliefs) that may lend to this&nbsp;(Dickman, 2010). Therefore, even if HWC is resolved, perceptions of animals and their treatment may not alter. However, this may only be applicable in cases where there is uncertainty about whether the \u201cproblem animal'' still poses a threat. It is often recommended that awareness raising, education, and outreach go hand in hand with mitigating certain HWC, so this would also need to be considered.</li><li><strong>Harms</strong>:&nbsp;Dual-use technologies could be used to make animal lives worse. Due to the great uncertainty about the net suffering of wild animals, AI-assisted HWC mitigations could increase other types of suffering. See section 8.3 for further details.</li><li><strong>Undesirable outcomes/trophic effects:</strong> For example, we do not know what the implications of a surplus ~1 million starlings per year would be if culling was prevented. Would they feed on neighboring, AI-unguarded crops, and would that create undesirable economic disparities or displace HWC fatalities to another location? What ecosystem impacts would we see?</li></ul><h1>4. Limitations of this report</h1><ul><li><strong>Full scope of technology not addressed:</strong>&nbsp;There are AI-assisted HWC mitigations I have not been able to address in this report, such as the use of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sentientmedia.org/how-drones-could-help-us-coexist-with-wildlife/\">drones</a>. From initial expert outreach, their use may be limited based on laws and regulations, and their effectiveness in the field may depend on how easy it is for end-users to utilize the technology. Though it could be worthwhile for further exploration and investigation of the use of drones.&nbsp;(Singer &amp; Tse, 2022) also discuss expanding wildlife-vehicle collision prevention AI to smaller animals.</li><li><strong>Neglecting HWC of most concern in the Global South:&nbsp;</strong>When writing this report with WAW in mind, the examples I discuss may largely be applicable to countries in the Global North (and specifically North America because of data and study availability). The stakeholders&nbsp;for the mitigations&nbsp;I discuss may be conservation organizations, farmers, and larger companies. However, people and areas that may need effective solutions the most are protected areas, national parks, and crop farmers in the Global South (which is usually underfunded in comparison). With any research or funding coming from the Global North that contributes to work on HWC in these areas, there is a need to ensure work is being carried out in collaboration with affected communities, and to&nbsp;invest in local capacity-building. This may add value to AI-assisted systems that can be one-off installations and may not require substantial long-term funding.</li></ul><h1>5. Background on human-wildlife conflict</h1><p>Broadly, HWC refers to interactions between humans and wild animals with negative consequences for people and their resources and/or for wildlife and their habitats (e.g.,<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=mPGlzJ\">SARPO, WWF, 2005</a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=3se3u6\">IUCN SSC HWCTF, 2020</a>). Examples of HWC directly negatively affecting humans include wild animals damaging infrastructure, crops and other vegetation, and attacking livestock. People often kill wildlife to mitigate or even retaliate against such threats. Other examples of HWC directly negatively affecting wildlife include destruction of habitats for human developments, hunting, wildlife-vehicle collisions, and wind turbine collisions.</p><p>In many regions of the world HWC is increasing as a result of human population growth, encroachment, and transforming land use (e.g., agricultural expansions, urbanization, and infrastructure development). This pushes humans, human structures, and agricultural practices in closer proximity to wildlife, raising the likelihood of interactions and natural resource competition - a key cause of HWC (<a href=\"https://www.unep.org/resources/report/future-all-need-human-wildlife-coexistence\">Gross et al., 2021</a>). HWC has become a global concern, particularly in terms of conservation, sustainable development, and food security. Several countries are now explicitly beginning to include HWC in national policies and strategies, not only for wildlife management, but also in poverty alleviation and development&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=FmOvhp\">(FAO &amp; UNEP, 2020, p. 17)</a>.</p><p>Climate change is further intensifying HWC by exacerbating resource scarcity, increasing competition and the need to share spaces even further (examples of this can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=h0rxCL\">Abrahms, 2021)</a>. Whilst climate change-driven HWC hasn't seen significant research attention, governmental bodies are increasingly recognizing this challenge and developing policies which incorporate climate into the management of certain HWCs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=UHHDka\">(Bhatt et al., 2018)</a>. In the same vein, research and development of HWC mitigation strategies and interventions could be framed as part of climate adaptation. Therefore, there may be an opportunity for the WAW community to shape such policies.</p><p>Current HWC efforts are largely reserved for charismatic species, or species of key conservation concern, or where human-wildlife conflict leads to economic and social damages to humans - this sidelines the animal welfare implications. For example,&nbsp;Anand and Radhakrishna (2017) reviewed HWC trends in India and found that all of the publications they accessed focused exclusively on the negative impacts of wildlife on humans. Working to emphasize animal welfare in HWC mitigation could help improve WAW right now. The direct impacts to WAW of current HWC practices include the number of animal deaths as a result, which are often stressful and perhaps even drawn out (e.g., animals chased in retaliatory killings or poisoned) and presumably very painful (e.g., train and turbine collisions). HWC may also exacerbate negative perceptions of wildlife among the people affected, which is associated with reduced support for species conservation&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=DZTsuV\">(Goodrich, 2010)</a>. Humans can suffer economic losses, loss of life, and trauma from conflicts, which reduces tolerance levels for wildlife and is associated with increased apathy for the welfare of wild animals (this applies at a community level, even among people who have never personally experienced HWC&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=Rt5uCQ\">(Dickman, 2010)</a>). Therefore, preventing HWC could potentially alter the perception of \u201cproblem animals.\u201d If preventing HWC improves attitudes toward affected animals, it may make it easier for people to consider the welfare of those animals.</p><p>There are many methods implemented to respond to different HWC. In the case of elephants alone, more than 80 non-lethal mitigation strategies have recently been identified and compiled in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ste-coexistence-toolbox.info/\">human-elephant coexistence toolbox</a> resource.&nbsp;However, for other species, non-lethal methods of prevention are lacking. Many HWC mitigations are reactive and some lead to deaths or significant impacts on animal welfare. Developing preventive methods that do not compromise animal welfare and are more animal-friendly should be prioritized, with a particular need for effective mitigations to avoid more extreme and harmful solutions such as lethal control. When it comes to mitigating HWC, the integration of several strategies is often required for effective reduction in conflict. Solutions preventing HWC from occurring in the first instance would provide the greatest benefit.</p><h1>6. Background on current use of AI techniques</h1><p>The&nbsp;utilization of AI in conservation continues to grow<a href=\"#fn-WBcso52Aef7pNXAW4-2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. AI techniques and methods&nbsp;can be utilized to establish effective systems in HWC mitigation, and in an ideal world, prevent conflicts from occurring in the first instance. Machine vision has a key role to play in this and has been developed successfully in other conservation areas.</p><p>Deep learning tools such as machine vision with artificial neural networks, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNN algorithms can learn (i.e., increasingly improve their ability) to execute tasks with examples.&nbsp;This is an example of a supervised ML technique, as a subject expert needs to pinpoint features that will be used to identify and classify objects in images. The CNN architecture employs filters to sequentially identify the most important features of an object and finally classify the image output in binary (e.g. bird/not bird) or multiple&nbsp;classes&nbsp;(e.g., small bird/medium sized bird/large bird). CNNs have been used successfully for automatically identifying, classifying, and monitoring wild animal populations using images and videos primarily from camera trap data&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=LG9yQQ\">(Norouzzadeh et al., 2018)</a>. These methods are used relatively widely in conservation and academia - initiatives such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://golden.com/wiki/Wildbook-4NXW4DZ\">'Wildbook'</a>&nbsp;help to facilitate this. Wildbook uses AI to identify individual wild animals from different species to create a wildlife image inventory for data collection. It is an open-source, user-friendly software&nbsp;platform to help collaborative projects store and manage wildlife data for scientific studies. It\u2019s used by over 900 wildlife researchers globally to track over 118,000 individual animals and collect data on populations from over 50 species<a href=\"#fn-WBcso52Aef7pNXAW4-3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>.</p><p>Due to rapid development in the field, CNNs have now become a more robust option for automated animal detection. Though published material on research and development for its specific use in HWC mitigation exist, it is still in its infancy in comparison with other conservation uses, and is a lesser utilized method of harnessing such techniques. Below, I review a case study of a scalable and tractable AI-assisted system for mitigating HWC, which has been deployed and proven more effective than typical mitigation methods using RCTs, while identifying where and how welfare considerations can be maximized. Secondly, I will discuss a potential theory of change for how increasing the effectiveness of HWC mitigation could have significant benefits to WAW through eliminating the need for lethal methods. The final example of how AI could improve HWC mitigation is informing where/when mitigations should be implemented to be most effective.</p><h1>7. Using AI-assisted systems for HWC mitigation</h1><h2>1. A case study: preventing bird-turbine collisions</h2><p>This is an example of a successful AI intervention that has proven effectiveness and reliability in solving a HWC problem better than existing methods, at scale. It is estimated that 600,000 to 949,000 bats and 140,000 to 679,000 birds die from turbine collisions per year in North America alone&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=L5xMwz\">(Choi et al., 2020)</a>. It is likely that wildlife collisions will continue to increase due to wide-scale wind energy development across the globe.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/wind\">The International Energy Agency</a> states wind additions doubled in 2020 and additions through 2026 may be almost 25% higher on average than between 2015 and 2020. Predictions for the number of terawatt-hours of electricity generated from wind power globally in 2030 are also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/9220/twh-of-electricity-from-wind-in-2030/\">2.7x higher</a> than published records for 2020. This rapid expansion of the wind energy industry will lead to increases in animal injuries and deaths, which makes it valuable to develop effective methods for preventing this HWC.&nbsp;AI solutions have been intentionally designed to detect certain birds falling under protected species legislation, with successful deployment in several countries. There is potential for: 1) advocates to utilize a similar mechanism of getting government leverage over companies; 2) expanding this to the protection of a wider number of bird species; 3) exploring research and development for how this system could be used to prevent mass bat mortalities.</p><h3>The system: automated informed curtailment</h3><p>Generally speaking, these systems are programmed to: identify specific birds/classes of birds \u2192 decide if the collision risk is great enough \u2192 if so, trigger curtailment upon detection (temporarily shutting off the blades) and/or other deterrents such as sound \u2192 thus preventing collision.</p><h3>Example product: IndentiFlight</h3><p>The \u2018<a href=\"https://www.identiflight.com/\">IdentiFlight\u2019 system</a> can be used to detect eagles within 1km of wind turbines (it has been tested for detection of birds as large or larger than American kestrels (<i>Falco sparverius</i>)).</p><p>The system utilizes a CNN and is made up of a stereo unit that captures pairs of images eight times per second while following a bird's flight path, and calculates distance to the bird every 125 meters per second. Bird dimensions are estimated from the images using the distance and fixed angular field-of-view of the cameras. IdentiFlight calculates ~200 image attributes (e.g estimates of body length, wingspan, posture, color, etc.) which are used to determine bird classification with a confidence value (how well the calculated attributes match the pre-trained library of eagle attributes in the system). It can quickly discriminate between objects too far away, too large, or too small. The system continuously scans the sky in a 360-degree radius and can follow a bird's flight path continuously (unless it goes out of view and then it gets 'reset' i.e. detected as a different bird). It chooses the classification with the highest confidence for the whole record of the bird flight (i.e., as the bird and its features become more visible, confidence levels increase). If the bird moves into non-ideal perspective again the highest classification is still preserved, even if it is at a low confidence value, as the system is intentionally biased to err towards classifying non-eagles as eagles.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995892/mirroredImages/nhsdeCEZAaBQQaro8/qlhfboilx3jfozxkesio.png\"></p><p>Image of an Identiflight bird detection system.</p><h3>What it is designed to replace: human observers</h3><p>Airports use radar systems widely for detection of birds, however they cannot perform classification of birds or distinguish them from flying objects, thus requiring detailed analysis of data, for example via biologist consultation. High prices, power consumption, and government-imposed limitations on beam power and frequency limit the scalability of radar systems to other contexts&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=OlUCev\">(Gr\u00fcndinger, 2017)</a>. To prevent turbine collisions of protected species, some wind power facilities employ human observers stationed at vantage points who watch for eagles and order certain turbines to be powered down.</p><p>Using automated machine vision systems would be quicker and cheaper than observers who also have reduced visibility in comparison. Furthermore, AI solutions allow for otherwise conflicting needs to be met. For ornithologists, preferable solutions to date have been periodic turbine shut-downs. However, this limits wind farm power production and thus affects company profits&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=30c5Tw\">(Gradolewski et al., 2021)</a>. Therefore, wind farm developers and operators would want to avoid unnecessary breaks in power production and minimize the time turbines are shut off, whereas environmental authorities want a high reliability of collision prevention, particularly for rare and large birds.</p><h3>Why it is tractable: conservation concern + proven efficacy</h3><p>There is a current conservation concern for big birds in particular, and there has been a challenge in designing systems that meet requirements specified by local environmental authorities, wind farm developers, and turbine manufacturers. In the United States, Duke Energy Renewables was found to violate laws protecting the Migratory Bird Treaty Act by failing to make all reasonable efforts to build their wind energy projects in a way that would avoid risk of avian deaths by collision with turbine blades, despite being warned by United States Fish and Wildlife Service (United States of America v. Duke Energy Renewables, 2013). This required the company to use human observers to prevent eagle-turbine collisions, but after several years they collaborated in the testing and implementation of IdentiFlight.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=VhRXwq\">McClure et al. (2018</a>) examined its efficacy compared to human observers in a proof-of-concept study. IdentiFlight was able to detect 96% of bird flights detected by human observers and 562% more than observers did (due to their difficulties with identifying birds from distance). The automated eagle detection had a false negative rate of 6% and false positive rate of 28% (it is \u201cprogrammed to have a low false negative rate at the cost of sometimes misclassifying a \u2018non-eagle,\u2019\u201d as it is intentionally designed to protect eagles (McClure et al., 2018, p. 30)). The median time from detection to classification was 0.4 seconds. The system missed 53 birds - however, only four of these were detected by observers - but detected 5,958 birds that the observers missed, making IdentiFlight comparatively more effective.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=Ofv6mp\">McClure et al. (202</a>1) tested the system\u2019s real-world effectiveness in addressing the problem using a&nbsp;before-after-control-impact study. They found a 75%-89% reduction in eagle fatality rates at a test site where IdentiFlight was deployed relative to the control site without the curtailment system. The number of fatalities within the treatment site decreased by &gt;60% after the mitigation was implemented. The system is currently deployed in five countries around the world: the USA, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Spain.</p><h3>Considerations:</h3><ul><li>The time taken for blades to stop depends on the turbine model (anything from 20s to &gt;1 min)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=ZfIaQM\">(McClure et al., 2021)</a>.</li><li>Initial costs may be high, however the costs of employing long-term observers are likely even higher and have been proven less effective.</li><li>Some systems have been designed to combine deterrents with curtailment, such as strobing lights (<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=pbrvvJ\">Gradolewski et al., 2021)</a> and auditory stimuli (such as \u2018DTBird\u2019 which is also commercially available, though I did not choose this as a case study as recent publications of efficacy tests, including compared to other mitigations, were not as readily available). Curtailment is largely reserved for rare or big birds, and long-distance light/sound deterrents for other birds. In some cases the additional deterrent methods are required to encourage birds to change their flight path and avoid turbine stopping zones altogether; in other cases, where possible, wind energy companies might opt for only deterrents to completely avoid the economic impacts of curtailment&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=UE7yF1\">(Gradolewski et al., 2021)</a>.</li><li>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=QxFpu9\">Gradolewski et al. (2021</a>), the authors also focused on system efficacy for identifying large birds, however their CNN was trained to classify birds in three different categories: small, medium and large; and was able to detect small birds reliably within 150m. Further research and development is needed for the improvement of accurate detection of smaller objects from a distance.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/news/can-painting-wind-turbine-blades-black-really-save-birds\">Painting turbine blades</a> may also help prevent bird deaths, however more robust testing is being conducted - this could be an alternative to AI, or something that could be used alongside AI systems.</li></ul><h3>Potential for further impact:</h3><p>There is promise that these kinds of systems will continue to be rolled out - in several locations protected species acts and legal requirements will encourage their uptake. Due to regulations, several wind power companies have a legal incentive to implement bird collision mitigation measures for protected species. This is a highly valuable mechanism advocates can use to gain leverage over companies. IdentiFlight currently only specifically intends to protect golden eagles (<i>aquila chrysaetos</i>), bald eagles (<i>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</i>), and red kites (<i>Milvus milvus</i>). Other bird species that were common within the testing site included turkey vultures (<i>Cathartes aura</i>), red-tailed hawks (<i>Buteo jamaicensis</i>), and common ravens (<i>Corvus corax</i>), and ferruginous hawks (<i>Buteo regalis</i>). So while the system is designed to protect a limited number of species, it can have a wider positive impact and could be programmed to detect other species. From a welfare perspective, it would be ideal for systems to protect more species of birds that are at risk. However, the conflicting priorities of involved stakeholders makes this difficult. Therefore, adding a bird from a relatively numerous species to a protected species list could be beneficial. It would be worthwhile to identify whether there is a species of bird at risk, in large numbers, not currently protected that could be added to capture a lot of the value of protecting all birds by just adding that one species to the detection list. This would be worthwhile if it would be relatively quick or easy to do this.</p><p>However, wind turbines are by no means the leading cause of bird deaths. Despite many studies being conducted on the impacts of turbines on birds, resources may be better spent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=3903501&amp;GUID=21B44B73-D7E1-4C55-83BD-1CA254531416\">deterring birds from colliding with buildings</a>, which causes between 365 and 988 million deaths annually (Loss et al., 2014). While there are clear merits to this technology for the conservation of large birds of prey and other protected species, and it can ultimately prevent painful injury and death, there would potentially be greater value in further research on how it can be used to protect bats, given that turbine collisions kill&nbsp;600,000 to 949,000 bats annually in North America alone. It is one of the leading causes of bat mortality; a&nbsp;global review showed wind turbine collisions were \u201cthe most frequently observed cause of multiple mortality events\u201d in bats worldwide&nbsp;(O\u2019Shea et al., 2016). Taking the data from this study, the average number of bats that die at once in a multiple mortality event is approximately 40. Not only are they affected in higher numbers than birds, bats can also suffer barotrauma (internal hemorrhaging) due to the sudden drop in air pressure around turbine blades. Studies have typically focused on automated detection of bats from their acoustic cues, and deployed systems, such as \u2018DTBat\u2019, that use one to three automated ultrasonic detectors to trigger curtailment in response to bat presence. However, recent evidence from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=XL2RHy\">Voigt et al. (2021</a>) suggests that when monitoring bat activity near wind turbines, the limited sensitivity of ultrasonic microphones and attenuation of ultrasonic echolocation calls poses limitations, such as severely constrained detection distances which do not cover the total area of risk. It would perhaps be more beneficial to explore how the detection of bats near turbines and prevention of collisions could be improved to save a higher number of bats. If this were to be explored using machine vision techniques, long-wave infrared cameras would have to be utilized, as bats are most affected between dusk and dawn. Thermal imaging is currently used to monitor bat behavior and can have a range of up to 110m. There has been success with automated recognition of thermal signatures of larger species, however, the small size of many bat species may make this difficult, even for typical object detection algorithms that rely on morphological properties to be used. Preliminary studies have found it may be possible to detect and classify bats from flight track patterns&nbsp;(Cullinan et al., 2015) which could be a way to overcome this challenge. More species-specific research on this would be needed, which highlights the fact that specific solutions are often needed for specific problems. However, research and development in this area could be a way to significantly improve WAW through improving systems to mitigate fatal HWC on a great scale.</p><p>In some places, like North America, the majority of bats are not legally protected, so the incentive to consider mitigations is lacking. Therefore, in tandem with the improvement of mitigations and proving their efficacy, advocates could push for the protection of a wider range of bat species, or those particularly at risk of turbine collisions, and the enforcement of protection at wind farms. Ways to go about this might include highlighting their conservation status and that turbine collisions are a leading cause of mass mortality events in bats, which could affect whole populations&nbsp;(O\u2019Shea et al., 2016)<a href=\"#fn-WBcso52Aef7pNXAW4-4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a>. This could speed up the adoption of effective systems that prevent bat deaths at wind turbines. There may be other ways to raise the status of a specific species, but this type of intervention was not the focus of this report.</p><h2>2. Exploring a theory of change: preventing HWC with \u2018pest\u2019 or \u2018nuisance\u2019 species</h2><p>If machine vision-based methods can make HWC prevention highly effective, they could be adopted, even on a small scale \u2192 this helps to drop prices \u2192 allowing for systems to be more widely adopted \u2192 which would lead to more support and R&amp;D \u2192 leading to continued price drops and adoption \u2192 this could create space for legislation to ban harmful or lethal methods of animal control, such as culling, which wouldn\u2019t be needed if the problem is solved (or more realistically, nearly solved) \u2192 it may also reduce apathy and antagonism towards species<a href=\"#fn-WBcso52Aef7pNXAW4-5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. This is a very tentative possible theory of change. A HWC that this could apply to is \u2018pest\u2019 species in agriculture, such as the culling of&nbsp;European starlings (<i>Sturnus vulgaris</i>) in the USA.&nbsp;Starlings can potentially ruin entire harvests of crops, particularly fruits, and also consume livestock feed, potentially contaminating it with their droppings. Earlier this year, Wildlife Services, a department of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), came under fire when it was revealed that they had killed over 1.75 million animals across the country, 1,028,642 of which were European starlings&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=hFGRPB\">(Milman, 2022)</a>.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ask.usda.gov/s/article/why-did-the-united-states-department-of-agriculture-cull-starlings-or-other-birds-in-my-area\">USDA</a> states that they deploy lethal methods for bird control when non-lethal methods are unavailable or deemed impractical or ineffective. Below is an overview of a proposed AI-assisted system that could be developed to detect and deter flocks of starlings. If proven more effective than alternative methods, which have been found ineffective at solving the problem or are highly costly, it could prevent wide-scale crop damage and thus the need for culling.&nbsp;There is potential for: 1) funding/influencing funding for AI-assisted solutions with high potential impact; 2) advocates to&nbsp;raise awareness among stakeholders of effective non-lethal mitigations; 3) investigating if a similar flock detection system could be used to prevent mass bat deaths.</p><h3>The non-lethal deterrent typically used is scaring</h3><p>**Mechanical:&nbsp;**Nets can be wrapped around individual plants or stretched over entire orchards or vineyards. This incurs high purchase costs as it is a short-lived method which needs replacing every one to five years, and costs range from $7,000 to $30,000 USD per acre, depending on the netting system used. Furthermore, installation and removal is labor and time intensive, and the netting has negative ecological impacts. Hawk-kites and scarecrows are another option, but show mixed results, so unmanned aerial vehicles/drones/\u2019robobirds\u2019 have been developed in recent years to be flown above affected areas and deter flocks. However, there are limits to flight times, legislation restrictions, and constraints from control and battery charging requirements.<br><strong>Acoustic:</strong> Hunters may shoot blanks to scare birds without death or injury, however, guards can only watch over part of the total area and this ideally requires someone working at different times throughout the day. Employment costs also need to be considered. Sonic bird repellers which emit raptor sounds, starling calls that signal danger avoidance, or sounds at frequencies unpleasant to birds can be deployed. Directional ultrasonic repellers are often effective but only perform optimally in small enclosed areas. Another method is using firing cannons during ripening periods. This method is relatively cheap, but disturbs other nearby animals and people. Furthermore, acoustic methods gradually become ineffective as animals habituate to constant disturbances&nbsp;(Kingshay, 2013).</p><p><strong>Optical:</strong> Distributing shiny objects disturbs all types of birds, but smaller birds particularly are scared by the reflections, which resemble raptor eyes. However, starlings are intelligent and again, over time, this method may become less effective. Holographic strips and lasers (agrilaser systems) are alternative methods.</p><p><strong>Natural enemies</strong>: some farmers may hire a falconer to predate upon \u2018pest\u2019 species. This method is time-intensive and costly, and it also causes suffering for the targeted species. From the perspective of conserving animal welfare, methods which cause the least suffering yet remain effective would be ideal. Harris Hawks (<i>Parabuteo unicinctus</i>) may be trained and flown above the area without chasing or catching starlings to deter them; though this is effective, it is still costly. I could not find costs in the US, but comparative costs in the UK are as follows: \u00a33045 GBP for \u2018setting up\u2019, which includes expenses such as equipment, shelter, and food + \u00a33045 GBP for one to two hours of staff time each day the hawk is flown.</p><h3>A proposed solution</h3><p>Marco\u0148 et al. (2021) propose a vision detection system to trigger a scaring element only when a flock of starlings is detected, so that the process is not continuous (preventing habituation to deterrent stimuli), and also eliminates undesired sonic disturbance. The system is an optical detector, utilizing a camera system and ML algorithm to track items in a predefined area. Images of different flying objects taken within the study area were annotated and categorized, for example based on if they were images of birds, insects, helicopters, or flocks. They were then classified into more specific subsets (e.g., bees vs. flies), and for birds, specifically based on their individual flight characteristics (e.g., soaring birds vs. birds with retracted wings). Classified images were used in training, validation, and testing in the ML phase. The system was set so that it would trigger a scaring task if the optical unit detected a flock with more than 30% confidence. Testing of the classifier showed a 100% precision for flocks (i.e., it detected 100% of the true positives) with only a 5.7% error rate (the proportion between all misclassified objects and the total number of detected objects). It evaluated flocks correctly up to 300m - any distance further than that causes an increase in false detections. Large flocks and even small formations of several birds were highly detectable. The idea is for a detection event to trigger a deterrent stimulus.</p><p>There is a deployed bird deterrent system, \u2018AVIX\u2019, which also uses AI in a similar way. This product can distinguish birds from other objects and uses laser beams to deter them - however, there is no trigger system for an entire flock, just a single bird. Since flocks raiding ripening fruit would cause the most widespread damage, the proposed system has a significant advantage over systems which are not programmed to detect flocks, and could be more valuable for effectively preventing raids and thus the need to resort to lethal methods. The authors emphasize that their system also allows incorporation of multiple scaring methods, not just one. By only triggering the deterrent when needed, this addresses limitations of alternative methods by reducing the adaptability of the flock to the scare sounds, compared to current commercial devices which emit continuous sound. For low consumption, the system includes a time delay switch to activate the setup one hour before sunrise and shut off one hour after sunset; this combined with the trigger system reduces the electricity costs and battery charging requirements compared to other technological solutions.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995892/mirroredImages/nhsdeCEZAaBQQaro8/zq9jwofbuipfv2umrhaw.png\"></p><p>Image of the complete set up at a vineyard in Bo\u0159etice, Moravia, the Czech Republic - taken from&nbsp;Marco\u0148 et al.

In this study, a small island network was built, which additionally required a solar charger, a photovoltaic panel and a voltage regulator to supply electricity to the microcomputer and cameras.</li><li>The number and placement of cameras needed will be dependent on the camera parameters as well as the area and altitude profile of the area being observed. For the study area, the authors in this study calculated a radius of 300m could be covered for a full 360 degree range by at least eight sensing modules. This poses a limitation in that each system has a reduced field of view, so several modules are needed.</li><li>Initial costs may be high, but the equipment could be made cheaper and more scalable with product development. Most agricultural areas are also owned by large multinational companies - scalability may depend on whether they or farmers bear the brunt of the cost, or whether government organizations could be persuaded to subsidize costs. It also benefits from being a system with a one-time installation which could continue to deter birds, avoiding crop damage, and thus prevent their deaths from poisoning.</li></ul><h3>Potential for impact:</h3><p>With the deployment and adoption of any mitigation, there will be a need to effectively&nbsp;demonstrate how the system works better than current methods to alleviate the problems end-users are facing.&nbsp;If the expected effectiveness of this system for deterring starlings is high in comparison to (or in combination with) other mitigations, and it successfully prevents birds from damaging crops and contaminating feed, it could potentially eliminate the need for lethal control. Culling also does not necessarily stop a problem recurring, it just controls the population of a species. So if effectiveness can be proven, perhaps it would be likely for conservation and government organizations to invest funds into R&amp;D, or for agricultural companies to buy the end product. This would perhaps require some advocacy work to convince stakeholders that this method is preferable to poisoning, or a funder to subsidize its free distribution and training costs for a period to incentivise quick awareness and adoption.&nbsp;Pimentel et al. (2000) estimated that starlings damaged 800 million USD worth of agriculture crops in the United States annually. Preventing this extent of financial damage to the agricultural sector alone could be a significant motivator for investing in HWC mitigation systems that are proven highly effective and consequently eliminate the need for culling.&nbsp;This flock detection system could also potentially be used for detecting bats near turbines, especially as turbine collisions are the leading cause of mass mortality events in bats. This may help to overcome issues of poor visual detection and poor acoustic detection described above.</p><p>The tentative theory of change I explore could apply to several conflicts involving numerous species that are seen as crop-raiding animals. Another example is wild boars, who can cause extensive and costly damage to agricultural land. AI-assisted systems could potentially be used to detect and deter such animals.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://india.mongabay.com/2022/06/farmer-unions-demand-vermin-status-for-wild-boars-centre-highlights-their-role-in-forest-habitat/\">Farmers in India</a> have been demanding that wild boars be formally categorized as \u2018vermin\u2019 to facilitate mass culling. While these demands have not been met, governments in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/state-frames-rules-to-allow-limited-killing-of-wild-boars/articleshow/87788213.cms\">Goa</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-local-bodies-to-get-powers-to-cull-wild-boars-101653506309177.html\">Kerala</a> have authorized permissions to hunt wild boars, suggesting other states where this conflict is high may follow suit. As wild boars are one of the widest-ranging mammals across the world, several other regions face a similar problem. In the USA there are now <a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/ourfocus/wildlifedamage/operational-activities/feral-swine/sa-fs-history#:~:text=Feral%20swine%20have%20been%20reported,million%20and%20is%20rapidly%20expanding\">over 6 million feral pigs</a>; they are widely seen as an invasive pest and are poisoned, trapped, or shot.</p><h2>3. Using ML predictions of where/when HWC will occur to redirect mitigations</h2><p>Improving the effectiveness of existing HWC mitigation systems could have a high pay-off on its own. An additional way AI could be used to make HWC mitigations most effective, and feed into this potential theory of change, is by predicting when and where HWC might occur in the first place. This could ensure that mitigation systems are placed in the most optimal locations. Using ML methods to understand, identify, and predict the conditions in which HWC may occur would allow proactive action to prevent HWC. ML algorithms can handle vast amounts of data, AI can learn and rationalize \u2013 allowing modeling with higher accuracy and speed than humans, without having to explicitly provide instructions. Thus, animal behavior, animal movement, migration patterns, economic, psychosocial, and spatial-temporal data on HWC could be synthesized and analyzed to facilitate predictions.</p><p>Currently,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wildlifeconservationtrust.org/\">Wildlife Conservation Trust</a> (WCT) is collaborating with Singapore Management University and Google Research India in its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai.google/social-good/#:~:text=Working%20together%20to%20apply%20AI%20for%20social%20good&amp;text=Google.org%20issued%20an%20open,ranging%20from%20environmental%20to%20humanitarian.\">Social Good Programme</a> to design AI models to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wildlifeconservationtrust.org/can-artificial-intelligence-predict-human-wildlife-conflict/\">predict HWC</a> in Maharashtra, India. These models are currently being tested. WCT has already been conducting extensive research in this area, so plentiful data is available. Similarly, there are other locations and animal populations that are well-studied, with large amounts of data from camera traps and GPS remote sensing methods to analyze movement behavior, and community surveys to collect conflict-related data, which could be used in this context too. In other words, for some locations, there would not even be a need to collect this vast and fine-scale data. Other sources of data can be utilized too. WCT utilized the Forest Department\u2019s compensation records, government data on human and livestock populations, and Google satellite data.</p><p>Along with their primary uses, the AI-assisted systems I have described above could also potentially be used to contribute to gathering and storing large amounts of data on individual species counts and behavioral data that could be used to predict where HWC might occur. The turbine collision case study provides a clear example:</p><p>Due to the difficulty and differences in regulatory requirements for collecting this data, reliable estimates for mortality rates as a result of turbine collisions are difficult to acquire, which is why there is such a large range in figures. Here, machine vision without the need for a curtailment system can be utilized to automatically identify species and collision incidents to inform interventions.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?broken=XZbFC8\">McClure et al. (2021</a>) also suggested the best case scenario would be avoiding the erection of turbines in high-risk areas in the first instance, but it can be difficult to predict impacts before construction. While curtailment systems will still hold high value and will still be needed in the meantime, being able to predict where these high-risk areas are would be ideal in deciding where to erect turbines. For example, machine vision systems could also be used to monitor bat activity and inform ML predictions to identify migration pathways and high risk areas more quickly, before turbines are constructed. We may not be able to stop the development of wind farms in all high-risk areas, so when avoidance isn\u2019t preferred an effective automated curtailment system should still be implemented.</p><h1>8. Broader considerations, obstacles, and opportunities</h1><p>A global survey&nbsp;of 248 conservation technology developers, users, and academics&nbsp;by Speaker et al. (2022) suggests coordination, capacity-building, and funding issues are hampering the development and implementation of conservation technologies and need to be addressed. Some of these wider considerations could be applied specifically to AI-assisted methods for mitigating HWC and improving WAW, and the potential for harm should be considered too.</p><h2>1. Coordination issues</h2><ul><li>It seems many conservation organizations have little knowledge of technology from an operational perspective. Even where there are technology or AI experts, there is a huge gap between theory and applications in the field, and thus deciding what to actually bring to the field to implement. It\u2019ll take interdisciplinary work and collaboration between engineers, AI experts, ecologists, animal behavior experts, conservationists, and even social scientists to fully harness any potential that lies in this area.<ul><li>An interdisciplinary conference on the intersection between AI and HWC or wildlife management, with funding to tie experts from these fields together, could be established. Conservation technology networks like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wildlabs.net\">WILDLABS</a> might be a great place to start.</li></ul></li><li>Greater consideration should also be given to where research is published. For example, a lot of the research on developing AI-assisted systems for conservation was published in technological journals, and as a result, some developments may not end up on the radar of conservation or animal welfare organizations.<ul><li>An applied methods journal written by technical experts but designed to be accessible for audiences with a wider range of expertise would be beneficial, and could increase the likelihood of citations.</li></ul></li><li>There also seems to be a gap between what companies publicize, and the actual end result and efficiency once an AI-assisted, or any other technological, system is deployed in the field - there tends to be a boom of publications and articles before or at the beginning of the deployment phase, but then little after that. This could indicate that field results are worse than expected (highlighting the need for appropriate collaborations), or it could be that once funding is secured and a system is implemented, nobody asks for these studies of efficacy. Like the significance bias that exists in academic research, it does not seem highly likely that we would easily find out if a system had been developed or deployed but then failed. Although it would be highly valuable for this information to be easily accessible in order to have a better understanding of what does and does not work. Through expert outreach, I found conservation technology is sometimes funded and purchased, but end users are not trained or supported to effectively use it long term in the field (this being especially prominent in the case of drone technology).</li></ul><h2>2. Funding</h2><ul><li>A lot of technologies in conservation need long-term support to gradually implement them. If the funding for that is not considered, then it is not likely to succeed.<ul><li>Therefore, there should be higher expected value placed on systems that do not require long-term funding support.&nbsp;This should especially be paid attention to in areas with historically limited comparative funding and resources - e.g., East Africa and South Asia.&nbsp;In&nbsp;Speaker et al. (2022), upfront and maintenance costs were a key constraint for respondents in developing countries.</li></ul></li><li>In Speaker et al. (2022): \u201crespondents identifying as conservation technology developers and testers reported that financing was also a significant barrier for them. They rated securing funding throughout the development cycle (67%) and securing seed funding for projects (62%) as their top 2 constraints\u201d (p. 7).<ul><li>Perhaps involvement of corporate technology companies in conservation technology (e.g. Microsoft and Google) could shift this financing dynamic. If appropriate, there may be a potential opportunity here for EA to fund R&amp;D, work to convince others (such as companies/governments/NGOs/philanthropists) to fund and use effective AI-assisted mitigation systems, or inject a small amount of initial funding to test and gather feedback on interventions.</li></ul></li><li>Time and expertise needed: More generally,&nbsp;supervised learning techniques require large amounts of human-labeled data and human specialists to train models. This often comes at a cost. However, this technology is continually improving, and different methods, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning\">transfer learning</a>, can be utilized for slightly smaller datasets and can also reduce computational requirements.</li></ul><h2>3. Potential for harm</h2><p>There could potentially be some negative or harmful effects of the development of AI for wild animal welfare, or perhaps even for preventing HWC more generally.</p><ul><li><strong>Negative intentions:</strong> The intention of end-users with access to AI-assisted technology should be considered, for example, autonomous drones are already used for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/14/poison-laden-drones-to-patrol-new-zealand-wilderness-hunt-pests-aoe\">targeted poisoning operations</a> and increasing pest control efficiency. Individuals or organizations could potentially utilize or hack this kind of technology to locate species of interest (this would be particularly harmful in the hands of poachers or trophy hunters, for example). However, perhaps the potential benefits to improving WAW on a large scale outweighs the possibilities of this occurring. To ensure this, bans/moratoriums should be placed for these uses with negative impacts, while technology with positive effects should be supported. In any case, developers should keep such considerations in mind when designing, testing, and deploying any systems - i.e., making the software robust to hacking and manipulation, and controlling the distribution of the technology.</li><li><strong>WAW arguments:</strong><ul><li>HWC deaths may be less painful than counterfactual deaths;</li><li>HWC may reduce populations of species with net negative lives.<ul><li>Currently, where the concept of WAW is at an early stage, it may be difficult to determine to what extent these two points would be true. If they are proven true, extending the lives of these animals, by preventing HWC, may not improve their welfare.</li></ul></li><li>HWC could reduce species populations which are overall harmful to other animals, such as in the case of predators.<ul><li>Although, there are counterarguments to this counterargument, such as alternative deaths (like disease) being worse.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>I am inclined to believe the overall benefits to improving certain HWC mitigations and decreasing the number of animals negatively affected by HWC, such as in the cases I have discussed of birds and bats, would be worthwhile. This could be an opportunity for WAW to have a direct impact; it may currently be an easier or a good first step to work on avoiding harm and suffering. One can get this technology deployed by bringing together a range of stakeholders with different motivations, and a concerted effort by people interested in WAW could ensure it achieves enduring positive impacts on WAW. Additionally, intervening in HWC is seen as acceptable; having WAW-aligned people working in this space would be beneficial, as it is relatively difficult to find an area that already has such a high level of buy-in, and where WAW could influence positive impact that benefits animal welfare at scale.</p><h1>Acknowledgments</h1><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995892/mirroredImages/nhsdeCEZAaBQQaro8/lapkzhplldj6ybuxa3ld.png\"></p><p><i>This post is a project of&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/\"><i>Rethink Priorities</i></a><i>\u2013a think tank dedicated to informing decisions made by high-impact organizations and funders across various cause areas.

She loved the work, but she\u2019d procrastinated on starting the project for weeks. She described that the work was interesting, and she really enjoyed it when she did it earlier in the internship. However, nothing she tried could force herself to start work. And she didn\u2019t know why. Why did she procrastinate so much on work she liked?</p><p>Since Ariel felt confused about what the issues even were, we tried a bunch of mini experiments. Would breaking the task down help? What about starting with a one-minute task so it didn\u2019t feel so overwhelming? Maybe recording herself explaining a section, and transcribing that as a rough draft?&nbsp;</p><p>Many of these experiments didn\u2019t work. For example, financial penalties were a disaster. She still failed to do the task and felt worse about losing the money.</p><p>Which makes sense, as it turned out. As we discussed her goals and motivations, we found that Ariel really cared about this project. She wanted to do well, and she felt like to do well, she had to be able to sit down and write a good draft as the starting point.&nbsp;</p><p>Except, she never felt ready to sit down to write a good draft. So she never started.</p><p>As she avoided the task, it loomed worse in her mind, until she couldn\u2019t even think about it without feeling guilty. The pressure she was putting on herself paralyzed her. She felt like a failure because she couldn\u2019t do this task as well as she had convinced herself was necessary.</p><p>So, one of the first layers we had to work with was perfectionism. Here, she had to work on internalizing the idea that she could iterate on her work. She could write a crappy first draft and come back several times to edit it until it was good. In fact, starting with a bad draft resulted in a better output than trying to start with a good draft.</p><p>We continued working together as she started a full-time job following the internship. As we continued peeling back layers, Ariel learned to sit with and manage anxiety. She worked on better productivity routines (such as setting lots of little deadlines instead of a few big ones) and getting rid of distractions (even putting her phone in a timed lock box so it didn\u2019t distract her). She also got more comfortable asking for help and standing up for herself.</p><p>I saw her confidence blossom, but this process took a while -- and that\u2019s normal.&nbsp;</p><p>It can take a while to see progress when working through layers of maladaptive mindsets, inaccurate beliefs, and bad habits. Making progress is all the more difficult because often clients hold themselves up against unrealistic standards, so they feel bad about themselves even when they are improving. In these cases, it really helps to focus on progress over time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Pat</strong></h1><p>Now, many of the cases I work with are much simpler.</p><p>Pat worked in tech, but he wanted to transition to working on AI safety. In order to do that, he needed to self-study machine learning alongside his regular job. He was having a hard time staying motivated to study after work.</p><p>Pat came to me to increase his motivation, but talking with him, it became apparent that he didn\u2019t have a clear plan. He didn\u2019t know exactly what he needed to study, and that sapped his motivation before he could even try studying.</p><p>So, we started by having him put together a plan for what he thought he needed to learn. Then, he sanity checked that plan by talking to a couple people who worked at the orgs he was interested in.</p><p>That turned out to be immensely valuable. First, they told him that the list basically looked good, but about half of the things weren\u2019t that important. So, he reduced what he needed to study by 50%, basically meaning he was learning the important content twice as fast.</p><p>Second, he started volunteering at one of the orgs. He ended up deciding to keep his regular job and continue volunteering on the side.</p><p>In Pat\u2019s case, his desire to spend more time studying was a proxy for what he really cared about \u2013 making progress toward doing work he found meaningful. Setting clear goals, prioritizing only the most important tasks, and getting feedback early all helped him make much faster progress to that goal than he would have if he had just powered through more hours studying.</p><h1><strong>Phil</strong></h1><p>Phil started coaching as a senior studying computer science. He was preparing to start his master\u2019s program. Except he hadn\u2019t done that well in undergrad \u2013 he procrastinated chronically, started his assignments the night before they were due, and generally didn\u2019t think he was prepared to get the most out of his master\u2019s program. It was a make-or-break point. He was paying for this program, but he had to step up if he was going to make that investment worthwhile.</p><p>We started working on three main goals: daily planning, starting projects in advance, and implementing more effective learning strategies. However, over the first couple meetings, he only completed about half of the plans we made.</p><p>After setting the same goals a couple times, we discussed whether this was really the right approach. He really thought these were the goals he cared about - despite failing several times - so we agreed for him to try out financial commitments. If he didn\u2019t complete the action item, he would pay a penalty. This seemed to help him get over the initial hump of trying out interventions.</p><p>During this process, we ran a bunch of experiments. With the goal of focusing better, some of his experiments included different work locations, organizing coworking groups, studying with his girlfriend, and penalties for individual tasks.</p><p>We had twelve calls over the span of four months reinforcing those key habits. He felt pretty happy with that progress, so we stopped coaching.</p><p>He returned a year and a half later. He\u2019d done well in the master\u2019s program and was working at a startup that he liked. However, he wasn\u2019t getting as much done as he wanted. We set out to increase his productivity.</p><p>However, as we discussed why he wasn\u2019t motivated, we found signs that maybe the job wasn\u2019t a great fit for him. He liked the work but didn\u2019t think the job was meaningful. He started exploring potential jobs and found some that felt very exciting.</p><p>However, in the process of choosing a specific goal to work towards, he noticed that it felt scary to think about changing. He liked his job and felt like he was learning a lot. Stepping into the unknown felt scary. Because of that fear, it had been easier not to really consider leaving in the first place. Instead, he could feel like he was making progress toward being more productive -- without having to face that decision directly.</p><p>This emotional hurdle was what he really needed to work past before he could make progress in his career. Last I heard from Phil, he had just started a new job he\u2019s excited about and thinks could be really impactful.</p><p>Originally, Phil just needed to experiment. He needed to try a lot of things, with some accountability to help him follow through on them, to find the habits that would help him accomplish his goals. The second time, however, what originally seemed like a problem with not getting enough done, turned out to be an emotional hurdle that he needed to work around.</p><h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p>As you can see from these stories, productivity coaching covers a lot of ground. People frequently come to me with some version of \u201cI want to get more done\u201d, but the following process often includes experimenting, self-discovery, and zooming out to find the best path to accomplish their goals. It isn\u2019t enough to just mindlessly apply a toolbox of productivity advice (however good the advice) \u2013 there isn\u2019t a prescribed solution that will solve any particular problem. I know tips that often help, but a lot of the process is figuring out which strategies work for this particular person and situation.</p><p>I think this is also why it can be helpful to have a coach who works specifically with effective altruists. It gives me a shared mindset with my clients, so it\u2019s easier for me to try to understand their perspective.</p>", "user": {"username": "lynettebye"}}, {"_id": "HP44QpE4jJqwPEarM", "title": "Consider Applying to the Future Fellowship at MIT", "postedAt": "2022-10-25T15:50:00.166Z", "htmlBody": "<p>\n\n<b>Update 2022-11-11</b>: given the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yjGye7Q2jRG3jNfi2/ftx-will-probably-be-sold-at-a-steep-discount-this-is-bad\">collapse\nof FTX</a> and the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xafpj3on76uRDoBja/the-ftx-future-fund-team-has-resigned\">resignation\nof the FTX Future Fund team</a> this fellowship does not look like it's happening.\n\n</p><hr />\n\n<p><span>\n\nAre you interested in doing a PhD or Masters on something altruistic?\nThe MIT Media Lab has a </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/mit-media-lab-ftx-future-fellowship/\">new\nfellowship</a> funded by the \n\n<a href=\"https://ftxfuturefund.org/\">FTX\nFuture Fund</a> for \"ambitiously benevolent projects that could not be\naccomplished anywhere else\".

Simultaneously, I often described the central theme of some of the parts while stating why that piece is significant. I found listening to the podcast while reading the best approach to get the most out of this blog series. Although the original blog piece has plenty of other resources and branches to the arguments by the author.</p><h2><strong>The central idea</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;of the blog is the claim that the century we live in may very well be the deciding time for the future of humanity, driven by Transformative AI. Through this series the author forecast <strong>more than a 10% chance we'll see transformative AI within 15 years (by 2036); a ~50% chance we'll see it within 40 years (by 2060); and a ~2/3 chance we'll see it this century (by 2100).&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Key Takeaways</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/all-possible-views-about-humanitys-future-are-wild/\">All Possible Views About Humanity's Future Are Wild</a></h3><p>A very rich argument about our galaxy-wide expansion is described in this section. Akin to a fantasy tale narrated by a humble but stern voice, a possibility here is given the spotlight using the method of elimination of lesser odds. What I loved most are the sceptical views, which seem rather criticizing but are actually very true to the nature of how people present their views while in denial. Welcoming conservative view, Holden sternly made clear that our galaxy is empty(at least of intelligent life)</p><hr><h3><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/the-duplicator\">The Duplicator</a></h3><p>It delves into the concept of Digital Human Brains. A Duplicator. Thinking of Shadow Clones of Naruto, this argument by Holden is effectively materialized in my thoughts like VR. The concept is often tackled by the Sci-Fi culture and the writer is aware of their themes. In contrast, this piece centered forecasts skeptical analysis around the economic explosion and productivity feedback loop that can be reactivated by the Duplicators; hopefully, creating solace for the unprivileged economies.</p><p>And sure enough, if such a feat is achieved, space expansion would be urgent.</p><hr><h3><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/how-digital-people-could-change-the-world/\">Digital People Would Be An Even Bigger Deal</a></h3><p>From digital minds, we get digital people.</p><p>This piece discusses in detail the raw concept of the existence of intelligent beings besides humans both as a source of advancement and/or a challenge to overcome. The implication of mind uploading is the central theme here and evidently so if considered in 2022. &nbsp;One part that I loved-FAQs, especially the one where a systematic and prolonged argument is written on how digital people would actually survive and get by their lives on earth. The inclusion of their laws, liberty, and other aspects addressed as sentient beings i.e. People. Apart from productivity, one striking aspect(which I still find hard to believe) is the sheer capability of digital people to improve our(Humans\u2019) personal lives by possibly finding answers to the psychological queries humans tend to fail at, provided the necessary set-up. The emergence of digital people (if and when possible) will most likely be coupled with their rapid growth, and further lead us(and them) out of the bounds of the planet. Energy as the supplement, space expansion is ever more likely for self-sufficient digital beings.</p><hr><h3><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/this-cant-go-on\">This Can't Go On</a></h3><p>This piece focuses on the current time we live in, throwing a spotlight on the insane rate of economic growth in recent centuries compared to the ancient ones. Here we analyse the three possible near-future cases. Stagnation, which is least likely. Explosion, which is most likely but heavily dependent on future advancements. And Collapse, which is becoming more and more realistic in current human society. The latter two cases are the direct outputs of scientific advancements.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YCAEDBbskNaAc8XKx/cbnc5dqlyttjpj1gzhj3\" alt=\"Chart of the world economy starting in about 5000 BC. Unlike the previous chart, it looks very jagged and irregular, with the line getting steeper and steeper over time. Instead of a single dotted line projecting more of the same, I have several dotted lines projecting different possible futures.\"></p><hr><h3><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/transformative-ai-timelines-part-1-of-4-what-kind-of-ai/\">Forecasting Transformative AI: What Kind of AI?</a></h3><p>Then we analyze, a collection of 4 pieces, all focusing on transformative AI and getting closer to finding when exactly such a Process for Automating Scientific and Technological Advancement(PASTA) would be ready. Here PASTA is narrower than artificial general intelligence. 1st piece discusses the roots of AI from basic programming to machine learning(ML). A brief study on how artificial neural networks involve a train of trial and error to make ML grow and learn. PASTA would use ML as a building block, but later surpass the likes of AlphaZero. In detail, we study the impact of such a process on our growth rate; a rapid technological boon or a fateful misaligned AI overpowering the outnumbered humans. Such a system is predicted to grow differently with each iteration/multiplication, having varying human controls.</p><hr><h3><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/forecasting-transformative-ai-whats-the-burden-of-proof/\">Forecasting Transformative AI: What's The Burden Of Proof?</a></h3><p>Next, we look at how and why the proofs of current forecasting come with mixed(often negative) feedback. Holden walks through various angles and multiple probabilities to address scenarios based on prior studies, claims, analyses and even unsuccessful theories. Here, we note that the current rate of development and several other trajectories are in line with one involving the development of a PASTA-like system, and expert opinions in AI will only increase in the coming decades to support and likely update this hypothesis.</p><hr><h3><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/are-we-trending-toward-transformative-ai-how-would-we-know/\">Forecasting Transformative AI: Are We \"Trending Toward\" Transformative AI?</a></h3><p>Next, we question the hype of AI and try to map it to the current technology trends. Here Holden describes how his analogies work and compares the growth towards transformative AI with some of the most known(and evident) patterns of Covid-19, Greenhouse emissions, etc. Subjective extrapolations are key to projecting AI&nbsp; effectiveness in years to come. Here we correlated AI to varied human capabilities and map their forecasting based on the existing trends in the scientific space w.r.t cost of development and size of AI models.</p><hr><h3><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/forecasting-transformative-ai-the-biological-anchors-method-in-a-nutshell/\">Forecasting Transformative AI: The \"Biological Anchors\" Method In A Nutshell</a></h3><p>Then we explored how various experts predict their timelines of transformative AI arrival and on what they think it depends. Here, in line with a researcher-wide&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08807.pdf\"><u>Grace et al 2017</u></a> survey, the probability estimates come out to be on the same path as Holden\u2019s. Another forecasting of Transformative AI is shown with the help of Bio Anchors. This involves AI processing and development directly in comparison with the human brain and estimating the upper limit of cost and time to achieve such a scenario. &nbsp;This piece also deals with various critiques and takes on adapting the biological route. Although the Bio Anchor analysis comes out to be fully consistent with the AI concept scaled to the human brain, polar opposite reactions exist in most of the feedback received yet.</p><hr><h3><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/where-ai-forecasting-stands-today/\">AI Timelines: Where The Arguments, And The \"Experts,\" Stand</a></h3><p>This piece reflects on the absence of a solid consensus among the experts when it comes to predicting something like a PASTA. Here, Holden consolidates all other forecastings on the topic and addresses the reasons behind the skepticism acknowledgment and uncertainties. The best part about this piece(and probably the entire study) is the acknowledgement of Cunningham\u2019s law, which encourages seeking the right answer after predicting a wrong answer. The writer highlights here why such a procedure is key for AI forecasting.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/making-the-best-of-the-most-important-century/\">How To Make The Best Of The Most Important Century?</a></p><p>Perhaps the most relatable piece of the series, it argues that we, the people will be decided how the near future is shaped through AI. The writer presents two frames of consideration here-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/making-the-best-of-the-most-important-century/#the-caution-frame\"><u>Caution</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/making-the-best-of-the-most-important-century/#the-competition-frame\"><u>Competition</u></a>, with examples of necessary actions for consideration.&nbsp;</p><p>In the cautionary frame, we discuss the worst of the possibilities from Misaligned AI and its adversarial maturity to the best ones like a scenario for better negotiations and governance, and the idea of reflection on the strides we are going to make toward major AI goals.</p><p>In the competitive frame, we discuss how the scale of Transformative AI may lead to an international contest of power-grab. Holden also highlights, how the current world, with all its faults and glory, tends to incline towards it out of social stigma and national insecurities.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/call-to-vigilance/\">Call To Vigilance</a></p><p>In the last part, the writer urges a call for \u2018vigilance\u2019 rather than \u2018action\u2019 in an attempt to prevent temporary impulsive actions.

In the linked document, we argue that the invention of artificial general intelligence (AGI) could change this by making extreme types of lock-in technologically feasible. In particular, we argue that AGI would make it technologically feasible to (i) perfectly preserve nuanced specifications of a wide variety of values or goals far into the future, and (ii) develop AGI-based institutions that would (with high probability) competently pursue any such values for at least millions, and plausibly trillions, of years.</p><p>The rest of this post contains the summary (6 pages), with links to relevant sections of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkLFhxixWdT5peJHq4rfFzq4QbHyfZtANH1nou68q88/edit#\">the main document</a> (40 pages) for readers who want more details.</p><h3>0.0 The claim</h3><p>Life on Earth could survive for millions of years. Life in space could plausibly survive for trillions of years. What will happen to intelligent life during this time? Some possible claims are:</p><p>A. Humanity will almost certainly go extinct in the next million years.</p><p>B. Under Darwinian pressures, intelligent life will spread throughout the stars and rapidly evolve toward maximal reproductive fitness.</p><p>C. Through moral reflection, intelligent life will reliably be driven to pursue some specific \u201chigher\u201d (non-reproductive) goal, such as maximizing the happiness of all creatures.</p><p>D. The choices of intelligent life are deeply, fundamentally uncertain. It will at no point be predictable what intelligent beings will choose to do in the following 1000 years.</p><p>E. It is possible to stabilize many features of society for millions or trillions of years. But it is possible to stabilize them into many different shapes \u2014 so civilization\u2019s long-term behavior is contingent on what happens early on.</p><p>Claims A-C assert that the future is basically determined today.&nbsp; Claim D asserts that the future is, and will remain, undetermined. In this document, we argue for claim E: Some of the most important features of the future of intelligent life are currently undetermined but could&nbsp;<i>become</i> determined relatively soon (relative to the trillions of years life could last).</p><p>In particular, our main claim is that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkLFhxixWdT5peJHq4rfFzq4QbHyfZtANH1nou68q88/edit#heading=h.6psumlkrltri\"><u>artificial general intelligence (AGI)</u></a> will make it technologically feasible to construct long-lived institutions pursuing a wide variety of possible goals<strong>.</strong> We can break this into three assertions, all conditional on the availability of AGI:</p><ol><li>It will be possible to preserve highly nuanced specifications of values and goals far into the future, without losing any information.</li><li>With sufficient investments, it will be feasible to develop AGI-based institutions that (with high probability) competently and faithfully pursue any such values until an external source stops them, or until the values in question imply that they should stop.</li><li>If a large majority of the world\u2019s economic and military powers agreed to set-up such an institution, and bestowed it with the power to defend itself against external threats, that institution could pursue its agenda for at least millions of years (and perhaps for trillions).</li></ol><p>Note that we\u2019re mostly making claims about&nbsp;<i>feasibility</i> as opposed to&nbsp;<i>likelihood</i>. We only briefly discuss whether people would&nbsp;<i>want</i> to do something like this in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkLFhxixWdT5peJHq4rfFzq4QbHyfZtANH1nou68q88/edit#heading=h.17f05s8r0u3q\"><u>Section 2.2</u></a>.</p><p>(Relatedly, even though the possibility of stability implies E, in the top list, there could still be a&nbsp;<i>strong tendency</i> towards worlds described by one of the other options A-D. In practice, we think D seems unlikely, but that you could make reasonable arguments that any of the end-points described by A, B, or C are probable.)</p><p>Why are we interested in this set of claims? There are a few different reasons:</p><ul><li>The possibility of stable institutions could pose an existential risk, if they implemented poorly chosen and insufficiently flexible values.</li><li>On the other hand, if we want humane values or institutions such as liberal democracy to survive in the long-run, some types of stability may be crucial for preserving them.</li><li>The possibility of ultra-stable institutions pursuing any of a wide variety of values, and the seeming generality of the methods that underlie them, suggest that significant influence over the long-run future is possible. This should inspire careful reflection on how to make it as good as possible.</li></ul><p>We will now go over claims 1., 2., and 3., from above in more detail.</p><h3>0.1 Preserving information</h3><p>In the beginning of human civilization, the only way of preserving information was to pass it down from generation to generation, with inevitable corruption along the way. The invention of writing significantly boosted civilizational memory, but writing has relatively low bandwidth. By contrast, the invention of AGI would enable the preservation of entire minds. With&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/brain-emulation-roadmap-report.pdf\"><u>whole-brain emulation</u></a> (WBE), we could preserve entire human minds, and ask them what they would think about future choices. Even without WBE, we could preserve newly designed AGI minds that would give (mostly) unambiguous judgments of novel situations. (See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkLFhxixWdT5peJHq4rfFzq4QbHyfZtANH1nou68q88/edit#heading=h.pmw2wdlubtb4\"><u>section 4.1</u></a>.)</p><p>Such systems could encode information about a wide variety of goals and values, for example:</p><ul><li>Ensure that future civilisational decisions are made democratically.</li><li>Enforce a ban on certain weapons of mass destruction (WMD)</li><li>Make sure that reverence is paid to some particular religion.</li><li>Always do what some particular group of humans would have wanted.</li></ul><p>Crucially, using digital error correction, it would be extremely unlikely that errors would be introduced even across millions or billions of years. (See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkLFhxixWdT5peJHq4rfFzq4QbHyfZtANH1nou68q88/edit#heading=h.z2yla55u8vbn\"><u>section 4.2</u></a>.) Furthermore, values could be stored redundantly across many different locations, so that no local accident could destroy them. Wiping them all out would require either (i) a worldwide catastrophe, or (ii) intentional action. (See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkLFhxixWdT5peJHq4rfFzq4QbHyfZtANH1nou68q88/edit#heading=h.rix5eili69lw\"><u>section 4.3</u></a>.)</p><h3>0.2 Executing intentions</h3><p>So let\u2019s say that we can store nuanced sets of values. Would it be possible to design an institution that stays motivated to act according to those values?</p><p>Today, tasks can only be delegated to humans, whose goals and desires often differ from the goals of the delegator. With AGI, all tasks necessary for an institution's survival could instead be automated, performed by artificial minds instead of biological humans. We will discuss the following 2 questions:</p><ul><li>Will it be possible to construct AGI systems that (with high probability) are aligned with the intended values?</li><li>Will such systems stay aligned even over long periods of time?</li></ul><p><strong>0.2.1 Aligning AGI</strong></p><p>Currently, humanity knows less about how to predict and control the behavior of advanced AI systems than about predicting and controlling the behavior of humans. The problem of how to control the behaviors and intentions of AI is commonly known as&nbsp;<i>the alignment problem</i>, and we do not yet have a solution to it.</p><p>However, there are reasons why it could eventually be far more robust to delegate problems to AGI, than to rely on (biological) humans:</p><ul><li>With sufficient understanding of how to induce particular goals, AI systems could be designed to more single-mindedly optimize for the intended goal, whereas most humans will always have some other desires, e.g. survival, status, or sexuality.</li><li>AI behavior can be thoroughly tested in numerous simulated situations, including high-stakes situations designed to elicit problematic behavior.</li><li>AI systems could be designed for interpretability, perhaps allowing developers and supervisors to directly read their thoughts, and to directly understand how it would behave in a wide class of scenarios.</li></ul><p>Thus, we suspect that an adequate solution to AI alignment could be achieved given sufficient time and effort. (Though whether that will actually happen is a different question, not addressed since our focus is on feasibility rather than likelihood.)</p><p>Note also that if we&nbsp;<i>don\u2019t</i> make substantial progress on the alignment problem, but still keep building more AI systems that are more capable and more numerous, this could eventually lead to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/ai-could-defeat-all-of-us-combined/\"><u>permanent human disempowerment</u></a>. In other words, if this particular step of the argument doesn\u2019t go through, the alternative is probably not a business-as-usual human world (without the possibility of stable institutions), but instead a future where misaligned AI systems are ruling the world.&nbsp;</p><p>(For more, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkLFhxixWdT5peJHq4rfFzq4QbHyfZtANH1nou68q88/edit#heading=h.mgr1dawfh1eu\"><u>section 5</u></a>.)</p><p><strong>0.2.2 Preventing drift</strong></p><p>As mentioned in&nbsp;section 0.1, digital error correction could be used to losslessly preserve the information content of values. But this doesn\u2019t entirely remove the possibility of value-drift.</p><p>In order to pursue goals, AGI systems need to learn many facts about the world and update their heuristics of how to deal with new challenges and local contexts. Perhaps it will be possible to design AGI systems with goals that are cleanly separated from the rest of their cognition (e.g. as an explicit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationality-normative-utility/#OutUti\"><u>utility function</u></a>), such that learning new facts and heuristics doesn\u2019t change the systems\u2019 values. But the one example of general intelligence we have \u2014 humans \u2014 instead seem to store their values as a distributed combination of many heuristics, intuitions, and patterns of thought. If the same is true for AGI, it is hard to be confident that new experiences would not occasionally cause their values to shift.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, although it\u2019s not clear how much of a concern this will be, we will discuss how an institution might prevent drift&nbsp;<i>even if</i> individual AI systems sometimes changed their goals. Possible options include:</p><ul><li>Whenever there\u2019s uncertainty about what to do in a novel situation, or a high-stakes decision needs to be made, the institution could boot-up a completely-reset version of an AI system (or a brain emulation) that acts according to the original values.<ul><li>This system will have had no previous chance of value-drift, and so only needs to be informed about anything that is a prerequisite for judging the situation.</li><li>In order to reduce contingency from how these prerequisites are learned, the institution could bring back multiple copies and inform them in different ways \u2014&nbsp;and also let some of the copies opine on how to inform the other copies. And then have them all discuss what the right option is.</li></ul></li><li>AI systems designed to execute particular tasks could be motivated to do whatever the more thorough process would recommend. They could be extremely well-tested on the types of situations that most frequently come up while performing that task.<ul><li>For any tasks that didn\u2019t require high context over a long period of time, they could be frequently reset back to a well-tested state.</li><li>If the task did require a larger amount of context over a longer period of time, they could be supervised and frequently re-tested by other AI systems with less context. These may not be able to correctly identify the value of the supervisee\u2019s every action, but they could prevent the supervisee from performing any catastrophic actions. (Especially with access to transparency tools that allow for effective mind-reading.)</li></ul></li><li>Value drift that is effectively random could be eliminated by having a large number of AI systems with slightly-different backgrounds make an independent judgment about what the right decision is, and take the majority vote.</li></ul><p>Some of these options might reveal inputs where AI systems systematically behave badly, or where it\u2019s not clear if they\u2019re behaving well or badly. For example, they might:</p><ul><li>endorse options that less-informed versions of themselves disagree strongly with,</li><li>have irresolvable disagreements with AI systems which have somewhat different previous experiences,</li><li>exhibit thought-patterns (detected with transparency tools) that show doubt about the institutions\u2019 original principles.</li></ul><p>In most cases, it is probably the case that the reason for the discrepancy could be identified, and the AI design could be modified to act as desired. But it\u2019s worth noting that&nbsp;<i>even</i> in situations where it remains unclear what the desired behavior is, or in situations where it\u2019s somehow difficult to design a system that responds in the desired way, a sufficiently conservative institution could simply opt to prevent AI systems from being exposed to inputs like that (picking some sub-optimal but non-catastrophic resolution to any dilemmas that can\u2019t be properly considered without those inputs).</p><ul><li>An extreme version of this would be to prevent all reasoning that could plausibly lead to value-drift, halting progress in philosophy.<ul><li>It doesn\u2019t seem impossible that all philosophically ambitious institutions would eventually converge to some very similar set of behavior, from a very wide range of starting points. This might be the case if some form of moral realism holds, or perhaps if something like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/msr\"><u>Evidential Cooperation in Large Worlds</u></a> works. If this were the case, our claim that it\u2019s feasible to stabilize many different value-systems would be false for philosophically ambitious institutions. It would only apply to institutions that refused to conduct some philosophical investigations. (Which we&nbsp;<i>hope</i> wouldn\u2019t be very common.)</li></ul></li><li>A further extreme would be for the institution to also halt technological progress and societal progress in general (insofar as it had the power to do that) to avoid any situation where the original values can\u2019t give an unambiguous judgment.<ul><li>This would largely eliminate the issue motivating this subsection \u2014 that continual learning could lead to value drift \u2014 since complete stagnation wouldn\u2019t require much in the way of continual learning.</li><li>But depending on&nbsp;<i>when</i> technological progress was halted, this could limit the institution's ability to survive in other ways, e.g. by preventing it from leaving Earth before its doom.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Given all these options, it seems more likely than not that an institution could practically eliminate any internal sources of drift that it wanted to. (For more, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkLFhxixWdT5peJHq4rfFzq4QbHyfZtANH1nou68q88/edit#heading=h.i0a3afz1g4wa\"><u>section 6</u></a>.)</p><h3>0.3 Preventing disruption</h3><p>So let\u2019s say that it will remain mostly-unambiguous what an institution is&nbsp;<i>supposed</i> to do, in any given situation, and furthermore that the institution will keep being motivated to act that way.</p><p>Now, let\u2019s consider a situation where this institution \u2014&nbsp;at least temporarily \u2014 has uncontested military and economic dominance (let\u2019s call this a \u201cdominant institution\u201d). Let\u2019s also say that the institution\u2019s goals include a consequentialist drive to maintain that dominance (at least instrumentally). Could the institution do this? On our best guess, the answer would be \u201cyes\u201d (with exceptions for encountering alien civilizations, and for the eventual end of usable resources).</p><p>Any resources, information, and agents necessary for the institution\u2019s survival could be copied and stored redundantly across the Earth (and, eventually, other planets). Thus, in order to prevent the institution from rebuilding, an event would need to be global in scope.&nbsp;</p><p>As we argue in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkLFhxixWdT5peJHq4rfFzq4QbHyfZtANH1nou68q88/edit#heading=h.fz5wpzaejvj7\"><u>section 7</u></a><i>, natural</i> events of civilization-threatening magnitude are rare, and the main mechanism they have to pose a global threat to&nbsp;<i>human</i> civilization is that they would throw up enough dust to blot out the sun for a few years. A well-prepared AI civilization could easily survive such events by having energy sources that don\u2019t depend on the sun. In a few billion years, the expansion of the Sun will prevent further life on Earth, but a technologically sophisticated stable institution could avoid destruction by spreading to space.</p><p>As we argue in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkLFhxixWdT5peJHq4rfFzq4QbHyfZtANH1nou68q88/edit#heading=h.25oxsyshlmp5\"><u>section 8</u></a>, a dominant institution could also prevent other intelligent actors from disrupting the institution. Uncontested economic dominance would allow the institution to manufacture and control loyal AGI systems that far outnumber any humans or non-loyal AI systems. Thus, insofar as any other actors could pose a threat, it would be economically cheap to surveil them as much as necessary to suppress that possibility. In practice, this could plausibly just involve enough surveillance to:</p><ul><li>prevent others from building weapons of mass destruction,</li><li>prevent others from building a competitive institution of similar economic or military strength, and</li><li>prevent others from leaving the institution\u2019s domain by colonizing uninhabited parts of space.</li></ul><p>The main exception to this is alien civilizations, which could at first contact already be more powerful than the Earth-originating institution.</p><p>Ultimately, the main boundaries to a stable, dominant institution would be (i) alien civilizations, (ii) the eventual end of accessible resources predicted by the second law of thermodynamics, and (iii) any disruptive Universe-wide physical events (such as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Rip\"><u>Big Rip</u></a> scenario), although to our knowledge no such events are predicted by standard cosmology.</p><h3>0.4 Some things we don\u2019t argue for</h3><p>To be clear, here are two things that we&nbsp;<i>don\u2019t</i> argue for:</p><p>First, we don\u2019t think that the future is&nbsp;<i>necessarily</i> very contingent, from where we stand today. For example, it might be the case that almost no humans would make an ultra-stable institution that pursues a goal that those humans themselves couldn\u2019t later change (if they changed their mind). And it might be the case that most humans would eventually end up with fairly similar ideas about what is good to do, after thinking about it for a sufficiently long time.</p><p>Second, we don\u2019t think that extreme stability (of the sort that could make the future contingent on early events) would necessarily require a lot of dedicated effort. The options for increasing stability we sketch in sections 0.2.2 and 6 and the assumption of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/fut/singleton\"><u>singleton</u></a>-like entity in sections 0.3 and 8 are brought up to make the point that stability is feasible&nbsp;<i>at least</i> in those circumstances. It seems plausible that they wouldn\u2019t be necessary in practice. Perhaps stability will only require a smaller amount of effort. Perhaps the world\u2019s values would stabilize&nbsp;<i>by default</i> given the (not very unlikely) combination of:</p><ul><li>technological maturity (preventing new technologies from shaking things up),</li><li>human immortality (reducing drift from generational changes),&nbsp;</li><li>the ability to cheaply and stably align AGI systems with any goal, and</li><li>such AI systems being equally good at pursuing instrumental goals regardless of what terminal goals they have.

The Further Considerations section may provide additional value.</p><p>For those who are less familiar with these areas, the first couple of sections may provide you with useful context into the problem and relevant research.</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>In the context of animal ethics, and particularly the suffering of animals raised for food, the small animal replacement problem is the concerning situation where people stop eating larger animals and instead replace that consumption by eating smaller animals, resulting in the suffering and death of many more animals.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpuieejgmoi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpuieejgmoi\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(For example, people who stop eating cows and pigs and instead eat chickens and fish will end up being responsible for the deaths of many more animals.) For good reason, many animal advocates have started to take the small animal replacement problem into account in their work to try to ensure that this situation doesn't happen.</p><p>But, the small animal replacement problem assumes that when people switch from eating larger animals to eating smaller animals, nothing else has changed in their beliefs or attitudes towards animals. In many cases, this assumption may be true. However, under the situation of moral circle expansion, this switch might be exactly what we would expect to see\u2014the elimination of eating mammals first, followed by birds, followed by fish and other animals, roughly in the order of evolutionary similarity to humans and proximity to humans\u2014and thus this progressive elimination (and replacement) might indicate psychological ethical progress. In the short-term, this replacement would result in an increase in the number of animals killed and eaten for food, but in the long-term this is the trajectory we might expect to see on the way towards the moral inclusion of animals in our societies. In fact, there is some evidence that this kind of progressive elimination may be the method that works the best with our human psychologies to get someone to move towards eliminating consumption of animals, with would make replacement an unfortunate but necessary step.</p><p>Combined, the implications of current research show that we should at least consider the possible benefits of moving society through a moral circle expansion that humans are naturally inclined to, or to think about the potential costs and difficulties of advocating for animals in a different order.</p><p><strong>For animal advocates, some recommendations might be this:</strong></p><p>(Note: these are copied from the Conclusion.)</p><ol><li>Continue trying to reduce replacement risks where possible in the actions we take.</li><li>When an action with a replacement risk does not appear to coincide with moral circle expansion (or a similar longterm benefit), then reconsider taking that action at all.</li><li>When an action with a replacement risk <i>does</i> appear to coincide with moral circle expansion, consider the case that short-term replacement may be an unfortunate but psychologically strategic step for humans on the way to their total elimination of eating animals. If you do decide to proceed, then do what you can to move people through the replacement stage as quickly as possible.</li></ol><p>More research is needed into the last recommendation above, especially since that is the new recommendation that is being introduced in this post. But barring further research, it is at least something to take into account.</p><p><strong>When possible, we should still try to prevent replacement.</strong> But we should also be aware of the situation where elimination and small animal replacement are signs of moral circle expansion, and in that situation replacement may be an unfortunate effect on the way towards more complete elimination of eating animals.</p><h1>The Small Animal Replacement Problem</h1><p>When it comes to advocating for farmed animals, it seems like low-hanging fruit to advocate <i>against</i> eating cows. From the climate perspective, raising cows for food is a large source of climate emissions and environmental destruction, and from the health perspective, there are studies that clearly link cow meat consumption with cancer. Plus, cows are mammals, so they share many behaviors, appearances, and expressions with ourselves and other animals who we care about, like dogs, making them easier to empathize with.</p><p>However, advocating <i>against</i> eating cows results in a very big question: what, then, should the person eat instead?</p><p>A common answer in modern society is: chickens. Being vegetarian is relatively uncommon, which means people aren't likely to completely give up eating animals simply because of giving up eating one animal, and pig meat is still classified as \"red meat\" which comes with many of the same health concerns as cow meat. Plus, chickens are cheap to raise and don't have nearly the same environmental emissions that cows and pigs do. Thus, switching from eating cows (or pigs) to chickens starts to seem like a reasonable thing to do.</p><p>Unfortunately, for those of us who consider animal suffering as worthy of consideration, this replacement leads to a lot more suffering, especially taking into account that chickens are raised in some of the worst environments out of all farmed animals. Kelsey Piper at Vox has the numbers: \"And while a cow suffers and is slaughtered to produce around 500 pounds of meat, a chicken produces about four to five pounds of meat. So a switch from beef to chicken is actually a switch from a tough life for one cow to an awful life for around 100 chickens.\"<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkuejon7t0a\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkuejon7t0a\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If someone were to choose to replace their cow consumption with fish, the numbers would be even more staggering (see graph below).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6tssvbz16o3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6tssvbz16o3\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:72.57%\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b1b6eb1cd1c983429c27c72f1d2eacac01e4f6703a7abeda.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b1b6eb1cd1c983429c27c72f1d2eacac01e4f6703a7abeda.png/w_100 100w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b1b6eb1cd1c983429c27c72f1d2eacac01e4f6703a7abeda.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b1b6eb1cd1c983429c27c72f1d2eacac01e4f6703a7abeda.png/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b1b6eb1cd1c983429c27c72f1d2eacac01e4f6703a7abeda.png/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b1b6eb1cd1c983429c27c72f1d2eacac01e4f6703a7abeda.png/w_500 500w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b1b6eb1cd1c983429c27c72f1d2eacac01e4f6703a7abeda.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b1b6eb1cd1c983429c27c72f1d2eacac01e4f6703a7abeda.png/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b1b6eb1cd1c983429c27c72f1d2eacac01e4f6703a7abeda.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b1b6eb1cd1c983429c27c72f1d2eacac01e4f6703a7abeda.png/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b1b6eb1cd1c983429c27c72f1d2eacac01e4f6703a7abeda.png/w_994 994w\"><figcaption>Source:<a href=\"https://countinganimals.com/how-many-animals-does-a-vegetarian-save/\"> How many animals does a vegetarian save? by Counting Animals</a></figcaption></figure><p>Thus, from an animal suffering perspective, advocating against eating cows suddenly seems like a terrible strategy if people are going to start eating more chickens or fish instead. Indeed, we could generalize this by saying that any strategy seems bad if it results in people switching from eating fewer larger animals to more smaller animals (from cows to chickens, from pigs to fish, etc.), especially if the smaller animals are raised in environments that cause more suffering. This general dilemma is known as the small animal replacement problem.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpuieejgmoi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpuieejgmoi\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><h1>Moral Circle Expansion</h1><p>However, this situation becomes more complicated when we consider moral circle expansion.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsa6cuk8cqg8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsa6cuk8cqg8\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>The concept of moral circle expansion has existed for millennia, but it was most recently named and popularized by Peter Singer in his book <i>The Expanding Circle</i>, where he says:</p><blockquote><p>The circle of altruism has broadened from the family and tribe to the nation and race, and we are beginning to recognize that our obligations extend to all human beings. The process should not stop there. In my earlier book, <i>Animal Liberation</i>, I showed that it is as arbitrary to restrict the principle of equal consideration of interests to our own species as it would be to restrict it to our own race. The only justifiable stopping place for the expansion of altruism is the point at which all whose welfare can be affected by our actions are included within the circle of altruism. This means that all beings with the capacity to feel pleasure or pain should be included; we can improve their welfare by increasing their pleasures and diminishing their pains. The expansion of the moral circle should therefore be pushed out until it includes most animals.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrzx5p5sjdcl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrzx5p5sjdcl\">[6]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>If we're just considering animals that we eat, though, which animals come first as the circle grows?</p><h2>Moral Circle Expansion and Farmed Animals</h2><p>Human empathy towards an individual of another species appears to be strongly correlated with how close we are to that species evolutionarily. The further apart we are in evolutionary history, the less empathy we feel.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref55ixhdh9ytj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn55ixhdh9ytj\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Other research shows a similar correlation when looking at shared \"bio-behavioral traits\".<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmfcyktx6eyk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmfcyktx6eyk\">[8]</a></sup></span></p><p>Simply put, humans seem to naturally have more empathy towards other animals who are close to us evolutionarily and similar to us in appearances and behavior. The more dissimilar we get, and the further away evolutionarily, the less empathy we feel.</p><p>If we were to rank the animals that we eat according to similarity to humans, the list would be ordered as follows: cows and pigs (and other mammals), then chickens (and other birds), then fish (and other sea life).</p><p>As we're thinking about moral circle expansion, this is probably also the order most natural to humans when including these species in moral consideration: first, we start to consider cows and pigs as morally worthy of consideration; then chickens and other birds; then fish and other sea life.</p><h2>Moral Circle Expansion and the Replacement Problem</h2><p>It quickly becomes apparent that if we were to stop eating animals in the order of natural human empathy, and we were to replace that consumption by eating animals further down on the empathy scale, then we would be consuming a much larger number of animals and causing much more suffering.</p><p>Additionally, if animal advocates simply try to encourage people to eat less meat or to recognize other animals as worthy of consideration, we may find ourselves in this same situation: if a person chooses to eat less meat, they may start by eliminating cows and pigs from their diet, due to some mixture of moral, health, and environmental reasons. If a person begins the process of bringing other animals into their moral consideration, they will probably start with mammals (like cows and pigs). Thus, even without us explicitly advocating against eating cows and pigs, people might start there anyway.</p><h1>Further Considerations</h1><p>Is there a way around this? Or are we doomed to the necessity of the small animal replacement problem as a required step along the path towards eventually reducing farmed animal suffering as much as possible?</p><p>In this section, we'll explore some of the primary considerations that I think are important when thinking through the small animal replacement problem.</p><h2>People Probably Won't Care About Chickens Before Caring About Cows</h2><p>One of the conundrums with the small animal replacement problem, from an ethical advocacy perspective, is that the research shows that people aren't naturally inclined to expand their moral circles to include chickens and fish before include other mammals like cows and pigs.</p><p>This seems to indicate that if we're trying to persuade people to expand their moral circles, we need to use one of these strategies:</p><ol><li>Make the case for ethical inclusion of mammals <i>first</i>, then chickens and fish (a strategy that may be vulnerable to the small animal replacement problem); or</li><li>Make the case for inclusion for <i>all</i> of these animals simultaneously, such as educating people about the concept of speciesism and its implications.</li></ol><p>What seems like a flawed strategy, however, is trying to advocate for ethical inclusion of chickens and fish <i>first</i>. We can't know for certain that this is a bad strategy without further research, but this hypothesis seems in alignment with current research on how humans empathize with other animals. Anecdotally, it also seems that people frequently give up eating meat in the \"cow/chicken/fish\" order on their way to becoming vegetarian.</p><p>As a hypothesis, consider this\u2014it could be the case that in the long-term, the best strategy for eliminating animal consumption would be to get people to expand their moral circle step by step in the order that humans naturally empathize with other animals, and to move through this progression as quickly as possible, even if that resulted in a period of increased numbers of smaller animals being raised and killed for food. Perhaps it's much easier, given our current society, to advocate for ethical inclusion of cows and pigs; and perhaps it's much easier to advocate for chickens and fish once people have already expanded their moral circles to include other mammals who we've traditionally eaten. If true, this strategy would have negative consequences for smaller animals in the midterm while potentially resulting in less suffering and more lives saved in total. <i>(This is just a hypothesis to illustrate the point\u2014I don't have a strong intuition on the efficacy of this idea, and I'm not aware of research that shows people's progression through these stages.)</i></p><p>If we're not trying to <i>morally</i> persuade people, then this consideration becomes less important\u2014for example, if we're trying to change behavior based on price, health, climate change, etc. Unfortunately, when it comes to many of those other domains, eating chickens instead of cows seems like the reasonable thing to do if we don't also include animal ethics, as we'll discuss in the next consideration.</p><h2>Multiple Pressures Are Pushing People to Eat Smaller Animals Already</h2><p>Even without considering the small animal replacement problem in animal advocacy work, there are already numerous pressures driving people in society to change their consumption, especially in the direction of eating more chickens and fish.</p><p><strong>Environmental pressures\u2014</strong>Raising cows for food is a large driver of climate change, much larger than the climate impact caused by raising chickens. As the climate crisis becomes more urgent in the public's eye, more people might switch to eating more \"climate-friendly\" animals such as chickens.</p><p><strong>Health pressures\u2014</strong>\"Red meat\" (i.e. meat from mammals such as cows and pigs) has been linked to cancer and other health conditions. There has been much health messaging over the past several decades advocating that people switch from eating cows and pigs to eating chickens or fish instead, for health reasons.</p><p><strong>Economic and supply pressures\u2014</strong>At least in the US, chicken consumption has been increasing steadily since around the 1940s. The reasons for the increase include government competitions to breed bigger birds, the growth of chicken science, the short time required to breed multiple generations of chickens (thus allowing faster artificial selection for desirable traits), and World War II rations on red meat, to name a few reasons.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefobl30yp279c\"><sup><a href=\"#fnobl30yp279c\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Fish consumption has also been increasing, with aquaculture (fish farming) responsible for nearly all of the increase in the volume of fish produced (as measured in metric tons, not individual fish).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft7cay69jd9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt7cay69jd9\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:79.12%\"><img src=\"https://cdn.farmjournal.com/s3fs-public/inline-images/meat-consumption2.jpg\"><figcaption><strong>US Per Capita Meat Consumption Over Time.</strong> Source:<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.agweb.com/opinion/drivers-us-capita-meat-consumption-over-last-century\">https://www.agweb.com/opinion/drivers-us-capita-meat-consumption-over-last-century</a></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7d759b14-dd83-49ed-ad84-a95cd519b74d/jwas12619-fig-0001-m.png\"><figcaption><strong>Global production of seafood by production type.</strong> Source: <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jwas.12619\">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jwas.12619</a></figcaption></figure><p>So an important question to ask here is: what are the implications for animal advocacy work if society is <i>already</i> doing this work of replacing larger animals with smaller animals?

And so people still have plenty of opportunity to replace their existing consumption of large animals with even more smaller animals, multiplying the numbers of chickens and fish raised and killed for food\u2014a situation we are trying to avoid.</p><h2>Rather Than Advocating Elimination, Consider Advocating Plant-Based Replacement</h2><p>One potential way to try limiting the downside risks is to advocate for <i>plant-based replacements</i> rather than <i>elimination</i>.</p><p>If, for example, our primary message is to \"stop eating cows\" or \"stop eating animals\", then this framing may be vulnerable to the small animal replacement problem. The animals people are likely to stop eating are the big ones, and due to various societal pressures these people are often more likely to switch to a different animal product rather than a plant-based one.</p><p>If instead, our primary message is to \"replace your beef with beans\" or \"replace your pork with pintos\" (or some other more-expertly crafted message), this framing\u2014if effective (a very important \"if\")\u2014might result in more true animal product elimination and less replacement of large animals for small.</p><h2>If Economic Forces Are a Primary Driver, It Could Make Sense To Focus Predominantly on Chicken and Fish Alt Protein Products</h2><p>There is a compelling case to be made that economic forces will be able to shift society away from consumption of animals much faster than moral advocacy will, and organizations like The Good Food Institute focus exclusively on this space.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0uclfy1d5g1\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0uclfy1d5g1\">[11]</a></sup></span></p><p>For someone who thinks this and who is in the alt protein industry, it could make sense to focus most efforts on the creation of products to replace smaller animals, unless there are reasons why competing on price and taste with these products are significantly harder. All else being equal, an excellent plant-based chicken product that is the same price or cheaper than the animal-based chicken product will spare many more animals than a plant-based cow product, if price and taste are most of what fundamentally matter for most consumption habits.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>This post is not at all meant to dissuade people from taking the small animal problem seriously. It is instead meant to add nuance to the discussion and point out some considerations that we should take into account when planning our strategies.</p><p>Specifically, the theory of moral circle expansion and the research on human empathy towards other animals shows that humans are more likely to empathize with similar animals\u2014such as cows and pigs\u2014before empathizing with animals who are less similar\u2014such as chickens and fish. Cognitive dissonance research also shows us that someone who stops eating cows (for whatever reason) may be more likely to include them in their moral circle, since they don't need to defend their consumption of cows any longer.</p><p>Combined, all of this research should get us to at least consider the possible benefits of moving society through a moral circle expansion that humans are naturally inclined to, or to think about the potential costs and difficulties of advocating for animals in a different order.</p><h2>Final Recommendations</h2><p>For animal advocates, some final recommendations might be this:</p><ol><li>Continue trying to reduce replacement risks where possible in the actions we take.</li><li>When an action with a replacement risk does not appear to coincide with moral circle expansion (or a similar longterm benefit), then reconsider taking that action at all.</li><li>When an action with a replacement risk <i>does</i> appear to coincide with moral circle expansion, consider the case that short-term replacement may be an unfortunate but psychologically strategic step for humans on the way to their total elimination of eating animals. If you do decide to proceed, then do what you can to move people through the replacement stage as quickly as possible.</li></ol><p>More research is needed into the last recommendation above, especially since that is the new recommendation that is being introduced in this post. But barring further research, it is at least something to take into account.</p><h1>Notes</h1><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnpcrdtha375\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefpcrdtha375\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/cause-profile-animal-welfare\">https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/cause-profile-animal-welfare</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnpuieejgmoi\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefpuieejgmoi\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/post/small-animal-replacement-problem\">https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/post/small-animal-replacement-problem</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnsa6cuk8cqg8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefsa6cuk8cqg8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-circle-expansion-1\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-circle-expansion-1</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnkuejon7t0a\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefkuejon7t0a\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22430749/beef-chicken-climate-diet-vegetarian\">https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22430749/beef-chicken-climate-diet-vegetarian</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn6tssvbz16o3\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref6tssvbz16o3\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://countinganimals.com/how-many-animals-does-a-vegetarian-save/\">https://countinganimals.com/how-many-animals-does-a-vegetarian-save/</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnrzx5p5sjdcl\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefrzx5p5sjdcl\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanding_Circle\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanding_Circle</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn55ixhdh9ytj\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref55ixhdh9ytj\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56006-9\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-56006-9</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnmfcyktx6eyk\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefmfcyktx6eyk\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/biohorizons/article/2/2/180/254452\">https://academic.oup.com/biohorizons/article/2/2/180/254452</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnobl30yp279c\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefobl30yp279c\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://firstwefeast.com/features/2016/08/how-chicken-conquered-america/\">https://firstwefeast.com/features/2016/08/how-chicken-conquered-america/</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnt7cay69jd9\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreft7cay69jd9\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jwas.12619\">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jwas.12619</a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn0uclfy1d5g1\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref0uclfy1d5g1\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://gfi.org/\">https://gfi.org/</a></p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Steven Rouk"}}, {"_id": "v2qCBwWiQPeE8K2wK", "title": "PAs in EA: A Brief Guide & FAQ", "postedAt": "2022-10-25T16:16:48.846Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This guide was produced by&nbsp;</i><a href=\"http://pineappleoperations.org\"><i><u>Pineapple Operations</u></i></a><i>; Holly Morgan is the primary author, with support from Jennifer Waldmann and Vaidehi Agarwalla (all mistakes are Holly\u2019s own).&nbsp;</i></p><h2>1.

How much are PAs paid?</h2><p>Some data&nbsp;<i>from early 2022</i> on what EAs were offering can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bzXBZyMrnMiWu2DeF/to-pa-or-not-to-pa#Pay\"><u>here</u></a> (and it was similar to what EA PAs were asking for):&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>For the 5 public ads for full-time PAs that we\u2019ve noticed in EA over the past few months that list starting salaries, the average has been \u00a350,600 (lowest: \u00a330k to \u00a347k; highest: \u00a357k or \u00a377k).</p><p>The rate offered for part-time PA support has varied between \u00a30 and \u00a377 per hour, with \u00a320-40/h being common. The amount varies according to factors such as: number of hours needed, amount of disposable income (most part-time work seems to be paid out of personal pockets), and skills required beyond those needed for typical Virtual Assistant tasks (e.g. data entry, basic Googling).</p></blockquote><p>By comparison, rates for common non-EA VA agencies might range from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://getmagic.com/\"><u>$10/h</u></a> to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NqbQCjKKk69nX42QC/advice-on-how-to-get-a-remote-personal-executive-assistant?commentId=NsAMjxc5A43fgLoKG#comments\"><u>$50/h</u></a>, with the VAs receiving what remains after the agency takes their cut.</p><p>But&nbsp;<strong>negotiate</strong> with each other. And perhaps renegotiate after you\u2019ve spent some time working together.</p><p>Factors you may want to consider when deciding on a rate include:</p><ul><li>The PA\u2019s prior experience / ability to add value</li><li>The client\u2019s budget</li><li>How enjoyable / convenient / useful the PA finds the work</li><li>The rate you feel sustainably comfortable with vs. the rate you could do at a push</li><li>Self-employment expenses (self-employment rates tend to be ~1.5-2x higher than those of full-time employees doing similar work to account for insurance and taxes, periods of sickness / holiday / seeking work, office space and equipment, etc.)</li></ul><h2>6. Is PA work a stepping stone to other work?</h2><p>Some EAs see PA work as a long-term career path for themselves. But we think that many consider PA work primarily a stepping stone to more senior roles in EA, either with the same individual/organisation or elsewhere. Where this is the case, we strongly encourage PAs to&nbsp;<strong>be upfront</strong> about this before agreeing to work together and to give their clients an honest estimate of how long they expect to stay in the role.</p><p>Onboarding is an investment, so it\u2019s important to think about how long it might take for the working relationship to become net useful to the client. This will vary according to the nature of the tasks, prior delegation/PA experience, how many hours a week the PA works, etc. We have heard the following estimates from the EA community so far:</p><ul><li>From a Research/Personal Assistant: \u201cMy guess is that it took me&nbsp;<strong>\u2248 4 months to become net useful</strong>\u201d</li><li>From someone who has a Research/Personal Assistant: \u201cmy assistant became net useful to me very quickly, after&nbsp;<strong>a few weeks</strong>\u201d</li><li>From someone who hired a full-time PA: in conversation, they gave the estimate of&nbsp;<strong>a couple of weeks</strong></li><li>From someone who hired a full-time PA: in conversation, they said that the PA helped them free up time&nbsp;<strong>right away</strong></li></ul><p>A few more thoughts&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bzXBZyMrnMiWu2DeF/to-pa-or-not-to-pa#Career_progression\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><h2>7. Do EAs or non-EAs make better PAs?</h2><p>It depends. As mentioned above, we think that many EAs will only be interested in short-/medium-term PA roles (although the idea is that you\u2019ve partially helped to train/trial them for more senior roles with you or someone with similar goals to you, so it\u2019s not a total loss when they leave). But there are other ways in which EAs may prove&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bzXBZyMrnMiWu2DeF/to-pa-or-not-to-pa#Demand\"><u>more helpful</u></a>.</p><h2>8.

How can we create and sustain a happy, productive working relationship?</h2><h3>Communicate.</h3><p>These relationships tend to require an unusually high level of communication because:</p><ul><li>There\u2019s more delegating to be done - the work is usually a series of relatively independent tasks rather than broad areas of responsibility with a lot of autonomy</li><li>PAs tend to work remotely, which makes it harder to ask quick questions</li><li>PAs tend to be part-time contractors and therefore miss out on a lot of the background info and support that comes from being embedded in an organisation</li></ul><p>Helpful things to discuss at the start:</p><ol><li>Each other\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/user-manual-to-me-92c8ce68f960\"><strong><u>working styles</u></strong></a>, e.g.:<ol><li>What do you value most at work? What irritates you?</li><li>How can people tell when you\u2019re stressed and support you?</li><li>What things do you struggle with at work?</li><li>How do you like to receive feedback?</li><li>What might people misunderstand about you?</li><li>What are your broad career goals?</li></ol></li><li>If there is anything the PA should read or be given access to that could provide useful&nbsp;<strong>context</strong> and help answer their questions (e.g. a Slack workspace to search for relevant info and communicate with the client\u2019s colleagues if needed)</li><li>If there is anything the PA is&nbsp;<strong>not prepared</strong> to do (e.g. particularly unglamourous work) or would find particularly stressful (e.g. dealing with finances)</li><li><strong>Communication habits</strong> going forward:<ol><li>Messaging platforms, e.g. Slack by default / WhatsApp if urgent</li><li>Task management tools, e.g. Slack threads, Google Docs, or dedicated apps</li><li>Whether to have regular check-in calls (we\u2019d suggest at least monthly to maintain good rapport and to act as a default space for exchanging feedback)</li></ol></li></ol><h3>Continuing to communicate</h3><ol><li>You should usually expect a fair amount of&nbsp;<strong>figuring things out as you go</strong> and being adaptable according to each other\u2019s needs and evolving situations.</li><li>When exchanging feedback, don\u2019t forget:<ol><li><strong>Communication</strong>, e.g. there\u2019ll be some trial and error to find the balance between over- and under-communicating (and note that more communication is needed early on before you\u2019re familiar with each other\u2019s ways of working)</li><li><strong>Boundaries</strong> - performing a service-oriented role in a maximisation-focused community risks burnout, so check that the PA isn\u2019t feeling overwhelmed</li><li><strong>Positive feedback</strong> - the PA is relying solely on one person for recognition for their efforts</li></ol></li></ol><h3>Tips for clients</h3><ol><li>From Peter Wildeford\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dpjCwMwKEPqK3TPnC/notes-on-managing-to-change-the-world#Delegating_Projects\"><u>notes</u></a> on the book&nbsp;<i>Managing to Change the World</i>:<ol><li>\u201cThe best way to ensure delegation goes successfully is to (1) be clear from the start about what you expect, (2) stay engaged enough along the way to make sure you and the employees are on the same page and to ensure the ongoing quality of the work, and (3) hold people accountable for what they deliver.&nbsp;<strong>Management problems</strong> that appear to be personal issues with a bad employee are much more likely to be about issues with expectations and communication.\u201d</li></ol></li><li>When delegating, remember to include how&nbsp;<strong>soon</strong> you\u2019d like the task completed</li><li>For many tasks, a good way to start is simply to&nbsp;<strong>do the task in front of your PA</strong>, explaining why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing as you go</li></ol><h3>Tips for PAs</h3><ol><li>Some excellent tips on emails/messages that&nbsp;<strong>respect your client\u2019s time</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.managementcenter.org/article/the-secret-to-getting-replies-to-your-emails-the-one-hand-test/\"><u>here</u></a> (and some good tips&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dHHuEYdbMqBf2deyj/using-the-executive-summary-style-writing-that-respects-your#Concrete_recommendations\"><u>here</u></a>)</li><li>It\u2019s often very helpful to say&nbsp;<strong>when/whether</strong> you expect to complete a task, give updates if that changes, and say when the task is done (at least keep track of what has and hasn\u2019t been done somewhere your client can access)</li><li>Make the most of your client\u2019s attention while you have it to minimise their context switching, e.g.&nbsp;<strong>batch communication</strong> where possible and if you notice a message come in when you\u2019re free, reply immediately with your answer or any questions you have</li><li>Be prepared to sometimes have to&nbsp;<strong>act on little information</strong> if your client is too busy to talk (one Executive Assistant told us \u201cI felt like I had to be psychic with [Vice Presidents]\u201d), but if you feel like they should be communicating more, check in with them about whether they think they\u2019re getting the balance right</li><li>If you\u2019re new to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/\"><strong><u>effective altruism</u></strong></a><strong> culture</strong>:<ol><li>You may want to skim this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/handbook\"><u>intro handbook</u></a> and look up any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/all\"><u>jargon</u></a></li><li>If you\u2019re familiar with academic, startup, or activist culture, you may notice similarities (e.g. intellectualism, adaptability, and collaboration, respectively)</li><li>The culture is also inevitably influenced by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ThdR8FzcfA8wckTJi/ea-survey-2020-demographics\"><u>overrepresented demographics</u></a></li><li>G Suite and Slack are very popular</li><li>There are very high standards for communication being clear,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/duzspoWQrnm8tjC8d/the-value-of-content-density\"><u>content-dense</u></a>, and honest, and people will often communicate their degree of uncertainty about whatever they\u2019re claiming (sometimes marked \u201cepistemic status\u201d)</li></ol></li></ol><hr><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667996097/mirroredImages/v2qCBwWiQPeE8K2wK/kazq8ivlhez3zr9iqkek.png\"></p><p><i>This guide was produced by&nbsp;</i><a href=\"http://pineappleoperations.org\"><i><u>Pineapple Operations</u></i></a><i>; Holly Morgan is the primary author, with support from Jennifer Waldmann,Vaidehi Agarwalla and Alexandra Malikova (all mistakes are Holly\u2019s own).

My problem is not that there's nothing good to read, but that there is so much to plow through to find what's best for me.</p><p>Also, it's sad to see great posts receive so little attention, the moment after they are pushed off the frontpage.
