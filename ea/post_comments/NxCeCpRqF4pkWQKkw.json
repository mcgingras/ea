If we instead use 1993, OWID suggests a denominator of 321m, and hence an increase of only 35%, which does not seem like 'nearly twice'. It is literally closer to 'no change' than 'twice'.</p><p>Thirdly, I am curious as to the source for this 2023 figure. Traditionally macroeconomic data is only published with a lag; the BEA doesn't produce even its initial estimate of GDP for almost a month after the quarter, and the final version is months later. Similarly US corporations with sophisticated accounting software and complete control of their activities won't release their figures for over a month after the quarter closes. Given the difficulties collecting data in Sub-Saharan Africa, it is very surprising to me that the 2023 figure is already available. <a href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/15210375/\">Your source</a> in turn lists two sources.</p><p>One of these sources is <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/server/api/core/bitstreams/0a750f57-7b86-54ca-8fb0-180e8f6f6ecd/content\">this 2022 paper</a> about the covid impact, which does not contain 2023 data. It uses surveys done in 2020, though for Sub-Saharan Africa these phone surveys do not even directly ask about income or consumption, which had to be imputed:</p><blockquote><p>While the phone surveys provide information on whether households gained or lost income or consumption since the beginning of the pandemic, <strong>they do not contain information on households\u2019 level of income or consumption</strong>, nor do they report the size of the change in income or consumption. [emphasis added]</p></blockquote><p>The second source is to the<a href=\"https://pip.worldbank.org/home\"> World Bank Poverty and Inequality platform</a>. There are a lot of datasets here, and I admit I haven't looked through them all. But the most prominently displayed chart is one showing the number of people living on under $2.15/day PPP, <i>and it only goes up to 2019</i>.</p><p>I think what the chart you are using is doing is relying on the approach described <a href=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/poverty-back-pre-covid-levels-globally-not-low-income-countries\">in this paper</a>, which uses GDP growth to impute the numbers needed to apply the methodology described in the 2022 paper. Even though GDP/Capita has been growing for Sub-Saharan Africa, this still produces suggests a growing number of people in poverty, presumably because their population growth is so high.&nbsp;</p><p>But this approach seems... quite dubious to me. They are using 2023 (a year that is not yet over) GDP (a statistic which takes months to compile) figures for Sub-Saharan Africa (a region notorious for poor data quality) to extrapolate the values from an earlier paper (which was itself based on imputing the figures using phone surveys that did not ask the question directly).</p><p>In general I have a lot of faith in OWID.

Also short term thinking is a big problem.</p>\n<p>Even just prioritising urgent over important is a massive and understandable issue. For example sending kids to school in Uganda is so highly valued, yet most people can't send all their kids to school (especially once some reach high school age) so every shilling could be spent there alone. Then there are medical fees, cultural events like funerals and weddings which are highly prioritized, bride prices etc. In this context making the decision to spend 3 to 5 dollars on a mosquito net is no joke.</p>\n<p>There's also the issue now with nets specifically that they are seen as a \"free\" item,  because they normally are, given away every few years.

Even if we shifted everyone in Sub-Saharan Africa up to $2.16 per day, that would not be a satisfactory situation. Many people above the extreme poverty line are still in serious poverty. I think the goal should be to increase living standards across the board in poor countries, i.e. we need to increase economic growth in poor countries. Direct cash transfers are not plausibly among the top ways to increase economic growth in poor countries. The main predictor of extreme poverty rates in a country is the median income of that country. No country has ever eliminated extreme poverty through cash transfers. The main driver has always been broad-based economic growth, which is primarily driven by changes in economic policy, not by direct aid.&nbsp;</li><li>If we abandon the goal of minimising extreme poverty, then I think it becomes clear that direct cash transfers are not the best way to improve the living standards of people in developing countries. Around <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/DT.ODA.ALLD.CD\">$200 billion</a> is spent on international aid each year, about $550 million per day. Around 690 million people are in extreme poverty. If we assume that all of the people in extreme poverty are on $1 per day and we spent all international development aid on cash transfers to the extreme poor, then we could increase the income of all of the extreme poor by around $1.25 per day. This would eliminate extreme poverty. However, it would also increase the income of the extreme poor to $2.25 per day. I don't think this is an outcome we should be at all happy with, and I think it would be a misuse of resources.&nbsp;</li></ol>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": null}, {"_id": "Noys3Mbux7CWonM3j", "postedAt": "2023-10-17T15:55:45.803Z", "postId": "NxCeCpRqF4pkWQKkw", "htmlBody": "<p>Given that Open Philanthropy seems to believe that typical GiveWell recommendations are dominated by more leveraged ones (e.g.using advocacy, induced technological change) at least for risk-neutral donors, I am a bit confused by the anchoring on GiveWell charities.</p><p>Even if GD were closer to AMF than GiveWell thinks, this would not put GD close to the best thing one can do to improve human welfare unless one applies a very narrow frame (risk-aversion, highly scalable based on existing charities right now).</p><p>Or, put a bit differently:</p><ul><li>(1) We live in a world that has lots of mechanisms in it that make it quite unlikely that something like marginal consumption changes is close to the best use of money -- stuff like public good provision, negative and positive externalities, other market failures, policies, technologies etc. with global ramifications etc.</li><li>(2) Obviously, it is much harder and uncertain to positively shape the trajectory of, say, rapid malaria vaccines, or trade policy, or to positively influence development aid at large, which is why GD is a good fallback for risk-averse donors and a great baseline to exist.</li><li>(3) But it seems extremely unlikely that GiveDirectly is anywhere close to the best thing and it also seems far from clear that pushing the narrative more in the direction of \"let's do more cash transfers\" is good on net, unless one is quite sure that the benefits in explainability and scaleability outweigh the impact differential on a per dollar basis on finding and funding interventions with higher EV.<ul><li>E.g.

I agree that it is set by the World Bank, but I don't agree that means it is not arbitrary.

One piece of evidence for this is historical: for all countries that have ever eliminated extreme poverty, the things that caused that were never cash transfers. Rather, they were usually caused by changes in economic policy.&nbsp;<ul><li>On the example of Rwanda. GDP per capita in Rwanda is around <a href=\"https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/bae48ff2fefc5a869546775b3f010735-0500062021/related/mpo-rwa.pdf\">$960 per person</a>, or around $2.60 per day. You say that \"Despite these commendable strides, <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/country/rwanda\">over half</a> of Rwandans still live in extreme poverty.\" Since the average income is $2.60 per day, it is not surprising that more than half of the population lives on less than $2.15 per day. This is an argument for the necessity of economic growth, not an argument for cash transfers.&nbsp;</li><li>Taking your example of China. The thing that caused China to massively reduce extreme poverty was economic liberalisation under Deng, e.g. agricultural liberalisation, international trade etc. Even if they are now, as a middle income country, using cash transfers to reduce extreme poverty, that is not an argument for the claim that in poor countries cash transfers will be more effective than changes in economic policy in reducing extreme poverty, on the current margin. China is the most striking counterexample to that claim in history.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>\"Many countries use cash transfers to eliminate extreme poverty, which economic growth alone will not solve.\" \"we should not expect extreme poverty to \u201csolve itself\u201d overtime through economic growth\"<ul><li>Empirically, this is not correct. The median income in a country ~completely explains levels of extreme poverty in that country. Increasing median income is empirically necessary and sufficient for the elimination of extreme poverty. Very nearly all of the observed variation in extreme poverty rates, on any poverty line, is explained by median income - the R^2 is above 0.98 &nbsp;(<a

This behavioural quirk might explain why people don't always buy bednets even when given cash. Similarly, vaccines are often more likely to be used when provided for free, underscoring the importance of removing cost barriers to accelerate their uptake.</li><li><strong>Economies of scale &amp; availability</strong>: When bednets or vaccines are distributed en masse to an entire region, not only do economies of scale make each unit more cost-effective, but availability also increases. If the purchase of these products were to rely solely on individual decisions made by recipients of cash transfers, there might be insufficient demand to justify large-scale supply, potentially leading to lower availability and higher costs per unit. This contrasts with targeted interventions, where bulk purchasing and distribution can ensure both cost-effectiveness and widespread availability.</li></ol><p>For these reasons I'm very glad that COVID vaccines were provided for free in my country instead of charged for and people given the equivalent amount of cash.</p><p>Cash transfers are a fantastic tool with broad utility but lack the targeted impact that you can get with specific interventions like bednets or vaccines for the reasons above.</p><p>I deeply understand the appeal of cash transfers and the autonomy they offer to recipients and think that they are something that can truly scale but feel like there are compelling and reasonably intuitive reasons for why interventions like providing bednets might be more effective at saving and improving lives.</p>", "parentCommentId": "QghPYcnrtGtE4fh4y", "user": {"username": "Luke Freeman"}}, {"_id": "gNPecX2woT5CvfieD", "postedAt": "2023-10-18T19:11:08.976Z", "postId": "NxCeCpRqF4pkWQKkw", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks, that's helpful context!&nbsp;</p><p>I find it a bit weird - possibly unhelpful - to blend a big picture cause prioritization argument and the promotion of a specific matching campaign. &nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "9BLpKDeM2HXZZSAjx", "user": {"username": "burner"}}, {"_id": "AyaZpbwzNMnQkeyYx", "postedAt": "2023-10-18T20:17:24.985Z", "postId": "NxCeCpRqF4pkWQKkw", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>If the purchase of these products were to rely solely on individual decisions made by recipients of cash transfers, there might be insufficient demand to justify large-scale supply, potentially leading to lower availability and higher costs per unit.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>One might even say that providing complete autonomy of choice between bednets and cash to recipients is impossible at a constant funding level. If one could do a widespread distribution of bednets for $2 a person in an area, it should often be feasible to distribute $2 (less administrative costs) to each person instead. However, if bednets now cost $3 because the efficiencies of mass distribution have been lost, then \"receive a bednet for free\" is no longer something the beneficiary can actualize. In other words, without increasing the funding to allow for \"choose between $2 cash or a $3 bednet,\" replacing bednets with cash doesn't really give those who prefer bednets the freedom to choose bednets.</p>", "parentCommentId": "LRyWfk2hq3HLnWXTG", "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "8eBMvtc2XKCja76Mx", "postedAt": "2023-10-19T01:27:02.806Z", "postId": "NxCeCpRqF4pkWQKkw", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for posting this. As far as agency and dignity, I think there are two potential cruxes here:</p><ul><li>I'd submit that the predominant beneficiary of GiveWell-style programs (like bednet provision) is actually children under 5, not older family members. (At least this is what GiveWell's rationale for the programs would lead us to conclude.) Children under 5 lack agency in the sense that cash vs. bednets would make a difference in their agency. Either way, someone else -- either parents/caregivers or aid workers -- &nbsp;is making the choice of how they benefit from aid for them.&nbsp;<ul><li>There might be reasons to think one or the other substitute decisionmakers would make a better choice for the young child, but the young child's agency and dignity wouldn't seem to be major factors here. Thus, while I think it is right to say that unconditional cash transfers promote agency and dignity, I would not say that bednet provision reduces them.</li></ul></li><li>I can also see agency/dignity tradeoffs when comparing unconditional cash transfers to conditional cash transfers (e.g., cash for vaccinating your child) or what I'll call indirect cash transfers. The former is a strong test case for conditional cash transfers . . . but I think a fair one since it describes a GiveWell top charity. A toy example of the latter would be a program that provided glasses to improve worker productivity, and thus worker salaries.&nbsp;<ul><li>At least in the cash-for-child-vaccination scenario, I would concede that the strings attached slightly reduce parent/caregiver agency and dignity. However, I would suggest the resultant increase in vaccination rates <i>improves </i>young-child agency in two ways. If the child dies from malaria, he or she loses the potential to exercise agency in the future. The same is true to the extent a child has a non-fatal case of malaria that limits his or her future functioning.</li><li>In the eyeglasses toy model, I'm not sure if there is a clear difference between giving someone $5 and giving them a $5 set of eyeglasses that raises their income by $5. On the one hand, in the direct-cash scenario, the beneficiary can choose not to wear glasses and still receive a benefit. On the other hand, some people would experience earning $5 from their work as more dignified than being given $5 as an act of charity. Either way, the beneficiary got $5, whether it was in the form of a check or the form of eyeglasses.</li><li>That toy model is, of course, not very realistic. But it seems plausible that programs could have a public-health effect and a secondary cash effect. The example that comes to mind is <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/nicklaing?mention=user\">@NickLaing</a>'s work with OneDay Health [cost-effectiveness sketch <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XpeamS2yTNhagxAip/remote-health-centers-in-uganda-a-cost-effective\">here</a>, with the COI disclosure that I assisted with parts of it.] While the primary impact is modeled through saving lives of under-5s who would not have counterfactually been treated (or treated early enough), there's a secondary indirect cash effect for patients who would have counterfactually sought care several hours away. Their transportation costs and lost income are lower, which seems equivalent to giving those patients' families a small amount of cash.</li></ul></li><li>All that is to say that it may be possible to conceptualize some other programs as cash-transfer programs with some different positive spillover effects than unconditional cash-transfer programs. That perhaps isn't the fairest mode of analysis to the other programs, whose primary intended effects are being categorized as spillover effects.&nbsp;<ul><li>But it might facilitate comparisons that are <i>slightly </i>more apples-to-apples than merely transforming impact scores using a set of moral weights. Suppose a conditional cash-transfer program moved 65% as much money into recipients' hands than an unconditional one [number totally made up]. We can then think about whether the bundle of positive spillover effects of the conditional program is sufficiently greater than the bundle for the unconditional program to justify the loss in efficiency.</li></ul></li></ul>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "n9orqNjLSvE6NhfKF", "postedAt": "2023-10-19T07:43:27.717Z", "postId": "NxCeCpRqF4pkWQKkw", "htmlBody": "<p>Further to this, one way to visualise this is to look at this <a href=\"https://onehundredhomes.in/the-homes/house/37/category/exterior\">website</a>, which has photos of homes for people in India at different levels of income.
