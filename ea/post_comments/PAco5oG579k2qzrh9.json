After Open Phil matching, this means LTFF now has ~3.3M additional funding and EAIF has ~1.5m in additional funding.<br><br>We are also aware that other large donors, including both individuals and non-OP institutional donors, are considering donating to us. In addition, while some recurring donors have likely moved up their donations to us because of our recent unusually urgent needs, it is likely that we will still accumulate some recurring donations in the coming months as well. Thus, I think at least <i>some</i> of the less-certain sources of funding will come through. However, I decided to conservatively not include them in the estimate above.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>From my (Linch)'s perspective, this means both LTFF nor EAIF are no longer </strong><i><strong>very</strong></i><strong> funding constrained for the time period we wanted to raise money for (the next ~6 months), however both funds are still funding constrained and can productively make good grants with additional funding.</strong></p><p>To be more precise, we estimated a good target spend rate for LTFF is as 1M/month, and a good target spend rate for EAIF as ~800k/month. The current funds will allow LTFF to spend ~550k/month and EAIF to spend ~250k/month, or roughly a gap of 450k/month and 550k/month, respectively. More funding is definitely helpful here, as more money will allow both funds to make productively make good grants<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefofesuci41gg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnofesuci41gg\">[1]</a></sup></span>.<br><br>Open Phil's matching is up to 3.5M from OP (or 1.75M from you) for each fund. This means LTFF would need ~650k more before maxing out on OP matching, and EAIF would need ~1.25M more. Given <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PAco5oG579k2qzrh9/ltff-and-eaif-are-unusually-funding-constrained-right-now#Our_Ask\">my rough estimate of funding needs</a> above, which is ~6.2M/6 months for LTFF and ~5M/6 months for EAIF, this means LTFF would ideally like to receive 1M above the OP matching.&nbsp;</p><p>I appreciate donors' generosity and commitment to improving the world.
