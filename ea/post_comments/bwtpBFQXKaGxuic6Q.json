The ultimate goal is, I'd say, always to find someone with the time and capacity to look into things in depth and with balance, as much as is realistic given the situation.

And probably the community health team should take their names and add it to their list where orgs can ask CH about any potential hires and learn of red flags in their past. I think Alice should def be included on that list, and Chloe should maybe be included (that's the part I'd let the CH team decide if it is was bad enough). It's possible Alice should be revealed publicly, or maybe just revealed to community organizers in their locale and let them make the decision of how they want to handle Alice's event attendance and use of community resources.<br><br><strong>Extra answer:</strong> FWIW I already have bad feelings about CEA's hardcore commitment to anonymity. I do feel EA is too hard on that side, where for example, people accused of things probably won't even be told the names of their accusers or any potentially-identifying details that make accusations less vague. The only reason NL knew in this situation is because the details make it unavoidable that they'd know. But otherwise the standard across EA is that if you are accused of something via CEA's community health team, you will never know who makes the critiques, and therefore will never be able to properly rebut them. And if that is how <i>this</i> had gone down, it would have been Kat and Emerson getting their names on CEA's blacklist. I think this default justice system of this community is messed up, and there should be <i>some</i> exceptions in theory.</p><p>That said, I'm not sure this is one of those exceptions. I feel kind of conflicted about revealing their names even in this extreme case, because I have also had a weird employment experience in EA with an atypical structure, after which I felt emotionally wounded, and if someone had come to me and said \"We suspect your ex-employer may be unethical and causing repeated serious harms! So I am asking you and others for all the details they can remember that made you feel bad in that situation\" there is some likelihood I would share my experiences, rather than say my actual thought-through POV which is \"No I actually don't blame or hold ill will to my ex-employers and I won't participate in any investigation against them. It was a complex situation and we all made mistakes\". In most cases I would not \"sing\" per se, but in some universes I surely would. Just because I was asked. Incidentally this parallels how I feel about the women in the sexual misconduct TIME piece too. It's gotta be hard to not add to a (maybe false but also maybe true) narrative when you are literally asked to and commended for doing so? Most of us trust people who put themselves in that sort of investigator position.</p><p>I'm sure many readers who are shocked at Alice or Chloe now would, if asked, start singing if they had been in their position, thinking they are doing something useful as they are being so encouraged, after all, even if at first they felt conflicted. Even if they had felt conflicted about it for a year prior. Even if they were almost over it, and their mental health and humility were improving, wouldn't being suddenly told \"no you really might be a victim, please share, in fact I'm talking to another victim too\" sort of.. undo that? Especially if they are working on mental health problems, I imagine it would feel soo temptingly cathartic and be hard to say no to a narrative that just <i>might </i>make you the hero, just <i>might </i>help someone else, for everything else you feel you lost. Does that make it their fault that they bit the bait? Or is it more the \"fault\" (or simply, \"result\") of how the investigation was done?</p><p>I do agree that orgs should be able to factor this whole debacle into their decision if they end up about to hire Alice or even Chloe. CEA's private list should mostly solve that problem. But my opinion on revealing names publicly beyond that hinges a lot on how the investigation kicked off. How much did Ben have to search and push to get them to say all that? What framing did he use? How much were they slandering NL before Ben even reached out, and was it about egregious or very important things? Was NL's reputation unfairly damaged by Alice <i>or</i> Chloe before this investigation even kicked off? I would like to hear more of his thoughts on that.. with no judgement toward him for the past, because it is so critical that the community come together and discuss honestly and collaboratively what happened here.</p>", "parentCommentId": "kJJ7Hbo6zxHZtTKyF", "user": {"username": "Ivy_Mazzola"}}, {"_id": "4krbLstnzNBtXNq26", "postedAt": "2023-12-20T00:39:04.691Z", "postId": "bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>So, what do you all think?</p></blockquote><p>I <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=LyJERRGdzhZqmsgbb\">continue to think</a> that something went wrong for people to come away with takes that lump together Alice and Chloe in these ways.&nbsp;</p><p>Not because I'm convinced that Alice is as bad as Nonlinear makes it sound, but because, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=qPAAsbfpCkwtQmKAq\">even based on Nonlinear's portrayal</a>, Chloe is portrayed as having had a poor reaction to the specific employment situation, and (unlike Alice) <i>not</i> as having a general pattern/history of making false/misleading claims.

As I <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Lc8r4tZ2L5txxokZ8/sharing-information-about-nonlinear-1?commentId=b9FGqeqo4hBcbSfu5\">commented</a> on the original post, the norm I've been pushing is only intended for cases where you have a neutral or better relationship with the organization, and not situations like this one where there are allegations of mistreatment or you don't trust them to behave cooperatively. The question here instead is, how do you ensure the accusations you're signal-boosting are true?</p><p>Here's my understanding of the timeline of 'adversarial' fact checking before publication: <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=8DGWvtFjvtDCMQmQh\">timeline</a>. Three key bits:</p><ul><li>LC first shared the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=Zf4oaHFm8DHFndnHt\">overview of claims</a> 3d before posting.</li><li>LC first shared the draft 21hr before posting, which included additional accusations</li><li>NL responded to both by asking for a week to gather evidence that they claimed would change LC's mind, and only threatened to sue when LC insisted on going ahead without hearing their side of the story.</li></ul><p>Overall, it does look to me like Ben should have waited. That he was still learning his post had additional false accusations right up to publication, including one so close to publication that he didn't have time to address it, meant he should have expected that if he didn't delay it would go to publication containing additional false claims. And Ben seems to have understood this, and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=8qvrnk8X2pk9hefqB\">told NL</a> two days before that \"I do expect you'll be able to show a bunch of the things you said\" and \"I did update from things you shared that Alice's reports are less reliable than I had thought\". Additionally, three days (some of which NL was traveling for) is not long to rebut such a long list of accusations, and some of the accusations were shared with NL less than a day in advance of publishing.</p><p>Given that I think it's clear Ben should have given NL some time to assemble conflicting evidence, do I also need to conclude that it was ok for NL to threaten to sue if he didn't? That is something I <i>really</i> don't want to do: I'm not a fan of how strict defamation law is, and I think it's really valuable that it's almost never used in our community. If we instead had a culture where everyone is being super careful never to say anything that they would lose a suit over I think we'd see a tremendous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilling_effect\">chilling effect</a> where many true and important things would never come out. This is especially important around allegations of abusive behavior, where proving the truth of anything can be quite difficult and abusers have often taken advantage of this.</p><p>On the other hand, defamation law at its best deters people from saying false things, including fact checking before <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=GoqAiuDfwxwBRfMsY\">republishing</a> others' claims, especially in cases where false statements are likely to have strong personal and professional impacts. NL threatening a suit here seems to me like the law used correctly even given the tighter scope I'd like to see for defamation law, and while it's still not something I would do and I'd be sad if it became common in our community, I don't think NL was actually wrong to do it.</p><p>Note that I'm not making an overall \"Nonlinear: yes or no\" judgement here; please don't interpret this post as a view on whether NL mistreated their employees or on how trustworthy their former employees are. I've only been looking at the two questions above: should Ben have waited for additional evidence, and was it an unreasonable escalation for NL to threaten to sue.</p><hr><p>A few thoughts about how future posts like LC's could go better:</p><ul><li>Be clear about voice. Ben's post often clarifies that he's relaying information (\"Alice reported that\") but at other times reports Alice or Chloe's perspective as his own (\"nobody in the house was willing to go out and get her vegan food, so she barely ate for 2 days\"). The latter would be warranted if Ben had validated the claims he's relaying, but my understanding is this was instead just a bit sloppy.</li><li>If you have your facts straight you don't <i>have</i> to give the people you're writing about a chance to look over a draft and point out errors, and in cases where, for example, people are telling the story of abuse that happened to them that's often a reasonable decision. On the other hand, especially if you're reporting on a situation you weren't a part of, I think you're really very likely to have some mistakes. Sharing your post's claims section (you don't have to share parts of the post that don't make new claims) for review is really hard to beat as a way of avoiding publishing false claims.</li><li>How much time to give for assembling evidence depends on how many claims there are, and I think you can do some prioritization. You can ask if they can provide evidence for some of the places they think you're most clearly wrong, and if they can't do a good job with this given a few days I think you're justified in assuming their claims of counter-evidence are bluster.</li><li>When giving time to fact check and gather evidence, get agreement on deadlines up front so things don't get pushed back repeatedly: \"I'll review anything you get me before EOD Thursday; does that work?\" While you should sort out all your claims before starting this process, if you want to add new claims after then you need to push the deadline out to give them more time to respond.</li></ul><p>I really like Michael Plant's <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fn7bo8sYEHS3RPKQG/concerns-with-intentional-insights?commentId=BHX8y5gD687NAgoFe\">comment</a> on a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fn7bo8sYEHS3RPKQG/concerns-with-intentional-insights\">previous post about issues with an EA org</a> (which <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/habryka?mention=user\">@Habryka</a> also worked on), responding to someone who <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fn7bo8sYEHS3RPKQG/concerns-with-intentional-insights?commentId=piXQnP4uvJrXC4Mzu\">thought</a> the post was \"charitable and systematic in excess of reasonable caution\" and objected to the \"fully comprehensive nature of the post and the painstaking lengths it goes to separate out definitely valid issues from potentially invalid ones\":</p><blockquote><p>I take your point as \"aren't we being too nice to this guy?\" but I actually really like the approach taken here, which seems extremely fair-minded and diligent. My suspicion is this sort of stuff is long-term really valuable because it establishes good norms for something that will likely recur in future. I'd be much more inclined to act with honesty if I believed people would do an extremely thorough public investigation into everything I'd said, rather than just calling me names and walking away.</p></blockquote><p>If you think that NL was overall in the right then of course LC should have been more careful, but even if you think NL is run by horrible people I think you <i>still</i> should come to that conclusion. &nbsp;This combination of posts and overwhelming amounts of conflicting screenshots and stories seems to have left most of the community not knowing what to think. A post from LC that led with airtight accusations and then included supplementary material for fuzzier issues would have been much more effective towards its goals, enough so that I think more hours spent in 'adversarial fact checking', resolving conflicting claims, would have been <i>far</i> more effective per hour than the average for this project.</p><hr><p>I almost always post immediately after writing things, since that's how my motivation works, but in this case I sent my post out for review. &nbsp;I got some good feedback from several people, but now that the top-level post has opened the conversation about appropriate process in situations like these I think talking in public makes more sense.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jeff_Kaufman"}}, {"_id": "soyf3bHt7gtwkqCAf", "postedAt": "2023-12-20T10:33:57.552Z", "postId": "bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q", "htmlBody": "<p>I find this post to be emotionally manipulative to a pretty substantial degree.

I'd argue that makes it worse; Nonlinear's section on Ben actually told the readers what it was doing.

A few observations:</p><p>(1) Suppose a universe in which the first post on this topic had been from from Nonlinear, and had accused Alice and Chloe (by their real names) of a pattern of mendaciously spreading lies about Nonlinear. Would that post have been allowed to stay up? If yes, it is hard to come up with a principled reason why Alice and Chloe can't be named now.&nbsp;</p><p>If no, we would need to think about why this hypothetical post would have been disallowed. The best argument I came with would be that Alice and Chloe are, as far as I know, people with no real prominence/influence/power (\"PIP\") within or without EA. Under this argument, there is a greater public interest in the actions of those with PIP, and accepting a role of PIP necessarily means sacrificing <i>some</i> of the privacy rights that non-PIPs get.</p><p>(2) Another possibility involves the idea of <i>standing</i>. Under this theory, Alice and Chloe had standing to name people at Nonlinear because they were the ones who allegedly experienced harm. Ben had derivative standing because Alice and Chloe had given him permission to share their stories on the Forum. Under this theory, Nonlinear (and individuals named in Ben's post) would have standing to name Alice and Chloe as the parties allegedly harmed by their conduct. The rest of us would not have standing. [Edit to add footnote here.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref23snzoj2atl\"><sup><a href=\"#fn23snzoj2atl\">[1]</a></sup></span>]</p><p>Maybe the aggrieved party isn't the best imaginable arbiter of whether someone should be unmasked, but it's probably better than concluding that each and every one of us get to make that decision. That could more easily lead to a situation in which 99% of us agree that the names shouldn't be disclosed, and the 1% gets to decide. Of course, that could happen under a standing theory as well, but the 1% minority opinion has to coincide with the list of parties with standing. That at least narrows the problem.</p><p>(3) This situation involves a mix of Forum and non-Forum conduct. I sense that the norm for not doxxing people is stronger for Forum conduct (or at least for conduct involving similar sorts of speech) than from non-Forum conduct. This may reflect a difference in the norms of Internet communities vs. physically-grounded communities, or a sense that Forum speech is often core expressive speech or otherwise entitled to extra solicitude.&nbsp;</p><p>In any event, based on the fact that a number of people seem to know their identities, it sounds like the tale of Alice and Chloe was not a closely-kept secret before Ben's post went up. Presumably this information came, directly or indirectly, from Alice and Chloe. In other words, there has been potentially relevant non-Forum conduct that did not magically morph into Forum conduct merely because Ben decided to write a post sharing the same information.</p><p>That raises the following hypothetical. Let's say that Dan allegedly made some homophobic, racist, sexist, and/or otherwise offensive comments.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefez22hg2jpf9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnez22hg2jpf9\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Does the location in which the comments were made change whether he can be identified. For example, is it OK to write a Forum post identifying Dan by name if those comments were posted on the Forum under a pseudonym? What if they were said at an EAG afterparty? In a non-EA space on Reddit? With a mask on in public (by someone who recognized Dan's voice)? If the answers are not the same, why is that the case? I don't claim to know the answers, by the way; this isn't a trick question.</p><p>(4) I do not at present have a clear opinion on whether naming Alice, Chloe, or both should be allowed on the Forum. I do have an opinion that there needs to be a clear, logical set of rules or at least principles -- ideally, laid out in advance as far as that is practical. I don't like the idea of apparently ad hoc decisions about who gets privacy protections and who does not.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn23snzoj2atl\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref23snzoj2atl\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>[Added footnote: I should note that standing, which is used as a legal metaphor here, does <i>not </i>mean \"is none of your business.\" We often impose standing requirements to make sure the person making the decision has appropriate incentives, context, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Here, the various people who A &amp; C have allegedly spread lies about are in a much better position than I am to know the relevant facts. If they have not concluded that disclosure of A &amp; C's names is warranted, it's not clear why I -- or any other reader of the relevant posts -- would do a better job as decisionmaker.</p><p>Another reason for limited standing is practicality.

You say: \"If individuals want to give a company a bad review, they can do so publicly online or privately to whomever they want.\"  Do the ethics of \"giving Nonlinear a bad review\" change depending on whether the person writing the bad review is a person in the EA community or outside of it?

However, insofar as EAs involve themselves in public issues, public scrutiny will often be warranted.  I think the best policy would be: the journalist's job is to cover people both inside <em>and</em> outside the EA community, who are working in areas of public <em>and</em> EA interest.  They aspire to neutrality in their coverage, so the valence of their stories isn't affected by a person's EA affiliation.</p>\n<p>We should also discuss what \"stopgap norms\" to have in place until something actually happens, because if FTX is any guide, nothing will ever happen.

Those means may be more or less formal, but I don't think communities are very viable without some means of norm enforcement. I think \"justice system\" implies something significantly different than what has happened here: e.g., the US justice system can throw me in a dungeon and take away all my money. To use a private example, if I were Catholic, the Catholic justice system could excommunicate me, defrock me as a priest, etc. A campus justice system can expel or fire me.</p><p>What happened here feels more like gossip on steroids. Lightcone said bad things about Nonlinear, which had the effect of decreasing community opinion of Nonlinear. That might in turn have concrete adverse effects on Nonlinear. But as far as I know: Lightcone did not, and could not, directly impose consequences on Nonlinear unmediated by the actions of the community.</p><p>Likewise, I don't think \"community police\" is right, at least in the frame of modern Western societies. The police and prosecutors (collectively \"police\") have the <i>exclusive </i>ability to charge people with crimes. They have the exclusive ability to use certain investigative tools, like search warrants. Although everyone has the ability to investigate possible wrongdoing in some capacity (e.g., journalists), the police are generally recognized as having a preeminent role. For example, if there is a police investigation into certain conduct, other processes like private organizations and civil investigations are usually expected to step aside to avoid disrupting the police investigation.</p><p>Rather, I think Lightcone's role here is more akin to the prosecutorial role in classical Athens. <a href=\"http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/socrates/greekcrimpro.html\">Any citizen could bring a criminal prosecution. In fact, there were no public prosecutors.</a> There was a preliminary stage, but then the matter was tried before a large jury of citizens (e.g., 500 for the most famous trial, that of Socrates). It's not clear to me that Lightcone has claimed any role in norm enforcement that is superior to the role they would believe appropriate for any community member. True, it championed the cause of A and C, but that was a result of a voluntary decision among A, C, and Lightcone. Similar things happened in classical Athens, and Lightcone hasn't appointed itself sole champion of people with grievances. What we are seeing on the Forum is vaguely like the deliberations of the citizen jury.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not seeing a clear alternative to \"private\" prosecution of norm violations in such a decentralized community. Who is in a place to be the public prosecutor? One could argue for CHSP, but it is merely another private actor with no real democratic legitimacy and some serious conflicts of interests (e.g., due to being part of CEA, due to so much of CEA's funding coming from Open Phil). I do not like the alternative of their being no norm enforcement except what is available through the legal system.</p><p>Although I can envision alternatives to adjudication by the whole community, I don't think we can criticize the abstract idea of bringing disputes to the whole community for adjudication at this time. In such a decentralized structure, sanctions for norm violations are imposed by community actors in their individual capacities. In other words, everyone who hears of Lightcone's charges has to decide for themselves whether they will change the way they interact with Nonlinear (and/or Lightcone) as a result. Likewise, there is no adjudicatory authority who would publicly warn everyone else of the risks of associating with an organization that has committed serious norm violations. Whatever its flaws, public adjudication seems to be the only real option at present for a certain class of matters.</p><blockquote><p>Emerson talking about suing for libel-- his right-- was seen as defection from the norms which that Lightcone employee thinks should apply to the whole EA/rationality community. When did Emerson opt into following these norms, being judged by these norms? Did any of us?&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Fair enough, but the flipside is that Lightcone didn't opt in to following your proposed norm of <i>not criticizing people for threatening to file defamation suits</i>.

I can definitely see a situation where you would agree to give a source a heads up once you\u2019d decided to publish \u2014 if it was a story where they\u2019d recounted a violent incident or sexual assault, or if they needed notice to stay somewhere else or watch out for hacking attempts.

Working with a journalist involves a trade-off: in exchange for total control, you get greater credibility, plausible deniability and institutional legal protection. <strong>If I wasn\u2019t happy with a story against a ticking clock, I wouldn\u2019t be pressured into publication.

A lot of the problems around the deadline were created by promising sources a hard deadline, something that she would not do. As a result of that promised hard deadline, they got into a situation where, with two hours to go, they looked at new information they received that complicated things and said \"Sorry, story goes up as-is.\" This seems clearly incompatible with the advice in those two paragraphs. The third paragraph mentions a judgment call, and there of course my own judgment call would be different (a week to gather evidence against the results of six months of investigation seems like the minimum for a fair period, certainly not time-wasting) but I recognize there's a bit more flex there.

By useful I mean that these alternatives potentially promote better social outcomes within the community, while hopefully not significantly undermining desirable practical outcomes such as a shift in funding or priorities.</p><p>1. If nothing else, add emotional honesty to the framing of a DTHP. A DTHP becomes more constructive and less prone to inspire reader bias when they are introduced with a clear and honest statement of the needs, feelings, requests from the main author. Maybe two out of three is a good enough bar. I'm inclined to think that the NL DTHP failed spectacularly at this.<br>2. Post a personal invitation for relevant individuals to learn more. Something like \"I believe org X is operating in an undesirable way and would urge funders who might otherwise consider donating to X to consider carefully. If you're in this category, I'm happy to have a one on one call and to share my reasons why I don't encourage donating to X.\" (And during the one on one you can allude to the mountain of evidence you've gathered, and let someone decide whether they want to see it or not.)<br>3. Find ways to skirt around what makes a DTHP a DTHP. I think a simple alternative such as posting a DTHP verbatim to one's personal blog, then only sharing or linking to it with people on a personal level is already incrementally less socially harmful than posting it to the forums.</p><p>Option 4 is we find some wonderful non-DTHP framework/template for expressing these types of concerns.

Perhaps I didn\u2019t word it well. Or am I misunderstanding you? If you could give some hard numbers like, only X% of complaints end up being handled anonymously, and of those, in Z% the complaints end up being unactionable and we just give a listening ear, and only in Y% do anonymous complaints end up being held against the person and meaningfully effecting their lives, then maybe I can agree I made the extent of the dilemma sound overblown.

I just wanted to acknowledge that there is a dilemma and that I am not a \u201cnever deanonymize\u201d type of person before I made some other points.</p>\n<p>Reading your link I felt it was not in conflict because: In the case where many people give complaints about Steve, not a single person was willing to have their concerns discussed in detail with him (out of fear that details would reveal them I suppose), let alone be deanonymized by name. So it does sound like EAs like to make complaints in (what I\u2019d call) \u201cextreme anonymity\u201d by \u201cdefault\u201d and tbh that matches my social and cultural model of EAs. And in the next section you say that your policy is to be even more protective of confidentiality than some communities like universities. And you do make some decisions based on those things you might never fully discuss with the other party. You call them \u201ccompromises\u201d but some are major reactions which could be EA-career-ending. Actually I find it hard to consider what other worse actions remain other than calling the police, writing a public expose about them, or messaging their employer out of the blue. So I don\u2019t think it is going too far to say that maybe CEA could be too protective of anonymity, as you acknowledge your behavior can, at least sometimes, be abnormal or counter to what people would expect in other institutions.</p>\n<p>In my view, it might be one of those cases where general society or others landed on the right institutional practices, but we EAs are naive in our tradeoff considerations by trying to use different systems, or draw the line of deanonymizing at different degrees. I don\u2019t think this is a bold possibility. I expect you disagree with the idea that CH could be too protective of anonymity. Maybe most EAs would.

I was merely trying to write an introduction I felt took seriously and related to the feelings of people who do want Alice and Chloe doxxed, and show how I understand and sympathize with that perspective very much, and then go from there to discuss why I wouldn\u2019t be in favor of doxxing even in this case that so many are shocked by.
