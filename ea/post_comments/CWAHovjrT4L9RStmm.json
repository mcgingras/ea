I had severe constipation, and very quickly had a very bad infection in the main incision, which took weeks to heal. After care in the hospital was poor, intact it was pretty dire. If wasn\u2019t for my GP, I think I would have been in a very dark place now. The staff at my GPs surgery we\u2019re outstanding.</p><p>A couple of months went by that were quite grim at times and then a large Hernia appeared. I got straight on to the hospital, who always told me they\u2018d fix any problems that may arise, hernia being one of them. That last statement couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. After numerous visits, I was asked if they could sign me off, I said no, not until I was fixed. The second from last consultant I saw initially told me that that it was as good as it gets, and some things go wrong and I\u2019ll have to deal with it. I obviously said no, and that I want a second opinion.</p><p>After a while I eventually got to see a hernia &nbsp;specialist that said he could sort, but at best it will be early this year(2023). As of yet, nearly July, I haven\u2019t heard a thing From them. My operation was two years ago now.</p><p>From the original consultation it has been a shambles, pre op there were three different surgeons that were going to do the op. Appointments were arranged, and one department not speaking to another, so certain tests seemed unplanned. Follow up calls and general communication was dire.</p><p>I am glad I have helped a complete stranger to have a better life by donating, but would I do it again, I don\u2019t really know, and probably wouldn\u2018t.</p><p>Only thing I would say is really check out the hospital that is taking from you, mine was a prestigious NHS hospital that should have done better.&nbsp;<br>I feel that their interest in me, was only what they could get from me, and not my well-being. Almost as blunt as saying I was a slab of meat to them.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Nell"}}]
