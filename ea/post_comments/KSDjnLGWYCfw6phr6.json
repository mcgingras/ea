You can a more in-depth analysis in our <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Hs9X8LirL5GWTFNnN/rethink-wellbeing-on-par-with-top-charities-first-year\">main end-of-the-year-report post</a>. &nbsp;This is how we arrived at the number (N=42): To assess productivity, we employed the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire: General Health V2.0 (<a href=\"https://oml.eular.org/sysModules/obxOML/docs/id_98/WPAI-GH_English_US_V2.pdf\"><u>WPAI:GH</u></a>, 2015). This helped to quantify the actual amount of productive hours gained. We basically measured the hours worked as well as the productivity during those hours.&nbsp;<br>The results: Five hours or 18% more hours are worked overall (pre-mean=23, post-mean=28), and 57% fewer hours are lost due to mental health issues before and right after the program. Also, within the hours worked, productivity was claimed to be 13% less impaired by mental health issues, which is equivalent to 3.6 hours of more work. This mounts up to an overall productivity increase of 8.6 hours or 37% per week. This finding is aligned with the larger increase in executive function we observe.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "eotx4yHJFeC84MskN", "user": {"username": "Inga"}}]
