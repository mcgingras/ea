I never really even thought I should have been consulted, but in hindsight, those two quick moves probably contributed significantly to my attachment issues, as they both broke some nice friendships I had found myself in and pretty much taught me a sort of unconscious \"don't get too attached to people\" lesson. Between that and the bad luck that the last school I ended up in was not quite as nice an environment for me as the first two, this probably had a big impact on me that I still feel the effects of.

I am sure it might work for some people, maybe even most EAs (judging by the upvotes), but I would also perhaps put up a warning flag for EAs considering whether to become parents or not: This might not be the right process for you and I think it is not at all necessary if you want to be an EA and a parent. I know you caveated the post this way, but I am commenting both to reinforce this caveat, to offer a bit more balance to this post and to offer an alternative strategy.<br><br>Therefore, I would like to outline an alternative and perhaps <strong>simpler approach: Ask yourself only if you want to bring another life into this world or not, leaving out all considerations of impact. If you land on \"yes\", then do it and do not worry about impact.</strong> Sure, it <i>could</i> have a \"negative\" effect on your impact, but I think it could easily also be net positive in sublime ways (like emotional safety, meaning in life, etc. that can affect your productivity in large ways).<br><br>I would also warn against trading off kids with impact. Another comment here touches upon it but I think there is value to always putting the kids first if you want to have kids. There are many times this will come up and having been a parent only for 6 years they could be situations such as the kids not feeling 100% and taking a day off instead of sending them to daycare, even though you during that day could save 0.1 lives in expectation.<br><br>I think the reality is that many of us will have careers that are at least 40 years long, and kids might only take up significant time 10-15 years of these.
