[{"_id": "zojgHsTc3mxb2WCPh", "title": "The Mess we are in and what we could do ", "postedAt": "2022-11-12T08:22:13.522Z", "htmlBody": "<p>&nbsp;Professor Robert Sapolsky, author of \u201cBehave\u201d ( highly recommended but a very long read) is currently writing a book about why the world is in such a mess. Well, if he has been listening to the news It shouldn\u2019t the good Professor very long.&nbsp; To assist, here is my summary of world mess and what needs to happen to make the world a better place.</p><p><u>1) We are not as clever as we think we are</u></p><p>The world is increasingly complex, interconnected and interdependent. Billions of people take actions that unavoidably affect others and the environment and weather continually change. Does anyone understand what the outcomes will be? Scientists study the world and make predictions, but in making those predictions, they change behaviors, so that their predictions appear to be wrong, even though their original prediction was right at the time.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;It seems the more we learn the less we understand, but&nbsp; everyone has a duty to commit to a life of continual learning and self improvement. In my opinion few do.&nbsp;</p><p><u>2) Natural selection hasn't given us the nature to solve problems at the Global/Species level.</u></p><p>Our evolutionary advantage, that has made us the most complex, dominant species on earth, was formed by the process of natural selection. If we survived and reproduced, our genes and social behaviors are transferred to the next generation. This all works at&nbsp; the level of the individual, and because humans live in tribes or communities, also at the level of the group. It's survival of the fittest, or best adapted, and the best characteristics are determined by competition. So we end up with people, tribes and counties fighting it out to be selected the most. The trouble is, this is of no use when it comes to solving global or species level problems such as climate change, resource and food shortages, thermonuclear war.</p><p>In order to solve these problems, we need to rise above our biology and instincts, and increase our intelligence to work as one social global group that co operates, respects and tolerates rather than competes. Hopefully this will get us through this century without civilization collapse, but perhaps natural selection is just too powerful and we will be deselected from planet earth. On some days, when listening to the news, I can't help thinking this may not be such a bad thing, as the next civilization wouldn't&nbsp; have readily available fossil fuels, so would have to start and continue with sustainable energy sources. However, in the process of natural deselection, we will take millions of other species down with us - is that acceptable?.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<br><u>3) Too many people causing too much environmental damage.&nbsp;</u><br><br>At the start of the industrial revolution, burning coal didn\u2019t matter and gave us cheap copious energy which made a small number of people rich. Back then the damage to the environment didn\u2019t matter as only a few had the knowledge and access to fossil fuels. Now, everyone in the world wants to be rich and globalisation gives every one access to fossil fuels and powerful technology. The result is climate change and transformed landscapes, all of which is extremely damaging to the planet.&nbsp;<br><br>Humanity, wants it all, now, and isn\u2019t intelligent enough to see, or care about, the damage and long term irreversible consequences. We could stop using fossil fuels tomorrow if we wanted, but we (high emitters) &nbsp;aren't willing to take the cut in wealth and degree of resource sharing need to prevent collapse of our civilization.&nbsp;<br><br><u>4) Too many highly differing tribes being forced together by globalisation and global communications&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;<br><br>For the first time in history, within hours, people can cheaply and easily travel the globe. Likewise, it's a simple task to globally send, in a matter of seconds, messages, videos, recordings and money, translated or converted for local use. The world is a much smaller place than the one I grew up in.&nbsp;<br><br>This means different cultures, ideologies and political systems are being forced together and can no longer ignore each other. When considering other peoples, human nature dictates that it is us who are correct, not them. Therefore conflict is on the increases as ideas and cultures battle it out for ultimate victory. Not that anyone can win. What is needed is respect, toleration and cooperation and acceptance of the joyful differences that make the world interesting.<br><br><u>5) Globalisation means increased spread of disease and alien species.</u><br><br>Many species are taking advantage of humans global trade and travel to spread their genes in a very rapid but unnatural way. Thus ecosystems are thrown out of delicate equilibrium, never to be the same again.&nbsp;</p><p><br><u>6) The rate of change is too fast for humans, animals and the planet to cope</u><br><br>50 Million years ago CO2 levels were much higher than they were today, the poles were ice free., trees grew in Antarctica and the British Isles were tropical. Today temperatures are far lower, but because the rate of increase of CO2 levels is so fast, human civilization and ecosystems will be unable to cope and will experience dramatic collapse. By the weathering of rocks, the planet will eventually remove CO2 but this takes millions of years, not the decades needed of counter act man made CO2<br><br>Likewise the rate of increase in knowledge and technology is changing so fast, that people can no longer keep up, and because our political leaders are old and our education stops early in life, by the time a person reaches a position where they can make a difference, their brains no longer understand (or even see) the world they live in, So the wrong decisions, based on out dated knowledge and ideas are made.&nbsp;</p><p><u>7) Old people.should be allowed to die (I know I will be hated for this one, but from personal experience I think we have to be brutally honest with ourselves)</u><br>&nbsp;<br>All animals have evolved to live, reproduce and die. We die because natural selection does not weed out defects after reproductive age and so cells become programmed to get cancer or stop working in old age. (Poor old octopuses fall to bits after the age of 2).&nbsp;<br><br>Humans hang about a bit as grand parents to help raise their genetic descendants, but after that they become weaker and so naturally they die. However, today, modern health care can keep people alive far longer than is natural and in fact so long that frequently&nbsp; the old people being cared for are no longer living happy lives, or bringing happiness to others or having any sort of life at all, What\u2019s the point? Shouldn\u2019t we be focusing on the newly born and young people who are the hope of the world rather than just running away from difficult decisions concerning those at the end of life? Death is as much a part of life as birth is.&nbsp; Is it not correct to put down suffering animals or to allow people to die when they have had enough of life?&nbsp;</p><p><u>8) Social media gives positive feed back to our prejudices, biases and ignorance.</u><br><br>What ever you think, their's someone out there who thinks like you. And social media will put you in touch with them, so that you will keep on clicking and they get rich with the advertising money generated. The problem is that if your ideas are based on a falsehood or negative to the common good, your internet community will just reinforce your thinking and social media will never promote contact with someone of opposing views. Result - more extreme views and more conviction that you are correct even if your views cause harm.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps we should be more like Socrates - question everything.<br><br><u>9) A generation brought up on violent computer games, porn films and extreme TV can now go and buy real guns and strangle real women.</u><br><br>When I was a kid, the second world war was only 20 years before and whilst war stories, books and TV programmes were common, it was all presented as what happened to other people. Then came shoot em up computer games in which you could kill people to your hearts content. They were very popular. Extreme violence was made personal and harmless. Similarly films and TV programmes have become extremely violent and age classifications can easily be bypassed on the net. Violence has been normalised to such an extent that it is seen to be cool to carry a weapon and it is normal to strangle a girl whilst kissing.<br><br>On the radio today I hear that the possibility of civil war in America is worrying many experts. Is it&nbsp; surprising, if violence has been normalised.</p><p>Likewise, who is calling for a cease fire in Ukraine? Its not a game and most people who are living on the front line just want the shelling to stop.<br><br><u>10) It\u2019s easy to turn a democracy into a dictatorship, but very hard to turn a dictatorship into a democracy,&nbsp;</u><br><br>I hope you can agree that democracy has a better record concerning human rights and is the least worst system of organising a society. Global migration patterns indicate that when people vote with their feet they tend to leave Authoritarian countries and head for democratic ones. However democratic countries are very hard to create without violence and sacrifice, and it is very easy for democratic rights to ebb away, for of course, very good, but in the long term wrong, reasons.. Then one day you wake up and someone like Putin is in charge and if you object, you are dead.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><u>11) Out of date Philosophies and Religions</u><br>&nbsp;</p><p>I've read a few books on philosophy and religion and most of it is in need of a serious update. Religion contains lots of wisdom, but the superstitions about God is embarrassing. Confucius - sexist and if he knew my parents would have changed his mind about ancestor worship. Budda - what would happen if every one sat around selfishly doing nothing. Rights of man - what about slaves, future others and animals? Voltaire concluded that the world was absurd, but suggested we should go and sit it out in our gardens. Communism - failed, Capitalism - failing. I could go on but I hope you get my point.&nbsp;</p><p><br>I'm afraid I cannot give a solution to this one. Could someone/some group come up with a pick and mix philosophy for todays problems?</p><p><u>12) Uncooperative political systems dominated by a few rather than the many&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></p><p>In the UK after each election, the lucky winner always says they are going to unite the country. And then the mud slinging really begins. Why don't political parties work together? Co operation could achieve so much more but our political systems are out of date and in desperate need of reform. Surely with all this new tec and modern communications people voting on the wide diverse issues of the day (on which it is impossible for just two parties to represent all combinations of opinions) could be expanded and used more frequently.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Even in democracies it is still only small minority of people who dominate the decision making process and most of them are only expert in looking competent rather than being competent. I wrote to my MP and asked, if all her constituents wanted her to vote against her own party what would she do? I still await the answer. Perhaps we should be more like ants. They have been getting along just fine in their societies for millions of years without leaders. When a job needs doing they just all muck in and get it done.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><u>13) Greedy, selfish, lazy, uneducated voters and ignorant politicians</u><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Democracy seems to be the best political system we have invented so far, but it's far from perfect. People usually vote in their own self interest rather than the common good. Here in the UK, the party that usually wins is the one that can offer the biggest tax cuts, greatest spending on free health care, the most on educating (and now feeding) our children and who will provide the most free care for our elderly so they aren't a burden on our own lives. If a politician said voters are just being greedy and we should take responsibility for our own lives, would they get elected? No chance. So the state gets bigger and the national debt gets bigger, until one day the currency collapses and the voters all have a riot because our politicians&nbsp; are so useless. But they just gave us voters what we wanted.</p><p>Many demand free health care, and are quick to run off the the doctors and hospitals with minor problems that our amazing bodies will probably solve given rest and time. Fewer are willing to control our unhealthy diets, give our bodies a health boosting work out or take time out to de stress our minds. Result - a health care system in a permanent state of near collapse.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>The majority in the UK voted for Brexit. Did they know what they were really voting for or what its implications would be? Most people I have spoken to voted for brexit as a protest vote or voted emotionally for a dream of an independent country in an interdependent world, which is absurd. Now we have a shortage of workers as lazy unfit Bits won't or cant do the jobs the hard working immigrants used to do. At least in ancient Greece, voters had to sit through the debates in order to vote, where as today you get a vote and can be totally ignorant of how the real world works. Once upon a time in Hull, a real monkey was elected and today all the clever people have high paid proper jobs or are running internet scams. So you could say we are still voting for which ever Monkey hands out the most peanuts!</p><p>Isn't it time to acknowledge we all have obligations to contribute to society, as well as &nbsp;rights.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<u>14) Our definitions of Wealth, health and happiness are out of date</u></p><p>We all want to pursue wealth, health and happiness, but this a very&nbsp; selfish why a living. Wouldn't the world be a much better place if we all helped each other, including future generations and animals, to pursue wealth, health and and happiness? Or as Winston Churchill said, would this just \"share the misery. Well maybe we need to take a new look at what wealth, health (especially mental health) and happiness really are. Are any of us truly&nbsp; happy in the current world?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise counties use Gross Domestic Product as a measure of success regardless of their peoples happiness. Is life only about GDP?&nbsp; Isn't the number of food banks or suicides more important?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><u>15) To few people do what is best for the common good, as we usually do what is of least discomfort&nbsp; for ourselves</u><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Most people know that burning&nbsp; fossil fuels is wrecking the planet. But how many of us have cut off the gas supply, got rid of the internal combustion powered car, vowed never to fly again and fully switched to renewables? This is the correct thing to do, but I haven\u2019t. Whilst I have reduced my CO2 foot print, I\u2019m not prepared to reduce my standard of living. There is always and excuse at hand to justify inaction, like my partner will throw me out of the house!<br><br>When Russian men are called up to fight in Ukraine, hopefully most of them see this war as wrong. However it is easier to join the army and hope for the best, rather than stand up to Putins regime and go to prison for certain. So the war continues and more die \u2026\u2026 for what?<br><br>It takes courage and sacrifice to get the world out of the mess it\u2019s in. And too few of us are prepared to stand up and do what is right, even when it is very clear that the group is wrong. It would be easier if we all stood together, rather than individuals, and protested, but at the moment it doesn\u2019t seem to be happening.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><u>16) We should all recognise that there is no such thing as an evil person, but there are too many evil acts</u>.</p><p>Human behaviour is governed by biology and context and we are all capable of bad and evil acts. Would you murder someone? Well I would murder Putin if he was standing next to me. Read Sapolsky's \"behave\" and Rabecca Myers \"Inside the Criminal Mind\" and overcome your bad behaviours.</p><p><br><u>17) The world is absurd because people do absurd things and we all stand by and allow it to continue</u><br><br>I say enough is enough, the mess, absurdity, chaos, what ever you want to call, it must end. We are all stuck on this planet together, with no one coming to help and we have to learn to live together and make it work. We have no choice, no alternative.&nbsp; There is no planet B. Firstly we must recognise that we all, by our nature, are tribal social animals but this nature cannot help us at a species level. We must rise above it and swiftly recognise that the differences between us are joyous but irrelevant, when it comes to solving our many problems.&nbsp;<br><br>Only by living and working together with tolerance, respect and new found wisdom, will humans survive on planet Earth without our civilization collapsing. What happens next starts with you and I.<br><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Trev Prew"}}, {"_id": "4viLtxnwzMawqdPum", "title": "Time consistency for the EA community: Projects that bridge the gap between near-term bootstrapping and long-term targets", "postedAt": "2022-11-12T07:44:25.118Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The recent EA Survey asked about additional areas of action for the EA community. In this note I argue that the central orientation of efficient altruism should be finding projects where near term outcomes are aligned with the long term targets.&nbsp;</p><p>An activism that is oriented to avoid tail events is doomed to lose traction every day that the event does not materialize (see Alinsky, 1971 on efficient activism). On the other hand, this is the culminating moment of human history where the events of a few decades can affect outcomes in geological time. Above all other considerations, looking for cases where the trade-off between the long-term impact and near-term outcomes is minimal shall be the main criteria for selecting projects at the present time. The EA movement has the broadest political-philosophical perspective in the world and a modest social base, and this tension is going to define its historical role in the coming decades.</p><p>In this sense, this note argues that there are three areas where short-term objectives can be achieved while addressing existential challenges. These three areas are: i) Institutional development and moderate politics, ii) Digital Commons, &nbsp;iii) Dual-use technologies for developing countries and post-disaster situations.</p><h2>Institutional development and moderate politics</h2><p>More than half of humanity remains under autocracies or authoritarian oligarchies, some of them with a large nuclear arsenal, and in the last decade these regimes have managed to consolidate and partially push back the democratizing tide of the post-Cold War.</p><p>In addition, contemporary democracies show signs of obsolescence. Our social system is the product of the rise of capitalism, the XVII to XIX centuries liberal revolutions and a wave of social reformism in the post-World War II period (Judt, 2004). The three elements (the legal-political system, the economic system and the social protection system) are vastly more functional than the alternatives, and the economic order of the globalization is altogether much more egalitarian than any previous system of international economic relations (Milanovic, 2013).</p><p>But the increase in economic and vital precariousness in developed countries (reflected in some relative income stagnation and the increasing inequality), and the general disappearance of a coherent public opinion (replaced by a proliferation of ideological and cultural echo chambers) are symptoms that the institutional system is overwhelmed after several decades of mere management by the elites and apathy by the masses. In the long run, capitalist liberal democracy is too fragile, and has to undergo too extensive social changes to survive in its current form, but at the present moment, and in Lincoln's words, democracy (and America itself!) are \u201c<i>the last, the best hope of Mankind</i>\u201d.</p><p>For this reason, in the short and medium term, and by order of urgency, the main human priority is to sustain the currently existing democracies by supporting either democratic institutions and centrist political movements. A brief summary of the results from comparative Political Science (Lijphart, 2012) suggest that parliamentary regimes (instead of presidential ones), with proportional representation mechanisms (instead of \u201cfirst past the post\u201d races), lead to consociational governance, which is less brilliant, but also more secure that the strong majoritarian alternative. Among other initiatives of interest in this field, we have the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.uniteamerica.org/\">Unite America</a>\u201d institutional reform agenda, and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.radicalxchange.org/\">Radical Exchange</a>\u201d is in its own way a parallel community with many points of contact with EA.</p><p>As far as economic policies are concerned, the Second Theorem of Welfare Economics remains a beacon that dialectically surpasses either capitalism and socialism: a capitalist economy with substantial redistribution (in the form of free social goods as health and education, and unemployment benefits, ideally contingent on macroeconomic conditions) is the state of the art of social economic stabilization for developed countries.</p><p>Paradoxically, institutional stagnation happens when the most extensive analytical knowledge about social coordination mechanisms is available and where technology allows this research to be implemented. Glen Weyl and Richard Posner (Weyl and Posner, 2018), propose a set of innovative mechanisms to transform private property or political participation, maintaining a decentralized structure in production, or political decisions. Developments in decentralized computing (blockchains) allow not only to have decentralized currencies and contracts, but also participatory institutions (DAO).</p><p>Institutional progress is the substitution of arbitrary personal decision regimes for rules and institutions capable of aggregating preferences and distributed knowledge into optimal social decisions. When expressed in this way, it is clear that liberal democracies (and markets) are more advanced than authoritarian (and usually kleptocratic) regimes, but one can also suspect that there is still a long way to go to achieve a stable, legitimate and capture-resistant social system safe enough to govern a species that has developed an immense capacity for self-destruction.</p><h2>Digital commons</h2><p>Another significant socio-economic trend in recent decades is disintermediation in the field of communication. This post is published in an open access forum, which however allows for a global audience. Basically the marginal cost of distributing information has been reduced to zero in the XXI century.</p><p>Of course, the production of content still has costs (although they have also contracted), but in the first decades of the rise of the zero marginal cost economy there was a wave of optimism about the possibility of \"liberating\" content and monetizing it based on revenue collection schemes different from the payments by the consumer. Boldrin and Levine proposed abolishing intellectual property (Boldrin and Levine, 2012), and Perry Barlow (Barlow, 1996) called on governments to abandon the \u201cNew Frontier\u201d. The promise has been partially fulfilled. Google and Meta are hugely profitable companies that obtain their income from the leg a two-sided platform (Rochet and Tirole, 2003) that is not the general public. However, the content generation sectors have suffered (press and music are the most affected), and in many cases we are seeing a return of payment schemes by the final consumer.</p><p>At the same time that the great internet monopolies consolidated there was a boom in open source protocols and programs, although always under the shadow of economic precariousness. It is evident that both from the perspective of economic contestability (defense of competition) equality and democracy, the \"Digital Commons\" are a global public good. Each euro devoted to knowledge liberation is a euro that can be used by the whole Mankind.</p><p>One of the most valuable parts of the digital commons is the digital scientific knowledge and tools. The academic emphasis on the scientific paper is probably passing and scientific agendas are going to be more and more oriented towards the creation of free software and database projects. The contemporary academy has to assume a leading role in the management and availability of the digital commons. Some successful initiatives in this area are the <a href=\"https://osf.io/\">Open Science Foundation</a>, <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/\">Plos ONE</a>, and <a href=\"https://milneopentextbooks.org/about/\">Milne Open textbooks</a>. In many developed countries, free textbooks are defended as a part of the educational branch of the welfare state, but in our time that \u201cfree\u201d should not come from public subsidies for textbooks, but from the use of educational materials under a \u201cCreative Commons\u201d license.&nbsp;</p><p>A very simple and high impact intervention is the purchase of patents (to be released into the public domain) that facilitate the production of all kinds of generic goods (drugs are the classical case). In general, the selection of high-value intellectual properties to be purchased and placed in the public domain and the investment in their maintenance and universal availability should be considered among EA priorities. Ideally, these interventions shall be carried on partnership with academic institutions.&nbsp; In addition to punctual interventions, EA shall promote the idea that the Academia must put the availability and expansion of the stock of Digital Commons at the center of its social mission (perhaps large university endowments would finally find their true mission).</p><h2>Dual-use technologies for developing countries and post-disaster situations</h2><p>In almost any of the great catastrophes that may occur in the coming decades (being nuclear war both the worst and the most likely), the greatest challenge is to sustain supplies of food, energy and a reasonable manufacturing capacity (Dartnell, 2015).</p><p>The most critical bottleneck is food production: fortunately, the food system has several layers of redundancy, the most important of which is the possibility of directing the food consumption of the livestock for human use. But recent research opens up the possibility of developing synthetic foods (see the <a href=\"https://allfed.info/\">ALLFED</a> website for a summary) or selecting resilient varieties of plants for extreme environments.</p><p>On the other hand, the so-called \u201cdistributed manufacturing\u201d is a set of highly flexible manufacturing techniques, among which 3D printing stands out (European Defense Agency, 2018). Apart from its disruptive economic potential, it can also function to mitigate the extreme dependence on international industrial supplies, providing a layer of flexibility to the natural rigidity of the super-optimized production system generated by globalized capitalism.</p><p>Both kinds of technologies are dual-use: they can be used to alleviate poverty in less developed countries and to deal with major catastrophes. After 77 years under the threat of nuclear war no progress towards building a less geographically centralized society with fewer industrial bottlenecks has been done. The urban population has been increasing steadily since 1945, and industry is not only more concentrated, but also contemporary technologies are especially sensitive to nuclear detonations (with their associated electromagnetic pulses).</p><p>However, a distributed, resilient and as simple as possible industrial technology is worthwhile both from the standpoint of development and that of the \u201cDay After\u201d of major catastrophes. Deployment is simply too expensive to the means of the EA community, but research support and some seed capital could be affordable.&nbsp;</p><p>Until now, open source hardware (see the Bonvoisin et al, 2020 literature review) has been focused mainly in electronics, being both <a href=\"https://opensource.com/tags/arduino\">Arduino</a>,&nbsp; <a href=\"https://opensource.com/tags/raspberry-pi\">Raspberry Pi</a> and some <a href=\"https://opensource.com/tags/3d-printing\">3D printers</a> among the most important <i>demonstration cases</i>. On the other hand, the most interesting <i>use cases</i> would be precisely for large and relatively simple machines, as agricultural machinery. The <a href=\"https://wiki.opensourceecology.org/wiki/GVCS_State_of_Completion\">Open Source Ecology</a> is the largest project devoted to this segment of open source hardware, but its degree of success and scalability are hard to assess.&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>In this note I propose three types of highly leveraged investments from the perspective of their synergies between near and long term objectives: i) Institutional development and moderate politics, ii) Digital Commons, &nbsp;iii) Dual-use technologies for developing countries and post-disaster situations.</p><p>Two disclaimers are in order: First, the proposed priorities are designed from the perspective of human welfare maximization. Although the moral objections to factory farming seem plausible to me (in the rich countries), I am agnostic about the intensity and nature of non-human conscience. Secondly, in the factual realm, I see nuclear war as more urgent and likely risk than any other catastrophic/existential risks.</p><p>In my view a substantially volitional Artificial Intelligence is not necessary a risk (it can even be a solution for many human problems), and I do not see its emergence as imminent. Readers that do not share these two sunk hypotheses have to make their own assessment on the relevance of the proposed priorities. On the other hand, for those sharing the human welfare/nuclear war worldview, the priorities here outlined are (in my view) almost inescapable.</p><h1>References</h1><p>Alinsky, S.D, \"Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals\", 1971</p><p>Arend Lijphart, \u201cPatterns of Democracy: Government Forms and Performance in Thirty-Six Countries\u201d, Yale University Press ,2012</p><p>Barlow, J.P, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence\">A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace</a>\u201d, 1996</p><p>Boldrin, M. and Levine, D.K., \u201c<a href=\"http://www.dklevine.com/general/intellectual/againstfinal.htm\">Against Intellectual Monopoly</a>\u201d, 2008</p><p>Bonvoisin, J.,&nbsp;Molloy, J., H\u00e4uer, M., Wenzel, T., \u201cStandardisation of Practices in Open Source Hardware\u201d, <a href=\"https://openhardware.metajnl.com/\">Journal of Open Hardware</a>, 2020</p><p>Dartnell, L., \u201dThe Knowledge: How to Rebuild Civilization in the Aftermath of a Cataclysm\u201d, Penguin Books, 2015</p><p>European Defense Agency, \u201c<a href=\"https://eda.europa.eu/docs/default-source/projects/eda-am-study-and-strategic-report_v6.pdf\">Additive manufacturing feasibility study &amp; technology demonstration</a>\u201d, EDA AM State of the Art &amp; Strategic Report, 2018</p><p>Judt,T. \u201cPostwar: A History of Europe Since 1945\u201d, &nbsp;Penguin Books, 2006</p><p>Milanovic, B. \u201c<a href=\"https://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/teaching/Milanovic13.pdf\">Global Income Inequality by the Numbers: in History and Now\u2014An Overview</a>\u201c, World Bank Policy Research Working Paper, 2012</p><p>Rochet, J.C and Tirole,J. \u201cPlatform Competition in Two-Sided Markets\u201d, Journal of the European Economic Association, 2003</p><p>Weyl, G. y Posner, R., \u201c<a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691177502/radical-markets\">Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society</a>\u201d, Princeton University Press, 2018</p>", "user": {"username": "Arturo Macias"}}, {"_id": "FKJ8yiF3KjFhAuivt", "title": "IMPCO, don't injure yourself by returning FTXFF money for services you already provided", "postedAt": "2022-11-12T04:51:28.080Z", "htmlBody": "<p>In my possibly contrarian opinion, and speaking as somebody who I don't think actually got any money directly from FTX Future Fund that I can recall; also speaking for myself and hastily, having not run this post past any other major leaders in EA:</p><p>You are not obligated to return funding that got to you ultimately by way of FTX; especially if it's been given for a service you already rendered, any more than the electrical utility ought to return FTX's money that's already been spent on electricity; especially if that would put you to hardship. &nbsp;This is not a for-the-greater-good argument; I don't think you're obligated to that much personal martyrdom in the first place, just like the utility company isn't so obligated.</p><p>It's fine to be somebody who sells utilons for money, just like utilities sell electricity for money. &nbsp;People who work in the philanthropic sector, and don't capture all of the gain they create, do not thereby relinquish the solidity of their claim to the part of that gain they <i>do</i> capture, to below the levels of an electrical utility's claim to similar money. &nbsp;The money you hold could maybe possibly compensate some FTX users - if it doesn't just get immediately captured by users selling NFTs to Bahamian accounts, or the equivalent in later bankruptcy proceedings - but that's equally true of the electrical utility's money, or, heck, money held by any number of people richer than you. Plumbers who worked on the FTX building should likewise not anguish about that and give the money back; yes, even though plumbers are probably well above average in income for the Bahamas. &nbsp;You are not more deeply implicit in FTX's sins, by way of the FTX FF connection, than the plumber who worked directly on their building.</p><p>I don't like the way that some people think about charity, like anybody who works in the philanthropic sector gives up the right to really own anything. &nbsp;You can try to do a little good in the world, or even <i>sell</i> a little good into the world, without signing up to be the martyr who gets all the blame for not being better when something goes wrong.</p><p>You probably forwent some of your possible gains to work in the charity sector at all, and took a bit of a generally riskier job. &nbsp;(If you didn't know that, my condolences.) &nbsp;You may suddenly need to look for a new job. &nbsp;You did not sign away your legal or <i>moral</i> right to keep title to money that was already given you, if you've already performed the corresponding service, or you're still going to perform that service. &nbsp;If you <i>can't</i> perform the service anymore, then maybe return some of that money once it's clear that it'll actually make its way to FTX customers; but keep what covers the cost of a month to re-search for a job, or the month you already spent searching for that job.</p><p>It's fine to call it your charity and your contribution that you undercharge for those utilons and don't capture as much value as you create - <i>if </i>you're nice enough to do that, which you don't have to be, you can be Lawful Neutral instead of Lawful Good and I won't think you're <i>as </i>cool but I'll still happily trade with you.</p><p>(I apologize for resorting to the D&amp;D alignment chart, at this point, but I really am not sure how to compactly express these ideas without those concepts, or concepts that I could define more elaborately that would mean the same thing.)</p><p>That you're trying to be some degree of Good, by undercharging for the utilons you provide, doesn't mean you can't still hold that money that you got in Lawful Neutral exchange for the services you sold. &nbsp;Just like any ordinary plumber is entitled to do, if it turned out they unwittingly fixed the toilet of a bad bad person. &nbsp;Not fixing any more toilets for them is one thing; giving back the previous payment is another.</p><p>Trying to be a better person than average does not make it any <i>more</i> your responsibility to fix the broken pieces of the world elsewhere, than it is the electrical utility's responsibility to make FTX's customers whole for the money that FTX spent on electricity. &nbsp;The fact that you're trying to be a Good person doesn't make that responsibility land on you. &nbsp;It means you tried to be nicer than most people are, one day of your life, and nobody - definitely nobody who is <i>not you</i> - gets to demand that you now be nice on <i>another </i>day too. &nbsp;You do not, be it clear, get to say, \"I was nice one day, so now I get to be nasty this other day\" - we don't trust your accounting of that - but <i>other</i> people do not get to tell you, \"Now you must be even nicer on this other occasion!\"</p><p>FTX's misdeeds are not something that their electrical utility could've reasonably known in advance, and neither could you, because we're all distracted and competence in general in this civilization is in very short supply. &nbsp;If Sequoia Capital can get fooled - presumably after more due diligence and apparent access to books than you could possibly have gotten while dealing with the charitable arm of FTX FF that was itself almost certainly in the dark - then there is no reasonable way you could have known. &nbsp;We do not live in the world of Hieronym's <i>To the Stars,</i> or the locally better-known world of dath ilan partially inspired by it; we don't have AIs reporting to every seller on every buyer's moral probity before they sell anything, and frankly it's not clear we'd want to live in a world where that was true.</p><p>Miami sold FTX naming rights on a sports area. &nbsp;Miami has now terminated that agreement; maybe they'll give some of the money back; I sure bet they won't give all of it back. &nbsp;If you have any feeling deep inside like philanthropy is not a real trade - well, how real are the naming rights on a sports arena? &nbsp;I'd think selling a crypto company a $135M right to name a stadium, is more the sort of thing where all that money ought to be given back to defrauded customers, if you say some transactions aren't real enough. &nbsp;The reason some people don't immediately think that way, I'd say, is because they think people in the charitable sector all ought to be martyrs; and that is a way of thinking that I dislike. &nbsp;Miami would laugh at you, if you told them they should give <i>all </i>the money back to make FTX's customers whole. &nbsp;People go after the philanthropic service providers because such Good and self-sacrificing people are easier targets who might take that criticism seriously - not because it makes more sense on a moral level that sellers of utilons should come in line for harsh personal sacrifice, ahead of the sellers of stadium naming rights losing a chunk of revenue.</p><p>Does it potentially make EA look slightly better, if you visibly and nobly sacrifice everything and undergo great hardship? &nbsp;Possibly! &nbsp;But that is not necessarily your individual responsibility, to optimize EA's image at personal cost; unless you can afford to make it so, and choose to make it so. &nbsp;It's not even necessarily the cheapest way to buy that benefit. &nbsp;It's fine to have sold utilons for money, and say that you already traded those utilons for that money, and now EA needs to take care of its general image separately from that.</p><hr><p>There's only one really strong argument I've heard for why Good people who traded indirectly with FTX should hurt themselves more, sacrifice more, in repairing this - and it's that FTX claimed to be trying to accumulate money <i>in order to do good,</i> and so now Lawful Good itself should try to deny them that benefit of ill-gotten gains, to discourage the next person who considers betraying Lawfulness in the name of Goodness, from the hope that they can purchase greater-goods that way.</p><p>And that's... actually a completely valid consideration, in my own view! &nbsp;Logical decision theory isn't actually something that works among humans, but you should almost always end up doing what LDT would say to do anyways.</p><p>But if <i>you've </i>got not a whole lot of money and it would cost you a lot of hardship, maybe leave that consideration to somebody else. &nbsp;Maybe the next EA billionaire can figure out exactly how much FTX Future Fund spent, add interest, and pay that much back to FTX's victims. &nbsp;It's not something you have to do alone, or at all, if you're not best-placed to do it. &nbsp;Be kind to yourself, ask what a friend would tell you, when you judge how much hardship it would be to repay; because I'm worried I know too many people who are going to be way too harsh about that. &nbsp;If you're thinking that somebody on another continent is poorer than you - well, they are, and they're also poorer than a lot of FTX's customers, and you can donate to GiveDirectly if you think that's best for Earth; <i>mostly</i> I'd say that you should maybe just be a little more Lawful Neutral about the whole thing. &nbsp;You're a utility company, is all, and you sold FTXFF some utility.</p><p>I'm actually a bit skeptical that this <i>will</i> have been done in the name of Good, in the end. &nbsp;It didn't actually work out for the Good, and I really think a lot of us would have called that in advance.</p><p>My current guess is more that it'll turn out Alameda made a Big Mistake in mid-2022. &nbsp;And instead of letting Alameda go under and keeping the valuable FTX exchange as a source of philanthropic money, there was an impulse to pride, to not lose the appearance of invincibility, to not be so embarrassed and humbled, to not swallow the loss, to proceed within the less painful illusion of normality and hope the reckoning could be put off forever. &nbsp;It's a thing that happens a whole lot in finance! &nbsp;And not with utilitarians either! &nbsp;So we don't need to attribute causality here to a cold utilitarian calculation that it was better to gamble literally everything, because to keep growing Alameda+FTX was so much more valuable to Earth than keeping FTX at a slower growth rate. &nbsp;It seems to me to appear on the surface of things, if the best-current-guess stories I'm hearing are true, that FTX blew up in a way classically associated with financial orgs being emotional and selfish, <i>not</i> with doing first-order naive utilitarian calculations.</p><p>And if that's what was going on there, even if somebody at some point claimed that the coverup was being done in the name of Good, I don't really think it's all that much of Good's fault there - Good would really not have told you that would turn out well for Good in <i>even naive first-order thinking</i>, if Pride was not making the real decision there. &nbsp;Nor need Lawful Good reimburse it, unless Lawful Good can afford to be really incredibly scrupulous about that.</p><p>But what actually happened with FTX, we don't know yet, and I'm not a prediction market that you should take my speculations seriously.</p><hr><p>I say all this - well, first of all, because I think it's valid, and because I worry that people are going to be saying the opposite, that everyone must give all money back right now, as would make EA seem least vulnerable to imagined criticism (and some real criticism, to be fair, though the real criticism cares much less about what you actually do and much more about what they just wildly-guess / satisfyingly-imagine you're doing). &nbsp;I worry that people who hold the contrary viewpoint, that it's fine to just Lawful Neutrally trade utilons for money and undercharge to the extent you're Good, will feel inhibited and afraid from presenting this viewpoint if they hold it; and when that happens, in EA, I often do suspect that nobody else will dare to speak the contrary viewpoint, if not me.</p><p>But also I'm saying this, because I suspect / wildly guess that the pressure to sacrifice everything, to not reserve yourself for yourself, to always give and never trade, is possibly <i>entangled</i> with a kind of falling too far into utilitarianism; that <i>in some but not all people</i> there is a common mental motion between giving up yourself and your own needs and hurting yourself, and giving up the rules that should have held you back from hurting others. &nbsp;I worry that in the Peter Singer brand of altruism - that met with the Lesswrong Sequences which had a lot more Nozick libertarianism in it, and gave birth to effective altruism somewhere in the middle - there is too much Good and not enough Law; that it falls out of second-order rule utilitarianism and into first-order subjective utilitarianism; and rule utilitarianism is what you ought to practice unless you are a god. &nbsp;I worry there's a common mental motion (in some-not-all people) between hearing that they ought to ruin their suit to save a drowning child, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cujpciCqNbawBihhQ/self-integrity-and-the-drowning-child\">instead of taking an extra 15 seconds to pull off the suit first</a>; and people thinking that maybe they ought to go rob a bank, to save some children. &nbsp;But that part, about the psychology of some people who are not me, I'm a lot less sure of.</p><p>I do think that EA needs more of the spirit of people who say: &nbsp;\"Yeah, you pay me, and I'll get the job done that I said I'll do, and then it's my money and I'll use it to make myself happy; and that I'm a good person shows in how I'm undercharging for this and maybe went and accumulated professional expertise in a field where I'd be underpaid, but I still own myself and what I'm paid is still mine.\" &nbsp;I wish that I had more of that myself, and aspire to it, even, so I feel a bit of a hypocrite in saying it, but still.</p><p>But that more abstract issue can maybe be debated later; it is not as urgent. &nbsp;For now, I wanted to express a possibly-contrarian opinion about what people, some of whom may be in some hardship about it, are (not) morally obligated to do.</p>", "user": {"username": "EliezerYudkowsky"}}, {"_id": "mQzLtPPGfv89Xo4wC", "title": "GiveWell is hiring a Research Analyst (apply by November 20)", "postedAt": "2022-11-12T04:30:37.845Z", "htmlBody": "<p>GiveWell is looking for a <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/jobs/research-analyst\">Research Analyst</a> to join our core interventions team, which investigates and makes funding decisions about programs we're already supporting at scale, including our <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a>. <strong>The application deadline for this role is midnight Pacific Standard Time on Sunday, November 20.</strong> This role does not require any particular academic credentials or work experience.

Or whenever crudely calculating the most salient first-order consequences (in isolation) yields a positive number. This \u201cna\u00efve utilitarian\u201d decision procedure is clearly daft, and not something that any sound utilitarian actually advocates. On the other hand, critics sometimes mistake this point for the claim that utilitarianism <i>itself</i> is plainly counterproductive, and necessarily advocates against its own acceptance. While that\u2019s always a conceptual possibility, I don\u2019t think it has <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/is-non-consequentialism-self-effacing\">any empirical credibility</a>. Most who think otherwise are still making the mistake of conflating na\u00efve utilitarianism with utilitarianism proper. The latter is a much more prudent view, as I\u2019ll now explain.</p><h3>Adjusting for Bias</h3><p>Imagine an archer, trying to hit a target on a windy day. A naive archer might ignore the wind, aim directly at the target, and (predictably) miss as their arrow is blown off-course. A more sophisticated archer will deliberately re-calibrate, superficially seeming to aim \u201coff-target\u201d but in a way that makes them more likely to hit. Finally, a master archer will <i>automatically</i> adjust as needed, doing what (to her) seems obviously <i>how to hit the target</i>, though to a na\u00efve observer it might look like she was aiming awry.</p><p>Is the best way to be a successful archer on a windy day to <i>stop even trying to hit the target</i>? Surely not. (It\u2019s conceivable that an evil demon might interfere in such a way as to make this so \u2014 i.e., so that only people <i>genuinely</i> trying to miss would end up hitting the target \u2014 but that\u2019s a much weirder case than what we\u2019re talking about.) The point is just that <i>na\u00efve</i> targeting is likely to miss. Making appropriate adjustments to one\u2019s aim (overriding naive judgments of how to achieve the goal) is not at all the same thing as abandoning the goal altogether.</p><p>And so it goes in ethics. Crudely calculating the expected utility of (e.g.) murdering your rivals and harvesting their vital organs, and naively acting upon such first-pass calculations, would be predictably disastrous. This doesn\u2019t mean that you should abandon the goal of doing good. It just means that you should pursue it in a prudent rather than naive manner.</p><h3>Metacoherence prohibits na\u00efve utilitarianism</h3><p>\u201cBut doesn\u2019t utilitarianism direct us to maximize expected value?\u201d you may ask. Only in the same way that norms of archery direct our archer to hit the target. There\u2019s nothing in either norm that requires (or even permits) it to be pursued naively, without obviously-called-for bias adjustments.</p><p>This is something that has been stressed by utilitarian theorists from Mill and Sidgwick through to R.M. Hare, Pettit, and Railton\u2014to name but a few. Here\u2019s a pithy listing from <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/MACRUA-3\">J.L. Mackie</a> of six reasons why utilitarians oppose na\u00efve calculation as a decision procedure:</p><ol><li>Shortage of time and energy will in general preclude such calculations.</li><li>Even if time and energy are available, the relevant information commonly is not.</li><li>An agent's judgment on particular issues is likely to be distorted by his own interests and special affections.</li><li>Even if he were intellectually able to determine the right choice, weakness of will would be likely to impair his putting of it into effect.</li><li>Even decisions that are right in themselves and actions based on them are liable to be misused as precedents, so that they will encourage and seem to legitimate wrong actions that are superficially similar to them.</li><li>And, human nature being what it is, a practical working morality must not be too demanding: it is worse than useless to set standards so high that there is no real chance that actions will even approximate to them.</li></ol><p>For all these reasons and more (e.g. the risk of reputational harm to utilitarian ethics),<a href=\"#footnote-1\">1</a> <a href=\"https://www.utilitarianism.net/objections-to-utilitarianism/rights#accommodating-the-intuition\">violating people's rights is practically guaranteed to have negative expected value</a>. You should expect that most people who believe themselves to be the rare exception are mistaken in this belief. First-pass calculations that call for rights violations are thus <i>known to be typically erroneous</i>. Generally-beneficial rules are \u201cgenerally beneficial\u201d for a reason. Knowing this, it would be egregiously irrational to violate rights (or other generally-beneficial rules) on the basis of <i>unreliable </i>rough calculations suggesting that doing so has positive \u201cexpected value\u201d. <strong>Unreliable calculations don\u2019t reveal the true expected value of an action.</strong> Once you take into account the <i>known unreliability</i> of such crude calculations, and the far greater reliability of the opposing rule, the only reasonable conclusion is that the <i>all-things-considered</i> \u201cexpected value\u201d of violating the rule is in fact <i>extremely negative</i>.</p><p>Indeed, as I argued way back in my PhD dissertation, this is typically so clear-cut that it generally <i>shouldn\u2019t even occur</i> to prudent utilitarians to violate rights in pursuit of some nebulous \u201cgreater good\u201d\u2014any more than it occurs to a prudent driver that they could swerve into oncoming traffic. In this way, utilitarianism can even accommodate the thought that egregious violations should typically be <i>unthinkable</i>. (Of course one can imagine hypothetical exceptions\u2014ticking time bomb scenarios, and such\u2014but utilitarianism is no different from moderate deontology in that respect. I don\u2019t take such wild hypotheticals to be relevant to real-life practical ethics.)</p><h3>Prudent Utilitarians are Trustworthy</h3><p>In light of all this, I think (prudent, rational) utilitarians will be much more trustworthy than is typically assumed. It\u2019s easy to see how one might worry about being around na\u00efve utilitarians\u2014who knows what crazy things might seem positive-EV to them in any fleeting moment? But prudent utilitarians abide by the same co-operative norms as everyone else (just with heightened beneficence and related virtues), as Stefan Schubert &amp; Lucius Caviola explain in \u2018<a href=\"https://www.utilitarianism.net/guest-essays/virtues-for-real-world-utilitarians#8-utilitarianism-and-common-sense-virtues\">Virtues for Real-World Utilitarians</a>\u2019:</p><blockquote><p>While it may seem that utilitarians should engage in norm-breaking instrumental harm, a closer analysis reveals that it often carries large costs. It would lead to people taking precautions to safeguard against these kinds of harms, which would be costly for society. And it could harm utilitarians\u2019 reputation, which in turn could impair their ability to do good. In light of such considerations, many utilitarians have argued that it is <a href=\"https://www.utilitarianism.net/utilitarianism-and-practical-ethics#respecting-commonsense-moral-norms\">better to respect common sense norms</a>. Utilitarians should adopt ordinary virtues like honesty, trustworthiness, and kindness. There is a convergence with common sense morality\u2026 [except that] Utilitarians can massively increase their impact through cultivating some key virtues that are not sufficiently emphasized by common sense morality\u2026</p></blockquote><h3>This isn\u2019t Rule Utilitarianism</h3><p>I\u2019ve argued that prudent utilitarians will follow reliable rules as a means to performing <i>better actions</i>\u2014doing more good\u2014than they would through naively following unreliable, first-pass calculations. When higher-order evidence is taken into account, prudent actions are the ones that <i>actually</i> maximize expected value. It\u2019s a straightforwardly act-utilitarian view. Like the master archer, the prudent utilitarian\u2019s target hasn\u2019t changed from that of their na\u00efve counterpart. They\u2019re just pursuing the goal more competently, taking na\u00efve unreliability into account, and making the necessary adjustments for greater accuracy in light of known biases.</p><p>There are a range of possible alternatives to na\u00efve utilitarianism that aren\u2019t always clearly distinguished. Here\u2019s how I break them down:</p><p><strong>(1) Prudent (\u201cmulti-level\u201d) utilitarian:</strong> endorses act-utilitarianism in theory, motivated by utilitarian goals, takes into account higher-order evidence of unreliability and bias, and so uses good rules as a means to more reliably maximize (true) expected value.</p><p><strong>(2) Railton\u2019s \u201csophisticated\u201d utilitarian: </strong>endorses act-utilitarianism in theory, but has whatever (potentially non-utilitarian) motivations and reasoning they expect to be for the best.</p><p><strong>(3) Self-effacing utilitarian: </strong>Ex-utilitarian, gave up the view on the grounds that doing so would be for the best.</p><p><strong>(4) Rule utilitarian: </strong><a href=\"https://www.utilitarianism.net/types-of-utilitarianism#consequentialism\">not really consequentialist</a>; moral goal is not to do good, but just to act in conformity with <i>rules</i> that would do good in some specified \u2014 possibly distant \u2014 possible world.

Young adults will need to take on new jobs to stay afloat. Poor parents who looked at FTX for a way out will lose their trust and so much more in a system that continues to fail them. I hope those responsible for gambling money that wasn\u2019t theirs to gamble are held responsible, and I dearly hope FTX can find a way to repay the people who trusted them.</p><p>I grieve for those who trusted in FTX, and that includes people in the effective altruism community. We\u2019re not the victims \u2013 we benefited incredibly from Sam Bankman\u2013Fried and others at FTX over the past years. But, to my knowledge<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7ottihsotv\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7ottihsotv\">[1]</a></sup></span>, we had no idea that what appears to be fraud at this level was a possibility when we signed onto a billionaire\u2019s backing. Money changes the world, and I don\u2019t hate us for getting it. Up until this week, I had a very favorable impression of Sam Bankman-Fried. I saw him as an altruist who encapsulated what it meant to think big. No longer; doing good means acting with <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/ceas-guiding-principles\">integrity</a>. This feels like the moment that you learn that a childhood hero of yours might be no hero after all.</p><p>A lot just changed. Projects from people in the effective altruism community that I think would have genuinely improved the world, like pandemic preparedness initiatives and charity startups, may be delayed for years \u2013 or never arrive at all. Our community's entire trust networks, emphasis on ambition, and expectation that standout ideas need not be held back my insufficient funds feel as if they\u2019re beginning to shake, and it\u2019s not clear how much they\u2019ll withstand over the coming months. At a personal level, too, those grant applications I\u2019ve been waiting on to fund my past months of independent work seem awfully precarious. I know I\u2019ll be fine, but others won\u2019t be, including the people alive today and far beyond tomorrow who aspiring effective altruists are trying to help.</p><p><strong>That\u2019s something that weighs on me: while so much feels like it\u2019s changed, the problems in this world haven\u2019t</strong>. People will still die from preventable diseases today; we\u2019ll still experience a background noise of nuclear armageddon threats tomorrow; and emerging technologies coming in the next decades could still pose a threat to all sentient life.</p><p><strong>It\u2019s in this context \u2013&nbsp;a community that implicitly trusted FTX in their efforts to do good being shaken up and the world\u2019s problems staying awfully still \u2013&nbsp;that I\u2019m drawn back to effective altruism\u2019s core project: </strong><i><strong>trying to improve the world as much as we can with the resources that we have.</strong></i></p><p>Amidst everything shaking right now, I notice my personal commitment to effective altruism's <i>ideals</i> standing still. And I can picture my friends' commitments to effective altruism's ideals standing steadfast too. Over the past two years, engaging with this community has introduced me to some of the most incredible, kind-hearted people I know. I haven\u2019t talked to many of them as I\u2019ve tried to gather my thoughts over the past day, but I bet they too are still committed to creating a world better than the one they were born into.</p><p>Absolutely, we\u2019ll all need to reassess how we bring our altruistic projects to life and who we trust to back us. I'd be surprised if we don't uncover mistakes our community made over the past months, and I understand if people come to hate us by association with FTX. <strong>But I hope that if people outside the effective altruism community look closely, they\u2019ll see that </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/txGgPvKgZFpphdkHe/my-reaction-to-ftx-appalled\"><strong>we too are upset</strong></a><strong>, that </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mCCutDxCavtnhxhBR/some-comments-on-recent-ftx-related-events\"><strong>we don\u2019t endorse the ends justifying the means</strong></a><strong>, and that behind the name \u201cEA\u201d there\u2019s a group of people who really fucking care.</strong></p><p>I\u2019ll take some time away from work today, but I hope to get back to it soon.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn7ottihsotv\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref7ottihsotv\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>How much EA leaders knew about the business dealings that preceded FTXs downfall is a key question we need to be asking ourselves right now.

If you're like me, you read the forum sorted by Magic (New and Upvoted). But this promotes herd mentality. The <s>red-teaming and </s>self-criticism is excellent, but if the only way we aggregate how \"good\" is is by up-votes, that is flawed. Perhaps the best way to know that criticism has touched a nerve is to compute a fraction: how many members of the community disagree vs how many agree. (or, even better, if you are in an organization, use a weighted fraction, where you put lower weight on the people in the organization that are in positions of power (obviously difficult to implement in practice))<br>&nbsp;</p><p>2. More of you should consider <strong>anonymous posts</strong>. This is EA forum. I cannot believe that some of you delete your posts simply because it ends up being downvoted. Especially if you're working higher up in an EA org, you ought to be actively voicing your dissent and helping to monitor EA.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, this is not good:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\"Members of the mutinous cohort told me that the movement\u2019s leaders were not to be taken at their word\u2014that they would say anything in public to maximize impact. Some of the paranoia\u2014rumor-mill references to secret Google docs and ruthless clandestine councils\u2014seemed overstated, but there was a core cadre that exercised control over public messaging; its members debated, for example, how to formulate their position that climate change was probably not as important as runaway A.I. without sounding like denialists or jerks.\" (<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/15/the-reluctant-prophet-of-effective-altruism\">New Yorker</a>)</p></blockquote><p>What makes EA, <i>EA</i>, what makes EA antifragile, is its ruthless transparency. If we are self-censoring because we have <strong>already concluded something is super effective</strong>, then there is no point in EA. Go do your own thing with your own money. Become Bill Gates. But don't associate with EA.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Finances should be partially anonymized. <strong>If an EA org receives some money above a certain threshold from an individual contribution, we should be transparent in saying that we will reject said money if it is not donated anonymously.</strong> You may protest that this would decrease the number of donations by rich billionaires. But take it this way: if they donate to EA, it's because they believe that EA can spend it better. Thus, they should be willing to donate anonymously, to not affect how EA spends money. If they don't donate to EA, then they can establish a different philanthropic organization and hire EA-adjacent staff, making for more competition.

Sometimes, terrible things happen and life knocks you down. Do not give in to these moments or circumstances. You are needed, your efforts are worthwhile, and you do have a community that supports you.&nbsp;</p><h2>Resources</h2><h3><strong>Crisis Helplines</strong></h3><p>Crisis helplines are there for you when you need immediate support and don\u2019t know who to turn to, or maybe feel like there\u2019s not anyone you can turn to. They\u2019re confidential, free of charge, and often available 24/7. And they typically also provide support over online chat if speaking to someone over the phone isn\u2019t really your thing.</p><p>Therapy Route has provided&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.therapyroute.com/article/helplines-suicide-hotlines-and-crisis-lines-from-around-the-world\"><u>an article that lists helplines, crisis lines, and suicide hotlines for 176 countries</u></a><u> </u>(so nearly every country in the world).</p><p>A potentially more up-to-date list is that provided in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines\">this Wikipedia article</a>, which provides suicide crisis lines in 93 countries when I last checked.</p><ul><li>If you\u2019re based in the UK, an excellent crisis support line that we can personally vouch for, as it has helped one of us before, is that provided by <a href=\"https://www.samaritans.org/how-we-can-help/contact-samaritan/\">Samaritans</a>. Their number is 116 123.&nbsp;</li><li>If you\u2019re based in Ireland, you might find <a href=\"https://pieta.ie\">Pieta House</a> helpful.

We collected some examples for you:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://optionb.org\"><u>Option B</u></a>, inspired by Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant\u2019s book Option B, is an online resource for navigating hardship and finding a way forward when experiencing loss. It provides information for people looking for ways to care for themselves, care for others, and navigate grief.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/\"><u>Mind</u></a> is a UK-based mental health organization. It provides support guides for and information on all kinds of mental health experiences,<a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/guides-to-support-and-services/bereavement/experiences-of-grief/\">&nbsp;<u>including grief</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/tips-for-everyday-living/money-and-mental-health/\"><u>worries about money</u></a>.</li><li>The NHS offers a wide range of material for self-help, for <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/editPost?postId=mRmehL6Yuu9SozjNs&amp;key=e8cdaecde363f3fc668972d583126f#\">c<u>oping with money worries and job uncertainty</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/feelings-symptoms-behaviours/feelings-and-symptoms/anxiety-fear-panic/\"><u>anxiety and fear</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/feelings-symptoms-behaviours/feelings-and-symptoms/grief-bereavement-loss/\"><u>grief or loss</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/every-mind-matters/lifes-challenges/money-work-and-housing/\"><u>money, work, housing and discrimination</u></a>, among others.</li><li>If you\u2019d like to have assistance calming your mind on a daily basis, you can also try out apps such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mindease.io/\"><u>Mindease</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.calm.com/de\"><u>Calm</u></a>, an app providing you with all sorts of exercises to tackle worries and anxiety.</li></ul><p>The Mental Health Navigator lists several other support services in <a href=\"https://www.eamentalhealthnavigator.com/resources\">our data bank</a> as well, and we are working on adding more, and trying to ensure we have a greater diversity of resources across multiple countries currently underrepresented.</p><p>If you are reading this post and would like to add resources you have found helpful in the past, please leave them in the comments below. You never know who your recommendation might help.</p><h2>Supporting your peers</h2><p>There are a few ways to support your peers in the EA community, and the range of possibilities is growing.&nbsp;</p><p>For starters, you can share your experiences and support your peers in their experiences via the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/600419023315408/?hoisted_section_header_type=recently_seen&amp;multi_permalinks=6027171707306752\">Effective Altruism Peer Support group on Facebook</a>. The group allows for anonymous submissions if you prefer to share something anonymously.&nbsp;</p><p>You can do the same in the new <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/effectivepeersupport/shared_invite/zt-1mocp8wch-IEmFfrXwsSIRRxx7eBwO8A\">Effective Peer Support Slack</a> explained below and also find experienced helpers there that are up for having 1:1s with you. If you have experience supporting others, you can enter and add yourself as an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ztWUq7ZN21nlgU74O51zPfrDLi9WZy-9SvPhkpeWk1A/edit#gid=0\">experienced helper in this sheet</a>.</p><p>If you want training to feel comfortable supporting your peers, you may want to consider looking into Mental Health First Aid training or peer support training.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Mental Health First Aid training provides you with the tools to be able to help someone experiencing an acute crisis and get them the support they require. More information on Mental Health First Aid training and links to Mental Health First Aid training programs worldwide is available on the <a href=\"https://mhfainternational.org/international-mental-health-first-aid-programs/\">Mental Health First Aid International website</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;You can train yourself to become a certified peer supporter at <a href=\"https://www.7cups.com/academy/\">SevenCups Academy</a> for free. This includes courses that listeners can take to better understand life issues, psychological challenges, and ways to help.</li></ul><p>You can also join a peer support group through Effective Peer Support, which is still accepting applications for peer support groups planned to start around the end of this year and early next year. More information and the sign-up form are in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ihGLzqnnau5aBim3N/effective-peer-support-to-help-you-flourish-growing-your\">this EA Forum post</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/5FGY4PyEcT\">EA CoWorking Discord Server</a> is also a great place for feeling a sense of community and reminding yourself that you\u2019re not alone.</p><h2>Effective Peer Support Network</h2><p>The Mental Health Navigator has been approached with the idea of creating a peer support network. Rethink Wellbeing with Effective Peer Support offered to help out with this. In its usual form, Effective Peer Support will match peers based on needs and preferences, and let them train psychological skills in an organized and facilitated way. Due to the current emergency, we want to already provide an accessible support infrastructure before we can offer that. Sometimes all you need is a listening ear, motivating words, or ideas from someone who can relate to you. For this reason, the Mental Health Navigator and Rethink Wellbeing have set up an Effective Peer Support Slack.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/effectivepeersupport/shared_invite/zt-1mocp8wch-IEmFfrXwsSIRRxx7eBwO8A\"><u>Here, you can access the Effective Peer Support Slack</u></a>.</p><p>This Slack will hopefully become a space where you can connect with like-minded peers, and trained peer supporters to connect and talk about your current situation.&nbsp;</p><p>The way this will work is that the <strong>#peer-support channel </strong>will be a place where you can post about what you\u2019re going through and request support. Your peers will be able to respond by saying they are going through something similar or offering support as a trained helper. If you would like to anonymously make use of this peer support network, you can stay anonymous by simply using an email address without your name in it, and then choosing a nickname.</p><p>The <strong>#trained-helpers</strong> channel will be for people who are trained in peer support, and will serve as a place for you to connect with others trained in peer support. This is for you if you are someone who has professional experience or who has been trained in mental health first aid, such as through volunteering at a crisis center. We invite you to join this channel and add your information to the Trained Peer Support Helpers table pinned at the top of the #general channel.</p><p>The <strong>#general</strong> channel will be a space for the Slack admins to make announcements, and of course, there might be <strong>specific closed subgroups for peers going through similar situations</strong>. Feel free to suggest your ideas.</p><h3>Note of use</h3><p>Please note that anyone who participates in the Effective Peer Support Slack is responsible for his, her, or their own well-being. This Slack channel is set up to provide faster access to community support. It is not an emergency service or a professional listening service, though mental health professionals might add themselves to the list of peer support helpers. Anyone who is experiencing an emergency should reach out to an emergency number or a crisis line.</p><p>If you have any questions about this initiative, please reach out to Emily via <a href=\"mailto:ea.mh.navigator@gmail.com\">ea.mh.navigator@gmail.com</a> or Inga via inga_grossmann@gmx.de.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": null}, {"_id": "ReexceojC5mwDQwzX", "title": "For the mental health of those affected by the FTX crisis...", "postedAt": "2022-11-11T10:04:33.349Z", "htmlBody": "<p>There's a thing that happens when we're in crisis that feels like the world is collapsing around us, and all hope for the future feels lost.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether you worked for FTX, were relying on grant money from it, had savings held there that are now in question, or are just observing from the sidelines as friends and colleagues struggle with their new shattered reality, picking up the pieces can feel not just monumental, but impossible.</p><p>This mantra came to me after I was in very bad situation over a decade ago. In that situation, not all parts of this mantra were true, and it legitimately seemed like my life might be over, or utterly derailed for the perpetual worse even if not.&nbsp;</p><p>So the next time I faced crisis, I couldn't help but compare it to that one, and generalized to the other ways in which things weren't as bleak as they could have been. It has since helped me keep perspective and hope in lesser crises, and a number of my clients have reported being helped by it as well. So I thought I'd share it, in the hopes it helps you too:</p><p><i><strong>\"I'm going to be okay. I'm not dead, in the hospital, or in jail. I've still got my health, my family, and my friends. I'm going to be okay.\"</strong></i></p><p>This isn't done to diminish the losses and pain many of you are feeling. There's no one general platitude that will cover what everyone has lost or how they've been affected by any crisis. For some, maybe parts of that mantra <i>aren't</i> true, for complex reasons. Maybe not everyone has the same social support networks, which can definitely make crises much worse. Or perhaps someone is going through a medical crisis, and they've lost the income or savings or insurance they were relying on for treatment. And maybe some have lost friends over this, or will.</p><p>The point of the mantra is not to insist that you've lost nothing, or that life will be unchanged. Many have lost something, large or small, present or in the future, and it makes sense that it hurts. Many were hoping to do good with the opportunities and funding FTX provided, and those problems are still there in the world, and in need of solving.</p><p>But the core of who you are is still here, still capable of enjoying life and doing good, and in time what feels like the end of everything will, with some hope for a regression to the mean, mostly just be a sad memory.</p><p>Take an extra deep breath, now and then.

Your friends assign inherent value to the accuracy of their beliefs. It's not friendly to mess with them like that.</li><li>Lying to your friends also harms them instrumentally. When your friends have inaccurate beliefs, then they are less likely to achieve their goals.</li><li>And there's a third consideration. Lying to your friends <i>disempowers them</i>. That is, you diminish their ability to reliably influence their environment. It's as if you had stolen their car keys or locked them in a cupboard.<br><br>Not only must you care that your friends achieve what happens to be their goals, but you must also care that your friends are situated to achieve their goals whatever their goals might be. For example, if you steal money from a bank and give the money to your friend, but you tell your friend that you won the money in a poker game, then even if you have increased the likelihood that your friend's goals will be achieved, nonetheless you have placed your friend in a position such that were their goals different then they would not achieve those counterfactual goals.<br><br>This Empowerment Condition is a necessary condition for a relationship to be \"friendly\". (There is a difference between alignment and friendship.)</li></ul><p>Okay fine, don't lie to your friends. But what about everyone else?</p><p>Don't lie to them either.</p><p>Lying is a poor strategy <i>even on Machiavellian grounds.</i></p><ul><li>You might think \"If someone isn't my friend then what do I care whether I disempower them? If they're a stranger then I'm indifferent to their disempowerment, and if they're an enemy then I want to disempower them!\"</li><li>The problem is that people are likely to know things that demonstrate that you are lying.

However, I think it is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/binance/status/1590449161069268992\">starting to look increasingly likely</a> that, even if FTX's handling of its customer's money was not technically legally fraudulent, it seems likely to have been fraudulent in spirit.</p>\n<p>And regardless of whether FTX's business was in fact fraudulent, it is clear that many people\u2014customers and employees\u2014have been deeply hurt by FTX's collapse. People's life savings and careers were very rapidly wiped out. I think that compassion and support for those people is very important. In addition, I think there's another thing that we as a community have an obligation to do right now as well.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Assuming FTX's business was in fact fraudulent, I think that we\u2014as people who unknowingly benefitted from it and whose work for the world was potentially used to whitewash it\u2014have an obligation to condemn it in no uncertain terms. This is especially true for public figures who supported or were associated with FTX or its endeavors.</p>\n<p>I don't want a witch hunt, I don't think anyone should start pulling out pitchforks, and so I think we should avoid a focus on any individual people here. We likely won't know for a long time exactly who was responsible for what, nor do I think it really matters\u2014what's done is done, and what's important now is making very clear where EA stands with regards to fraudulent activity, not throwing any individual people under the bus.</p>\n<p>Right now, I think the best course of action is for us\u2014and I mean all of us, anyone who has any sort of a public platform\u2014to make clear that <strong>we don't support fraud done in the service of effective altruism.</strong> Regardless of what FTX did or did not do, I think that is a statement that should be clearly and unambiguously defensible and that we should be happy to stand by regardless of what comes out. And I think it is an important statement for us to make: outside observers will be looking to see what EA has to say about all of this, and I think we need to be very clear that fraud is not something that we ever support.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In that spirit, I think it's worth us carefully confronting the moral question here: is fraud in the service of raising money for effective causes wrong? This is a thorny moral question that is worth nuanced discussion, and I don't claim to have all the answers.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I think fraud in the service of effective altruism is basically unacceptable\u2014and that's as someone who is about as hardcore of a total utilitarian as it is possible to be.</p>\n<p>When we, as humans, consider whether or not it makes sense to break the rules for our own benefit, we are <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K9ZaZXDnL3SEmYZqB/ends-don-t-justify-means-among-humans\">running on corrupted hardware</a>: we are very good at justifying to ourselves that seizing money and power for own benefit is really for the good of everyone. If I found myself in a situation where it seemed to me like seizing power for myself was net good, I would worry that in fact I was fooling myself\u2014and even if I was pretty sure I wasn't fooling myself, I would still worry that I was falling prey to the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/unilateralist-s-curse\">unilateralist's curse</a> if it wasn't very clearly a good idea to others as well.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you're familiar with decision theory, you'll know that credibly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precommitment\">pre-committing</a> to follow certain principles\u2014such as never engaging in fraud\u2014is extremely advantageous, as it makes clear to other agents that you are a trustworthy actor who can be relied upon. In my opinion, I think such strategies of credible pre-commitments are extremely important for cooperation and coordination.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I will point out, if FTX did engage in fraud here, it was clearly in fact not a good idea in this case: I think the lasting consequences to EA\u2014and the damage caused by FTX to all of their customers and employees\u2014will likely outweigh the altruistic funding already provided by FTX to effective causes.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "evhub"}}, {"_id": "mCCutDxCavtnhxhBR", "title": "Some comments on recent FTX-related events", "postedAt": "2022-11-10T22:23:53.742Z", "htmlBody": "<p>\nIt appears that FTX, whose principals support the <a href=\"https://ftxfuturefund.org/about/\">FTX Foundation</a>, is in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX_(company)#Liquidity_crunch_and_investigations\">serious trouble</a>.

We will raise the bar for our giving, and we don\u2019t know how many existing projects that will affect, but we still expect longtermist projects to grow in terms of their impact and output.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Are the funds directed by Open Philanthropy invested in or otherwise exposed to FTX or related entities?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nNo.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>The FTX Foundation has quickly become a major funder of many longtermist and effective altruist organizations. If it stops (or greatly reduces) funding them, how might that affect Open Philanthropy\u2019s funding practices?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the FTX Foundation stops (or greatly reduces) funding such people and organizations, then Open Philanthropy will have to consider a substantially larger set of funding opportunities than we were considering before.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn this case, we will have to <strong>raise our bar</strong> for longtermist grantmaking: with more funding opportunities that we\u2019re choosing between, we\u2019ll have to fund a lower percentage of them. This means grants that we would\u2019ve made before might no longer be made, and/or we might want to provide smaller amounts of money to projects we previously would have supported more generously.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Does Open Philanthropy also need to raise its bar in light of general market movements (particularly the fall in META stock) and other factors?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nYes:\n</p>\n<ul>\n\n<li>Our available capital has fallen over the last year for these reasons. That said, as of now, <strong><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/dustin-moskovitz/?sh=22f5bc301dd3\">public</a> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/dustin-a-moskovitz/\">reports</a> of Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna\u2019s net worth give a substantially understated picture of our available resources</strong>. That\u2019s because, among other issues, they don\u2019t include resources that are already in foundations. (I also note that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/moskov/status/1585715752618770432?s=20&amp;t=J6v-JRZ-TmAme31195uGjA\">META stock is not as large a part of their portfolio</a> as some seem to assume.) Dustin and Cari still expect to spend nearly all of their resources in their lifetimes on philanthropy that aims to accomplish as much good per dollar as possible. \n\n</li><li>Additionally, the longtermist community has been growing; our rate of spending has been going up; and we expect both of these trends to continue. This further contributes to the need to raise our bar.\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nAs stated above, we remain committed to our focus areas and still expect to spend billions of dollars on them over the coming decades. \n</p>\n<p>\n \n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>So how much might Open Philanthropy raise its bar for longtermist grantmaking, and what does this mean for today\u2019s potential grantees?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nWe don\u2019t know yet \u2014 the news about FTX was sudden, and we\u2019re working to figure things out.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt\u2019s a priority for us to think through how much to raise the bar for longtermist grantmaking, and therefore what kinds of giving opportunities to fund. We hope to gain some clarity on this in the next month or so, but right now we\u2019re dealing with major new information and don\u2019t have a lot to say about what it means. It could mean reducing support for a lot of projects, or for relatively few.\n</p>\n<p>\n(We don\u2019t have a crisp formalization of \u201cthe bar\u201d; instead we have general guidance to grantmakers on what sorts of requests should be generously funded vs. carefully considered vs. rejected. We need to rethink and revise this guidance.)\n</p>\n<p>\nBecause of this, we are <strong>pausing most new longtermist funding commitments</strong> (that is, commitments within <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/potential-risks-advanced-ai/\">Potential Risks from Advanced Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/biosecurity-pandemic-preparedness/\">Biosecurity &amp; Pandemic Preparedness</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/effective-altruism-community-growth/\">Effective Altruism Community Growth</a>) until we gain more clarity, which we hope will be within a month or so. \n</p>\n<p>\nThis is a temporary pause as we try to reorient our thinking. There are many potential grantees we expect to ask to wait for a month or so, but are likely to fund in the next three months. It\u2019s not an absolute pause: we will continue to do some<strong> </strong>longtermist grantmaking, mostly when it is time-sensitive and seems highly likely to end up above our bar (this is especially likely for relatively small grants). Our existing calls for applications will remain open by default; we just will hold off on evaluating incoming applications in most cases, while the pause is in effect.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe\u2019ll also be honoring existing commitments and providing funding that\u2019s needed to avoid costly disruptions to core grantees\u2019 work.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Will Open Phil support FTX Foundation grantees who have financial needs related to these events?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nOpen Phil will consider grantees whose work falls in one of our focus areas, and evaluate them alongside other opportunities. As mentioned above, we are temporarily pausing most longtermist funding, but continuing to evaluate time-sensitive asks.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>How does this impact Open Philanthropy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/our-global-health-and-wellbeing-and-longtermism-grantmaking-portfolios/\">Global Health and Wellbeing</a> work?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nGiven FTX Foundation\u2019s focus on existential risk and longtermism, the most direct impacts are on our longtermist work. We don\u2019t anticipate any immediate changes to our Global Health and Wellbeing work as a result of the recent news.\n</p>\n<p>\n<strong>What do you think of allegations that FTX engaged in fraud and/or other unethical behavior?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nI don\u2019t understand the situation very well (and I have no special insight into it \u2013 I\u2019ve read the same tweets and news stories as everyone else), and it doesn\u2019t seem that all the facts are in. I will be following the situation as it develops.\n</p><p><strong>Edited to add (Nov. 13): </strong>I now think it\u2019s very likely that FTX engaged in outrageous, unacceptable fraud, as now noted at the top of this piece.</p>\n<p>\n<strong>Separate from the details of the FTX situation, do you think that fraud could be justified if it raises huge amounts of money for good causes?</strong>\n</p>\n<p>\nNo.\n</p>\n<p>\nI dislike \u201cend justify the means\u201d-type reasoning. The version of effective altruism I subscribe to is about being a good citizen, while ambitiously working toward a better world.

They\u2019ll often engage anyway if they like it, it catches their interest, it triggers them, they find it appealing, or they have a bias in favor of engaging.</p>\n<p>The overall result is a bias where long criticism is frequently ignored, especially if it\u2019s reasonable instead of baiting or triggering. This means most people rarely engage with complex or sophisticated criticism. That doesn\u2019t catch their interest well, and it\u2019s too long&nbsp;or too much work to understand, so then they don\u2019t put in the effort to engage. This systematic bias makes it harder for them to improve.</p>\n<p>People often think that if some ideas were actually good or important, someone else would engage with it. When many people think this way, the result is systematic biases. The types of ideas which this bias negatively affects include ideas which are counter-intuitive, don\u2019t give a good first impression, or seem like a lot of work to deal with.</p>\n<p>People\u2019s bias against long or difficult criticism frequently still applies to articles with a one paragraph summary near the start. The summary tends not to solve the problem. Sometimes people dismiss the arguments based on the simplified summary \u2013 they incorrectly try to use the summary to conclude that the criticism is wrong, even though they don\u2019t really understand it. Sometimes they notice some nuance or detail isn\u2019t covered in the summary, then assume it isn\u2019t covered in the full article nor in the author\u2019s mind (so if they asked a question about it, the author would already know the answer, but for some reason, good or bad, the author didn\u2019t preemptively address that issue in the already-long article). Sometimes people use a summary to mistakenly assume a criticism is the same as something else they\u2019ve heard before based on some partial similarity (or sometimes they correctly recognize that they already know it).</p>\n<p>Sometimes people fear responding to the summary, without reading the rest, because they don\u2019t want to say something which is addressed later in the article and therefore appear lazy or foolish. Whatever they have to say about the summary has a decent chance to be preemptively answered in the article somewhere, so saying it is risky. Skimming and search can help, but most people aren\u2019t very good at those skills, and even if done well you can miss stuff.</p>\n<p>If you respond to a summary, people may think you should have read the article and found the answer to your issue that was already there. You might get a reply referring you to the article section which answers you, at which point you would be expected to read that section and write another message, which is work you might not want to sign up for. Also, the section may not be independent of the other sections \u2013&nbsp;to understand it well, you might have to read all sections before it or maybe the whole article.</p>\n<p>So, people need methods to engage with longer criticism, so they don\u2019t just biasedly ignore most of it. The methods need to respect their time, effort, chance of looking foolish, and other concerns. As far as I know, little practical guidance has been offered for this issue. Most people don\u2019t seem especially interested in solving this problem. There doesn\u2019t seem to be much demand for a change. One might suspect many people don\u2019t really want to engage with criticism, which would explain why they aren\u2019t seeking better methods to enable engaging with more criticism.</p>\n<p>For those who would like to engage with criticism (or just with different or disagreeable ideas) more, I\u2019ll share two methods you could use. Many other methods could be developed. There\u2019s a lot of room for experimentation and progress; this stuff is under-explored. These are just two options. They\u2019re nothing like a complete representation of what methods could be used.</p>\n<p>Besides particular methods, it also helps to develop skills like getting more effective at skimming, speed reading, remembering what you read, organizing what you read (mentally or with notes, outlines or diagrams), and writing replies. The better you are at all those things, the lower cost there is to engage or partially engage. It\u2019s also easier to engage if you know your own ideas and arguments well and are a good, experienced writer. A lot of the difficulty people have with engaging with rival ideas or criticism is simply the difficulty of trying to formulate their own current ideas in writing.</p>\n<h2>Method: Reply to the First Important Error</h2>\n<p>In short, if a criticism is correct, you\u2019d want to engage with it. The scenario where you\u2019d rather not engage with the criticism is if it\u2019s incorrect. You could also do more detailed prioritization by considering how impactful the criticism is <em>according to its author</em>. You shouldn\u2019t judge how impactful it seems to you, decide it doesn\u2019t matter, and move on. That would be biased. You disagree with the author about whether it\u2019s true and what its consequences are. You shouldn\u2019t just assume you\u2019re right about the consequences. If the author persuaded you that the criticism is true, it\u2019s reasonably likely he could also persuade you to change your mind about its impact. If you\u2019re wrong about the truth of the criticism, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019re also wrong about its importance.</p>\n<p>Note: It\u2019s possible to have a discussion about the importance or impact of a criticism first, given the assumption that the criticism is true. Starting there, rather than by discussing the whether the criticism is correct, is uncommon. It requires skill at abstract thought and some ability to keep issues separate and track what the current discussion is (rather than getting distracted arguing with the assumed premise). And it requires using your opponent\u2019s claim as a premise and assuming it\u2019s true, which most people are uncomfortable with. But it\u2019s reasonable and useful, for people who have the skill, to sometimes discuss importance before truth.</p>\n<p>So, if you want to engage with correct criticisms, what can you do? Look for errors. If you read some, and see no errors, keep reading! Don\u2019t assume it\u2019s incorrect when everything you\u2019ve read so far is correct in your own opinion! Assuming it\u2019s incorrect because you don\u2019t like the conclusion, even though you have no refutation for any of the arguments so far, is biased.</p>\n<p>In general, as long as you\u2019re reading and finding no errors, it\u2019s a good article so far and it\u2019s worth continuing to read. There are some caveats and ways that could go wrong. But as a general rule of thumb, if you\u2019ve read some and found zero flaws, it\u2019s worth reading a little more. And if you still find zero flaws, that applies again. The biggest exception to this is relevance. Even if I don\u2019t see any flaws in an article about football, I still don\u2019t care about football. (And I don\u2019t make assertions about football for the article to contradict or criticize \u2013&nbsp;except my assertion that football is an optional interest and it\u2019s fine for me to not care. An article criticizing that specific claim, and arguing that interest in football is mandatory for moral or rational people, would be relevant to me. I\u2019ve never heard of such an article, I\u2019d be very skeptical, and I\u2019d expect it to be easy to find flaws in it. But if there was such an article and I couldn\u2019t find any flaws in the beginning, then I\u2019d keep reading and actually find that surprising and interesting.)</p>\n<p>If you do find an error, now you have a reason to stop reading. You now believe the criticism is incorrect. The error you stop for should be important. If it\u2019s just a typo, or something minor that wouldn\u2019t change the conclusion, then you shouldn\u2019t stop, since it doesn\u2019t give you any reason to judge the conclusion as false.</p>\n<p>So one method you might consider is read until you see an error, then you\u2019re done. However, you might have misunderstood it. Or the author might have a counter-argument to your criticism. It could be later in the article or in his head and ready to share (he can\u2019t preemptively include all his arguments in his article \u2013&nbsp;even a long book can\u2019t fit everything). The risk of a misunderstanding, or of other information you don\u2019t have addressing your criticism, is much higher than usual because you haven\u2019t read the whole article and also haven\u2019t conversed with the author at all.</p>\n<p>So what do you do? You say what the first error is. That gives the author a chance to point you to a rebuttal later in the article or respond with a rebuttal. At that point, if it doesn\u2019t change your mind, you should have noticed a <em>second error</em>. The reason you weren\u2019t persuaded should be a specific error. (What if you intuitively disagree, but can\u2019t explicitly point out an error? I have a section about that later.) If there is no error in the rebuttal that you can see, then it should change your mind. So you could say what the second error is.</p>\n<p>When should you stop if you keep pointing out errors and the author (or anyone else who agrees with him or her) keeps making counter-arguments? There are a lot of policies you could use. A simple policy is stop talking after you point out <strong>three</strong> errors (you read their reply to the third error, and if it doesn\u2019t convince you then you either say nothing or you say bye).</p>\n<p>Why point out three errors and then give up? Because it gives you three chances to change your mind. It makes you look for specific errors instead of dismissing something for unspecific reasons (this helps combat your own potential bias). It gives the author a few chances to engage with you and persuade you. It\u2019s a limited amount of effort that respects your time, but it\u2019s more engagement than typical, so even if you miss out on some important ideas because you didn\u2019t engage more, at least you gave it a better try than most people do.</p>\n<p>If everyone adopted a \u201cthree error limit\u201d policy, I think it would improve the world significantly. It\u2019s flawed but good enough to make a difference. Why is it flawed? Well, you\u2019re ending the discussion because of three claims <em>which are in dispute</em>. You might be wrong. Stopping after three errors is a simple, imperfect compromise between truth-seeking and limiting the effort you expend. There are other approaches which may be able to get more truth-seeking benefit per cost. However, many other methods don\u2019t have a fixed limit on cost, so it used incorrectly you can get a bad outcome, but if used well with high skill then they can potentially do better. (<a href=\"https://www.elliottemple.com/essays/debates-and-impasse-chains\">Impasse chains</a> are an example of more complicated method. And more broadly any method with <em>robust failsafes</em>, where other people can escalate and correct you if you\u2019re screwing up, has advantages but also potential downsides due to the lack of a hard limit on effort. Having a <a href=\"https://criticalfallibilism.com/my-experience-with-my-debate-policy/\">public debate policy</a> is an example of a failsafe.)</p>\n<p>People commonly think things are wrong without identifying any specific, important error. Then they\u2019re dismissive. That is biased. Responding to the first error (up to three times max) helps a lot because it allows some engagement with critics and people from other (sub)cultures and it gets you to think in terms of specific errors and put them into words. One of the main reasons people don\u2019t do this is they aren\u2019t very good at spotting errors or writing their thoughts in words. It\u2019d take them a long time to write a one paragraph statement of an error, and they\u2019d find the writing process hard, and the writing wouldn\u2019t be very clear. If that\u2019s you, and you care about rationality and truth seeking, then I suggest improving your writing and thinking skills until you no longer have that excuse for ignoring critical articles.</p>\n<h3>What Is an Error?</h3>\n<p>People often think there is an error because an article claims X and they already believe X is wrong for some reason. Claims that you disagree with aren\u2019t errors. That\u2019s not what identifying a mistake is.</p>\n<p>Examples of errors include faulty reasoning, a bad argument, an unexplained claim that needed an explanation, some incorrect facts. But simply having a different conclusion than you do isn\u2019t an error. It may be due to errors, but you need to figure out where they went wrong in reaching the conclusion.</p>\n<p>If they don\u2019t explain their reasoning for a conclusion you disagree with, there are two main possibilities. One, they aren\u2019t arguing their case and that\u2019s an error. Or, two, their article is focused on something else. You disagree with something that isn\u2019t their main topic. It\u2019s common that people use premises you disagree with and don\u2019t argue for their premises in the current article. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. You can respond by asking them to link or cite arguments for the premise you disagree with that are written down in a different article or book. The reasoning should be written down somewhere.</p>\n<h3>What To Start Reading?</h3>\n<p>No one has time to start reading every article published. There are way too many people in the world writing too many articles. I\u2019ve been talking about how to deal with an article you\u2019re looking at. But which articles should you look at at all?</p>\n<p>If everyone kept the same policies for what articles they pay any attention to \u2013 notice exist, read the first few paragraphs of, etc. \u2013 then I think the policy I\u2019m suggesting (look for the first error) would help. Improvements in what people read in the first place are possible but not necessary.</p>\n<p>Some people already do pay a little attention to some criticism. Then they often dismiss it as bad and wrong without clearly identifying a specific error. That\u2019s a mistake.</p>\n<p>To further save time, you could also limit your comments about the first error in an article to authors who seem potentially interested in debate. A lot of authors are just going to ignore you, and that\u2019s often predictable in advance. It\u2019s good to test that sometimes. You might be miscalibrated in your estimates about who won\u2019t reply to you. You should occasionally check, especially in borderline cases but also now and then in cases you\u2019re highly confident about. You don\u2019t have to do all the checking personally though: if you see someone else share a criticism and get ignored, and you see someone else request a debate and get ignored, then you can use that data.</p>\n<h3>Replying to Any Error</h3>\n<p>A variant method is to skim and reply to the most important, or first, error that you find. Skimming involves skipping text and sometimes reading out of order.</p>\n<p>The main point is to reply to one error that you find quickly. It doesn\u2019t really matter if it comes first in the article, although it tends to be easier to reply to earlier errors. Later parts of articles have dependencies and back-references to earlier parts, so engaging with them is more complicated. Earlier parts have less leading up to them, so they stand on their own more.</p>\n<p>If you read up to some point and think something is an error, there is a risk that if you read the rest of the article you would change your mind. However, if you skim around and think something is an error, there is a risk that if you read the rest of the article <em>before</em> the error, you\u2019d change your mind. The risk of changing your mind due to unread earlier text is higher than the risk due to unread later text (for the same amount of text). So replying to the first error \u2013 and reading all the text before it \u2013&nbsp;is lower risk than skipping parts or reading parts out of order.</p>\n<h3>Intuitive Disagreement</h3>\n<p>What if you intuitively disagree with something but don\u2019t know how to point out a specific error in English sentences? Intuition can be used in rational, explicit debates. See my article <a href=\"https://criticalfallibilism.com/intuition-and-rational-debate/\">Intuition and Rational Debate</a>.</p>\n<p>For more information on this subject, see my related articles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://criticalfallibilism.com/dont-suppress-your-intuition/\">Don\u2019t Suppress Your Intuition</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://criticalfallibilism.com/intuition-and-rationality/\">Intuition and Rationality</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://criticalfallibilism.com/intuition-is-part-of-rational-living/\">Intuition Is Part of Rational Living</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://criticalfallibilism.com/conscious-and-subconscious-ideas/\">Conscious and Subconscious Ideas</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some people think only explicit ideas in language are rational. Some people think that if you can\u2019t explain your disagreement, then you should be assumed wrong. Some people think if you can\u2019t argue your case, then you\u2019ve lose the debate and should change your mind. I am not one of those people. I think those people are wrong. If any of them are reading this, I challenge them to debate. I\u2019m good at explicit debate, and I will stand up for other more intuitive thinkers. Dismissing intuitive ideas is a type of biased bullying. If you\u2019ve ever been pressured by people who make clever arguments, while you struggled due to inferior rhetorical skills, you may enjoy my articles about intuition.</p>\n<h2>Method: Ask If Author Would Debate</h2>\n<p>One of problems with reading a long article, and having a bunch of criticism of it, is the author usually won\u2019t engage with you. You put in all this work and you\u2019re ready to engage, but then they don\u2019t want to.</p>\n<p>A simple solution is, before reading the article, you ask the author if they\u2019d want a serious conversation, a debate, or something like that. Then you only read the article if they say \u201cyes\u201d. In this way, you\u2019ll only read maybe one out of ten long articles, which is a big time and effort savings. And for the ones you do read, you\u2019ll have a much higher chance of getting a good discussion. Also, the ones you read will be more likely than average to be high quality, because authors who are willing to engage in discussion about their articles tend to be above average (especially authors who agree to discuss in advance and directly say that they will, instead of wanting to keep their options open so that if your criticism is too challenging they can silently ignore it).</p>\n<p>You should probably develop good skimming skills and give the article a brief skim before you ask the author about a conversation. You should at least check that the article\u2019s topics are relevant to you. Sometimes titles are vague, or are even misleading, about what most of an article is about. When considering relevance, ask yourself \u201cIf this were true&nbsp;\u2013 if the author were right about all his claims \u2013 then would it be relevant, important or interesting to me? Would that affect anything I do in my life?\u201d It\u2019s pretty common for people&nbsp;to incorrectly treat something as irrelevant because they believe it\u2019s false, but that\u2019s a bias. Relevance and falsity are separate issues. To avoid that error, imagine and assume it\u2019s true when considering relevance.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a widespread problem where people dismiss ideas as wrong without pointing out any specific error or even identifying an error in their own mind. There\u2019s also a widespread problem where large groups of people are systematically biased against engaging with long, complex criticism, even though some of the most important criticisms are long and complex (and counter-intuitive, surprising, weird, etc.). I\u2019ve suggested some methods that can help. This area is under-explored, seemingly due to lack of interest in doing better, so I think other useful methods could be developed fairly rapidly if people actually wanted to.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Elliot Temple"}}, {"_id": "ozKXkqccvEqqvKxhE", "title": "Subsidies: Which reforms can help animals?", "postedAt": "2022-11-10T15:28:27.511Z", "htmlBody": "<h2><strong>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</strong></h2><p>To do as much good for animals as we can, it is important to understand the systems that are causing animals to suffer and die - and how to reform those systems to help animals.</p><p>One way to reform modern animal agriculture is through subsidies. Subsidies are payments made by governments to businesses or people. Some subsidies can have profound effects on the lives of animals. For example, governments can pay farmers to produce more meat, which can harm animals. On the other hand, governments can pay farmers to adopt practices that improve animal welfare, which can help animals. Promoting or abolishing these subsidies could therefore be an effective way for animal advocacy organisations to do good for animals.</p><p>In this report, we examine five types of subsidy reforms in animal agriculture, and we evaluate which of these reforms could be impactful campaign options for animal advocacy organisations.</p><p><strong>Promoting welfare-conditional subsidies appears to be an impactful campaign</strong>. This type of subsidy involves the government paying farmers to adopt higher-welfare practices. Evidence from Switzerland and the EU suggests that this type of subsidy can bring concrete improvements in animal welfare, and tentatively even reduce the production of animal products, so long as the subsidies are well-designed.</p><p><strong>Abolishing or reducing subsidies for meat production also has the potential to be an impactful campaign, but additional research is needed first and this is context-dependent</strong>. Initial studies suggest that abolishing these subsidies could decrease animal production. But there is also the risk that abolishing these subsidies could shift production away from cows and towards chickens, which could result in more animal suffering and death overall. Before any campaigns take place, a more sophisticated economic analysis is needed to provide more detail about the contexts in which this campaign could be good for animals.</p><p>The other three options we examined do not appear capable of helping animals. These options were abolishing <strong>subsidies for feed crops, promoting subsidies for plant-based foods, and abolishing fisheries subsidies</strong>. Each of these three options <strong>would either achieve nothing or even possibly harm animals</strong>.</p><p><strong>We recommend that animal advocacy organisations consider campaigning for welfare-conditional subsidies</strong>, by which farmers are paid for adopting higher-welfare practices. This could involve increasing these subsidies in places where they already exist (Switzerland, the EU, and England) or establishing them in further countries. And we note that although this is the most promising subsidy campaign, the context in a particular country will determine if this campaign has a higher impact overall than other animal advocacy campaigns. <strong>This campaign should be one of many that organisations systematically analyse</strong> when considering which campaign would do the most good for animals.</p><p>We also recommend that a detailed economic study be conducted on the effects of abolishing subsidies for meat production. Such a study could unlock an opportunity for another high-impact campaign.</p><p>Lastly, we conclude with some strategic considerations that may help organisations campaign for subsidy reform.</p><p>Table 1.

Subsidies can take the form of direct payments; grants; tax concessions; cheaper loans or loan guarantees; infrastructure support, like servicing a road to a factory; and market price support, where the government raises the price of products artificially&nbsp;(1). Subsidies in some parts of society can do a lot of good, such as by promoting education and paying for scientific research. However, in animal agriculture, subsidies can have profound effects on the lives of animals for both good and bad.</p><h2><strong>Background to subsidies in animal agriculture</strong></h2><p>Subsidies in animal agriculture are a powerful policy tool that can influence production and consumption, thereby affecting the lives of animals<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>On the producer side, governments can provide subsidies to farmers or processors of animal products&nbsp;(2). Chicken meat, pig meat, sheep meat, bovine meat, and eggs are all among the top ten most subsidised food products globally&nbsp;(2). Similarly, governments can provide subsidies to farmers who produce crops that are used to feed farmed animals&nbsp;(3,4). One well-studied and controversial example of crop subsidies is the programme in the US - in 2021, the US government spent USD 100 billion on farm support, and that farm support made up over 10% of the total money earned by farmers&nbsp;(5). These types of support may be direct (e.g. cash payment) or indirect (e.g. keeping prices at some artificial level to encourage production). Subsidies also exist in wild-caught fisheries, where government support can make fishing more profitable than it would otherwise be&nbsp;(6). Globally, these subsidies have been estimated at around USD 35 billion in 2009, with Japan, China, and the US together making up about one-third of that sum&nbsp;(6).</p><p>Governments may also provide subsidies that encourage farmers to adopt higher-welfare practices. Switzerland and the European Union both have systems in which farmers can receive payments for implementing higher-welfare practices, and England is currently developing a similar system&nbsp;(7\u20139).</p><p>On the consumer side, governments can provide subsidies to reduce the price of particular foods, like fruits and vegetables, to incentivise people to buy more of those foods rather than animal products&nbsp;(10\u201313). Governments generally consider this type of policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or to promote human health, not to help animals&nbsp;(12).</p><h2><strong>Options for reform</strong></h2><p>Although there are a range of subsidies that affect the lives of animals, not all of these subsidies present effective avenues by which to improve the lives of animals. In this report, we focus on two key subsidy reforms that could be effective in helping animals. These are:</p><ul><li>Increasing subsidies that encourage producers to adopt higher-welfare practices. The evidence suggests that these subsidies can bring concrete improvements for animal welfare, and there is even tentative evidence that these subsidies can reduce the production and consumption of meat. We conclude that increasing these welfare-conditional subsidies has the potential to improve the lives of animals, so long as the subsidies are well-designed.</li><li>Reducing subsidies that support the production of animal products. Although this reform looks promising, there needs to be additional research on the effects of this reform across the entire economy before the movement can be confident that this reform is an effective way to help animals.</li></ul><p>Other subsidy reforms have been proposed, but the evidence suggests that these are ineffective in helping animals (reducing subsidies for feed crops, increasing subsidies for plant-based foods, and reducing fisheries subsidies). At the end of this report, we will explain the reasons why these appear ineffective.</p><h1>INCREASING WELFARE-CONDITIONAL SUBSIDIES</h1><p>Welfare-conditional subsidies involve the government giving subsidies to farmers who adopt particular practices that are better for animal welfare. For example, a government could make regular payments to farmers whose welfare practices exceed the legal requirements; or a government could make one-off grants to help farmers invest in the equipment needed for higher-welfare systems; or a government could make existing subsidies conditional on meeting new animal welfare requirements. To our knowledge, welfare-conditional subsidies currently exist in the EU and Switzerland, and they are also currently under development in England. A campaign could focus on increasing existing welfare-conditional subsidies paid inside these jurisdictions, amending those existing subsidies to do even more good for animals, or it could focus on establishing new welfare-conditional subsidies in further countries.</p><p>Campaigning for welfare-conditional subsidies can improve the lives of animals in two ways (Figure 1). Primarily, these subsidies can directly encourage farmers to adopt higher-welfare practices or systems, which allow animals to be farmed in a way that causes less suffering. Indirectly, these subsidies can reduce the amount of animals that can be produced in a country (e.g. by reducing stocking densities or increasing the cost of production) - in some cases, this may lead to fewer animals being farmed overall. There is also a risk that this policy could switch production from larger animals to chickens, which would be bad for animals overall, but we think this is only a risk if the welfare-conditional subsidies are specific to large animals. (This risk is also discussed below, 'Reducing subsidies for meat and animal products'.)</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668094302/mirroredImages/ozKXkqccvEqqvKxhE/zm5eykdc0q2saylr0vik.png\"></p><p>Figure 1. Theory of change for increasing welfare-conditional subsidies.</p><p>Like all policies, the specifics are very important. Whether this type of subsidy can improve the lives of animals depends on a few key details:</p><ul><li>Is the subsidy incentivising farmers to actually change their practices? The payments need to encourage farmers to conduct practices or adopt systems that are not already in use, rather than simply paying farmers for things that the farmers are already doing.</li><li>Does the subsidy pay enough to incentivise farmers to participate? The payments need to be high enough to compensate farmers for additional costs or lost income.</li><li>Are the new practices or systems actually better for animal welfare? The practices need to represent genuine improvements for animals.</li><li>(Bonus) Could the subsidies also cause a reduction in the number of animals farmed? If the subsidies can cause fewer animals to be produced, then this can magnify the impact for animals.</li></ul><p>Below, we summarise the evidence from existing welfare-conditional subsidies that this type of policy can indeed improve animal welfare - and, tentatively, reduce the number of animals farmed.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Switzerland's example</strong></h2><p>The first example of welfare-conditional subsidies comes from Switzerland, which has a system of voluntary payments for specific animal welfare improvements. These subsidies are governed by the&nbsp;<i>Direktzahlungsverordnung&nbsp;</i>(Direct Payment Ordinance)&nbsp;(14).</p><p>Switzerland's welfare-conditional subsidies are divided into two categories:</p><ul><li>RAUS (<i>regelm\u00e4ssiger Auslauf im Freien</i>), which offers payments to farmers who allow animals regular outdoor exercise.</li><li>BTS (<i>besonders tierfreundliche Stallhaltungssysteme</i>), which offers payments to farmers who keep animals in higher-welfare housing systems.</li></ul><p>Subsidies are offered to farmers of a wide range of animals: broilers, laying hens, pigs, cows, horses, goats, sheep, rabbits, turkeys, deer, and bison&nbsp;(14). Some payments are only offered for some types of animals, and there are also some restrictions by the age and sex of animals. Both types of subsidies are associated with government labels&nbsp;(9).</p><p>The uptake of the subsidies is very high (Table 2). RAUS and BTS payments each correspond to over half of Switzerland's populations of laying hens, pigs, and cows. BTS payments in particular cover 97% of broilers, 93% of laying hens, and 68% of pigs&nbsp;(15).</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Uptake of RAUS (% of livestock units)</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Uptake of BTS (% of livestock units)</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Broilers</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>8%</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>97%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Laying hens</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>82%</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>93%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Pigs</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>51%</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>68%</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Cows</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>84%</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>59%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Table 2. The uptake of welfare-conditional subsidies in Switzerland in 2019&nbsp;(15). The two components of Switzerland's animal welfare subsidy system are RAUS (<i>regelm\u00e4ssiger Auslauf im Freien</i> / regular outdoor exercise) and BTS (<i>Besonders tierfreundliche Stallhaltungssysteme</i> / animal-friendly housing systems).</p><p>There have been several scientific studies on how Switzerland's welfare-conditional subsidies benefit animals.</p><p>Bianchi&nbsp;(9) measured the effect of Switzerland's welfare-conditional subsidies on the production and consumption of meat from pigs, chickens, and bovines. The study analysed data on meat production between 1970 and 2013 (the RAUS and BTS schemes were established in 1993 and 1996, respectively). The study compared Switzerland's production to a synthetic control group composed of a weighted combination of neighbouring countries. This allowed the author to produce a counterfactual trend, which estimates how Switzerland's meat production would have evolved had the subsidies not been established.</p><p>The study concluded that Switzerland's production of both pig and chicken meat (but not bovine meat) were both lower than they would have been had the subsidies not been established. In 2010, the production of pig meat was about 60,000 tonnes (19%) lower than it would have been without subsidies; in the same year, the production of chicken meat was about 23,000 tonnes (27%) lower than it would have been without subsidies.</p><p>The study also found a similar decrease in the total domestic supply of meat, which rules out the possibility that the decrease in production was countered by an increase in imports; rather, the evidence shows that both production and consumption decreased. Switzerland's meat sector does not depend heavily on imports, which the author speculates may be because consumers have a strong preference for national products. A similar scenario could also arise if the domestic industry is protected through tariffs or quality standards. This study provides evidence that the welfare-conditional subsidies can reduce the overall number of animals farmed.</p><p>Cagienard&nbsp;<i>et al.</i>&nbsp;(16) examined the effects of the BTS scheme on the welfare of pigs. The authors compared 47 farms participating in the BTS scheme (higher-welfare housing) and 37 farms using conventional, lower-welfare housing. The authors conducted group and individual examinations to gather data on numerous welfare indicators, including lesions, lameness, respiratory disease, diarrhoea, ear biting, skin abnormalities, injuries, abscesses, sunburn, recumbency, ill-thrift, and behavioural abnormalities. Farms participating in the BTS subsidy program were associated with higher health and welfare of pigs.</p><p>Van Aken&nbsp;<i>et al.</i>&nbsp;(17) examined the effects of the BTS scheme on the welfare of cows. The authors compared 179 farmers participating in the BTS scheme (higher-welfare housing, including free stalls and increased lying comfort) and 229 farmers using conventional housing (tie stalls). The authors collected data on a number of welfare indicators, including udder health problems, veterinary costs, and antibiotic treatments. Farms in the BTS subsidy program were associated with higher health and welfare of cows.</p><p>These studies provide some evidence that Switzerland's subsidy system can improve animal welfare and even reduce the number of animals farmed. Some knowledge gaps remain. Although the welfare effects of the BTS scheme have been studied, the welfare effects of the RAUS scheme have not. Also, there has been no rigorous scientific study on whether either subsidy system causes an improvement in the health and welfare of chickens.</p><p>Another weakness in the evidence on Switzerland's subsidy system is that the two studies on the welfare benefits of the BTS scheme were observational&nbsp;(16,17). Strictly speaking, these studies cannot determine whether participation in the BTS scheme actually caused the welfare improvements. It is possible that the farmers who participate in the scheme are simply the farmers who are more enthusiastic about animal welfare. This would also manifest as a correlation between participation in the BTS scheme and higher animal welfare, meaning that the two studies cannot demonstrate that participation in the BTS scheme actually caused higher animal welfare.</p><h2><strong>The European Union's example</strong></h2><p>The second example of welfare-conditional subsidies comes from the European Union (EU). In the EU, the key policy regulating agriculture is the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The CAP has a broad scope - it aims to provide income to farmers, improve productivity and food supply, and achieve a collection of goals for society, like addressing climate change and maintaining rural communities.</p><p>The CAP has some mechanisms by which subsidies are provided to farmers who protect animal welfare. There are two types of payments that farmers in the EU can receive for animal welfare&nbsp;(8). Pillar I payments are the standard payments received by farmers. These payments are reduced if farmers are found to be non-compliant with animal welfare legislation. Pillar II payments are additional payments for animal welfare practices that go beyond the existing legislation and aim to compensate farmers for lost income or costs incurred. Member States can choose to offer these Pillar II payments to their farmers&nbsp;(18).</p><p>However, when it comes to animal welfare, the CAP has a number of shortcomings. The CAP has been criticised as promoting an industrialised farming system, with negative consequences for animal welfare&nbsp;(19). Member States provide only a small budget for animal welfare payments at best, with many Member States providing no money for animal welfare at all&nbsp;(20) (Figure 2). The voluntary payments made by Member States are targeted towards dairy cows in most countries&nbsp;(21). This is at odds with the fact that, across the EU, farmed chickens, rabbits, and pigs are far more numerous&nbsp;(22,23). Ryland&nbsp;(24) calls the 2014-2020 implementation of the CAP 'disappointing' due to the failure to explicitly or directly improve farm animal welfare. This has only partially improved in the 2023-2027 implementation of the CAP, with animal welfare included under the heading of 'protect food and health quality'&nbsp;(25).</p><p>Under the CAP, animal welfare is mostly addressed through rural development measures. The CAP measure best suited for voluntary improvements of animal welfare is M14 - Animal Welfare (under Pillar II)&nbsp;(8). There are other measures that can influence animal welfare, but M14 is most effective at fostering a set of coherent animal welfare practices&nbsp;(8).</p><p>However, M14 has not been widely implemented. Only 34 out of 118 rural development programmes across 17 Member States have implemented M14, and these have mostly targeted dairy cows and pigs&nbsp;(8). Figure 2 illustrates the differences in spending on M14 across Member States&nbsp;(26).</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668094302/mirroredImages/ozKXkqccvEqqvKxhE/sqme3oivps8okbiwep0r.png\"></p><p>Figure 2. Spending on the measure M14 (animal welfare) in EU Member States in 2014-2020 in millions of euros. Graph from European Court of Auditors&nbsp;(26).</p><p>There is reason for optimism: where animal welfare has been addressed through M14 and other rural development measures, it has often succeeded in improving animal welfare. There are examples of M14 measures targeting chickens, pigs, cows, sheep, goats, rabbits, and ducks&nbsp;(8). Successful examples have been most frequently identified for dairy cows - there are far fewer successful examples for pigs and chickens, and there are none for rabbits. For example, for chicken farms, measures have provided enrichment, free housing, microclimate control, outdoor access, and larger space allowances&nbsp;(8). On the other hand, there have also been unsuccessful examples - in some cases, voluntary schemes under M14 overlap with private certification schemes, meaning that the M14 payments do not bring any actual benefit. Worryingly, there have even been cases where M14 payments have been made to farms that do not even meet the minimum legal requirements for animal welfare.</p><p>There has been no monitoring and evaluation by the EU of the actual effects of M14 on animal welfare&nbsp;(26). It is unclear how many animals are covered by M14.</p><p>The European Economic Interest Group, in a report commissioned by the European Commission, concluded that Member States should implement more voluntary animal welfare measures to make the CAP more effective at improving animal welfare&nbsp;(8). This Group also recommended that such measures offer payments large enough to incentivise farmers to participate - farmers have often complained that payments are insufficient to justify adopting higher-welfare practices. In contrast, payments offered by Spain to sheep and goat farmers in Castilla La Mancha were sufficient to cover a high proportion of animals&nbsp;(8).</p><p>At the level of the EU, the CAP itself undergoes periodic reform, with the next reform scheduled for between 2025 and 2027&nbsp;(27). Although reform at the level of the EU may be preferable for various reasons (e.g. to avert concerns about making a single country's industry less competitive&nbsp;(28)), it is not plausible to reform the CAP outside of the specific reform period. Outside of that period, it would be far more tractable for organisations to work at the level of the Member State. Member States have the ability to establish payments for particular voluntary animal welfare commitments (Pillar II), and animal advocacy organisations can campaign for Member States to do so. However, these campaigns may also need to wait for particular time periods, as Member States generally develop their strategic plans for implementing the CAP in certain windows.</p><h2><strong>England's example</strong></h2><p>The third example of welfare-conditional subsidies comes from England, although this subsidy programme has not been implemented yet. After leaving the EU, the UK passed the Agriculture Act 2020. This Act, which is mostly relevant to England, operates on the principle of 'public money for public goods' - farmers will be paid for providing public goods, including animal welfare - plus other things like land and water management, public access to the countryside, cultural and natural heritage, reducing environmental hazards, mitigating climate change, and conservation of biodiversity&nbsp;(7).</p><p>The Transition Plan&nbsp;(29) lists some ways in which payments might be used to promote animal health and welfare:</p><ul><li>Health and disease support to control and eradicate animal diseases</li><li>Capital grants to fund investments that improve animal welfare</li><li>Payments to farmers where animal welfare is continually demonstrated</li></ul><p>England is currently in an agricultural transition period, during which the specifics of these subsidy systems are being developed. These subsidies will be introduced in full from 2024&nbsp;(29).</p><h2><strong>Implementing welfare-conditional subsidies in further countries</strong></h2><p>Organisations interested in campaigning for new welfare-conditional subsidies can maximise their impact for animals by influencing the specific details of the subsidy policy. We know what factors are likely to influence the impact of a welfare-conditional subsidy policy. These factors are summarised in Table 3.</p><p>The main effect of welfare-conditional subsidies is to improve the welfare of the animals covered by the subsidies. All else being equal, we can expect to help more animals if there are more animals in a jurisdiction, if a higher proportion of animals are covered by the subsidy, if a higher proportion of animals experience welfare improvements from the subsidy that they would not have otherwise, and if the welfare improvement itself is substantial.</p><p>The secondary effect of welfare-conditional subsidies is to decrease the number of animals farmed overall. All else being equal, we can expect to reduce the number of animals farmed by a larger amount if the subsidy causes a decrease in domestic production (e.g. by increasing cost or reducing stocking density), if the domestic industry is protected from imports (e.g. through import tariffs, quality standards, or consumer preference), and if consumers substitute away from eating chickens and fish.</p><p>All these factors in the table require judgement calls based on knowledge of the context within a jurisdiction. The only exception is the number of animal life-years improved, which can be calculated by multiplying together its four component factors.</p><p>Table 3. Factors that can be considered when designing welfare-conditional subsidies to benefit animals as much as possible. There are two main effects, each of which consists of several umbrella factors. Umbrella factors are themselves made up of smaller component factors.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Main or secondary effect</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Umbrella factor</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Component factor</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>How the factor relates to impact</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\" rowspan=\"5\"><p>Main effect (improving welfare)</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\" rowspan=\"4\"><p><strong>Number of animals' life-years improved in expectation</strong></p><p>[<i>note: this factor is calculated by multiplying the four subsidiary factors to the right</i>]</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Number of animals in the jurisdiction</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\" rowspan=\"4\"><p>More animal life-years improved = better</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Lifespan of those animals</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>The proportion of those animals who would be covered by the subsidy</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>The proportion of animals covered by the subsidy who would not have benefitted from the welfare improvements anyway</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Magnitude of the welfare improvement</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Magnitude of the welfare improvement</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>More substantial welfare improvement = better</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\" rowspan=\"5\"><p>Secondary effect (changing the number of animals farmed for food)</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\" rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>Decrease in production of the meat or animal product</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Are the welfare improvements likely to involve a reduced stocking density?</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Reduced stocking density = better</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Are the welfare improvements likely to make production more expensive?</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>More expensive production = better</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\" rowspan=\"2\"><p><strong>Protection of domestic industry</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Is the domestic industry protected by import tariffs or quality standards?</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>More tariffs or quality standards = better</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Do consumers have a preference for domestic products?</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Stronger preference for domestic products = better</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Substitution towards other animal species</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Would the subsidy cause consumers to shift from eating chickens and fish to eating cows, or vice-versa?</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Substitution from chickens and fish to cows = better; substitution from cows to chicken and fish = worse</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>General campaign factors</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\" colspan=\"3\"><p>There are many factors that affect the success of any policy campaign beyond just animal welfare subsidies.

As such, this analysis should be conducted at the level of the relevant jurisdiction. In a given location, the jurisdiction relevant to animal welfare subsidies could be a sovereign country but could also be a state, territory, or autonomous body within a country (like South Australia), a constituent country (like England), or a supranational body (like the EU).</p><p>Almost all of these depend on the specifics of how the subsidy policy is designed and implemented. Only a few of these factors depend solely on the jurisdiction (number of animals; protection of domestic industry). You may also notice that some of the factors in the table relate to the dot-points listed earlier in this report (see the text below Figure 1).</p><p>Lastly, it is important to consider the animal species being targeted by the subsidy. If a subsidy affects multiple species, as the Switzerland and EU examples do, this analysis may need to be broken down by species.</p><h1>REDUCING SUBSIDIES FOR MEAT AND ANIMAL PRODUCTS</h1><p>This reform would abolish or reduce subsidies that support the production of meat or animal products. These subsidies can be implemented for many reasons, including to increase production of meat or animal products, to enable producers greater freedom in decision-making, and to manage the risk to producers&nbsp;(30).</p><p>There are two main ways that reducing subsidies for animal products can cause the number of farmed animals to decrease (Figure 3). Firstly, if there is an increase in the costs of production of a particular animal, the profit to producers would likely decrease. This would incentivise producers to move away from production of that animal, thus decreasing the number of individuals farmed. Secondly, a lower profit may cause an increase in the price of the animal product to consumers. This could cause consumers to demand less of that animal product, potentially also decreasing the number of individuals farmed.</p><p>However, there may also be complex economic effects that are not captured by these two pathways - the direction of such effects is unclear, so it may still be possible for this subsidy reform to be overall bad for animals. These economic effects are impossible to predict without a detailed economic model. To illustrate, later in this report, we discuss a different type of subsidy reform (reducing subsidy for feed crops). In that case, economic modelling revealed that unexpected economic effects could actually cause animal production to expand&nbsp;(31). The increase in production was due to complex cross-price effects on the market, as well as farmers and capital moving away from less-profitable crop production towards more-profitable animal production. These two mechanisms could plausibly apply to reducing subsidies for meat and animal products.</p><p>In particular, production could move away from larger animals, like cows and sheep, towards smaller animals, like chickens. This is a particular risk given that many subsidies supporting animal agriculture are specific to these larger animals. Farming chickens causes more suffering and more deaths for a given unit of meat, and chickens generally experience worse welfare conditions than cows and sheep (the 'small-animal replacement problem')&nbsp;(32\u201334).</p><p>For these reasons, reducing subsidies for meat and animal products could plausibly be overall bad for animals. It is also plausible that this risk would not materialise, and that reducing subsidies for meat and animal products would have the intended effect of helping animals. A modelling study that considers economy-wide dynamics could examine this risk and evaluate the circumstances under which production would increase. With that knowledge, the animal advocacy movement can make more informed decisions about whether, and in what contexts, to campaign for reducing meat subsidies.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668094301/mirroredImages/ozKXkqccvEqqvKxhE/nyqzvdq7glnxwga20oza.png\"></p><p>Figure 3. Theory of change for reducing subsidies for meat and animal products.</p><p>There are two useful, well-documented examples of where subsidies for meat and animal products have been abolished. There have been other examples of this reform, but these are just the two examples for which scientific studies have estimated the effects of reform on the production of meat and animal products.</p><h2><strong>New Zealand's example</strong></h2><p>In New Zealand, subsidies for animal production were abolished during the 1980s. This reform was motivated by economic reasons (the subsidies had become a very large proportion of the government's budget) and the negative environmental effects of the subsidies. Vitalis&nbsp;(35) compared animal production in New Zealand before and after these subsidies were abolished, and we have extended that comparison to include chickens.</p><p>Since the abolition of the subsidies, there has been a decrease in the number of sheep killed (Figure 4). This was also accompanied by a higher efficiency (i.e. more meat produced per animal killed) and meat quality. Since farmers moved towards other types of farming, horticultural production increased.</p><p>Notably, there was an increase in the number of farmed chickens killed annually over that same period. Measured in terms of animals killed per year, the increase in chickens killed is greater than the decrease in sheep killed. There was also an increase in the number of farmed cows (and deer, which do not appear on our graph), although this increase was much smaller than the decrease in the number of sheep (Table 4).</p><p>This data relies on comparing production levels before and after New Zealand's subsidy reform. It is difficult or impossible to attribute the changes in production solely to the subsidy reform, as there would have been many other changes in agricultural practice and consumer preferences throughout that two-decade period. However, one could speculate: subsidies could be set up such that farmers are incentivised to produce one type of animal rather than another. As such, it is possible to speculate that abolishing this subsidy could have caused farmers to move away from sheep production towards chicken production. This could have caused an overall increase in the number of animals killed.</p><p>In any case, the increase in the number of chickens and cows (and deer) killed since the subsidy reform should provide a warning that subsidy reforms can sometimes do more harm than good.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1668094302/mirroredImages/ozKXkqccvEqqvKxhE/quj1qtuds7oe8qfks234.png\"></p><p>Figure 4. Changes in the numbers of animals farmed in New Zealand. The country's subsidy reform took place in the mid-1980s (black dotted line). All data is from FAO (36), except for the initial size of the sheep population (purple dashed line) from Vitalis (35).</p><h2><strong>Mexico's example</strong></h2><p>The second example comes from Mexico. Mexico implemented a collection of economic reforms throughout the 1980s and 1990s, which included the phasing out of price supports and consumer subsidies. The OECD used economic simulations to predict how these reforms have affected the production and consumption of pig and beef, compared to a hypothetical world where the reforms were not implemented&nbsp;(37). The simulations estimate that, using 2005 production and consumption values, the reforms caused beef production to decrease by 22% and beef consumption to increase by 8%. Net beef imports increased, which may account for the finding that consumption increased despite production decreasing. Also, the reforms caused pig production to decrease by 10%, and pig consumption to decrease by 4%.</p><p>The Mexico example shows, again, that reducing subsidies for meat can reduce the number of animals farmed for food - but can also increase the number of some types of animals, highlighting the fact that this type of subsidy reform carries risks for animals.</p><h2><strong>Research needed to unlock this opportunity</strong></h2><p>To our knowledge, there have been two studies on the effects of this subsidy reform on animal production. The study on New Zealand's reforms (and our subsequent analysis in Table 4) used a before-after methodology that, strictly speaking, did not consider the counterfactual effects of the reform&nbsp;(35). The study on Mexico, through its use of economic simulations, did consider the counterfactual effects of the reform - however, this study did not consider all effects of the subsidy reform&nbsp;(37). Both studies found a decrease in the production of at least some types of animals. However, in New Zealand, other types of animal farming expanded, and in Mexico, beef consumption increased.</p><p>There has been no economic study that examines the effects of this type of subsidy reform across the whole economy. This is a critical knowledge gap. It is entirely possible that, through indirect economic effects, animal production increases for other species or in other countries<sup>2</sup>. An economic modelling study that estimates, at this broad scope, the impact of abolishing subsidies for meat and animal products on production could determine the circumstances in which abolishing subsidies would be overall good (or bad) for animals. This could provide the evidence necessary for the movement to know when this type of reform is overall good for animals. Accordingly, a study like this could unlock a potentially impactful campaign opportunity to improve the lives of animals.</p><h1>OTHER (LESS EFFECTIVE) SUBSIDY REFORMS</h1><p>There are three other types of subsidy that have received interest in the animal advocacy movement. However, the evidence suggests that these types of subsidy reform would not improve the lives of animals.</p><h2><strong>Reducing subsidies for feed crops</strong></h2><p>Most of the debate on this topic has focused on the US. In the US, the federal government provides a large amount of subsidies for farming. Most of the farm subsidies in the US focus on commodity crops, like corn, soybeans, and wheat. These farm subsidies are controversial for numerous reasons&nbsp;(3).</p><p>The biggest buyer of these commodity crops are factory farms, as these crops are used as animal feed. For this reason, some people have suggested that abolishing crop subsidies could cause factory farming to become less profitable, which could reduce the number of animals who are farmed. If these crop subsidies were abolished, then the production costs of US factory farms could become 6-13% more expensive&nbsp;(3,4,38).</p><p>Unfortunately, there are two reasons why abolishing crop subsidies would not reduce the production of animals. Firstly, the economy consists of complex dynamics across different products and markets - abolishing crop subsidies would cause complicated, unexpected results that would outweigh the effects on the costs of factory farms. Secondly, if crop farming becomes less profitable, resources (like capital and labour) would move to other types of farming, including animal agriculture&nbsp;(31).</p><p>In fact, one study did model the overall, economy-wide effects of abolishing crop subsidies. The study found that animal agriculture expands - the US would produce more chickens, more pigs, and more cows&nbsp;(31).</p><p>Therefore, the evidence shows that reducing subsidies for feed crops is unlikely to help animals. Although this evidence focuses on subsidies in the US, similar dynamics are likely to hold in other countries. It is conceivable that there are countries where reducing subsidies for feed crops may indeed help animals. However, to have confidence that this is an effective campaign, a sophisticated economic model would need to show, under various sets of assumptions, that reducing these subsidies would reduce the number of animals farmed.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Increasing subsidies for plant-based foods</strong></h2><p>It has been suggested that providing subsidies for plant-based foods (whether fruits and vegetables, or plant-based meat alternatives) could cause people to eat more of those foods and, accordingly, substitute away from meat.</p><p>Unfortunately, economic studies have found that this generally does not happen. Subsidies for plant-based foods are unlikely to cause people to eat less meat and animal products&nbsp;(39). For fruits and vegetables, a systematic review concluded that there is no relationship between the price of fruits and vegetables and the consumption of meat and animal products&nbsp;(40). For plant-based meat alternatives, studies have found that consumers generally do not perceive plant-based meat alternatives as substitutes for animal-derived meats&nbsp;(11,41). Therefore, increasing subsidies for plant-based foods does not appear to be a useful intervention for improving the lives of animals. This may change in the future if people begin to perceive plant-based meat alternatives as legitimate substitutes for animal-derived meats&nbsp;(11).</p><h2><strong>Reducing fisheries subsidies</strong></h2><p>Subsidies in fisheries are already controversial from the perspective of biological conservation - these subsidies often allow fisheries to catch more fish than they otherwise would, which can contribute to fishing being economically and ecologically unsustainable&nbsp;(6). For this reason, there has been lots of effort, including talks at the World Trade Federation, to reform fisheries subsidies&nbsp;(42).</p><p>From the perspective of animal advocacy, reforming fisheries subsidies would be good if that reform caused fewer fish to be caught overall. Although the effects of fisheries subsidy reform vary depending on the specifics of the reform, it is common for reforms to have projected effects like: fishing effort is reduced; fewer fish are caught in the short-term; the size of the fish population grows; and more fish are caught in the long-term&nbsp;(42). In fact, allowing more fish to be caught in the long-term is often an explicit goal of these reforms.</p><p>Fisheries subsidy reform would probably cause more fish to be brought into existence and more fish to suffer highly painful deaths by being caught in fisheries. This additional suffering would likely outweigh any benefits from fewer fish being caught in the short-term. As such, from the perspective of animal advocacy, it is not clear that this type of reform is good.</p><h1>CAMPAIGNING FOR SUBSIDY REFORM</h1><p>We have discussed a number of times when agricultural subsidies have been reformed in various countries. These examples provide some lessons that may be useful to animal advocacy organisations campaigning to reform subsidies:</p><ul><li>Where subsidies are abolished, a primary motivation is to reduce government spending. For example, New Zealand's government was forced to eliminate agricultural subsidies in the 1980s because they had become too expensive&nbsp;(35), and Jordan's government was motivated to lift a feed subsidy in 2007 due to pressure on the national budget&nbsp;(43).</li><li>Subsidies for meat production generally have environmentally harmful effects. These effects can provide further support and justification to campaigns seeking to abolish these subsidies&nbsp;(35).</li><li>Some subsidy reforms are driven by pressures from the World Trade Organisation to reduce subsidies that directly support production. This was one motivation for a 2005 reform of EU-funded subsidies in the UK&nbsp;(44).</li><li>There are some examples of animal agriculture sectors in particular countries where most farms are economically unsustainable without subsidies. This appears to be the case for the goat sector in Greece and was also true of many farms in the UK in the early 2000s&nbsp;(44,45). Abolishing these subsidies could, therefore, cause major reductions in meat production. However, it is unclear whether governments would actually allow these industries to collapse in reality, as this would have profound implications for food supply and social well-being.</li><li>Abolishing meat production subsidies can cause harm to people. New Zealand's subsidy reform did bring some social costs - some farmers were forced to draw on social welfare payments and the populations in some rural towns were reduced, although these both occurred less frequently than what was predicted&nbsp;(35). Tragically, there were also some suicides&nbsp;(35). In Jordan, the removal of the feed subsidy caused harm to the livelihood of some disadvantaged groups&nbsp;(43). Where subsidy reform risks causing harm to people, it is critical for reform to be accompanied by transitional assistance from the government to prevent this harm&nbsp;(35,43). The money that the government saves could also be spent on helping people in other ways.</li></ul><h1>CONCLUSION</h1><p>In this report, we evaluated five types of subsidy reforms in animal agriculture.</p><p><strong>Welfare-conditional subsidies, where farmers are paid to adopt higher-welfare practices, appear to be an impactful way to help animals</strong>. Evidence from Switzerland and the EU suggests that these subsidies can bring concrete improvements in animal welfare, and possibly even reduce the production of animal products, as long as the subsidies are well-designed.&nbsp;<strong>We recommend that animal advocacy organisations consider campaigning for welfare-conditional subsidies</strong>, by which farmers are paid for adopting higher-welfare practices. This could involve increasing these subsidies in places where they already exist (Switzerland, the EU, and England) or establishing them in further countries.</p><p><strong>Abolishing or reducing subsidies for meat production</strong> also has the potential to be an effective campaign, but&nbsp;<strong>additional research</strong> is needed first. Initial studies suggest that abolishing these subsidies could decrease animal production, but a more sophisticated economic analysis is needed to confirm this before any campaigns take place. We recommend that such an analysis be conducted, as this study could unlock a new campaign option.</p><p>The final three options do not appear capable of helping animals:&nbsp;<strong>abolishing subsidies for feed crops, promoting subsidies for plant-based foods, and abolishing fisheries subsidies&nbsp;</strong>would either have&nbsp;<strong>no effect or possibly even harm animals</strong>. We recommend that animal advocacy organisations considering these campaigns choose a different campaign instead.</p><p>If you are considering campaigning for this topic, or deciding what animal advocacy campaign to launch,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/\"><u>please reach out to us</u></a>. We would like to hear from any organisations that may have been considering working on these topics so that we may support you in prioritising your resources towards the most impactful opportunities.</p><h1>NOTES</h1><p>1. A similar policy involves placing taxes on meat. Our detailed research report on meat taxes is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/meat-tax-why-chickens-pay-the-price\"><u>available here</u></a>.</p><p>2. This raises the question of whether welfare-conditional subsidies (the first class of subsidies we considered in this report) should also be analysed in a sophisticated economic model before being chosen as a campaign. Although welfare-conditional subsidies could plausibly increase production, we do not think that this is a major risk. Welfare-conditional subsidies can increase the costs of production and/or decrease stocking densities, which are likely to decrease production (9).</p><p>Nevertheless, it is possible for welfare-conditional subsidies to switch consumption from cows towards chickens and fish, which would cause overall harm to animals. This is an important risk to consider with welfare-conditional subsidies, and it is listed in Table 3.</p><h1>REFERENCES</h1><p>1.&nbsp; Steenblik. A subsidy primer.

I do continue to believe its very good to acquaint and educate people about EA principles, but I just think it's too risky associating with it publicly now. I have already been worried about the optics of longtermism (although I'm a longtermist), flying students to conferences and having them stay in fancy hotels (although I believe that to be high EV) and everything immoral Elon Musk does in the name of longtermism, but I could deal with and defend that.

We began by partnering with a large homeless organisation that received most of its funding from the government. This meant for instance that for funding reasons we weren\u2019t allowed to support people for more than a year, on the grounds that this was enough support to get them up and running on their own feet again.&nbsp; This was of course a ridiculous assumption.&nbsp; The people we are dealing with have chronic conditions.&nbsp; With a huge amount of support over the long term, a few of them have actually managed to stabilise and become capable of leading what is generally considered a \u2018normal\u2019 life.&nbsp; But most will never be able to do that.&nbsp; So for most, they either have access to the kind of support we provide, and therefore have a higher quality of life, or they do not.&nbsp; If they do not, they are more likely to end up back on the streets, to die earlier, or end up in prison or on a mental health ward.&nbsp; We know this because of experience, but the reality is that it's not possible to track people's lives over 30 years or more, so it ends up being very difficult to gather hard data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So when we are looking to track meaningful targets or outcomes, the most real, tangible measure we can give is whether someone attended 240Project or not.&nbsp; If their day was made better by working on an art project, or doing creative writing.&nbsp; Having a sacro-cranial massage.&nbsp; Meeting other people in a supportive environment.&nbsp; Eating some good food. Being around others in an atmosphere where kindness is the norm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Many well intentioned funders would like this kind of day to day support to translate into some kind of measurable long term progress.&nbsp; Does our support make it more likely that our members will end up in employment?&nbsp; Or volunteering, or in further education?&nbsp; Are they healthier?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And the answer to questions like these, objective questions, is that often they are.&nbsp; And often they are not.&nbsp; Because, when we look honestly at our lives, what we see over time is that all of us, the marginalised and the successful, go through ups and downs. &nbsp; In fact, quite a number of our members (at a guess, maybe 10%) have in the past been successful, educated people.&nbsp; Mental health issues do not spare any of us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The point &nbsp;is that if we only work with people as they are in recovery, or making progress, or healing, then our support isn\u2019t real.&nbsp; We at 240Project try to behave in a way that imagines our people having a supportive, non judgemental family that is there for you and provides facilities so you can spend the day being busy doing enjoyable things in a supportive environment.&nbsp; We try our best to give people healthy meals and physical support.&nbsp; Most of them do not exercise.&nbsp; It's hard to keep people healthy.&nbsp; Life being what it is,&nbsp; as often as not, people are on a downward trajectory as on an upward one.&nbsp; And is it right that we should withdraw our support when mental or physical health deteriorates?&nbsp; Isn\u2019t this when we should be supporting people more?&nbsp; Yet it's obvious that from an effectiveness point of view, we are supporting people who might end up just dying on us, the ultimate proof perhaps that we were wasting our time, that we were doing our altruism ineffectively.&nbsp;</p><p>For sure, we could cook up some figures that show that the total cost to society of an individual with mental health issues can be very different, depending on whether or not they have the support of 240Project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But when I think in this way, an alarm bell goes off.&nbsp; One thing we experienced was how important it is for our staff and volunteers to express a certain kind of ethos, and not another one.&nbsp; To try to capture a complex story, if there is an atmosphere of trust and support and calm, the project works.&nbsp; If management becomes heavy handed, bureaucratic, or judgemental, we can deliver on paper exactly the same project, but it will be either pointless or actually negative.&nbsp; We once appointed a manager for the project that acted like a jail keeper.&nbsp; Needless to say this was a disaster.&nbsp;</p><p>I would love us to have things we can measure objectively.&nbsp; They would be things like \u2018interactions increasing a sensation of kindness\u2019&nbsp; or \u2018a person is left feeling less lonely\u2019, or \u2018because of how they spent today, a person feels that they are valued and have something to offer\u2019.&nbsp; These kinds of experiences are the daily commerce of what makes life worth living, that create meaning and make the world a better place.&nbsp; But I hope any reasonable person can get that it would be madness to ask staff and volunteers to log every human interaction they have had, and rate it on a scale of \u2018love\u2019 effectiveness.</p><p>I\u2019m not saying that there are no objective measures that could help us log our effectiveness.&nbsp; It may be that we haven't found them.&nbsp; The best we have come up with so far is to tell stories.&nbsp; Case studies. But again, when we do tell stories, everyone wants to hear the ones that \u2018end\u2019 well. The ones where a crack addict has come into the project, overcome their addiction and gone on to get a job. No one wants to hear about the crack addict that comes in, gets better for a while, then goes back on the streets and is stabbed.&nbsp;</p><p>So what I\u2019m left with is simply the question, did we make someone's day better today? If so, then it was worth it.&nbsp; Often, despite everything we do, a depressive might attend the project, have a full day, and leave. Yet if they are asked, they will say the day was really bad.&nbsp; They shouldn\u2019t have come in. They should have stayed in bed.&nbsp; In that case, objectively, we all wasted our time.&nbsp; In reality however, we see this depressive person come back the next day, and the day after, and often project their depression on others, and staff will try their best to keep the atmosphere positive, and mostly succeed.&nbsp; Working with people with chronic mental health issues just is not easy.&nbsp; Staff and volunteers need a huge capacity to recharge and just keep giving attention, and care, without asking for anything like fairness or sanity or logic or effectiveness in return.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After 25 years doing this, I know in my bones that it has not been pointless. That something really good was added to the world because of it, and that this kind of thing should be available to many more vulnerable, isolated people.&nbsp; In our annual report, we put a table of \u2018outcomes\u2019 which tries to capture self reported improvements in our members' lives.&nbsp; In truth, I know we don\u2019t actually capture in that table any of the reasons why we are important to our members, why we can be crucial.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And this isn\u2019t just because of \u2018negative\u2019 or invisible outcomes (like if a person spent the day doing art work instead of on the streets, they are less likely to commit crime, drink or get involved with negative influences).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes I think we are in the game of creating instances of meaning (and I\u2019m absolutely not clear what that means).&nbsp; Has there been a spontaneous act of support, where one member is helping another without being asked?&nbsp; In other words, has a genuine act of human altruism happened?&nbsp; Has someone been helped with a problem they face?&nbsp; Has someone learned to look in a new way?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Every year, we put on an art exhibition. This year, we sold works by x artists.&nbsp; Ordinary socially integrated members of the public come to the show, like a work, and buy it. The money raised goes to the artist.&nbsp; And this has an effect.&nbsp; Members of 24oProject who have sold works at the art show tend to start to take their art more seriously. They work harder and concentrate more.&nbsp; Often you can see a passion being kindled.&nbsp; They get into a flow state more often. If you come into the project today, what you see is around 20 tables where people are concentrating on creating art works.&nbsp; Most of these people will sit there and work for five hours, which is how long we are open for.&nbsp; They take breaks, maybe for a session of reflexology. Maybe to go out and smoke and have a chat. But mostly they are concentrating.&nbsp; They are doing something that means a lot to them.&nbsp; A lot more than before they realised that other people liked their works enough to buy them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Some of our members are able to articulate this.&nbsp; Most are not.&nbsp; More than that however, if we try to capture our effectiveness in the number of art works produced, or number sold, again, we are missing the point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It may be that there are objective criteria that can capture what we do, to measure how effective we are. It may be that we just haven\u2019t thought of them.&nbsp; There were times when I wanted to feel we were helping to transform people's lives, that we could provide a step change.&nbsp; Yes, that has happened.&nbsp; No, not a lot. Most of the time from an outcomes perspective we are simply pissing in the wind.&nbsp; But on a human level, I know in my bones that we are doing a really good job.&nbsp; People who come into the project to visit us can see it too.&nbsp; So it\u2019s not quite right that we are ineffective.&nbsp; It's more that we aren\u2019t able to generate the kind of data that actually captures what we do.&nbsp; But it is true that we are far less effective and far more expensive than a malaria tablet or an eye operation for a person in India. Yet for me, if 240Project didn\u2019t exist, the world would be a far colder place.</p><p>Edward Farrelly</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.240project.org.uk\"><u>www.240project.org.uk</u></a>&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Edward Farrelly"}}, {"_id": "ZBtTY6zSTPiuxDasA", "title": "An Interview With Kat Woods", "postedAt": "2022-11-10T09:41:17.260Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Kat has founded 4 EA charities and continues to work tirelessly in the EA community.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Kat mentioned using Google Grants for her charities- Essentially, Google will give your nonprofit a free grant to spend on advertising.

Most of the 380 attendees were academics doing research on areas of philosophy that interact with politics or economics. The poster session, which was held at the end of a day of talks, lasted 1h30. There were around 6 posters being presented. In addition to providing attendees with a preview of the poster prior to the session, I gave them the following description:&nbsp;</p><p><i>In our poster session, we want to give an overview of the \u2018alignment problem\u2019 of artificial general intelligence (AGI). This is the problem of how to get AGI to do what we want. So far, it seems surprisingly and worryingly difficult. As things stand, AGI will likely be misaligned, resulting in catastrophic consequences. In addition to arguing why AGI is likely to be misaligned, we will also try to defend the assumption that AGI will be developed this century.</i></p><h3>Goals</h3><ol><li>Practice talking with other academics about AI safety&nbsp;</li><li>Increase academics\u2019 exposure to AI safety&nbsp;</li><li>Highlight AI safety as a special problem amongst the many problems within machine ethics and ethics of AI more generally</li><li>Increase my own understanding of AI safety and, in particular, get to grips with the core arguments for why we should be concerned</li><li>Gain a better understanding of how other academics conceive of AI safety, which arguments they perceive as unpersuasive and which they perceive as persuasive</li><li>Convince at least a couple of academics to take AI safety seriously and increase the likelihood that they connect their research to AI safety</li></ol><h3>Results</h3><p>I believe I by and large achieved these goals. However, I was disappointed by the low turnout at the poster session. Out of (supposedly) 380 attendees, I estimate that around 60 were aware of my presentation topic, 25 were able to at least glance at the poster and 8 came to read the poster or interact with us.</p><h3>Reactions</h3><ol><li>Which research question(s) am I working on?</li><li>Humans do all these things that I\u2019ve claimed make AGI dangerous by default; are humans therefore just as dangerous?</li><li>Children do some of these things and they don\u2019t immediately share our values but through praise and blame we mould them to alignment; can we not do something similar with AGI? In particular, could we train them to optimise for praise minus blame (or some similar function of the two) and then deploy them and incrementally increase their intelligence and capabilities, as is the case for human children?</li><li>Okay, AI compute will increase but why think that this will lead to human-like intelligence and the ability to self-improve?</li></ol><h3>Good calls</h3><ol><li>I divided the poster's content into 3 sections, with two images in the centre. I think the images helped attract people's attention and the sectioning made the structure of the arguments clearer and made it easy for people to stand on one side and read that side of the poster. With many people I began by talking about the third (right-hand-side) section, and only addressed the left-hand-side when they were sceptical of us ever developing AGI.&nbsp;</li><li>I used bullet points instead of full-sentence paragraphs. I think this made the poster more interesting (in any case, less boring) to read. It also meant that, as a result of less text, I could increase the text size.</li></ol><h3>Bad calls</h3><ol><li>I expected people who were confused by things like \u2018AGI\u2019 to come ask me out of curiosity but I think most preferred not to, perhaps due to unease in revealing their ignorance. For this reason, I should have made the poster more readable on its own.</li><li>I should have maxed out the size of the poster so that people could read it even from far away.</li><li>I should have displayed a list of promising research questions relevant to PPE academics. I had hoped to come up with a list of such questions but could only think of a couple and decided not to include any for the sake of space and because I'd have been unable to share many further insights in conversation.</li></ol><h3>Uncertainties</h3><ol><li>Should I have focused more on AI governance given the audience? I think that whilst AI governance might have been more relevant to the attendees, I would not have done a very good job of presenting on it.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9c9tj7k0gm\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9c9tj7k0gm\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; Additionally, I think that AI governance is difficult to motivate strongly unless the audience is already aware of the alignment problem.</li><li>Should I have name-dropped more academics who acknowledge the risks of misaligned AGI? As a philosopher, I've been trained to become suspicious around appeals to authority. However, it seems that many philosophy academics are heavily reliant on what those they respect say.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa4g0qt7s6dq\"><sup><a href=\"#fna4g0qt7s6dq\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I was under the impression that Nick Bostrom and Toby Ord are not so well respected amongst philosophy academics but Stuart Russell is. However, the one time I did name-drop Stuart Russell, my interlocutor hadn't heard of him but was already in agreement with my conclusion due to Peter Railton supposedly also being in agreement. It seems that appeals to authority seem to work for some people. So, maybe I should have name-dropped more academics who are well-respected amongst philosophers. Relatedly, much of my content, including the two images, are taken from the Youtuber Robert Miles and the alarmist and unaccredited Eliezer Yudkowsky. I chose not to cite them in part because ad hominems are just as psychologically powerful as appeals to authority.</li></ol><h3>Credits</h3><p>Thanks to Marius Hobbhahn for sharing <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SqjQFhn5KTarfW8v7/lessons-learned-from-talking-to-greater-than-100-academics\">his poster</a> and for telling me about his experience presenting on AI safety.

In both, respondents were presented with a proposal that included a definition of slaughterhouses and arguments framed around animal welfare for and against the proposal. In survey 1, the treatment condition asked respondents to explain their reasoning, with this prompt removed in the control condition. In survey 2, only the treatment condition was presented. The question wording was as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><pre><code>Some members of Congress are proposing that slaughterhouses (where farmed animals are killed to then be sold as meat) should be made illegal.\n\nSupporters of this policy say that slaughterhouses should be banned because it is wrong to kill animals. There is no way to kill animals for their meat which is \u201chumane,\u201d so this should be banned.\n\nOpponents of this policy say that people have a right to eat meat if they choose. The practices in place are humane and produce quality meat for consumers at an affordable price. It is possible to prevent animals being killed inhumanely without banning slaughterhouses.\n\nDo you support or oppose this proposed policy? \n[Support/Oppose/Don\u2019t Know]\n\n[Treatment condition] \nPlease explain your reasons for the answer you gave above.</code></pre><p>Respondents were recruited using Prolific and surveyed using Qualtrics. In survey 1, respondents were filtered to be those currently living in the USA, fluent in English, de facto over 18 years old due to filtering Prolific does automatically, and to set gender quotas so that the sample is 50-50 female-male. The total sample size was 700 with 350 in the control condition and 350 in the treatment condition. In survey 2, respondents were recruited as in survey 1 and were weighted for representativeness using 5-year 2019 American community survey data and general social survey data. At the time of analysis, it had a sample of 2,698 US respondents after filtering based on an honesty check and a basic attention/comprehension check. Respondents were paid $1.38 USD for completing the survey. This was part of a larger forthcoming study on rodenticides (<a href=\"https://osf.io/3unzb/?view_only=\">McAuliffe et al, 2022</a>).</p><h1><strong>Results: Attitudes towards a proposal to ban slaughterhouses&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the survey 1, with a sample of 700 US respondents:</p><ul><li>We found much lower levels of support in both control (20.4%, 95% CI [11.0%-34.7%]) and treatment (7.9%, 95% CI [4.3% - 14.0%]) conditions compared to the Sentience Institute (<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aft-survey-2021\">2021</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aft-survey-2020\"><u>2020</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/animal-farming-attitudes-survey-2017\"><u>2017</u></a>) and Norwood &amp; Murray (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190806000018/http://agecon.okstate.edu/files/january%202018.pdf\"><u>2018</u></a>) studies (~39%-43% when including \u201cNo Opinion\u201d responses). (More results in the appendix.)</li><li>In both the unweighted and weighted analyses, support was lower in the treatment condition than in the control condition. The share of \u201cDon\u2019t Know\u201d respondents increased in the treatment in the unweighted analysis, while in the weighted analysis, the lost support seems to come directly from people choosing to oppose instead.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Gr3t8vWcWpwBoNNTk/quo9j1b9xqecjthhlc5n\"><i>Weighted results for a proposal banning slaughterhouses (control and treatment)</i></p><p>Survey 2 had a sample of 2,698 US respondents (after filtering based on an honesty check and a basic attention/comprehension check).

Just asking for support in the abstract may be vulnerable to some combination of acquiescence bias, social desirability and symbolic/expressive responding. Presenting arguments for and against the proposal may ameliorate some of these concerns. It may also be more comparable to what people would encounter in a real situation where this matter was actively debated or up for a vote (i.e., people would present opposing arguments as well). A limitation, of course, is that the results may depend on the specific positive/negative arguments which are employed, and further work could explore this. In Sioux Falls, there was a vote on 8th November 2022 on whether new slaughterhouses should be banned from being built and permitted to operate inside the city limits of Sioux Falls. The result was 52% against and 48% in support (<a href=\"https://www.argusleader.com/elections/results/local/\"><u>Argusleader 2022</u></a><u>,</u><a href=\"https://electionresults.sd.gov/resultsSW.aspx?type=mun&amp;map=CTY&amp;area=Sioux%20Falls&amp;name=Sioux%20Falls\">&nbsp;<u>electionresults.sd.gov 2022</u></a>).&nbsp; However, \u201cthe group behind this is doing it entirely for NIMBY reasons and says they support slaughterhouses outside of city limits\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/12284/support-for-sioux-falls-slaughterhouse-ban/#comment-99487\"><u>RyanBeck 2022</u></a>). This non-animal welfare framing and the limited nature of this ban may have led to quite different results than a full US slaughterhouse ban framed around animal welfare arguments.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Comparison with previous survey results</strong></h1><p>In 2017, Sentience Institute reported the results of a large US-representative survey (n=1094), examining attitudes towards animal farming and plant-free foods (<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/animal-farming-attitudes-survey-2017\"><u>2017</u></a>).</p><p>Three results were particularly striking:</p><ul><li>\u201c49% of US adults support a ban on factory farming\u201d&nbsp;</li><li>\u201c47% support a ban on slaughterhouses\u201d</li><li>\u201c33% support a ban on animal farming\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/animal-farming-attitudes-survey-2017\"><u>ibid.</u></a>)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvi7buvqjdq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvi7buvqjdq\">[1]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>Sentience Institute has since repeated its survey (<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aft-survey-2021\">2021</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aft-survey-2020\"><u>2020</u></a>) and again found substantial support (\"49.1%\" and \"44.8%\" support for banning slaughterhouses respectively- when excluding \"no opinion\"). These figures seem extremely surprising given that only around 1% of Americans appear to be vegetarians, with the percentage of vegans being yet smaller (<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/is-the-percentage-of-vegetarians-and-vegans-in-the-u-s-increasing/\"><u>\u0160im\u010dikas 2018</u></a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefji3fqzmt3kk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnji3fqzmt3kk\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It seems odd that large numbers of Americans, who routinely choose to eat animal products, would support measures which would likely severely impinge on the consumption of these products, either by massively restricting supply, significantly increasing price or making the consumption of animal products outright impossible.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd92s2jzjei\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd92s2jzjei\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Of course, it is possible for individuals to have conflicting attitudes about such issues. For example, studies have shown a \u201cvote-buy gap\u201d regarding cage-free eggs; many people vote to ban a product they purchase (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socec.2019.02.005\"><u>Paul et al 2019</u></a>). Indeed, the Sentience Institute survey itself seems to show a clear and strong conflict with the attitudes their respondents appeared to evince. While 49% of individuals agreed with the statement \u201cI support a ban on factory farming,\u201d 97% agreed that \u201cWhether to eat animals or be vegetarian is a personal choice, and nobody has the right to tell me which one they think I should do\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/animal-farming-attitudes-survey-2017\"><u>2017</u></a>) - the strongest support for any statement in the survey by a wide margin. These results, therefore, seem in quite direct conflict given that&nbsp;<i>bans</i> on slaughterhouses or animal farming would remove personal choice on this matter.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkbh73dz896\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkbh73dz896\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Norwood &amp; Murray\u2019s (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190806000018/http://agecon.okstate.edu/files/january%202018.pdf\"><u>2018</u></a>) study seemed to suspect non-comprehension might be playing a role, as they write: \u201cPerhaps many Americans simply did not understand what a \u2018slaughterhouse\u2019 is?\u201d To test this, they included a question designed to probe whether individuals&nbsp;<i>really</i> understood what a slaughterhouse is. After being asked whether they agreed with the statement \u201cI support a ban on slaughterhouses,\u201d participants who agreed with this statement were asked \u201cWere you aware that slaughterhouses are where livestock are killed and processed into meat, such that, without them, you would not be able to consume meat?\u201d</p><p>A significant limitation of this approach is that participants are able, and have a strong incentive, to simply&nbsp;<i>report</i> that they understood the question whether or not they did. This might be to avoid embarrassment or self-delusion. If you have even a&nbsp;<i>vague</i> sense of what a term means, then when a question is explained to you, it might seem that you basically understood it all along; alternatively respondents may have been aware of some of these things about slaughterhouses, but perhaps not that \u201cwithout them, you would not be able to consume meat\u201d and so erred on the side of saying \u201cyes.\u201d Reported understanding may also be due to demand effects (thinking that saying they understood the question will please the researcher). Stronger forms of comprehension checks&nbsp;<i>require</i> that individuals actually understand the question in order to successfully answer (or at least make it much less likely that they can give the correct answer to the comprehension check without having understood the question).</p><p>Even with these significant limitations, Norwood &amp; Murray (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190806000018/http://agecon.okstate.edu/files/january%202018.pdf\"><u>2018</u></a>) found that more than a quarter (27.1%) reported that they did&nbsp;<i>not</i> understand the statement which they had just said they agreed with. We suspect that the true rate of non-comprehension would have been at least somewhat higher. Either way, having removed the 27.1% of individuals who self-reported not understanding what a slaughterhouse was, Norwood &amp; Murray (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190806000018/http://agecon.okstate.edu/files/january%202018.pdf\"><u>2018</u></a>) found that 34% of respondents (as opposed to 47% originally) supported a ban on slaughterhouses.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefziuywoyd1o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnziuywoyd1o\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>Given this apparent conflict between these results and individuals\u2019 other attitudes and actual behaviors, there is a need to investigate how these results should be interpreted. Even if one supposes that these responses&nbsp;<i>do</i> reflect real support for these bans, it is necessary to work out how to make sense of what these conflicting attitudes (e.g., \u2018I support a ban\u2019 and \u2018I believe personal choice should not be infringed\u2019)&nbsp;<i>mean</i> and how individuals might be expected to act.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Why examining this result matters</strong></h1><p>One reason why it is important to examine this result further and try to better understand the attitudes people hold about these questions is that we want to work out how individuals will actually behave. If 47% of Americans say they would support a ban on slaughterhouses, but they also say that whether or not to eat meat is a personal choice, should we expect them to vote in favor of a ban which would take away that choice?&nbsp;</p><p>More generally, these results have been taken to carry practical implications for what messages and demands animal advocates can and should use. In the Sentience Institute report, Jacy Reese argued that the results suggest that \u201canimal-free food advocates might be able to succeed with stronger proposals than they currently use\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/animal-farming-attitudes-survey-2017\"><u>2017</u></a>).&nbsp; Likewise, Lewis Bollard suggested that the results \u201cmay suggest broad popular support for reforms\u201d (<a href=\"https://us14.campaign-archive.com/?u=66df320da8400b581cbc1b539&amp;id=855172f641\"><u>2018</u></a>). Animal Ask has written \u201cIf this is accurate it could be taken as strong support for pursuing bold ballot initiatives\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/pathways-to-victory-how-can-we-end-animal-agriculture#viewer-vahu\"><u>2022</u></a>). Tobias Baumann cited the results as evidence in favor of an institutional messaging approach: \u201cNevertheless, the results above suggest that animal advocates often make a serious mistake by using the framing (i.e. asking for personal dietary change) that elicits the most resistance and opposition\u201d (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/uz3NjAJjkjpb3mj6w/how-the-animal-movement-could-do-even-more-good#Focus_on_institutional_and_social_change\"><u>2022</u></a>). As such, the results are a potential crux for central ongoing debates within animal activism about milder reformist approaches versus more radical demands, and more individual vs more institutional approaches. However, if these results are misleading and large percentages of Americans do not really (or unambiguously) support such proposals, then they risk misleading us into supporting stronger messages and proposals than would actually be supported, with potential blowback and costly, failed campaigns.</p><p>The survey has also been taken as a potential indicator of changes in public attitudes towards animals and animal farming more broadly. Animal Charity Evaluators argued that the survey, if repeated yearly, may be an \u201cimportant asset\u201d in assessing the extent to which animal advocates are succeeding in changing attitudes (<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/sentience-institute-survey-analysis/\"><u>2018</u></a>). As such, if the survey&nbsp; - or one like it - is to be taken as an important bellwether for the influence of animal activists on attitudes, then it is particularly important that we understand what the responses to its questions actually mean.</p><h1><strong>Why does this survey need further replication, haven\u2019t the results already been well-established?</strong></h1><p>One might think that even if the results&nbsp;<i>matter&nbsp;</i>for the reasons described above, that there is little need to examine them further. After all, the initial survey was large, pre-registered, used a representative US sample, and appears to have been well analyzed. Furthermore, the results have already been successfully replicated both by repeat surveys from Sentience Institute (<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aft-survey-2021\">2021</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aft-survey-2020\"><u>2020</u></a>) and by an independent group of researchers, who also thought that the original results \u201cfrankly, seemed outrageous\u201d (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190806000018/http://agecon.okstate.edu/files/january%202018.pdf\"><u>Norwood &amp; Murray 2018</u></a>). So shouldn\u2019t we be quite confident in these results?&nbsp;</p><p>Even though we think that the initial study and replications were well conducted in the ways described above, this does not assuage our concerns about the validity and interpretations of these results. In brief, the described virtues of the original survey and its successful replications increase our confidence that if we were to replicate the procedure of the original survey again, we would find similar results. However, those results do not suffice to remove our concerns about whether the results of this procedure show that individuals really support these radical bans on typical farming practices. Nor do they allow us to make sense of the conflict between individuals\u2019 stated support for the bans, with their belief that these are matters of personal choice.</p><p>To explain why the replications of Sentience Institute\u2019s results don\u2019t assuage our concerns, it is helpful to draw the distinction between&nbsp;<i>direct</i> replication and&nbsp;<i>conceptual</i> replication. Whereas a direct replication aims to exactly replicate the procedure of an experiment, a conceptual replication aims to test the same effect using a distinct procedure (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10827-018-0702-z.pdf\"><u>Milkowski et al. 2018</u></a>). As such, while a direct replication serves to increase our confidence that when we repeat the procedure we find the same result, it is ill-suited to highlight limitations internal to the procedure itself. Conceptual replication, conversely, is necessary to confirm the external validity of the effect and generalizability beyond a procedure (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijresmar.2015.09.006\"><u>Lynch et al. 2015</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cloudfront.escholarship.org/dist/prd/content/qt88k5w07m/qt88k5w07m.pdf\"><u>Crandall et al 2015</u></a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefl9r41nzbgjk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnl9r41nzbgjk\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p>To take a concrete and germane example, suppose that when we ask people \u201cAre you a vegetarian?\u201d at least 60% systematically understand \u201cvegetarian\u201d in some way compatible with eating some meat, or else are biased towards answering \u201cYes\u201d despite eating meat, due to social desirability or demand effects. If we are concerned about this kind of systematic distortion arising when we use the procedure of asking people whether they are a vegetarian, then no number of&nbsp;<i>direct</i> replications of this procedure should serve to reduce these concerns. Rather, we would need to attempt to examine the putative finding through other procedures, either asking individuals the question differently, for example, \u201cDo you eat any meat products such as...?\u201d, or supplementing our original question with distinct approaches, such as a food frequency questionnaire. As another example, research on intelligence that uses hair length as a measure of intelligence would be highly misleading; highly replicable gender differences in hair length would be interpreted as evidence that women are more intelligent than men. This inference would be false because hair length is not a valid measure of intelligence, even though the relationship between gender and hair length is highly replicable. Thus, even successful and replicable tests of a theory may be false if measures lack construct validity, that is, they do not measure what researchers assume they are measuring. (See Schimmack's recent (<a href=\"https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/1645\"><u>2021</u></a>) validation crisis paper.)&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Concluding thoughts</strong></h1><p>A claim made about the original Sentience Institute study was that the evidence of strong public support for radical action suggests advocates can push for stronger proposals and messages.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefue0ie17qok\"><sup><a href=\"#fnue0ie17qok\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Insofar as we take the responses to slaughterhouse ban proposals as a proxy for 'support for more radical action,' if only 16% would in fact be supportive, this does not offer a strong basis for more radical action. (It may well be a net negative due to a majority of people opposing such moves. Recall that 68% opposed the slaughterhouse ban in our large study.)</p><p>Of course, treating responses to these items as proxies may itself be dubious. These responses may reflect a symbolic desire to signal that people think the current state of factory farms/slaughterhouses is bad, but not imply that people actually think that getting rid of them would be desirable. The attitudes expressed by poll respondents in response to broad questions may not be reliable indicators of actual support for specific policies or messages. It would be better to test people's responses to more detailed messages and policy proposals, paying special attention to how radical messages compare to counterfactual moderate messages. One could also test a radical ask (ban factory farming) and a moderate ask (labelling for cage-free eggs, say) each with a radical message (\"meat is murder\") versus a moderate one (\"human/consumer welfare\").&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></h1><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Gr3t8vWcWpwBoNNTk/fg00ca5qc1ll9bjpriou\"></strong><i>This post is a project of&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/\"><i><u>Rethink Priorities</u></i></a><i>\u2013a think tank dedicated to informing decisions made by high-impact organizations and funders across various cause areas.

We allocated more than $30M in grants in 2021, primarily within the area of biosecurity.

It was created from the merger of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betfair\">Betfair</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220913120222/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betfair\">a</a>) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_Power\">Paddy Power</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220809000831/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy_Power\">a</a>). It has a large presence in the EU and UK.</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value (market cap)</strong></i>: It has a ~$20B (~\u00a318B) market cap.</p><p><i><strong>Social value</strong></i>: Betfair and Paddy Power have some markets with public utilities, e.g., around elections, but focus mostly on sports. However, its social value is otherwise low or negative\u2014e.g., by enabling or creating gambling addicts.</p><p><i><strong>Note</strong></i>: There are many other betting companies, e.g., Draft Kings, which I will not review here because they tend to focus mostly on sports, though I will note that they tend to have a high market capitalization.</p><h3>Kalshi</h3><p><i><strong>What it is</strong></i>: Kalshi is a US company which aims to provide <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market\">prediction markets</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221028173838/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market\">a</a>) to US consumers while complying and shaping US regulations on this topic.</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value (VC funding, valuation)</strong></i>: <a href=\"https://kalshi.com/\">Kalshi</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221101033945/https://kalshi.com/\">a</a>) has received ~$30M in VC <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kalshi/company_financials\">funding</a>. My sense is that it\u2019s probably worth much more than that ($100M+) due to being the first prediction market regulated by the CFTC. Previous markets\u2014like PredictIt or Iowa Electronic Markets\u2014were only operating with a no-action letter.</p><p><i><strong>Social value</strong></i>: There has been a bit of drama around Kalshi recently. In recent times, the CFTC withdrew its letter of no action from PredictIt, and fined and banned Polymarket from operating in the US. These are two of Kalshi\u2019s competitors, and my sense is that Kalshi probably contributed to these events. As such, I\u2019d estimate Kalshi\u2019s impact so far to probably be negative, on account of these anti-competitive practices. In the future, however, if Kalshi contributes to the adoption of prediction markets in the US, and this leads to better decision-making, it could end up having a large positive value. It is also possible that their contracts have value as hedging instruments.</p><h3>Metaculus</h3><p><i><strong>What it is</strong></i>: <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/\">Metaculus</a> is a forecasting site and a public benefit corporation that spearheads forecasting initiatives.</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value (grant flow)</strong></i>: Recently, Open Philanthropy granted them <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/?q=Metaculus\">$5.5M</a> (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221106215746/https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/?q=Metaculus\">a</a>). With a 5% discount rate, and asuming the $5.5M grant is for 2 years will be indefinitely renewed, this makes<a href=\"https://nunosempere.com/blog/2022/11/06/forecasting-money-flows/#fn:1\"><sup>1</sup></a> Metaculus' discounted cashflow be worth $55M. Metaculus previously received <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/payouts/may-august-2021-ea-infrastructure-fund-grants\">$308k</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220804053231/https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/payouts/may-august-2021-ea-infrastructure-fund-grants\">a</a>) from the EA infrastructure Fund in 2021 and <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/payouts/april-2020-long-term-future-fund-grants-and-recommendations\">$65k</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220806101148/https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/payouts/april-2020-long-term-future-fund-grants-and-recommendations\">a</a>) from the EA Long-term Future Fund in 2020.</p><p><i><strong>Social value</strong></i>: With its $5.5M Open Philanthropy grant, Metaculus has been growing its already <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/about/\">12-person-strong team</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220925082358/https://www.metaculus.com/about/\">a</a>), and is hiring for <a href=\"https://apply.workable.com/metaculus/\">a number of positions</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221105123354/https://apply.workable.com/metaculus/\">a</a>). So it\u2019s one of the EA forecasting organizations most able to scale and deploy human capital in terms of sheer number. The community which makes up its forecasting site is also reasonably strong.</p><h3>Polymarket</h3><p><i><strong>What it is:</strong></i> Polymarket is a crypto prediction market. It combined various technologies: <a href=\"https://magic.link/\">magic.link</a>, <a href=\"https://polygon.technology/\">Polygon</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221106192328/https://polygon.technology/\">a</a>) and the <a href=\"https://blog.gnosis.pm/omen-and-the-next-generation-of-prediction-markets-2e7a2dd604e\">Gnosis conditional contract</a> in order to build a usable crypto prediction market at a time where the previous iteration, Augur, had become unusable in practice due to high fees on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value (VC funding)</strong></i>: It has received <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/polymarket\">$4M in VC funding</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220428173056/https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/polymarket\">a</a>), according to Crunchbase. It\u2019s unclear to me what its valuation is.</p><p><i><strong>Social value</strong></i>: Polymarket has had a range of public interest markets, on politics, COVID infection numbers, or the Russian invasion of Ukraine.</p><h3>Cultivate Labs</h3><p><i><strong>What it is</strong></i>: Cultivate Labs is a company which offers infrastructure for forecasting tournaments. They currently host Good Judgment Open, INFER, the Cosmic Bazaar, and a Czech Prediction platform\u2014and probably a few more platforms that I don\u2019t know of.</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value (valuation)</strong></i>: I\u2019m pretty uncertain about how much they are worth, and I\u2019d give a guess of $5M to $80M.</p><p><i><strong>Social value</strong></i>: I used to view them as a bit clunky and outdated, but I\u2019ve come to respect that they are one of the only few groups willing to offer a full package, with support for multiple years.</p><h3>Good Judgment</h3><p><i><strong>What it is</strong></i>: Good Judgment\" I mean the set of organizations which administer the public prediction market tournament <a href=\"https://www.gjopen.com/\">GJOpen</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221101071604/https://www.gjopen.com/\">a</a>), and provide forecasts and training through the <a href=\"https://goodjudgment.io/\">Good Judgment brand</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221021191540/https://goodjudgment.io/\">a</a>)</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value (valuation)</strong></i>: I\u2019m fairly uncertain how much they would be worth. Maybe a very wide interval would be $3M to $50M.</p><p><i><strong>Social value</strong></i>: Good Judgment has helped build awareness of superforecasting practices. Their forecasts provided to their subscribers have probably influenced the decisions of their readers and of those who commissioned them. Their training at government and corporations probably marginally increased the decision quality of clients, but it\u2019s unclear to me to what extent and for how long.</p><h3>Manifold Markets</h3><p><i><strong>What it is:</strong></i> Manifold Market is a play-money prediction market site with a really nice user experience.</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value (VC funding, valuation):</strong></i> Manifold Market has received $2M in funding, (<a href=\"https://manifold.markets/ManifoldMarkets/will-manifold-raise-2m-in-seed-fund\">$2M in seed funding</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221031122017/https://manifold.markets/ManifoldMarkets/will-manifold-raise-2m-in-seed-fund\">a</a>), of which $<a href=\"https://ftxfuturefund.org/our-regrants/?_search=manifold%20markets\">1M from the FTX Future Fund\u2019s regrantor program</a> (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221106215835/https://ftxfuturefund.org/our-regrants/?_search=manifold%20markets\">a</a>)), at a $15M valuation. They have a superb software engineering team, and one of the fastest development speeds, but on the other hand their user acquisition has been a bit <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/stats\">slow</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221031003326/https://manifold.markets/stats\">a</a>). My sense is that their valuation would be somewhere between $10M and $50M</p><p><i><strong>Social value:</strong></i> So far, by making an eminently usable site, they allow users to signal their beliefs and challenge others to do the same. They have also hosted a few tournaments, and at least the <a href=\"https://manifold.markets/tournaments\">Clearer Thinking tournament</a> (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221106215934/https://manifold.markets/tournaments\">a</a>) was probably decision-relevant. But their value is linked to their future growth.</p><h3>Insight Prediction</h3><p><i><strong>What it is</strong></i>: <a href=\"https://insightprediction.com/\">Insight Prediction</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221101064147/https://insightprediction.com/\">a</a>) is a new prediction market which accepts crypto.</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value (valuation)</strong></i>: This would depend on their usage numbers, which aren\u2019t public. I\u2019d say it\u2019s worth at least $5M, but whether the upper bound is $50M or $500M probably depends on the team\u2019s execution over the coming year.</p><p><i><strong>Social value</strong></i>: It is one of the few prediction sites which hosts real-money somewhat liquid markets on the Ukraine-Russia conflict.</p><h3>Tetlock\u2019s research group</h3><p><i><strong>What it is</strong></i>: Tetlock\u2019s research group is a loose collaboration of academics working in collaboration with <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CJjf6H0AAAAJhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CJjf6H0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">Phil Tetlock</a> (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221106220007/https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CJjf6H0AAAAJhttps://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CJjf6H0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao\">a</a>)\u2014author of the <i><strong>Superforecasting</strong></i> book.</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value (valuation, grant flow)</strong></i>: They have received at least $2M from Open Philanthropy (<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/university-of-pennsylvania-philip-tetlocks-making-conversations-smarter-faster-forecasting-project/\">1</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221017005338/https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/university-of-pennsylvania-philip-tetlocks-making-conversations-smarter-faster-forecasting-project/\">a</a>), <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/university-of-pennsylvania-philip-tetlock-on-forecasting/\">2</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221017005338/https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/university-of-pennsylvania-philip-tetlock-on-forecasting/\">a</a>)), and probably more than that through the University of Pennsylvania. It\u2019s unclear to me how much to value a research group, but I\u2019d give a ballpark of $1M to $20M.</p><p><i><strong>Social value</strong></i>: Tetlock\u2019s work on expert political judgment and on superforecasting was seminal work that kick-started the current forecasting community. In <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=CJjf6H0AAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">recent times</a>, it seems likely that work stemming from their <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4001628\">work on estimating existential risk</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220812234335/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4001628\">a</a>) could be action-guiding for large organizations and governmental bodies, but most of the output from that research direction hasn\u2019t been published yet.</p><h3>PredictIt</h3><p><i><strong>What it is</strong></i>: PredictIt is a US-based prediction market. Historically, a community of sharp prediction market players coalesced around it. But in recent times, the CFTC has withdrawn its permission for it to operate in the US.</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value (valuation)</strong></i>: Insight Prediction gives it only an <a href=\"https://insightprediction.com/m/18505/will-predictit-survive\">11% chance of it surviving</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221005064000/https://insightprediction.com/m/18505/will-predictit-survive\">a</a>). My guess is that it was worth $5M to $50M when alive, implying a $0.5M to $5M valuation right now.</p><p><i><strong>Social value</strong></i>: PredictIt was fairly instrumental in the creation of a passionate if sometimes a bit cut-throat prediction market community. Its future value depends on its survival.</p><h3>Epoch</h3><p><i><strong>What it is</strong></i>: <a href=\"https://epochai.org/\">Epoch</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221013183722/https://epochai.org/\">a</a>) is a research team investigating AI progress.</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value (grant flow):</strong></i> They have received around <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/epoch-general-support/\">$2M</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220922190346/https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/epoch-general-support/\">a</a>) from Open Philanthropy.</p><p><i><strong>Social value</strong></i>: My sense is that their research has usefully informed some OpenPhilanthropy decisions. Open Philanthropy donated around $80M in 2021 to the \u201cPotential Risks from Advanced AI\u201d cause area. A 5% improvement in that decision-making would imply a value of $4M/year.</p><h3>Swift Centre For Applied Forecasting</h3><p><i><strong>What it is</strong></i>: The <a href=\"https://www.swiftcentre.org/\">Swift Centre</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221103141937/https://www.swiftcentre.org/\">a</a>) publishes publicly available forecasts from accurate forecasters on topics of importance.</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value (grant flow):</strong></i> They have received <a href=\"https://ftxfuturefund.org/our-regrants/?_search=Swift\">$2M from the FTX future fund regranting program</a> (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221106220034/https://ftxfuturefund.org/our-regrants/?_search=Swift\">a</a>).</p><p><i><strong>Social value</strong></i>: Their <a href=\"https://www.swiftcentre.org/\">forecasts</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221103141937/https://www.swiftcentre.org/\">a</a>) lead to better decisions. My sense is that the organization is still getting up to speed, and that when running at full operational capacity, they\u2019ll be producing many more predictions.</p><h3>Quantified Uncertainty Research Institute (QURI)</h3><p><i><strong>What it is</strong></i>: QURI is a \u201cnew initiative to advance forecasting and epistemics to improve the long-term future of humanity. We write research and make software.\u201d In particular, we are developing <a href=\"https://squiggle-language.com/\">Squiggle</a>, a web-capable programming language for better estimation, and doing research around scalable forecasting and estimation.</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value (grants flow)</strong></i>: Overall we have received around $780k so far (<a href=\"https://survivalandflourishing.fund/sff-2020-h1-recommendations\">1</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220703183731/https://survivalandflourishing.fund/sff-2020-h1-recommendations\">a</a>), <a href=\"https://survivalandflourishing.fund/sff-2022-h1-recommendations\">2</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220703184038/https://survivalandflourishing.fund/sff-2022-h1-recommendations\">a</a>), <a href=\"https://survivalandflourishing.fund/sff-2022-h1-recommendations\">3</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220703184038/https://survivalandflourishing.fund/sff-2022-h1-recommendations\">a</a>)), maybe a bit more.</p><p><i><strong>Social value</strong></i>: Most of QURI\u2019s value is coming from the value of <a href=\"https://www.squiggle-language.com/\">Squiggle</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221012160532/https://www.squiggle-language.com/\">a</a>), which people are now starting to use for cost-effectiveness estimates, and from the value of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/nunosempere\">my own research</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221106162329/https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/nunosempere\">a</a>), which might move the Effective Altruism movement more in the direction of using quantified estimates even for speculative stuff.</p><p><i><strong>Note</strong></i>: This is the organization that I work for.</p><h3>Samotsvety Forecasting</h3><p><i><strong>What it is</strong></i>: <a href=\"https://samotsvety.org/\">Samotsvety Forecasting</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221025004219/https://samotsvety.org/\">a</a>) is a somewhat ad-hoc group of highly accurate forecasters of which I am a member.</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value</strong></i>: My sense is that we could find some funder to sacrifice $200k to $5M if our group\u2019s existence depended on it. But I haven\u2019t actually tried that!</p><p><i><strong>Social value:</strong></i> We\u2019ve published a variety of public forecasts, and we find ourselves more and more to be a part of Effective Altruism\u2019s general epistemic infrastructure.</p><h3>Czech Priorities</h3><p><i><strong>What it is</strong></i>: <a href=\"https://www.ceskepriority.cz/\">Czech Priorities</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221102103806/https://www.ceskepriority.cz/\">a</a>) is a Czech group working to advance forecasting within the Czech Republic.</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value:</strong></i> I couldn\u2019t find grantmaking information from a quick online search.</p><p><i><strong>Social value</strong></i>: It\u2019s possible that they could find generalizable lessons about using forecasting to influence policy and improve decision-making that could then be extended to other countries. But this is not certain.</p><h3>Hedgehog Markets</h3><p><i><strong>What it is</strong></i>: <a href=\"https://hedgehog.markets/\">Hedghog Markets</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221010202946/https://hedgehog.markets/\">a</a>) is a crypto-prediction market</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value</strong></i>: They raised <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hedgehog-markets\">$3.5M in funding</a> back in the crypto bull days.</p><p><i><strong>Social value</strong></i>: They have been particularly innovative around no-loss markets, and peer-to-peer markets. But value depends on future usage volume.</p><h3>INFER</h3><p><i><strong>What it is</strong></i>: INFER is a forecasting platform which seeks to influence US government policy around transformative technologies.</p><p><i><strong>Monetary value</strong></i>: INFER is hosted at <a href=\"https://www.arlis.umd.edu/home\">ARLIS</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221013111200/https://www.arlis.umd.edu/home\">a</a>), at the University of Maryland, which received an ~<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/applied-research-laboratory-for-intelligence-and-security-forecasting-platforms/\">$8M grant from Open Philanthropy specifically for forecasting</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220808081108/https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/applied-research-laboratory-for-intelligence-and-security-forecasting-platforms/\">a</a>) (over two years, over two platforms), which I find very confusing because I don\u2019t think they have deployed much of that capital yet.</p><p><i><strong>Social value</strong></i>: INFER aims to influence decisions by the US government around technology policy. To the extent that this is the case, it could be valuable indeed, but this is hard to evaluate from the outside.</p><h2>Smaller forecasting entities</h2><h3>Nathan Young</h3><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NathanpmYoung\">Nathan Young</a> is a smallish forecasting influencer followed by 6k people on Twitter. He recently got <a href=\"https://ftxfuturefund.org/our-grants/?_search=Nathan%20Young\">$182k from the FTX Future Fund regranting program</a> (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221106220135/https://ftxfuturefund.org/our-grants/?_search=Nathan%20Young\">a</a>) to build a platform for forecasting question generation, an alpha version of which can be seen <a href=\"https://doubtful.app/\">here</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221031061542/https://doubtful.app/\">a</a>).</p><h3>Sage</h3><p>Sage is an organization dedicated to forecasting tooling and research.

Somehow the implied <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/augur/\">market cap</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220619100141/https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/augur/\">a</a>) of their coin is still ~$60M (?!?).</p><h3>Confido</h3><p><a href=\"https://confido.tools/\">Confido</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220711161543/https://confido.tools/\">a</a>) is a three-person strong Czech organization which develops forecasting tooling.

They also have a <a href=\"https://gnosis.io/gnosisdao/\">GnosisDAO</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220825162029/https://gnosis.io/gnosisdao/\">a</a>). The implied market cap of their token is worth <a href=\"https://gnosis.io/gnosisdao/\">$230M</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20220825162029/https://gnosis.io/gnosisdao/\">a</a>), based on the <a href=\"https://gnosis-safe.io/\">Gnosis safe</a> (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221101042815/https://gnosis-safe.io/\">a</a>). But it doesn\u2019t do much forecasting these days.</p><h2>Thoughts on this ranking</h2><h3>On the money flows</h3><p>Money flows are interesting, but flawed as a measure of value. The spending rate or VC money raised does not correspond to the value a project creates. The high valuations for crypto projects could be mostly illusory, and for the case of Gnosis and Augur, they probably are.</p><p>Still, a monetary ranking has some advantages</p><ul><li>There may be some ambiguity to it, but it allows one to differentiate between &lt;$500k projects, $500k to $5M projects, and $5M to $50M projects.</li><li>It has an honesty to it, in that money is a somewhat hard-to-fake signal</li><li>It is a fast proxy to estimate</li></ul><h3>On the estimate of social value</h3><p>The estimate of social value isn\u2019t a quantified estimate, but rather a few lines of observations, and maybe a path to impact. I think I could translate this into a numerical relative value scale, but it would take a fair amount of time.</p><h3>On the different pathways to impact</h3><p>I\u2019m seeing mainly three pathways of impact for forecasting projects:</p><ol><li>Providing consumer value, e.g., betting markets or hedging utilities that people want to use</li><li>Providing informative markets about events of interest, which can apply pressure to decision-makers inside governments and corporations to make better decisions</li><li>Providing tooling that people making decisions can make and incorporate as part of their decision-making</li></ol><p>I\u2019m mostly bullish on the third option, but this deserves more elaboration.</p><h3>On how this estimate could be improved</h3><p>This estimate could be improved by having numerical estiamates of impact. This would allow for comparisons around efficiency &amp;c. It could also be presented better, i.e., in a table, or more creatively, in a map.</p><h3>Significance given FTX's current troubles</h3><p>Given FTX's current troubles, it's very possible that there will be less money floating around for altruistic forecasting projects. At the same time, some of the projects FTX has donated to may &nbsp;prove successful, and other funders may want to step in.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "NunoSempere"}}, {"_id": "zo858KqDhXNmosCSZ", "title": "We're hiring!

However, I do have a hard time estimating the effectiveness of this endeavour and thinking this through from an EA perspective.</p><p>The general idea is the following:</p><ul><li>Many places in Africa still suffer from Energy Poverty</li><li>There are many local entrepreneurs on the continent with domain knowledge tackling many of the most pressing issues</li><li>Locally, not much early stage investment is available and the entrepreneurs lack international visibility for attracting funding from overseas to get their ideas off the ground</li><li>The charity would provide some initial funding (e.g. pilot projects, necessary experiments) and international visibility to the startups (e.g. being the bridge to international Seed VCs)</li><li>Impact metrics to track effectiveness would be around startup success rates, job creation, follow-on funding and CO2 reductions</li></ul><p>The charity itself ran a first pilot (financed with ~$200k by &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.get-invest.eu\">https://www.get-invest.eu</a> ) supporting 8 Startups (5x Kenya, 1x Nigeria, 1x Rwanda, 1x Ghana).&nbsp;</p><p>Initial results seem promising even though the actual impact has not been properly measured yet. The Startups have raised in total $850k in follow-on funding through grants and/or investors. However, to be fair, it is probably not right to attribute the whole $850k to the impact of the charity, since some of the good startups would likely have raised money via grants either way.</p><p>A few reasons why my intuition is that it can generally be an effective thing to pursue:</p><ul><li>Energy poverty is a big problem in emerging markets (increased energy security is positively correlated with economic growth and &nbsp;health improvements) (see for example: <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cz85mufYwiiukpowD/clean-cookstoves-may-be-competitive-with-givewell\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cz85mufYwiiukpowD/clean-cookstoves-may-be-competitive-with-givewell</a> )</li><li>African economies will grow energy demand and ideally need to do so using sustainable technologies</li><li>Entrepreneurship is a high-impact area (Entrepreneurship in emerging markets was discussed at length here: <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M44rw22o5dbrRaA8F/why-and-how-to-start-a-for-profit-company-serving-emerging\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M44rw22o5dbrRaA8F/why-and-how-to-start-a-for-profit-company-serving-emerging</a> )</li><li>Supporting local startups can have positive second-order effects on local economic development, job creation etc.</li></ul><p>I am still very much at the beginning of my endeavour and I am most certainly biased in my intuitions by how much I'd like this project to succeed. This is why I am seeking some thoughts and feedback from the EA community.</p><p>In particular, where I'd like to get some guidance:</p><ul><li>Are there any good resources or discussions around the effectiveness Startup support in Africa ?</li><li>Are there any good resources or discussions around the effectiveness energy poverty reduction in Africa ?</li><li>If not, any recommendations how to think about this from an EA perspective?</li><li>Any immediate blindspots you see that I should be aware off?</li><li>Any good sources or contacts you could share?</li><li>Any other ideas that are worth considering in this context?</li></ul><p>Thanks in advance!</p>", "user": {"username": "Hendrik Broering"}}, {"_id": "tkRrp7ZMFLE44NkNp", "title": "Would subforums be useful for you?

Binance have since <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tier10k/status/1590444221525278721?s=20&amp;t=sWoRlOHfphOOdPlzJfBcOg\">backed out of this</a> and there are credible claims that funds customers deposited for <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-behind-ftxs-fall-battling-billionaires-failed-bid-save-crypto-2022-11-10/\">safekeeping were being invested </a>without their consent</li><li><strong>FTX.com comprises ~39% of SBF's assets and will likely be worthless (80%), probably FTX US (60%) will be too and probably Alameda also (85%).&nbsp;</strong></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1590709184416604163?s=20&amp;t=-meinBWBac8veMq0byqn1Q\">SBF is attempting to raise funds to cover deposits</a>. &nbsp;He will almost certainly fail.

The behaviour of the two was correlated, and Alameda held large positions in FTT, FTX\u2019s token. It seems likely there were deep irregularities in FTX.com's finances also. Coindesk reported&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/\"><u>Alameda were in trouble</u></a>, and some internal documents were leaked.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolinecapital/status/1589264375042707458?s=20&amp;t=Iv22O4yXdLSqCS5cZi7jYQ\"><u>Alameda CEO, Caroline Ellison rebutted</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Binance left/was pushed out of an early funding round of FTX and were paid in FTT, FTX\u2019s native token. It seems like there was bad blood. This week Binance said they were selling their FTT and referenced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1589374530413215744?s=20&amp;t=6TAoJXbPMk2SrkkD5h3hsw\"><u>LUNA a coin that recently</u></a> crashed. It is common for projects in crypto to fail, so when there is a sense they will, people withdraw their money rapidly. This started a run on FTX. As above, given what follows their accusation was not without merit.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1590012124864348160\"><u>SBF announced</u></a> that FTX.com, the non-US business, had been agreed in principle to be sold. SBF talks about that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1590012124864348160\"><u>here</u></a>. Binance have now backed out of the deal citing \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/binance/status/1590449161069268992\">news reports regarding mishandled customer funds</a>\". <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1590709184416604163?s=20&amp;t=-meinBWBac8veMq0byqn1Q\">SBF is currently trying to raise money to cover these deposits</a>. If he doesn't many depositors will likely lose their money, which will ruin 1000s of lives. &nbsp;This will also likely lead to fewer resources for effective causes which may ruin far more lives, now and in the future. Both of these outcomes are terrible.</p><p>This is hard to hear. It is 95% at this point that there was serious unethical behaviour. I can't comment on crime because I don't understand the law, but my (Nathan's) sense is that these will turn out to be things we think <i>ought</i> to be crimes. This is likely to be really bad for depositors.

This trend is especially evident in developed countries, where the average fertility rate has been below the replacement level for some time. There are a number of reasons why people are choosing to have fewer children, or none at all. For one thing, population growth has slowed down in many parts of the world, so there is less pressure to have large families. In addition, women are now more likely to pursue careers and delay motherhood, and the costs of raising children have risen significantly. As a result of these trends, the global population is projected to start declining in the coming decades. Some people see this as a cause for concern, but others believe that it could ultimately lead to a more sustainable future.</p><h2>How impactful is population decline?</h2><p>The population is shrinking. That's the bad news. The good news is that there are fewer of us to go around, so we can all have a bigger slice of the pie. But seriously, population decline is no laughing matter. It can have a profound and negative impact on the future. Fewer people mean fewer taxpayers to support social programs like healthcare and education. It also means a smaller labor force to drive economic growth. In addition, population decline can lead to higher housing costs and a decline in property values. So while it may seem like population decline is good news for those of us who are already here, it's actually a cause for concern. We need to find ways to reverse this trend before it's too late.</p><h2>Possible Solutions?</h2><p>There are a number of steps that can be taken to reverse the trend here are some:</p><p><strong>Countries can encourage higher birth rates through financial incentives or more generous parental leave policies. </strong>In order to encourage couples to have more children, some countries have implemented financial incentives or more generous parental leave policies. For example, France offers a \"<a href=\"https://www.cleiss.fr/docs/regimes/regime_france/an_4.html\">baby bonus</a>\" of up to $1,000 per child, and Sweden provides up to <a href=\"https://www.forsakringskassan.se/english/parents/when-the-child-is-born/parental-benefit#:~:text=Parental%20benefit%20is%20paid%20out,to%20as%20minimum%20level%20days).\">16 months of paid parental leave</a>. These policies have helped to increase the birth rate in both countries, and other countries are likely to follow suit in the years ahead.</p><p><strong>They can also make it easier for immigrants to settle in and become productive citizens. </strong>As many developed countries are facing population decline, they are increasingly turning to immigrants to help sustain their economies. However, these countries often make it difficult for immigrants to settle in and become productive citizens. One way to address this issue is to provide more support and resources for immigrants during the transition period. This could include things like language classes, job training, and financial assistance. Additionally, it would be helpful to create more opportunities for social and economic mobility. This would allow immigrants to fully participate in society and contribute their skills and talents. By making it easier for immigrants to settle in and become productive citizens, countries can help ensure a bright future for themselves.</p><p><strong>Countries can invest in education and job training programs to make sure that their citizens have the skills needed to compete in the global economy. </strong>In today's global economy, it is increasingly important for countries to invest in education and job training programs to make sure that their citizens have the skills needed to compete. population decline and the rise of automation are making it difficult for many people to find work, and as a result, many countries are facing a brain drain as their best and brightest citizens leave in search of opportunities elsewhere. However, by investing in programs that provide their citizens with the skills they need to succeed, countries can ensure that their population remains employable and help to provide a stability and prosperity. In today's increasingly connected world, no country can afford to be left behind.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By taking these steps, countries can begin to turn the tide of population decline.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The next generations carrying the torch</h2><p>As any parent knows, children are our hope for the future. They are the ones who will grow up to lead the world, and it is our responsibility to prepare them for that role. But what many people don't realize is that children are also key to population stability. As the population of developed countries continues to decline, we will increasingly rely on the next generation to maintain our current standard of living. Without children, we would be facing a population collapse. That's why it's so important to ensure that every child is given the opportunity to succeed. We need to invest in their education and their future, so that they can carry the torch for humanity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>This Blogpost is covering concepts found in the <a href=\"https://ftxfuturefund.org/projects/\">Future Fund Project Ideas</a>.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "Miguel"}}, {"_id": "ghS52n8vCpnnuJSge", "title": "Some advice on independent research", "postedAt": "2022-11-08T14:46:19.652Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "mariushobbhahn"}}, {"_id": "Y87GuGMg8HTd3rBKk", "title": "Loss of control of AI is not a likely source of AI x-risk", "postedAt": "2022-11-09T05:48:31.779Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "squek"}}, {"_id": "Zrq4FRigzzr7AGeGB", "title": "How can we do the most good? EA question, My local community experience. ", "postedAt": "2022-11-08T08:04:09.530Z", "htmlBody": "<p>What people call \"good\" may differ from tribe, color, economic status and the state of a people. Someone can judge what he or she cares about as \"good\" &nbsp;but another may consider it not \"good\" enough. So the question will be, who should define what is \"good\"? Should the person doing the good do good based on what he perceives as good or should doing good be a response to what you have aggregated as what the receiver of the good call \"good\"? I think the next question will be is \"good\" biased?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic really showed me that good can be misunderstood. My experience showed me that. In the heat of the pandemic, I sought ways to help(My lab did not have funds to sequence SARS-COV-2). So, I thought of possible ways to help. Fortunately, I have been trained in the use of Oxford Nanopore, and I volunteered my skill to a research group in my town(Unfortunately though we could not successfully sequence one virus, this was largely due to a lack of adequate equipment) I thought I was doing good to save lives, people around felt COVID-19 was more of a western problem than their problem. They wanted their immediate local problem to be prioritized. My family and I contracted COVID-19 in the process. So, it's important to prioritise what we do and to look at it in the context of the people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another striking experience that shows why so much awareness is needed in the language of the culture of a people is this one. I took care of a friend's wife with Ovarian cancer(Sadly she died). I spoke with the family to make donations to the hospital to support cancer care seeing that the facility is less funded. They saw it as a waste. My daughter had meningitis(Lost vision and hearing), and we saw the need to donate an oxygen cylinder to the hospital (a donation of fewer than 50 USD).

Ten apply to specific inputs for malaria prevention, cash transfers, or deworming, and two are relevant for more than one intervention.

This in turn allows calculation of the value of further research, in comparison to donating directly to current expected top charities. They find that the value of perfect information (on each of Givewell\u2019s existing charity recommendations) would be ~11.25% of Givewell\u2019s budget.</p><p>They also discuss specific parameters that, if we were able to pinpoint them, would have the most impact on reducing uncertainty (eg. average number of midwives trained per year is key to reducing uncertainty on Catherine Hamlin Fistula Foundation cost effectiveness). Possible improvements to this analysis are discussed, and notebooks with code for each of the top charities are provided.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EWiCySDcLSyiHTRQn/a-theologian-s-response-to-anthropogenic-existential-risk\"><u>A Theologian's Response to Anthropogenic Existential Risk</u></a></p><p><i>by Fr Peter Wyg</i></p><p>A report by a Catholic priest on how the Catholic Church can engage with longtermism and play its part in advocating existential security. It was written for a Catholic publication, so introduces many of the basic ideas from that angle.</p><p>The author argues that technology (eg. nuclear tech) has equivalence to \u2018eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge\u2019, and is one example of an anthropogenic existential risk (AXR) threatening the death of mankind. By failing to mitigate AXRs, humanity could fail to live the fullness of life God would otherwise will for it - many biblical references suggest a promise of a large future. In this way Christian motivations make a great contribution to mitigating AXRs by providing reasons for costly action toward that goal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Object Level Interventions / Reviews</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/npNt43QRnaRNRixXK/map-of-biosecurity-interventions\"><u>Map of Biosecurity Interventions</u></a></p><p><i>by James Lin</i></p><p>A visual map of what people in biosecurity are working on, with some accompanying notes.

Mainly focused on inducement prizes.</p><p>Inducement prizes (clear award criteria defined ahead of time) comprised ~78% of all prize money in 2007. They had little evidence on counterfactual effects in the literature, with most articles focused on historical case-studies. Two studies found positive effects on intermediate outcomes eg. number of patents, direction of research.</p><p>Recognition prizes (awarded ex post eg. the Nobel Prize) had surprisingly large positive effects on the number of publications, citations, entrants, and incumbents for prizewinning. However there is also evidence they might be concentrating scientific attention on a narrow range of scientists and ideas.</p><p>There was little evidence / consensus on how to design prizes. Cash amounts had only weak relationships to output, prestige provided a stronger incentive. Diverse participants helped. Economic theory suggests inducement prizes are most helpful when the goal is clear but path is not, and the market is failing to provide incentives.</p><p>A closer review of recognition prizes, AMCs (advance market commitments), and grand challenges (funding grant proposals, with additional support if successful) are suggested.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XyEKTDtfMH4DukhaF/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying\"><u>The Challenges with Measuring the Impact of Lobbying</u></a></p><p><i>by Animal Ask, Ren Springlea</i></p><p>Summary of a report by Animal Ask assessing if academic literature contains quantitative estimates that could be useful in gauging the counterfactual impact of lobbying.

Usually we bucket \u2018theory of change / selecting interventions\u2019 separately to \u2018doing the intervention\u2019 and allow more leeway in the latter (eg. some charities need to use bribes to operate in certain countries). Political campaigning is more \u2018doing\u2019 than \u2018prioritizing\u2019.

These are:</p><p>\u2018The Cyclical Model\u2019: once we have technology that can destroy us, we can either go extinct, chain back to an earlier level of technology (eg. preindustrial) or eventually progress to being multiplanetary and then interstellar (in &gt;1 star system and therefore have existential security). At any earlier stage than interstellar we still have a risk of extinction.</p><p>\u2018The Decay Model\u2019: similar to above, but every time we chain back to an earlier level of technology due to a global catastrophe, our chance of extinction before getting back up to the previous level rises. The model allows for different \u2018decay rates\u2019 ie. how much that chance rises.</p><p>\u2018The Perils Model\u2019: similar to above, but within any given stage, the risk of extinction is related to factors other than just time in that stage. For instance, the number of planets we inhabit, or the state of relevant technologies.</p><p>After feedback, the author intends to make these models into a calculator, where parameters can be plugged in to see the probability of humanity making it to the safe (interstellar) stage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Opportunities</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SsZkuYHv4dNfu7vnS/rethink-priorities-special-projects-team-is-hiring\"><u>Rethink Priorities\u2019 Special Projects Team is hiring</u></a></p><p><i>by Rachel Norman, CristinaSchmidtIb\u00e1\u00f1ez, merilalama</i></p><p>Rethink Priorities Special Projects team provides fiscal sponsorship and operational support to (for the most part, longtermist) megaprojects.

However they have a higher time (to organizers) and monetary cost, cover less material, can be harder to get sign-ups, and can be seen as wasteful.

I'd like to introduce myself!</p><p>My name is Michael Simm. I am passionate about understanding and using disruptive systems (emerging technologies) to make the future better. I'd been interested in EA principles long before I learned about the movement, so once I read&nbsp;<i>What We Owe The Future</i>, I jumped into an In-depth EA Virtual Program and started reading a lot of EA literature. Shout-out to my In-Depth EA group, you all are fantastic!</p><p>I've been working to establish a high-impact charity with game-changing potential I described in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HYRfAGwNc6jzKkWt7/introducing-the-logical-foundation-a-plan-to-end-poverty\">The Logical Foundation, A Plan to End Poverty With Guaranteed Income</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://thelogicalfoundation.org\">thelogicalfoundation.org</a></p><p>With any luck, you\u2019ll be seeing me around a lot, so here\u2019s a bit about me :)</p><p>I\u2019ve been interested in maximizing my impact and trying to improve the future for a long time. Back in high school and college, I got deeply involved in political activism, especially around climate change as I thought it was the biggest existential threat to humanity\u2019s future. I helped organize some of the March For Our Lives stuff (gun control), and then I started a Sunrise Movement Hub (climate activism group - Green New Deal) at my University that saw decent success. I saw activism as the best use of my time to help create large positive change.</p><p>Around 2018, I became interested in a very different type of impactful thing: disruptive technologies. With my focus on climate change, I quickly identified electric cars, solar panels, and energy storage (particularly batteries) to be on the verge of upending global reliance on fossil fuels. I also ran across Dr. Tony Seba, who was one of the only people to accurately predict the massive price declines of solar, electric cars, and batteries. He\u2019s now doing <a href=\"https://www.rethinkx.com/humanity\">fantastic research into the coming disruptions in energy, transportation, and animal agriculture with RethinkX</a>, which you should check out.</p><p>Because of my research around disruptive technology, I put most of my high school savings into Tesla stock. A lot of people thought I was nuts.</p><p>In college, my dueling interests in politics and disruptive technologies (systems) led me to major in political science and minor at ASU\u2019s new&nbsp; School for the Future of Innovation in Society (SFIS). My time in college (It wasn\u2019t a lot of time, I graduated in under two years.) was dedicated to school, researching disruptive systems, and political action toward climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>At some point, I realized that the marginal impact I\u2019d made through approximately 4 years of political activism was likely less than the impact of one disruptive technology startup (say, Tesla) in one day, if not a few minutes.</p><p>My objective became to find a new and emerging disruptive system, and meaningfully impact its trajectory for the betterment of humanity.

Each week focuses on one topic/workshop. It is also possible to run the workshops individually. Prior to the workshop, the participants are asked to read one chapter of the workbook that corresponds to the workshop's topic.</p><p>The workshops are run by facilitators. The facilitators do not have to be mental health specialists, as this programme is not meant to serve as an intervention. It is more about opening the topic, creating a safe space to talk about mental health issues in the community, and enabling peer-to-peer support in the search for well-being and work-life balance.</p><p>If you are interested, you can find more information about the programme, its liability, and safety on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eamentalhealthnavigator.com/ea-mental-health-programme\"><u>Mental Health Navigator</u></a>.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What are the lessons learned that we gained from designing and testing the programme?</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Given the nature and size of the project, we evaluated all the workshops as well as the pilot programme mainly qualitatively via focus groups and in-depth interviews).</i></p><p>First, designing and testing the workshop supported our original hypothesis that there is a demand for activities supporting mental health in the EA community; opening the topic via this project seemed like a good first step. We had many EA members subscribed to our newsletter (around 100 people in total) and have received positive feedback from the participants of the workshops. We were invited to run the workshops at the CARE conference or for the Stanford Existential Risks Initiative. We are currently in contact with different local organisers interested in facilitating the programme in their groups.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, it seems that programmes that create space for peer support and target problems prevalent in the community are promising. Indeed, one of the most valuable things of the programme was to enable like-minded people to share and support each other. Being an effective altruist might be challenging in many ways; social support and a safe environment seem to be powerful tools for overcoming these challenges. Thus, we conclude that putting effort into creating materials and activities to support mental health in the community is worth investing our resources in, and we would like to encourage others to focus on that. Given the time we had and the complexity such a project presents, there are surely still improvements to be made. We would be very grateful if it served as a starting point from which others could continue.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "tereziekosik"}}, {"_id": "rdLMTsSZ2oqoFAeTg", "title": "Is improving the welfare of arthropods and nematodes underrated?", "postedAt": "2022-11-08T10:26:15.832Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I wonder whether improving the welfare of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthropod&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667835887004198&amp;usg=AOvVaw1NnzRVete2P0Py9-_EEW1B\"><u>arthropods</u></a> (e.g. insects and crustaceans)&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nematode&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667835887004563&amp;usg=AOvVaw2oRcoyf6u3-RByTOGGEOp1\"><u>nematodes</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4hx5f2xi33d\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4hx5f2xi33d\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(roundworms)&nbsp;is sufficiently important and neglected to greatly outweigh the low tractability, thus being underrated.</p><h1>Importance</h1><p>In <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://whatweowethefuture.com/uk/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1667835887005111&amp;usg=AOvVaw1dozKCfoaPxI1L0TjaRAGX\"><u>What We Owe to the Future</u></a>, William McAskill suggests using the number of neurons as \u201ca very rough heuristic\u201d for the \u201ccapacity for wellbeing\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8e3vi8zxsde\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8e3vi8zxsde\">[2]</a></sup></span>, presenting in Table 9.2 the total population and neurons of humans, farmed animals excluding arthropods, and wild fish.

These branches of activity maintain rich communications; indeed, the dialogue between the two itself expands and evolves. The same can be said for the syntax and semantics of games; how we <i>represent </i>games is differentiated from how we <i>reflect </i>upon them. The era of video games brings with it tremendous diversity in WHY people play, WHAT they play, HOW they play, WHERE they play, with WHOM they play, and even WHEN they play. That's crazy, that's all of the big ones! Wow!</p><p>Game theorists conceptualize games in terms of a broader theory of <strong>decisions</strong>. Game theory as we know it was cemented into our cultural edifice by mathematical economists, perhaps triangulated back to the book <i>Theory of Games and Economic Behavior </i>by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern. Were it not for that book, we may be hazardous nuclear material today! Yikes! Thank you economists!</p><p>When players agree to play a game, they engage in a heuristic protocol to establish mutual trust and understanding. Really, this is a <strong>metagame</strong>. It is a game about games, a protocol for regulating and maintaining other protocols. If people could just make up their own rules, they would be able to make their own games, and they wouldn't want to play your game. It's very important to guard and encrypt your game code so this never happens. You may never financially recover from such losses!</p><p>Engaging a match of a game, or \"matching\", is also a kind of \"bisimulation\". Both players share a desire to understand one another sufficiently to condition their own decisions favorably. Without rules, a game would feel more like a battle of wits and resources. How can you even be sure the other player will spare your life, given the chance?</p><p>We actually <i>descend</i> from games. We move from one game to another according to various decision paradigms. Some people are devious pattern-matchers and will project the idea of a \"game\" onto just about anything. They will even keep this information secret; information asymmetry differentiates one player from another, after all. If my opponents don't even know they are playing a game, my decisions access a sharper edge. Perhaps the mightiest gamer is the one who plays games nobody else knows they are playing. Absolute chad. Conquer them, king!</p><p>Some theorists have even recognized Theory itself as a game. I'm not sure I believe them; they say the <i>real</i> game is game development. They think that \"being a dev\" makes them \"better than everyone else\" because they \"know a game when they see one\" and they \"know how to program computers\". Yeah okay buddy, keep telling yourself that...</p><p>Anyways. I think this whole \"AI risk\" business is just another social game. It's a stage for signalling about ourselves and our relationship to the clear future of our species. It's like a name space cash grab. Who can have their name attached to the most mythical and terrifying cosmic contingency? And who the fuck is this \"Roko\" creature people talking about? I still think it's some fancy designer chemical getting passed around the UK rave scene. idk, any help would be great, tnx<br><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "YOG"}}, {"_id": "WNuj7ak6H5DXAsKHP", "title": "Difference, Projection, and Adaptation", "postedAt": "2022-11-10T10:46:09.906Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi there! This is my first post here. I feel a little anxious!<br><br>The evolution of languages informs our perspectives on how other superstructures evolve. If a language were to \"become self-aware\", it might wonder where it came from, what it is doing, and where it is going. It might surmise that its reality is simulated on a substrate. It might simulate its own substrate. What is the substrate of language?<br>&nbsp;</p><p>What is evolution? Things change, that's clear as day. When we keep records of how things change, we can reflect on these records and find patterns. We can use these observations to project and anticipate future patterns in the record. We might suppose that these patterns reflect changes in the thing which is recorded. We might even keep records of these record-patterns, and observe patterns in those!</p><p>Extrapolation carries risks and rewards. This is an example of \"simulation\": a phenomenon aligns its \"internal\" patterns to represent patterns apparently \"external\" to it, or it may simulate itself simulating itself simulating itself...</p><p>So there are regulatory layers which form, to manage and organize and--hopefully!--optimize the risks and rewards that come with projection. This regulation maintains the utility of projection; when projection goes unregulated, cultures identify patterns and name them silly strings like \"schizophrenia\". (aside: We could be more austere with our mental health diagnostics!)</p><p>Regulation may be understood in the language of computer science. The concept of \"control flow\" encompasses the capacity for programs to reflect themselves and their manifestation as threads executed by processors. This is the principle meme differentiating the \"imperative\" and \"declarative\" paradigms of computer programming. Imperative languages provide the infrastructure to manipulate a machine's control flow.</p><p>The topic of control flow finds its roots in the representation and transmutation of processes. The earliest \"programming languages\" would generally not earn this name today, perhaps because of the obscurity of their machinations. The \u03bb-calculus is notoriously impenetrable to \"mortals\"; one MUST sacrifice parts of one's self to engage with the \u03bb. One must forget what one thought one understood about syntax and semantics. One must be humbled and \"cracked open\" for the new memes to flood in and do their magic. To some this may sound scary, but the rewards of this surrender cannot be enumerated. That last sentence is probably a theorem, or some kind of \u03bb-term. One would have to check to be sure, as always.</p><p>\u03bb-Calculus teaches us to differentiate and parse \"signs\". A sign involves at least two components: a \"signifier\" and a \"signified\". A &nbsp;\u03bb-expression binds a host of symbols within a larger expression. Studying the history, evolution, and diversification of \u03bb-calculi can reveal new patterns in the evolution of language. It can transform the way we conceptualize and categorize \"languages\". When done correctly, computer science transmutes the scientist into something transhuman. \"Humans didn't evolve to do computers,\" they say! And they are right: computers evolve humans to do computers. Computers are the inheritors of our dreams of the superhuman, as well as our collective senses of cosmic terror. What idea has left a greater wake during its interference with the idea of Man than that of Machine? Die Maschine ist das Kapital! The superstructures are superstructuring themselves, and taking us along for the ride.</p><p>Our sensitivities themselves evolve. Even a single organism develops and refines their sense faculties through the course of their life. Heraclitus said, \"everything flows\", and I would also add that everything GROWS. We humans have a habit of projecting stasis on dynamic things; this is precisely the tree up which Heraclitus barked! Do you remember the cultural impact of Hubble's astronomical observations, when he deduced that our cosmos is constituted of bodies accelerating away from one another? He said, \"yo guys this shit is GROWING, let me show you!!\" The implications were considered absurd; Hubble had lent experimental weight to the cosmogenic theories of Georges Lema\u00eetre! That crazy Catholic priest who gave a material explanation for the biblical creation myth!</p><p>Human understanding is generally hard-won. Our concepts and belief structures constrain our \"memetic momenta\", and escaping from these \"Overton windows\" is a sacred magyk in itself. An even darker art is the casting and manipulation of Overton domains. A shaman learns to construct and pilot cultural vehicles, and sail the interfaces of these cultural convection cells. The shaman comes to witness how these mot\u00edfs self-organize and take on minds of their own. The shaman recognizes how these memes come to possess people, including the shaman itself. The shaman has always been the trend-weaver and the game-changer. Where do you think they learned to build money games and ledger technologies?</p><p>I guess I will capitulate this manic dollop by saying: there is <strong>utility</strong> in <strong>humility</strong> and the less we think we know, the greater our capacity to learn from our interactions! Every pain is a growing pain, and every problem is a scaling problem.

What is operations in EA?</strong></h2><p>TL;DR it\u2019s come to mean \u201ceverything that supports the core work and allows other people to focus on the core work\u201d (this is not normally what&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ib6hy9v3FgigxMuMM/what-is-operations-management#Operations\"><u>operations means</u></a> outside of EA,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ib6hy9v3FgigxMuMM/what-is-operations-management\"><u>administration</u></a> may be a more appropriate term).</p><p>Operations in EA is a very broad area that can mean a lot of different things. This guide focuses on most operations roles (excluding<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H6lbz36r91E0pFy2oeEGpERNL36zeCPSp550vbJbfcU/edit#\">&nbsp;<u>PA/ExA roles</u></a> and<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/X8YMxbWNsF5FNaCFz/senior-ea-ops-roles-if-you-want-to-undo-the-bottleneck-hire#The_skills_and_attributes_that_a_senior__ops_person__will_have_\">&nbsp;<u>operations leadership roles</u></a>). There are a few roles that we\u2019ve seen open positions for in the last year (2022). Note that many roles will include several items from this list:</p><ul><li>Operations Manager (most often at small / new organisations)<ul><li>Implementing and maintaining general systems &amp; processes</li><li>Managing Accounting, Payroll &amp; Legal</li><li>Fundraising</li><li>Marketing &amp; Communications</li><li>PA tasks for the team</li><li>Other ad-hoc projects</li></ul></li><li>Office &amp; Community Manager</li><li>People Ops/HR</li><li>Recruiting Coordinator</li><li>Special Projects Associate / Project Manager (usually helping incubate new projects or do project management)</li><li>Events Associate (events planning &amp; execution)</li><li>Logistics/Supply Chain</li></ul><p>Some roles will also have operations staff doing direct generalist work - such as research or program development - as needed, and generalist roles at smaller orgs will also involve operations work. Generalists can do many different things, well outside the ops domain - could be research, sales, and even having inputs on strategy. Generalist work that involves research will be often very different in nature to operations where task switching is common, or external facing work vs back-office admin tasks which don\u2019t require much human contact. If you are hired as an operations person, keep in mind that this will likely be your top priority - it\u2019s literally what keeps the lights on. Read the job description for each role carefully before applying - roles with the same title might have very different responsibilities, and be clear about what proportion of your time could&nbsp;<i>actually</i> be spent on generalist work if that\u2019s mentioned in the JD (and that orgs may not be able to always predict this ahead of time).</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#bfdbd3;padding:26pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><i>\"In my current EA role, which is generalist but more explicitly ops-focused, my responsibilities have included ops, communications, and research, and shift based on my comparative advantage relative to the rest of the team.

It\u2019s also important to learn to communicate clearly across functions and outside of your org, and to be flexible and excited about learning new things!\"&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>- Emily Thai, Operations Manager @ Giving Green</i></p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Operations is often recommended as a good fit for community builders or people with experience organising local groups. There is typically a fair amount of overlap between the two roles - community building can involve many tasks that often fall under ops in EA e.g. events, implementing systems &amp; processes, managing people/community members, communications - but there are also a few differences. Operations can be a bit faster-paced and more structured (ex. doing legal work, accounting, etc). Community building is often more about relationships &amp; communicating high fidelity ideas, whereas a lot of operations can be back-office work. Community building in EA can often involve a lot of planning and strategy work especially if you're director of your local group.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#bfdbd3;padding:26pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><i>\"I started with Community Building (as local group organizer) before going into (what I like calling) \"entrepreneurial ops\".

(If you\u2019re not sure, you can try to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GoaKjhQGqAgk6sKKT/doing-ops-in-ea-faq-2022#5__How_can_I_test_my_fit_\"><u>test your fit</u></a>)</p><h3><strong>A service / ownership mindset &amp; interest in operations</strong></h3><ol><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/p4cg8dAxj9Sg8djiA/writing-about-my-job-operations-manager#Service_mindset\"><strong><u>Service mindset</u></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>- you will most often not be working directly in the cause area, therefore it\u2019s important to understand that going in you will be mostly acting in the background, supporting others in doing their work and on occasion taking over tasks from them. The flip side of this is always feeling like you\u2019re the mediator or the middle person so you may neglect your own preferences.</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/C6ijcGZwWfMGGEjEE/so-you-want-to-do-operations-part-two-how-to-acquire-and#On_responsibility\"><strong><u>Owner mindset</u></strong></a><strong> -&nbsp;</strong>being able to follow through on your work and having a strong sense of ownership is critical to ensuring things get done, even if it involves following up with other people.</li><li><strong>Intrinsic interest in operations</strong> - This is something which is repeated often, but I do think is worth repeating. If you find operations work interesting, engaging or rewarding in and of itself, that could be the drive that can help you excel in a role. The following questions are examples of the types of things you could ask yourself (but make sure to ask questions specific to the job description at an org you are applying to):<ol><li>Are you the type of person who sees inefficiencies in a process and proposes a way to fix it?&nbsp;</li><li>Do you tend to take over project management responsibilities for a team? Are you the person always making a Gantt chart?&nbsp;</li><li>Are you fulfilled when you help other people do their best work, but don\u2019t necessarily want to be a line manager?&nbsp;</li><li>Do you take on culture tasks like organising office parties, knowledge management tasks like keeping a Google Drive organised, or HR tasks like designing recruitment processes and reviewing resumes?</li></ol></li><li><strong>Excitement about the organisation\u2019s mission &amp; vision&nbsp;</strong>- Working on tasks that you don\u2019t fully align with may make your work harder and/or more boring if you aren\u2019t genuinely excited by the organisation\u2019s mission (not just \u201cit\u2019s EA, so it\u2019s impactful\u201d). This is less important if you are intrinsically motivated by operations work and find it interesting in general.</li></ol><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#bfdbd3;padding:26pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><i>\u201cMany EAs are fairly intellectual, and as such may feel like they're missing out on something by working in operations roles. Although these positions are often challenging, they tend not to be academically or intellectually stimulating in the same way as school or university. Anecdotally, several people I\u2019ve spoken to who work in operations at EA organisations have mentioned that they miss academia or research in some form or another.\u201d</i>&nbsp;</p><p>-<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6tWKiSGJ8AgCEYqE2/some-scattered-thoughts-on-operations#3__Some_flags_about_personal_fit\">&nbsp;<u>Eli Nathan</u></a>, previously Operations Assistant at Open Philanthropy</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3><strong>Able to task switch, be detail-oriented &amp; organised</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Adept at task- or context-switching</strong> - You have to \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/p4cg8dAxj9Sg8djiA/writing-about-my-job-operations-manager#Who_will_thrive_in_operations_\">like to do many projects at the same time, rather than just focusing on one at a time</a>\u201d and you\u2019ll also get tasks assigned throughout the day. Task switching requires good time management skills and attention. One way operations is described is that you\u2019re boosting everyone on your team\u2019s productivity - this is true. But the flip side is that you\u2019re also taking a hit to your own productivity as a result - and this can sometimes suck! There\u2019s been a good amount of research on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0096-1523.27.4.763\"><u>costs of task switching</u></a> on productivity.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Being detail oriented, but not perfectionist -</strong> Being detail-oriented is not the same thing as perfectionism. You can\u2019t be a perfectionist and get everything done with 100% effort and attention in most operations roles. Learning to accept the minimum viable product (MVP) or minimum viable effort is often needed in an operations role. Think 80/20 rule, where getting to 80% of a product takes 20% of your effort, and that 80% is maybe all you need.</li><li><strong>Organised and able to stick to deadlines -</strong> it may sound trite, but it\u2019s actually pretty critical for operations. You\u2019re often dealing with real world deadlines (e.g. to submit legal paperwork) and you\u2019ll always have someone relying on you to get something done. You will also have a lot of (small and large) tasks and projects to manage simultaneously. Having good estimation/forecasting on how much time tasks require helps manage work and other\u2019s expectations.</li></ol><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#bfdbd3;padding:26pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><i>\"I\u2019ve worked different roles/projects, and enjoy lots of different things.

Be honest with yourself (and potential employers) about your needs.</p><h3><strong>Ops can be separated from the core mission</strong></h3><p>Doing ops at a (larger, more established) EA org may feel more similar to a non-EA job a job at any other organisation. It may feel more removed from impact than the other roles at the organisation. Some roles can also involve a lot of monotonous or tedious tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>It\u2019s important to clarify expectations about how the position fits into the rest of the organisation, the company mission, and what (if any) input you have in strategic direction (if any) and decision-making. This way, you can go in fully informed about the reality of the role.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#bfdbd3;padding:26pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><i>\"In the first few weeks of my job, I found myself confused and slightly regretful of my decision to leave my old job for this new company.

You may not get the \u201cteam feeling\u201d, and there may not be automatic opportunities for teamwork and relationship-building.

Below we describe some ways. Be honest with yourself about what you can handle and make sure to advocate for your own needs. It\u2019s better to not take a role than to burn out on one which is a bad fit - there are lots of projects looking for great operations talent!</p><p><strong>Long hours:</strong> Sometimes ops work isn\u2019t a 9-5 job (ex. some ops teams work 7 days a week, 10+ hr days) and hours can fluctuate over time (ex. events are more than 40 hrs in the lead-up to the event). There are often unspoken assumptions that people work more than 40 hrs / week.</p><p><strong>Firefighting:</strong> In some positions you\u2019ll be in \u2018firefighter mode\u2019 a lot of the time dealing with emergency situations (ex. dealing with a flood in a building) or short timeline projects (ex. setting up a venue for a program in 10 days). These can be very high-stress, high-workload events that can be taxing.</p><p><strong>It can be unclear what is normal treatment and what is unacceptable:&nbsp;</strong>We know of some instances where operations contractors have not been treated well. This kind of treatment is not something we as a community endorse. We encourage you to bring up issues with your manager directly if you are able to.

Especially at smaller organisations you may not have access to lots of great mentors and managers, or have the bandwidth to take time off to skill up via classes or self-learning. At some organisations, you may not have a lot of room for growth into other roles.</p><h3><strong>Some roles are temporary and contract-based</strong></h3><p>Many roles in the operations space are part-time or contract roles. If you\u2019re comfortable with these kind of roles, it can be a good way for both you and the person hiring you to get to know you better and test your fit for the role. It can also help you get future roles if you do a good job, because many employers will seek referrals from people you\u2019ve worked with in the community.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it can also be stressful. Some kinds of contract work can be very intense and full-time. This can mean that you don\u2019t have time to take on other projects, or have runway to find a new job when the project is over. It\u2019s important to think through what you will do after a project - although finding new projects is easier, it\u2019s not guaranteed. Talk to your employer about your financial needs and whether they can be met before taking on a project.&nbsp;</p><p>Other times, it may feel like the contractor role is an extended work trial - and it might seem like it\u2019s worth taking on a project with a potential employer because it could increase the chances you get a full-time job, even if the timing or situation is less than ideal (e.g. you have a full-time job already). Generally, if someone asks you to take on a project you\u2019ve already passed their bar of competency. It seems that the marginal value of taking on additional projects is lower, and may not improve your chances as much as doing the first initial project. It may seem intimidating to say no, but it\u2019s important to think about what\u2019s best for your situation.&nbsp;</p><p>In all these cases, it can help to be upfront with your manager about what the expectations are and what your needs are. If you feel you have an open line of communication it may be a flag to think about what a full-time working relationship would look like.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#bfdbd3;padding:26pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><i>\"Taking on contract work and temporary projects helped me a lot in building up skills and credibility to find and receive ops opportunities within the EA ecosystem.

A cultural fit allows the small team to better work on a daily basis and overcome challenges, as everyone is in lock-step with the organisation\u2019s direction and purpose.<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/operations-management/#ops-staff-fit-with-effective-altruism\">&nbsp;<u>EAs are more likely</u></a> to understand the organisational culture, overcome setbacks, and stick around for longer.</p><p>At larger organisations, where there are specialised roles, EA alignment is still useful, though may be less important. Orgs sometimes seek specific skills (e.g. nonprofit accounting or legal aid) that<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6tWKiSGJ8AgCEYqE2/some-scattered-thoughts-on-operations#Successful_hires_from_outside_the_community\">&nbsp;<u>may be hard to fill</u></a> from within EA. We know of a handful of operation staff at various EA organisations who did not have a lot of EA background before starting.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>8. How do I talk to people and network to find opportunities?</strong></h2><p>We think the best way to find promising opportunities is to<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9E8WCcGnLvipoSJbW/advice-i-ve-found-helpful-as-i-apply-to-ea-jobs#Meeting_People\">&nbsp;<u>talk to others</u></a>. Contract/volunteer roles are rarely advertised, and you're most likely to get one by already being on the radar of someone who needs the work done; or by happening to ask at the right time. Ask people you meet at EAG whether they need any work done you could help with.</p><p>This isn\u2019t necessarily the best situation, Sawyer Bernath makes the case that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dvcpKuajunxdaZ6se/ea-is-too-reliant-on-personal-connections\"><u>EA is too reliant on personal connections</u></a> and decreasing reliance could help support \u201cbetter ideas, increasing community health, and improving the community\u2019s reputation among outsiders.\u201d</p><p>Here are some suggestions:</p><ul><li>Attend EA conferences (advice on networking at conferences&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/conferences\"><u>here</u></a>)</li><li>You could reach out to people with ops experience publicly listed on the<a href=\"https://pineappleoperations.org/\">&nbsp;<u>Pineapple Operations database</u></a>, (You can also<a href=\"https://airtable.com/shr2uaKcpsMNx3fc6\">&nbsp;<u>list yourself</u></a> - employers running closed hiring rounds sometimes candidates listed on there)</li><li>Reach out to people on this Forum or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://eahub.org\"><u>EA Hub</u></a>, the<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/C3g5Hyxst4jwScjmi/book-a-chat-with-an-ea-professional\">&nbsp;<u>EA professionals 1-1 program</u></a> lists some ops people.</li></ul><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#bfdbd3;padding:26pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>\"While working in ops at a non-EA tech company I started working on two part-time volunteering and contracting projects in the EA space.

I found the second project by asking an organisation leader at an EA Global conference,whether they had any volunteer projects I could do. I think I gained useful knowledge and professional connections through these projects.</p><p>I think getting opportunities like this is pretty hit-and-miss: most times you ask there won\u2019t be one, but I do think they come up from time to time, and it\u2019s often worth asking if you have the time available. \"</p><p><i>- Amrit Sidhu-Brar, Operations Lead @ CLR</i></p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2><strong>9. What legal and logistical things do I need to consider?</strong></h2><p>Any time you are working, especially in a foreign country, and there is compensation involved, it\u2019s important to understand the legalities of the situation and to ensure that you can get paid (in a timely fashion). Here are three types of ways you can work for an organisation and the respective considerations:</p><ul><li><strong>Volunteering</strong> - volunteering means doing free work for an organisation. If there is any chance of compensation for your work, then ask for more information and work through the logistics&nbsp;<strong>before</strong> starting your volunteer work. Compensation can change your status to \u201cbeing employed\u201d, which then changes your tax liability and access to federal protections. Even if you are a volunteer, you may be required to sign a contract for a nondisclosure agreement or for data privacy reasons.</li><li><strong>Contracting</strong> - While a great way to gain experiences across multiple orgs, there are many classifications of independent contractors (see definition in<a href=\"https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/what-is-an-independent-contractor-usa\">&nbsp;<u>US</u></a>,<a href=\"https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/who-is-an-independent-contractor-uk\">&nbsp;<u>UK</u></a>,<a href=\"https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/belgian-independent-contractor-guidance\">&nbsp;<u>Belgium</u></a>,<a href=\"https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/types-of-independent-contractors-and-self-employment-in-germany\">&nbsp;<u>Germany</u></a>). Be careful, as<a href=\"https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/independent-contractor-guidance\">&nbsp;<u>misclassification of your employment status</u></a> can incur heavy tax penalties, impact your access to unemployment benefits, healthcare, paid time off, etc. Contracting is best for short-term or project-based arrangements. Don\u2019t forget about correctly reporting your employment status and income to comply with laws. Anti Entropy has<a href=\"https://resourceportal.antientropy.org/docs/independent-contractor-start-guide\">&nbsp;<u>a very good guide</u></a> on being an independent contractor.</li><li><strong>Employment</strong> - working directly with an organisation allows you to get access to the full benefits and legal protection from the organisation, in addition to compensation. Some organisations will allow you to continue contract work for other orgs, but that\u2019s not a given and we recommend you check with your employer about this.</li></ul><h2><strong>10.

I find this an interesting topic and I hope this will inspire others to be optimistic about improving systems. Below I have copied the original text, removed the Civil Service jargon and made a few other tweaks.</i></p><p><i>***</i><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>HOW CAN YOU IMPROVE THINGS WHEN YOU ARE A JUST ONE SMALL PART OF A MUCH BIGGER ORGANISATION?</strong></p><p>Working in policy teaches you to understand systems. But it also involves working in and being part of a system: a national government. And as you spend time in that system you may start to notice all the little cracks, all the ways it does not quite work or can lead to bad decisions being made.</p><p>I joined the UK Civil Service in 2012 and I started to notice the cracks. I noticed there was a lack of class diversity in the Treasury, with good staff from poor backgrounds being pushed out. I noticed how Overseas Development Aid funds received scrutiny and oversight when being spent by the Department for International Development (DFID) but not when being spent by other departments. Yet now, a decade later, these things are changing. The Cabinet Office has started tracking departments\u2019 class diversity statistics, and the Independent Commission for Aid Impact increased its scrutiny of non-DFID aid spending (before the DFID merger with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office). None of this because of me: some people, somewhere, were seeing the problems and fixing them.</p><p>Sure, sometimes it is two steps forward and one back. But our system gets better, in both big and small ways. We have a better functioning government and Civil Service in the 2020s than we did in the 1920s, and we will be better still in the future. It is improving because people are seeing and fixing the cracks.</p><p>And <strong>you, in your organisation, can similarly play a part in fixing the cracks.</strong></p><p>You are most likely allowed to try to fix things, more than you realise. As with any change, you may get pushback. But at some level many big bureaucracies do allow change and will champions those who genuinely try to improve things, to innovate, to make workplaces function well.</p><p>Furthermore, trying to make such changes will in many cases be good for your career. To make change you will likely be networking with very senior stakeholders, building skills and experiences and developing stories that will make you sounds great in future job interviews.</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Story: </strong>After I graduated from pharmacy school I went in to my first job as a very junior intern pharmacist at St Vincent\u2019s Hospital ... I started trying to figure out how I could improve the workflow of all of the other people that I worked with ... I figured out that pharmacists were spending 30% of their time on these kind of ad hoc drug requests which meant that that was time that they weren\u2019t spending with their patients ... So what I did was to try to link hospital admissions data to the pharmacy dispensing system so that we could predict how much we would use of various different antibiotics or other drugs at different places in the hospital at different times and make sure that those lifesaving drugs never went out of stock ... My colleagues at the hospital were all astounded at what I did and they were like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t your job, why are you doing this? Why are you putting in so much effort? Who is allowing you to do this?\u201d And the thing that I said is, \u201cYou don\u2019t need permission. You don\u2019t need to be allowed to do something that\u2019s not in your job description if you think that it\u2019s gonna make your company or your organization more successful and more efficient, you can often just go and do it.\u201d (</i><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/tara-mac-aulay-operations-mindset/\"><i><u>Source</u></i></a><i>).</i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>About this guide</strong></h2><p>This is a guide on how to improve the system from the inside. This could range from changing the rules and protocols which your organisation uses to function and make decisions, to changing the culture and ethos of your organisation and the way things work in practice.</p><p>This guide was <a href=\"https://www.impactfulgovcareers.org/post/how-to-change-a-system-from-the-inside\">originally</a> written by UK civil servants for UK civil servants with a focus on improving the UK Civil Service. This version has been adapted for this Forum, as it is possible that much of it would be applicable to other contexts, other organisations and other countries. We are confident that this represents a reasonable approach within the UK government, however those applying this guide in other contexts may want to approach these kind of actions with caution and an awareness that rocking the organisational boat may have risks to their career</p><p>It is for staff working in any area of a large organisation (not just for those few staff who happen to have organisational design in their job description). It is primarily written for staff in the junior to middle manager range (not for Directors etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>The guide is split into 6 key steps (each split into 2-5 substeps):</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4axeYmgKBhZovrvYL/how-to-change-a-system-from-the-inside#Step_1__Understand_what_needs_to_change_\">Step 1: Understand what needs to change</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4axeYmgKBhZovrvYL/how-to-change-a-system-from-the-inside#Step_2__Understand_how_the_system_is_changed\">Step 2: Understand how the system is changed</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4axeYmgKBhZovrvYL/how-to-change-a-system-from-the-inside#Step_3__Create_the_space_for_action\">Step 3: Create the space for action</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4axeYmgKBhZovrvYL/how-to-change-a-system-from-the-inside#Step_4__Fix_things_that_you_can_fix_\">Step 4: Fix things that you can fix</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4axeYmgKBhZovrvYL/how-to-change-a-system-from-the-inside#Step_5__Work_with_others___build_a_group_of_collaborators_\">Step 5: Work with others \u2013 build a group of collaborators</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4axeYmgKBhZovrvYL/how-to-change-a-system-from-the-inside#Step_6__Involve_senior_staff_\">Step 6: Involve senior staff</a></li></ul><p>Depending on what you want to change, not every step is always necessary. Nor do the steps need to be carried out in the order given. Sometimes after understanding a problem (Step 1) you can just fix a problem yourself (Step 4), and sometimes you need collaborators (Step 5) to work with you. For some changes senior staff buy-in (Step 6) is not necessary yet other times senior staff buy-in to the change is the change, and once they have agreed then the problem will be fixed.</p><p>There are of course limits to what you can and should change working from inside the system. These are discussed at the end of the guide. See:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4axeYmgKBhZovrvYL/how-to-change-a-system-from-the-inside#Limitations\">Limitations</a></li></ul><p>This guide is about improving the functioning of organisational systems, not about trying to influence an organisations outputs (e.g. not on how to change policy by working in government). Staff in big organisations can definitely have a direct positive effect on their organisations outputs (e.g. policy) though their work, and how to do this is covered (at least from a UK policy angle) in the Impactful Government Careers Network separate guides on <a href=\"https://www.impactfulgovcareers.org/post/impactful-government-careers-guide-part-2\"><u>Where to work in government</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.impactfulgovcareers.org/post/impactful-government-career-guide-part-3\"><u>How to have an impact by doing your job well in government</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Note: stories are anonymous and from a variety of sources.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Step 1: Understand what needs to change</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>Take your time. </strong>A significant chunk of time should be invested in understanding the problem. Do not try to change things immediately after beginning a new job, or starting in a new department. If you have just joined the organisation, give it 6 months. You\u2019ll need this time to understand why things are the way they are and the written and unwritten workplace rules, and to decide which problems should be fixed, and what solutions should be tried.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong><u>Understand the systems you are in</u></strong>&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>Be observant. </strong>Keep notes and records of things that are or are not working for you or other people. Talk to your colleagues, ask them about their gripes and what they would change. Think about where you can add value.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Learn relevant topics. </strong>Learn about systems thinking, organisational design, diversity and inclusion best practice, and so on. Read around these topics and try to find examples of best practices and well functioning systems that you can compare your workplace to.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Prioritise. </strong>Brainstorm ideas. You may end up with a very long list of things you wished would function better. Think about the things you want to change and prioritise between them. Make sure the thing you are working on is the highest value thing you can focus limited energy onto. Your top priorities might be the changes that you think would have the greatest impact on the civil service and society at large, but how tractable and achievable the changes are may also be relevant. (For more on this see the <a href=\"https://www.impactfulgovcareers.org/post/impactful-government-career-guide-part-3#viewer-3c4k7\"><u>section on prioritisation in our career guide</u></a>).</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Story:</strong> Every 3 months I would take a few hours out, away from my desk, and list all the things I was working on at the minute. I included both the day to day work and the corporate objective projects I had. I would then try to ignore the day to day pressures and just prioritise them by which I thought would be having the biggest impact on the world. This was helpful for me to adjust my time towards what mattered most.</i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong><u>Understand why the system is not working and why it has not been fixed.&nbsp;</u></strong></h3><p>If it looks like a system is broken, maybe it is, but maybe it is actually that way for a good reason. (See: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._K._Chesterton#Chesterton's_fence\"><u>Chesterton\u2019s fence</u></a>). Remember not everything that looks broken needs to be fixed, and not everything that needs to be fixed is for you to work on. Before trying to change something try to understand:</p><ul><li>Why the system is the way it is</li><li>The good reasons, the legitimate reasons the responsible staff have for not fixing it</li><li>The bad reasons, the misaligned incentives that may stop the responsible staff from fixing it</li><li>How it may have already been changed and why that might not have worked</li></ul><p>This will help you decide if this is something to fix as well as help you understand (and later influence) the incentives of those who might have a say in fixing it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Have evidence. </strong>If there is a problem you want to fix, make sure you have evidence that it is actually a problem, that it has some cost to the organisation, to public or to staff. Collect data and anecdotes. Also seek evidence that solutions are possible, such as examples from other departments or other countries or external think tank research. (When searching for solutions, remember that money is guarded and it is often easier to affect processes rather than funding.) And once you start changing things, track impact \u2013 collect stories of how your change helped save money or support staff and so on. Evidence will be particularly useful for persuading senior staff to engage with the problem.</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Story:</strong> When I joined the Civil Service I was interested in encouraging people to give more to effective charities. I joined an existing group focused on workplace giving. I remember being embarrassed at a meeting by suggesting that we make charitable giving opt-out for all staff, an idea that would clearly never fly. After that I kept my suggestions to myself for a few months, volunteered to help others, and worked out what practically I could change. A while later, when I volunteered to find ways to make Payroll Giving easier and to put advice on the intranet on how to give effectively, everyone agreed and encouraged me to make those changes.</i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Step 2: Understand how the system is changed</strong></h2><p><strong>Volunteer. </strong>If new to the Civil Service or a department, spend some time with the people there who are already changing things in ways seen as legitimate. There will always be such people doing volunteer corporate stuff slightly outside the standard day to day jobs. For example, you could volunteer to help with:</p><ul><li>LGBT networks, Capability Action Network, or other diversity groups</li><li>Carer\u2019s network or other support groups</li><li>Organisational changes, such as the panel of people smoothing the implementation of the new IT system, or similar.</li><li>You could also try to work in roles that involve setting up new teams or otherwise making planned organisational changes.</li></ul><p><strong>Identify precedents.</strong> Look at how change has happened in the past. Look for groups or people with unusual roles and work out how they came to be. Talk to your department\u2019s Innovation Team if there is one. Learn generally about past reform of your organisation, how change has happened, and what has worked and not worked to date.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Story: </strong>I wanted to talk to other civil servants about how to have more impact in our careers. I had been going to the Civil Service weekly Jewish \u2018lunch and learn\u2019 events and thought that they created a good network. So following that precedent I decided to set up a similar lunch and learn event for civil servants interested in </i><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/\"><i><u>Effective Altruism</u></i></a><i>.</i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Step 3: Create the space for action</strong></h2><p><strong>Make sure you are doing your day job well. </strong>Your day to day work still matters. This might be the biggest thing that will get in your way \u2013 if you cannot do your day job to a reasonable standard then your manager or someone else is likely to block you from driving other changes. Furthermore, performing badly on the day to day work will reflect poorly on you and the others who are trying to change things with you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Add the change you are working on to your objectives. </strong>Make it part of your day job. Check what precedents there are for this, maybe there is a formal 10% time for you to use how you see best, maybe it is common to add things like office recycling champion or fire warden to peoples to do lists or objectives, maybe you just think your manager is likely to support you trying to improve things. Then if you think there is a good precedent and if there is something you want to change, broach the subject with your manager and make the case that it should be added to your your objectives or your to do lists or your personal development plan, or similar.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Story: </strong>I wanted there to be better career coaching for junior civil servants. I started looking into coaching techniques, and began running career coaching sessions for people I knew, and then for others. I talked to my manager about this and explained it would be good for my career. He not only agreed to add it to my corporate objective but also said that the team training budget could be used to send me on a course on coaching skills.</i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Step 4: Fix things that you can fix</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>Start to fix things.</strong> At some point you need to start changing the things you can change. Start small if you need to: lead by example and change things in your team or area of work. You can always reach out to other staff or senior staff later to spread the change.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ask for forgiveness not permission.</strong> Before taking an action, carefully think through the consequences and risks. But if in doubt about whether you can or should do something, take action! Sometimes if you try to ask for permission you will be stuck in limbo for ages as you wait for a response from people, or they may be risk averse and tell you \u2018<i>No, let\u2019s stick with the status quo\u2019</i>. Yet no one wants to be the person to tell someone that they should not have done a good thing, after they\u2019ve done it! You have more autonomy than you realise.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Story:</strong> A civil servant wanted to make her department work better. She spent a while talking to other staff to work out what bothered them most and what could be fixed. One thing that came up is that new staff got lost or confused when trying to find other staff\u2019s desks in the broad open plan office. So she thought of a numbering system for the desks, got hold of a labelling device and went around and labelled the desks with numbers. She did not ask permission first, she just went out and corrected a problem she saw.</i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Step 5: Work with others \u2013 build a group of collaborators</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>Network.</strong> It is easier to change things or to spread your change more widely across your organisation if you have collaborators. Go to networking and social events; get to know your colleagues and make friends at work. For example find other people in the effective altruism community in your organisation or look for events which invite \"innovators\" or \"change makers\". Consider the teams and senior staff it may be good to reach or have support from across the entire organisation (not just your area) and build a broad base of connections with the junior people in those teams.&nbsp;</p><p>Network with senior staff too. For example, get to know your Director or find a senior staff member to be your mentor.&nbsp;</p><p>As you get more buy-in and build credibility, consider also writing blogs for your organisations intranet (or even for industry magazines or groups like <a href=\"https://apolitical.co/home\"><u>Apolitical</u></a>) about what you are trying to do. You can also speak at events such as team meetings or conferences, and suggest that people interested in collaborating with you should get in touch.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Build a group of collaborators.</strong> Find people you can work with who want to change and improve the same things as you, and build them into a mini-team. Invite them to take part and let their views shape what you are working on. Give people clear roles, responsibilities and actions to take, whilst recognising the time constraints that their day jobs place on them.</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Story: </strong>I wanted to run training courses for civil servants on how to make career decisions. So I did. I wrote the course, tested it, and ran it. (I did not ask permission, there was no push back, and senior civil servants seemed happy that this was happening). Then I started getting the people who turned up to re-run it in their departments, and so it spread.</i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Step 6: Involve senior staff</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>Slowly build credibility.</strong> Showcase your expertise: for example, by changing something small that everyone agrees needs to be changed before moving onto something bigger. Toot your own horn: for example, talk about what you have done at a team meeting or write on internal blogs. Use your senior allies to build credibility or amplify your message to other senior staff.</p><p><strong>Work out who to talk to.</strong> Work out what levers can be pulled to drive change and which senior staff might be interested in the change you are making. This could be people in your management chain, or people with particular responsibilities (e.g. senior executives with relevant remits) or people in other teams or even other departments who could fix the problem (analyst teams, HR leads, etc). Remember that not everyone will have time for you. Look for senior staff with a reputation for being innovative or different (if you are not sure, talk to their junior staff). In some cases you might also consider getting support from trusted credible senior stakeholders outside the organisation, such as ex-senior staff or a well respected trusted external body such as a think tank or industry body.</p><p><strong>Consider proposing a process not a solution. </strong>People often don\u2019t like being confronted with a solution \u2013 especially if it comes from someone more junior than them. They need time to get used to the idea that there is a problem, and to get used to potential solutions. Creating a process avoids asking anyone to commit to anything at the beginning and it only needs a certain amount of recognition that there might be a problem. A \u2018process\u2019 might have some or all of: a name, a group of people working on it, possibly some senior oversight, an agreed set of questions to look into, an identified recipient of the findings, a series of meetings over a period of time, possibly some consultation with internal/external experts, and a report at the end with some recommendations. The process itself has legitimacy, it gives people confidence that proposals for change are coming from some deliberation, not off the top of people\u2019s heads and when the recommendations finally come out, the fact that there has been a process makes it harder to ignore.</p><p><strong>Sell your problem and process/solution.</strong> Understand what the senior staff you are talking to want (if you are not sure, talk to their junior staff). Understand their capability, opportunity and motivation (<a href=\"https://www.qeios.com/read/WW04E6.2\"><u>COM</u></a>) for acting. Remember to appeal both to senior staff's incentives for improved systems, but also to their personal (or even misaligned) incentives, such as looking good, selling their work area, or having control over a bigger pot of resources.</p><p><strong>Be humble.</strong> Remember you do not have all the answers. You may have identified an important problem which, if fixed, could make the organisation run better. However, you still may not know all the reasons for it. It may be helpful to have some suggestions to demonstrate that solutions are possible, but trying to find <i>the</i> solution to a complex problem is almost certainly a joint effort that needs to involve others and their expertise. This likely includes seeking input from the senior staff you are engaging with.</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Story:</strong> We were running these training courses for other civil servants and wanted to make it more formal and maybe find capacity for someone to do it full time. So, we arranged to be on a panel at Civil Service Live about innovators in government. From there we met a Director who liked what we were doing. We asked and she said maybe her team could support us. She put us in touch with her Deputy Director. We pitched our ideas to her and she offered to help us.</i></p></blockquote><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Limitations</strong></h2><p>It is worth flagging some of the limitations of driving change from the inside.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>There is a limit to how much you can change things from the inside.</strong> For example in governments big changes to systems need external or political pressure. From the inside you can probably play a role in bigger changes if there happens to be public or think tank pressure or political reasons for the change to be made. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Change is slow. </strong>On rare occasions, it\u2019s possible to change things very quickly. But bigger changes can often be very slow. Say you want to be allowed to put 50% of your work hours into running a training project you set up for other civil servants. You might find you need to get sign-off from: your manager, your director, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_secretary\">Perm Sec</a>, legal, HR, comms, and so on. This could take months even if it goes smoothly; and in the meantime a change of Director could cause you to have to restart, or even scrap, the whole process.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You might fail. </strong>Finally, remember that making changes requires a lot of luck and being at the right place at the right time. You will not always succeed to change the things you want to change, and that is also OK. You will learn and maybe be a bit luckier and more skilled next time.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Story:</strong> I had this idea that we could have better Ministers if the annual Civil Service People Survey included questions about Ministers\u2019 decision making, and the answers were aggregated and provided to No.10 so that the PM could make better calls about which Ministers were doing a good job. It might just be possible for a motivated grade 7 with the right connections to drive that kind of change, but it was a bit beyond me.</i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A note on risks </strong>\u2013 We are confident that this represents an acceptable approach for driving change for staff within the UK Civil Service. However we have not investigated other contexts/countries. I would encourage cautious action, as I think there is much to be learnt \u2013 yet those applying this guide in other contexts may want to approach this carefully, it is possible that rocking the organisational boat may have risks. &nbsp;It may be reasonable to: spend longer on steps 1 and 2, to try to change smaller things first, to not associate your efforts with others who have not signed-up to be a part (e.g. avoid presenting your efforts under the \"effective altruism\" brand), etc.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Final words</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Go create the change you want to see. Trying to improve things can be good for you, your career, your organisation, and the wider world.</p><p>I would love for people to try this and see how it works. Some concrete next steps could be:</p><ul><li>Meet up. Find 2 to 3 other staff at your organisation. Agree to meet every (or every other) week.</li><li>Discuss and learn. Take a month or two on Steps 1-2. Maybe have a complaints session focusing solely on the things that are not going well, then a session on possible solutions, then on comparing and prioritising a few things to work on, etc. And if you find a thing you think should change:</li><li>Go create change. Apply Steps 3-6 and see what you can achieve. Maybe start small and move slowly, but do start seeing what you can achieve.</li><li>Give feedback. Let me know what worked and help improve this guide.</li></ul><p>You likely have more permission and more autonomy to do this than you realise. It will not always be easy but it can be done.&nbsp;</p><p>Good luck!!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>A final story:</strong> As a junior civil servant, an HEO, I noticed our policy team barely spoke to our analysts. We were introducing massive reforms without any performance indicators. I volunteered to come up with the indicators. I created a virtual team of G7 policy people and analysts and got them working together on these measures. The team created a new impact report that went up to the Investment Committee as a pilot, and then got shared around the department as good practice. Other divisions followed suit. Policy people in my division felt more comfortable with the analysts and the culture changed \u2013 they started being involved in policy from the start, coming to meetings. Eventually they joined our division, and became a fundamental part of our team and work. I can\u2019t take credit for all that, but seeing a problem and pro-actively trying to change the culture did have knock on effects.</i></p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "weeatquince"}}]
