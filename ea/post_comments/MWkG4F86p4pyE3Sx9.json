I'm not sure what kinds of metrics she has for that.</p><p>We haven't collected rigorous data on engagement, but I'm very enthusiastic about people doing that kind of thing. There have been a few studies over the years suggesting that leafletting doesn't really work (see <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/reports/leafleting/2014-march/2013-leafleting-study/\">ACE</a> and <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/impact-leaflets-controlled-study/\">Faunalytics</a>), but I suspect there are lots of potential outreach tactics that work much better than leafletting. For example, Faunalytics found that showing people factory farming footage has a <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Animal-Equality-Report-Final.pdf\">meaningful impact on behavior and attitudes around pork</a>.</p><p>I'd love to see Faunalytics or other orgs study a broader variety of outreach tactics \u2013 I think there's a risk that people see a study saying \"leafletting doesn't work\" and conclude that vegan outreach in general is a lost cause. This is something I plan to write more about later this summer.</p><p>Anecdotally, when I've done standard vegan leafletting (with a sign that says \"Why Aren't You Vegan Yet?\") less than 1% of passerby engaged at all. With the dog meat stand, it felt more like 10%, though the number could easily be higher or lower and I'd have to actually keep track to know for sure.</p><p>There's always a risk of pushing people away, but IMO this can mostly be mitigated if the organizers are nice to people in conversation.</p>", "parentCommentId": "Xt3CTfjR6kYxc5Nza", "user": {"username": "Benny Smith"}}, {"_id": "oPuDxJPne3tgaCbGf", "postedAt": "2023-07-10T16:49:54.369Z", "postId": "MWkG4F86p4pyE3Sx9", "htmlBody": "<p>Do you think any people were really turned off by this?
