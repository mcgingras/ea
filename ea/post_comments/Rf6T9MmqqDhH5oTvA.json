Indeed counterfactuals are hard. I have also joined a large EA org (Rethink Priorities) and so far agree it is useful. I think a possible failure mode for me is that I am a bit risk-averse, and also just really like working with EAs, so I'm guessing if in X months/years time I have the option to go off and start/do something by myself or with a small group I might be reluctant to leave a nice, comfortable, convenient, EA org like RP. But I agree there are lots of advantages to working at an established org, at least for a while at the start of my career.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Oscar Delaney"}}, {"_id": "zDJbBC4db3o9bteS9", "postedAt": "2024-03-20T14:05:36.203Z", "postId": "Rf6T9MmqqDhH5oTvA", "htmlBody": "<p>I enjoyed reading this post!&nbsp;</p><p>My question is on a small topic though, what is a BIRD decision making tool?
