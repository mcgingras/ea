I bookmarked this post earlier and finally found a good moment to read it :)<br><br>For EA Finland my main takeaways from the post are:<br>- We should take some time to develop/unify the branding of EA Finland further and especially our tone of voice.&nbsp;<br>- Identify more broadly which our most promising target audiences could be and organise discussions/ 1-1s with people from the reference groups to get insights to qhat kind of communication appeals to them and if they are interested in EA in the first place. Now founder effect and existing networks are impacting our community building efforts quite a lot.<br>- Create Google Analytics for altruismi.fi so we can develop our website based on more detailed data.<br>- I believe your results from the messaging strategy are interesting and we could try to emphasise the inspirational part as well in our communications. (I acknowledge you also had a section on diversifying outreach strategies between EA groups but this is quite a general approach)&nbsp;<br>- I had some initial ideas about creating an influencer-focused effective giving campaign. It was good to get some more information on how time consuming it can be and your experience updated me against its cost-effectiveness.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Karla Still"}}]
