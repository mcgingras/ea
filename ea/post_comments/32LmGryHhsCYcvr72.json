The scenario you described, where the person in question gets a 1 OOM impact bump per job switch and then also happens to end up in a role with excellent personal fit is obviously good, though I'm not sure there's any scenario discussed in the podcast that wouldn't look good if you made assumptions that generous about it.</p><blockquote><p>Alex, regarding <i>\"The next time I\u2019m looking at options is in a couple of years.\"</i> - would you endorse this sort of thing for yourself?
