At best, we could randomly sample from some narrower frame (e.g. people on main newsletter mailing list, EA Forum users), but these groups are not likely to be representative of the broader community. In the earliest surveys, we actually did also report results from a random sample drawn from the main EA Facebook group. However, these days the population of the EA Facebook group seems quite clearly not representative of the broader community, so the value of replicating this seems lower.</p><p>The more general challenge is that no-one knows what a representative sample of the EA community should look like (i.e. what is the true composition of the EA population). This is in contrast to general population samples where we can weight results relative to the composition found in the US census. I think the EA Survey itself represents the closest we have to such a source of information.</p><p>That said, I don't think we are simply completely in the dark when it comes to assessing representativeness. We can test some particular concerns about potential sources of unrepresentativeness in the sample (and have done this since the first EA Survey). For example, if one is concerned that the survey samples a disproportionate number of respondents from particular sources (e.g. LessWrong), then we can assess how the samples drawn from those sources differ and how the results for the respondents drawn from those sources differ. Last year, for example, we examined how the reported importance of 80,000 Hours differed if we excluded all respondents referred to the survey from 80,000 Hours, and still found it to be very high. We can do more complex/sophisticated robustness/sensitivity checks on request. I'd encourage people to reach out if they have an interest in particular results, to see what we can do on a case by case basis.</p>", "parentCommentId": "Ek9ZnBrvNB95dTiRB", "user": {"username": "David_Moss"}}, {"_id": "2qzHEtZPKCdfKHxKq", "postedAt": "2022-11-01T12:35:21.806Z", "postId": "SqCDoL9cHa7bnEWyb", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>WAY too many of the questions only allow checking a single box, or a limited number of boxes.

A lot of the questions are verbatim requests from other orgs, so I can't speak to exactly what the reasons for different designs are. Another commenter is also correct to mention the rationale of keeping the questions the same across years (some of these date back to 2014), even if the phrasing isn't what we would use now. There are also some other practical considerations, like wanting to compare results to surveys that other orgs have already used themselves.</p><p>That said, I'm happy to defend the claim that allowing respondents to select only a single option is <i>often</i> better than allowing people to select any number of boxes. People (i.e. research users) are often primarily interested in the _most_ important or _primary_ factors for respondents, for a given question, rather than in all factors. With a 'select all' format, one loses the information about which are the most important. Of course, ideally, one could use a format which captures information about the relative importance of each selected factor, as well as which factors are selected. For example, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Dhxg9BfBQEYvZETAD/ea-survey-2020-community-information#Effect_of_different_factors_on_likelihood_of_staying_engaged_with_EA_\">in previous surveys</a> we've asked respondents to rate the degree of importance of each factor , as well as which factors they did not have a significant interaction with. But the costs here are very high, as answering one of these questions takes longer and is more cognitively demanding than answering multiple simpler questions. So, given significant practical constraints (to keep the survey short, while including as many requests as possible), we often have to use simpler, quicker question formats.</p><p>Regarding politics specifically, I would note that asking about politics on a single scale is exceptionally common (I'd also add that single-select format for religion is very standard e.g. in the CES). I don't see this as implying a belief that individuals believe in a single \"simple political identity or political theory.\" The one wrinkle in our measure is that 'libertarian' is also included a distinct category (which dates back to requests in 2014-2015 and, as mentioned above, the considerations in favour of keeping questions consistent across years are quite strong). Ideally we could definitely split this out so we have (at least) one scale, plus a distinct question which captures libertarian alignment or more fine-grained positions. But there are innumerable other questions which we'd prioritise over getting more nuanced political alignment data.</p>", "parentCommentId": "u8Ermi57DWeJX3Kkg", "user": {"username": "David_Moss"}}, {"_id": "qnFSBJEnGTEhebJQk", "postedAt": "2022-11-01T12:46:34.516Z", "postId": "SqCDoL9cHa7bnEWyb", "htmlBody": "<p>How far and wide should people (and especially community builders) spread this and encourage others to fill it in?
