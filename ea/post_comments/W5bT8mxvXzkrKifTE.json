The board is elected by the members with a given mandate, and the board are ultimately accountable to the members.

I don't share your intuition that starting the first EA group in a region makes you the founder of the EA movement in that region. For example, I started the first LW group in the Spanish-speaking world but it would be bizarre to call me the \"founder of the Spanish-speaking rationalist movement\". &nbsp;Expressions that seem more appropriate to me to convey what I take \"founder\" to be trying to communicate are \"a key figure in the Norwegian EA movement\" and \"an early figure in the Norwegian EA movement\".
