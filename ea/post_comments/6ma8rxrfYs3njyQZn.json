A few years ago I took some time with a med student thinking through some options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Reduce pelvic inflammatory disease. This causes uterine scarring, which leads to implantation failure, and the main causes are STIs like gonorrhea and chlamydia. Cervical cancer is also an issue, and we do have the HPV vaccine for this. These are already bad things we'd like to prevent, but this raises the stakes a lot.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Decrease the C-section rate. Abdominal surgery is another thing that gives uterine scarring. The US C-section rate is much higher than the rest of the world, for reasons that seem to be more about how we allocate medical providers and less about people's health, and there are already good options here like providing doulas for <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/doulas-would-save-insurers-money\">anyone who wants one</a>. C-sections are worse than other abdominal surgeries from this perspective because the embryo can implant into the surgical scar, which gives you an ectopic pregnancy and generally requires an abortion to save the life of the mother. Appendectomies might be another good candidate here, because outside the US people have way fewer of them. Though some of that is that different health systems respond differently to appendicitis: it recurs about 20% of the time, so different places have made different calls about whether removing it the first time it happens is worth it.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Come up with better detection methods for fibroids. These are benign tumors in the uterus that grow with estrogen, and compete with the fetus for space. This is more of a problem later in the pregnancy when space is tighter. This one might make sense if you don't think embryos matter but do think second or third trimester fetuses matter. This also disproportionately affects black mothers, so it may be underfunded.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Encourage people to switch to methods of birth control that prevent ovulation or fertilization instead of implantation. For example, estrogen over progesterone. This one is the odd one out, in that it's one where you're not just more highly prioritizing something people already think would be good. IUDs, for example, are really good in many ways, but they work by preventing implantation. This is at least less tractable socially than the others, because you'd get a huge fight.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jeff_Kaufman"}}, {"_id": "pjH5sZcGtvWK2kXKp", "postedAt": "2022-12-20T14:00:25.898Z", "postId": "6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Jeff, thanks for your comment!</p><p>The first three medical interventions you pointed out would have been excellent for me to include in this post's Community Actions section, as the possible moral patienthood of embryos would indeed update their significance.

I sketch out the generalization in the \"Increasing the Amount of Near-Term Future People\" section, but it's probably not sufficiently explicit.

It seems to me that he generally holds these views, but includes a factor to strongly discount the value of adding a future person versus saving a life now. This enables him to believe abortion is morally OK (since his discount factor applies), but longtermism is still an imperative (since heavily discounting 10^whatever possible future people still means they're extremely important in aggregate).</p><blockquote><p>Otherwise, interventions that increased how many babies people wanted to have would be roughly interchangeable with interventions that decrease abortions.</p></blockquote><p>Under non-person-affecting/deprivationist views, I would argue that that's correct.</p>", "parentCommentId": "dEmQ5ibjudaFh9PGv", "user": {"username": "Ariel Simnegar"}}, {"_id": "PDCgcmFJ3jWKG6YFp", "postedAt": "2022-12-20T15:34:02.118Z", "postId": "6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Under non-person-affecting/deprivationist views, I would argue that that's correct.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you think that's correct, then my (very rough) guess is that promoting having children gives more future lives for the amount of time/resources than voluntary abortion reduction.

The magnitude of the difference between adding a future person and saving a living person is <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/killing-vs-failing-to-create\">debated</a>, but it seems that many prominent EAs consider it to be close to as good as saving a living person today. <i>What we Owe the Future</i>'s \"Is it Good to Make Happy People?\" (Chapter 8) does a great job of making that case, though <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vZ4kB8gpvkfHLfz8d/critique-of-macaskill-s-is-it-good-to-make-happy-people\">some disagree</a>.</p><p>For an example of where this consideration could be relevant, consider <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zgBmSgyWECJcbhmpc/family-planning-a-significant-opportunity-for-impact\">this statement</a> from Family Empowerment Media (FEM)'s founders:</p><blockquote><p>A commitment of $7 million would fund FEM\u2019s scaling plans over the next four years, preventing \u223c3100 maternal deaths and \u223c340,000 unintended pregnancies.</p></blockquote><p>Let's assume 10% of those unintended pregnancies would have been carried to term and not counterfactually replaced (to avoid child replaceability <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn/a-case-for-voluntary-abortion-reduction#Child_Replaceability_Shouldn_t_Preclude_Intervention\">concerns</a>). In that case, this intervention would prevent 34,000 lives from being lived, far more than the 3100 maternal lives saved. If we're sympathetic to the above arguments (as many longtermists are), then this well-meaning intervention could arguably be doing much more harm than good.</p><p>It's critical to note that supporting women's autonomy, maternal health, and economic outcomes is a deeply important cause, and CE's family planning charities absolutely contribute to those good outcomes. However, it seems to me that the</p><blockquote><p>case for not donating to such charities out of moral uncertainty reasons</p></blockquote><p>you pointed to could be quite strong, and that there are many other interventions which support <a href=\"https://fistulafoundation.org/\">women's empowerment</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/best-charities/global-alliance-for-improved-nutrition/\">maternal health</a> without this possible serious negative externality.</p><p>I'd also like to note that I'm <i>not</i> saying EAs should never donate to FEM or its related charities. <strong>I only believe that the moral considerations are serious enough that we should temporarily suspend our support for these charities until we've systematically reviewed the effect of these considerations</strong>.</p><p>It could be that a systematic review uses randomized controlled trials to verify that FEM's interventions don't reduce the expected amount of future people at all and only space out births. The review could also show that replaceability should be accorded much higher credence than <a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/utilitarianism-wins-outright-part-67f\">many actually accord it</a>, and argue that even with these moral considerations, the absolute effect of FEM's interventions is good.

I do bring this measure up in a footnote, but you're right that it could have warranted a more thorough treatment in the post. TRIA best matches our intuition that the fetus's moral significance increases through the pregnancy, and through moral uncertainty, I would justify the same intuition. However, I personally find the deprivationist approach of purely measuring the disvalue of death through the amount of (adjusted) life years prevented to be more intuitive.</p>", "parentCommentId": "QGmSQKNCcYR6Q6Qex", "user": {"username": "Ariel Simnegar"}}, {"_id": "Gy5Et5sJNCRMAByqT", "postedAt": "2022-12-20T17:39:49.249Z", "postId": "6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn", "htmlBody": "<p>The cognitive and experiential capacities of an organism are important for us in determining how they treat them. So any consideration about fetuses as moral patients needs to consider their capacities. 38-week old fetuses have a very different set of cognitive and experiential capacities compared to 24-week old fetuses, and even more so to 14-week old fetuses. Because <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm\">90% of abortions in the US occur prior to 14 weeks</a>, and 99% before 22 weeks, the relevant questions about capacity are probably about experience in that time. At least prior to 12 weeks it seems unlikely fetuses could consciously experience pain, and unlikely they experience anything at all <i>(EDIT: I've updated against this somewhat--see Callum's comment below)</i>. As a result, and considering negative consequences for women's autonomy in cutting abortion funding, I caution against recommendations that involve cutting any funding for abortion prior to that time.</p><p>I worry that some folks will get a little bit queasy about me launching into comparisons with animal suffering, but I think that is unavoidable, and ultimately justifiable. But when we try to determine how we should <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw/p/tnSg6o7crcHFLc395\">treat pigs, chickens, and shrimp</a>, we look to their capacity to suffer, and their overall capacity to experience things. This is important because if we want to know whether it is net positive to farm animals, we need to know if farming them is net positive, i.e., if the positive experiences they have and we have as a result of farming them outweigh the suffering they experience, compared to the counterfactual of having not existed. If a particular animal doesn't have any capacity for suffering or any kind of conscious experience, arguably they are, as an individual creature, no more a moral patient than a rock or stone. That raises the question: do fetuses have the capacity to consciously suffer or experience, and if so what sort of experience do they have?</p><p>Conscious experience is not the only consideration one would have when considering a fetus as a moral patient. There are other reasons that have been explored in more general abortion debates over the last few decades about various social factors that lead us to assign fetuses more or less personhood, which I acknowledge. But in this comment I'll focus on the issue of conscious experience.</p><p>The conventional medical advice has been that \"<a href=\"https://the cortex and intact thalamocortical tracts are necessary for pain experience\">the cortex and intact thalamocortical tracts are necessary for pain experience</a>\", and because these don't develop until after 24 weeks of pregnancy, we can rule out any kind of fetal pain until that point. This is a based on a theory of human conscious pain that posits that something about the neocortex is what gives humans many or even all of our conscious experiences. Whether this is true is not clearly known but it would seem to follow from <a href=\"https://library.oapen.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.12657/47279/9783030541736.pdf?sequence=1#page=48\">leading theories of human consciousness</a>. The evidence that experience of pain in particular arises from the neocortex--let's call it the \"thalamo-cortical pain theory\" is somewhat stronger. The neocortex contains the somatosensory cortices; it also contains the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex, which at least until recently have been <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109038010400148X\">inseparable</a> from the conscious experience of pain in normal humans. Because those features don't develop until some time after 24 weeks, it seems plausible fetuses don't have conscious experience of pain until after that time.</p><p>On the other hand, there's <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw/p/tnSg6o7crcHFLc395\">mounting evidence</a> that animals without these advanced cognitive structures also have some experience of pain. I am sceptical this implies <i>humans</i> have experiences of conscious pain before they develop a neocortex, because those animals could have evolved other features giving them the experience of pain that humans do not have.&nbsp;</p><p>What's more important is the thalamo-cortical pain theory I described in the previous paragraph is under question, specifically with respect to fetuses, raising the possibility that <a href=\"https://jme.bmj.com/content/46/1/3?fbclid=IwAR0gdShqtwr8dnRMfm1XqKLsoUn7BI05Pi8hYeyyhEFfTlZWMji4RtJL-Wg\">fetuses before 24 weeks</a> could feel some sort of conscious pain, though it would almost certainly not reach the full expression and intensity that fully-formed humans can experience. This is based on evidence in adult human patients, including patients with disabled cortices and patients who were born insensitive to pain. On this theory of fetal pain would place development at <a href=\"https://jme.bmj.com/content/46/1/3?fbclid=IwAR0gdShqtwr8dnRMfm1XqKLsoUn7BI05Pi8hYeyyhEFfTlZWMji4RtJL-Wg\">closer to 12 weeks</a>. This is based on the fact the \"<a href=\"https://jme.bmj.com/content/46/1/3?fbclid=IwAR0gdShqtwr8dnRMfm1XqKLsoUn7BI05Pi8hYeyyhEFfTlZWMji4RtJL-Wg\">first projections from the thalamus into the cortical subplate</a>\" occur around that time. [<i>This paragraph edited slightly to update in favor of the 12-week theory]</i></p><p>Overall I am somewhat convinced by the recent work that pain processing doesn't require the neocortex<s>, but less sure that </s><i><s>conscious experience of pain</s></i><s> can be had without it</s>. However, at least in the United States, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm\">over 90% of abortions occured before 13 weeks</a>. Less than 1% occur after 21 weeks. Prior to 13 weeks, there doesn't seem to be a viable theory of conscious experience of fetal pain. I should acknowledge that in this context, we're not only concerned about pain--we're concerned about personhood more broadly. But one can infer, from the debate about pain, it seems unlikely that there are conscious experiences <i>in general</i> at the very least prior to 12 weeks. Consequently, any concern about the moral patienthood of fetuses at the time when most are aborted (spontaneously or otherwise) should be &nbsp;order of magnitude or two less than concern we might have about a fetus at that 38-week period which Peter Singer points out seems to be minimally distinguishable from an infant child.</p><p>Finally--I can't help but spell out some of my own motivation for this comment. Although it is very clear that it advocates only for voluntary abortion reduction, the original post does recommend defunding of abortion services for which funding may have previously been provided. I have less of a unique contribution to make in this area, than in the neuroscience, so I won't say too much about it. But it does seem to me that even defunding services could have tangible negative consequences for pregnant women's autonomy and control over their pregnancy. That probably motivates my caution against such a recommendation, and it needs to be considered alongside the discussion about fetal personhood, and within that discussion, fetal consciousness, which is the primary topic of this post.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "ben.smith"}}, {"_id": "QrBjc32Da3v6BA3KG", "postedAt": "2022-12-20T17:47:22.169Z", "postId": "6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for writing this.

We know that most women seeking abortion do want another child in the future, and we know the broad reasons women cite for having abortions. But we have almost no research about what it would concretely take for them to choose otherwise (as an illustration of the point, we know that a large minority - in some countries a majority - of women cite financial concerns. But a) most of those women cite multiple reasons, so helping financially may not help that much; and b) there is some evidence that many such women do not want to know what financial support might be available). So that seems like a fruitful area for future primary research by EAs. Part of the problem is that the relevant population can usually only be accessed by abortion providers, who are less inclined to do this research.</p><p>I myself would go further and support involuntary abortion reduction (for reasons briefly explained here: <a href=\"https://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2022/11/15/jme-2022-108572\">https://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2022/11/15/jme-2022-108572</a><a href=\"https://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2022/11/15/jme-2022-108572).\"> ).</a> But of course voluntary abortion reduction is even better to the extent that it can be achieved.

With some exceptions, little variation existed in the reasons given by women's sociodemographic characteristics.</p></blockquote><p>So with abortion reduction, the pregnant women you're targeting are:</p><ul><li>Already facing the cost of carrying a pregnancy they don't want to term</li><li>Don't want the baby</li><li>Won't realize any substantial benefit from having the baby</li><li>Are probably in a pretty fraught position in their lives in many cases</li></ul><p>And you are trying to somehow convince them to carry that baby to term voluntarily so that someone else can enjoy the benefit. That sounds intractable. On top of that, we have to point out that this is an enormously politically charged issue. Those who are against abortion already have massive resources aimed at abortion reduction. Among pro-choice people, arguing for the moral urgency of reducing abortions is going to create a lot of political friction. I think that's something we have to take into account from a sheer, practical tractability standpoint.&nbsp;</p><p>With 73 million abortions, only about <a href=\"http://archive.boston.com/news/world/articles/2007/07/08/child_adoptions_worldwide/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20annual%20number%20of%20child%20adoptions%20worldwide%3F&amp;text=40%2C000-,B.,undertaken%20within%20the%20same%20country.\">250,000 children</a> are adopted annually worldwide, even though <a href=\"https://adoption.org/international-adoption-statistics-know\">globally, 10 million children live in institutions, and 60 million on the streets.</a> There are about 2 million people waiting to adopt in the USA. I'm not sure how many people want to adopt globally, but my guess is that overall, there's only enough potential adoptive parents to provide homes for a small fraction of the children who'd be born if more parents chose adoption rather than abortion. What fraction of voluntary abortion reduction resulting in the child being raised in an institution or on the street would we consider an acceptable outcome?</p><p>I'd be tentatively more comfortable with measures taken to facilitate increasing the number of wanted pregnancies, including legalizing paid surrogacy services and subsidizing childcare and adoption of older children. Bans on paid surrogacy are connected to a broader, and in my opinion, deeply unethical and massively impactful ban on the voluntary sale, or in this case rental, of one's own organs.</p><p>I've focused on this topic more in the context of kidney sales. There, the public is generally quite supportive of a government-paid option for kidney sales, and most healthcare providers support a trial of a compensation mechanism. You'd never know it from media coverage, though, because a small group of sophisticated political and religious operatives have managed to create a false impression of an ethical consensus against kidney sales. I would not be surprised if legalizing paid surrogacy has even higher levels of public support.

It seems that your moral opinion on abortion stems from a belief that a person must already be conscious/able to suffer in order to be a moral patient--i.e. a person-affecting view. In that regard, you posit that the time at which a fetus's capacity to experience pain begins is a critical juncture. However, many EAs hold relatively non-person-affecting views, which often compels them to act in the interests of people who will live in the far future, and have no hope of experiencing pain right now.

Furthermore, unlike many other charitable donors, anti-abortion activists really <i>are</i> primarily concerned with decreasing the number of abortions - and they're willing to embrace all methods for doing so, including politics and even terrorism. \"Voluntary abortion reduction,\" honestly, sounds like one of the <i>least</i> effective means for achieving the aim of reducing abortions, although I could certainly be persuaded that I'm wrong on that point with data.</p><blockquote><p>However, it seems like improving this system's efficiency (would-be adopters in the US probably shouldn't have to <a href=\"https://adoptionnetwork.com/types-of-adoption-options/domestic-vs-international-adoption/\">wait as long or pay as much</a> as they do to adopt) and improving the culture around adoption would be a good idea even if it would be unrealistic for the infrastructure to ultimately scale enough to efficiently handle every child in need.</p></blockquote><p>I want to point out that in the short run, we should actually have would-be adopters pay more and wait longer, because right now, the waiting list is enormous, and it never makes sense to address a shortage by subsidizing demand. It would probably be best if the money they pay went to the women who are having the children, even if by an indirect mechanism.&nbsp;</p><p>In the long run, if you did manage to eliminate the waiting list by increasing the production of children for adoption then yes, you would eventually run into the opposite need, to subsidize childrearing. But that cuts against your abortion-reduction cause.</p><p>Effectively, my model from a population-growth standpoint is this:</p><ol><li>We have an acute child-supply shortage due mainly to paid surrogacy bans. There is no real difference between paying a woman to be a surrogate and paying a woman to carry an otherwise unwanted pregnancy to term in order to allow the child to be adopted. Both should be legal. And it's likely to be hard to increase people's willingness to <i>donate</i> this service, as we see in other cases of banned compensation for organ exchange, such as in the case of kidney donation. In combination with extracorporeal pregnancy technologies, I expect this would largely address the supply shortage.</li><li>Once the acute supply shortage is addressed by creating a \"pregnancy profession,\" you are faced with the problem of increasing the desire to rear children.</li></ol><p>It's not at all clear to me how supply and demand would scale with various subsidy measures and technological improvements, but one thing I am pretty confident about is that, on its face and by empirical analogy with the case of kidney donation, <i>voluntary</i> abortion reduction sounds like about the least tractable approach for achieving the aim of scaling up the supply of children available to be adopted. But that's a strictly epistemic disagreement, and if hard data, or a convincing mechanism, were available, I'd absolutely change my mind on this point.</p><p>Edit:&nbsp;</p><p>One further point is that if you\u2019re trying to convince people to carry pregnancies they don\u2019t want out of an altruistic spirit, then a natural next move is to encourage women in EA to have babies in order to give them up for adoption (if they don\u2019t want to raise the babies themselves). We find it charming when EAs donate kidneys to strangers, and this seems no different - indeed, a donated kidney will not generate nearly as many QALYs as a newborn baby. I find myself uncomfortable even articulating this idea, but it does seem consistent with your proposal, and more tractable than trying to convince people not to terminate pregnancies they don\u2019t want when they\u2019re not ideologically subscribed to EA-style altruism.

Sorry I was heading out earlier so didn't have time to elaborate as much as I would have liked. When I say unmet need for contraception (UMC) is low, I meant proportionally - by 2010 it was just over 10%, and I would guess is significantly lower still now. Of course, 10% globally is still a lot of people, but these are presumably the hardest people to reach and it is not clear how cost-effective doing so would be - moreover, it seems clear that even if we did manage to reach those 10%, the abortion rate would hardly decline by that much - so it is a pretty limited strategy for reducing abortions, if it is effective at all.<br><br>Regarding the second paper, table 5 indicates that only 8% of women with UMC globally lacked access (including because of cost). Table 3 in the third paper shows similar. So it still seems that only a very small proportion of women globally - perhaps 1% in 2010 - have a UMC because of lack of access to contraception.</p><p>There probably are interventions which could increase contraceptive uptake - but I don't think they are by any means simple, and they are not generally solving lack of access per se. The access is there, even if the relevant education or empowerment of women is not. As indicated in the rest of my previous post, even if this were solved, it is still not clear to me that it would reduce abortions, given the counterbalancing effects contraception promotion has on sexual behaviour and desired family size. It seems particularly doubtful that it would reduce abortions by a large amount.</p><p>You are right that as education increases, desired family size generally falls, and contraception demand will grow. But I don't see that there is a significant risk of contraception supply failing anytime soon. Even under the Mexico City Policy, which was widely held to significantly impede access to contraception, contraceptive use in the affected countries (turquoise - unaffected countries in orange) rapidly increased: <img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/20de95f3136235595175654616c744dfe69966f724ae67a9.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/20de95f3136235595175654616c744dfe69966f724ae67a9.png/w_141 141w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/20de95f3136235595175654616c744dfe69966f724ae67a9.png/w_221 221w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/20de95f3136235595175654616c744dfe69966f724ae67a9.png/w_301 301w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/20de95f3136235595175654616c744dfe69966f724ae67a9.png/w_381 381w\"></p><p>This, I suppose, is relevant to the EA discourse on neglectedness - with the emphasis on contraception in international development circles, it seems unlikely that slightly trimmed down support for it is going to significantly impede it or significantly increase abortion rates.

When a doctor conscientiously objects to providing a service (i.e. refuse to provide a service that is against their personal values), there's a clear case to be made that it is the doctor's professional obligation to let the patients know what options they have available and how they can access this care from other doctors who can provide this service, such that their personal values do not not meaningfully impact their patients' health outcomes and access to treatment. And if there are no other options available, and conscientious objection will compromise healthcare delivery then this may be unacceptable.</p><p>I agree that a charity / EA funding may not be held to the same standard as a medical doctor in terms of moral obligations, but the same thought process is relevant in terms of taking into account how much harm you may be contributing to in expectation.

I used to go on Reddit often, and as you can imagine from our interactions, I was prone to getting heavily downvoted :P To avoid motivated/emotion-driven \"reasoning\", I made a personal rule to never downvote anyone on Reddit for any reason. I'm off Reddit now, but I've always maintained the rule that I never downvote respectful discourse. I think engagement is better than a disagree-vote, and strive to avoid the latter in favor of the former.</p><p>To close (as frankly, there's only so much brainpower I'm willing to extend on this semantic consideration), I maintain that the interventions I suggest would be the right thing to do. However, there's a sensible case that there are reasonable definitions of \"voluntary\" which readers understandably presuppose when reading the post for which the interventions <i>don't </i>qualify. Though I maintain that there are senses in which they <i>do </i>qualify, I think you've made an excellent case that there's substantial ambiguity there which can blindside readers. I'd appreciate if you read my <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn/a-case-for-voluntary-abortion-reduction?commentId=RkWQ3H5ttjuKJenYk#Y8dwEcSSxHjpXZj2E\">reply </a>to Julia Wise's similar concern (which helps to spell my actual intention behind the post), and let me know what you think would be the best way to disambiguate while staying true to the post's scope.</p>", "parentCommentId": "iQyyBo4JKhaDoGyon", "user": {"username": "Ariel Simnegar"}}, {"_id": "FAGCojKzrTCs8fEnE", "postedAt": "2022-12-21T17:57:02.274Z", "postId": "6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn", "htmlBody": "<p>I do take a non-person-affecting view, but with a sort of deontological barrier around doing things that could cause substantial harm to a large number of currently-existing people, particularly in areas I regard as \"human rights\". This is not the only area I'd endorse this sort of deontological barrier. I also endorse one against committing dishonesty or fraud in the name of things that might harm the long term future, and recent events have strengthened my view on that.</p><p>There are a couple of justifications for this. First, we should have a certain amount of epistemic humility, where at some point it's just really hard to understand what effects of current acts on the long term future will be, and we better be <i>really sure</i> if we cause present harm for the sake of far-future good. I have a certain amount of loss aversion when it comes to working out what sort of acts I should do. Second, we might want certain values to be sustained into the long term future, like honesty and respect for human rights, because sustaining those values will be good for future society. That might be a reason that doing things in the name of honesty or human rights that might, on the balance, have negative direct effects for the long-term future, could actually end up having long-term positive effects.</p><p>On this particular issue, I'm at least moderately pro-natalist. I think the vast majority of possible good we can do in the present to improve the long term future is just to avoid existential risk, so I don't hugely emphasize pro-natalism. One reason is it's not clear whether a larger population now will lead to a large population in 200 years, since future generations might compensate for higher fertility now with less fertility in their time, as long as there are resource constraints given current technologies. But on balance I do support pro-natalism, not just because of the long term future, but also because more <i>present</i> people enjoying the <i>present</i> is good. Having said that, I think the restriction on womens' autonomy is a high cost to pay, and we might be able to get equivalent boosts in fertility through other policies, like <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/9/10/20835327/voting-age-youth-rights-kids-vote\">letting children vote</a>, providing much more financial support for parents at low incomes, and more favorable tax treatment for parents at all income levels, by, for instance, allowing not just spouses to file jointly but allowing parents to also file jointly with their children.</p><p>I worry I wasn't actually fair enough to the \"12 week fetal pain\" theory--the more I think about the paper I read yesterday, the more I actually prefer it, all things considered, to its alternative, and I'll update my post on that basis.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "uFh7C2wgrRdKCe8n6", "user": {"username": "ben.smith"}}, {"_id": "jS29gTKLYayEDgGJn", "postedAt": "2022-12-21T17:58:56.125Z", "postId": "6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you!

I'll confess on being quite ignorant on the subject. Jeff Kaufman gave a great <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn/a-case-for-voluntary-abortion-reduction?commentId=vGb4xMpCWtCW2iqSu\">laundry list</a> of interventions in that regard, and I think analyzing their effectiveness is worth taking a poke at.</p><blockquote><p>perhaps there's a way to rephrase and clarify the disclaimer to account for this; e g., you're less concerned about abortion as a cause area and more about a moral constraint regarding projects - i.e., just like we shouldn't fund projects leading to work abuse, we shouldn't fund projects leading to abortion</p></blockquote><p>This is a very fair point. There's been a bunch of very understandable discussion of how I shoehorn certain interventions to fit a very tight mold - \"voluntary abortion reduction\" - when there are either broader/less divisive lessons to take from this, and/or the lesson isn't even wide enough. In retrospect, there was much I could have arranged/emphasized differently in this post. My <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn/a-case-for-voluntary-abortion-reduction?commentId=RkWQ3H5ttjuKJenYk#Y8dwEcSSxHjpXZj2E\">reply </a>to Julia's similar concern here is the best clarification I've been able to give on what I was actually trying to say.</p><blockquote><p>is there a particular moral difference between preventing a (statistically predictable) spontaneous abortion and preventing an intentional one, per se?</p></blockquote><p>If in both cases, the outcome is one more child being born and living a happy life than otherwise, then I don't see a moral difference.</p><blockquote><p>there's another Scourge unmet by the appendix: discarded frozen embryos</p></blockquote><p>There it is! I actually think this is a pretty compelling pro-embryo-abortion objection in the deontological case. However, in my personal opinion, abortion is morally wrong specifically because it prevents a child from being born and living a happy life. If we had some process through which we could thaw out frozen embryos, place them in artificial wombs, and give them happy lives, then I would agree that destroying a frozen embryo when the counterfactual is putting them through this process and having one more happy person would be morally wrong. However, we seem to be well off from doing that. To needlessly speculate, I think it's much more likely aligned AGI teaches us to simulate arbitrarily happy people before we ever get to that point. In that case, I would even argue that diverting computational power from the AGI such that it loses the ability to simulate one person would be morally wrong the same way. I basically see all of these cases as just other ways to add (or not add) one more happy person.</p>", "parentCommentId": "XsarSqBbgWzhtiKNr", "user": {"username": "Ariel Simnegar"}}, {"_id": "jRi4bCffNYyy9AB2H", "postedAt": "2022-12-21T18:16:57.585Z", "postId": "6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn", "htmlBody": "<p>I replied to Ramiro <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn/a-case-for-voluntary-abortion-reduction?commentId=A4dgqKwjT7EdSCGe8\">here </a>if you'd like to read the elaboration, but my answer is no :)</p>", "parentCommentId": "g4m85iExCL3AzAJMR", "user": {"username": "Ariel Simnegar"}}, {"_id": "t7QqFCefyr5mxJYbg", "postedAt": "2022-12-21T18:34:09.956Z", "postId": "6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn", "htmlBody": "<p>(Edited to add: I'm speaking only in a personal capacity here, and not on behalf of my employer.)</p><p>If you try to account broadly for indirect effects and externalities, it's not clear you've arrived at the right stance on abortion and population reduction. There are many effects to consider:</p><ol><li>Withdrawing support for (or actively opposing) abortion and the reasoning here to do so could have impacts on norms/values around exploitation and treating others like mere means (or allowing them to be treated like mere means), like Richard suggests, so (EDIT) to make explicit, have other negative effects for women and girls (or others) in the near term. Norms more permissive of exploitation and treating others like mere means may make us more prone to conflict and less cooperative in general, and so more prone to catastrophic conflicts and missing opportunities for positive sum trades. Values in general via value lock-in and such effects on conflict and cooperation in particular could even have far-future effects.</li><li>Abortion and population reduction (for humans) could go either way for nonhuman animals. I'd guess they're good for farmed animals by reducing animal farming and because I think farmed animals mostly have bad lives (even on symmetric ethical views, although my views are suffering-focused), and the sign for wild animals (whose populations would plausibly increase) will depend on your expectations about their average welfare. I'd guess this would be limited to impacts on Earth, but humans might colonize space themselves and bring nonhuman animals with them, and more humans colonizing space could mean more nonhuman animals brought with them.</li><li>Abortion and population reduction could mitigate climate change, which may have near-term effects on humans and nonhuman animals, as well as far-future effects.</li><li>Moral circle expansion towards fetuses could transfer to MCE for other (far future) minds with limited cognitive capacities or agency, or otherwise in situations similar to fetuses.</li><li>Economic and technological effects from increased population or reducing costs on children (in time or money), which could possibly even compound into the far future.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few broad practical responses to all of this that I can think of:</p><ol><li>Try harder to quantify and compare these effects (EDIT: in some cases, rough bounds can be useful enough), and try to ensure you're capturing a relatively unbiased subset of indirect effects, and especially the largest ones.

However, I don't think the reduction of abortion is a useful or productive framing for these kinds of policies or interventions.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Goals obviously shape policies and interventions. If the goal of a policy is to reduce abortion rather than raise the quality of life for pregnant people, families and their children regardless of potentially averted abortions, this creates perverse incentives to form policies that are only focused on the pre-natal or immediately post-natal portions of the life cycle. This post outlines some suggestions for more encompassing policies, like daycare or family tax credits, but I believe that these policies should not be closely tied to a goal of reducing abortion in order to avoid these perverse incentives and distortion down the line, and that abortion reduction should at best be seen as a tertiary goal or byproduct.&nbsp;</li></ul><blockquote><p>Instead of spotlighting family planning, we should shift our family-focused interventions to spotlight mothers' physical and mental health, and support adoption as an option.</p></blockquote><ul><li>I whole heartedly believe that supporting and facilitating adoption is an important and very valuable goal, but I don't think it acts as a replacement to family planning. Family planning and access to abortion and conctraceptives are interventions that serve a different purpose than adoption services. Ideally, they allow families and individuals to make informed and well considered choices about their future and goals, which can and should be include access to abortion and conctraceptives if one does not want to be pregnant or carry a child to term. Even if adoption is easy and unstigmatized, being pregnant and giving birth can cause long-term (and sometimes catastrophic) physical and mental health effects and significant disruptions to the career of pregnant people, even in developed nations with excellent health care and social security systems in place. Being able to avoid this is an important mechanism for empowering people, including in being the best parents they can be when they choose to have children, and this should not be minimized or written off.&nbsp;</li></ul><blockquote><p>we should suspend our support for charities which decrease the amount of near-term future people, until we can systematically review the effect of the above moral considerations on the morality of the charities' interventions</p></blockquote><ul><li>The extension of longtermist thinking to abortion in this way is one reason I've never felt comfortable with longtermism as a prevalent moral framework without a strong countervailing focus on the rights of already existing people. Interventions offering access to abortion and family planning play an important role in ensuring the <i>right </i>to bodily autonomy and self-determination, particularly in places where these services are not offered otherwise. While you can argue that people should be choosing to not exercise their right, arguing for the suspension of support for charities that offer these services comes off to me as implicitly arguing for a decrease in access to the tools that allow for the realization of these rights. While I'm not arguing that EAs or charities should be tasked with undergirding rights, I do think that this is an important thing to consider. I personally think that the natural conclusion to this line of argument in the abstract is that longtermists should be anti-abortion, which is something that blurs the line between reduction of \"voluntary\" abortion and abortion altogether, but I realize that there are different ways to interpret it and don't at all mean to say this is what you're arguing for.&nbsp;</li><li>This consideration is also important for the discussion around personal autonomy. The post argues:</li></ul><blockquote><p>The consequentialists among us would say that it would be morally wrong for us to&nbsp;<i>not</i> help our fellow people in poverty, even if helping them reduces our personal autonomy by preventing us from enjoying some of the amenities of the wealthy countries we typically reside in.</p></blockquote><ul><li>I don't understand this conceptualization of personal autonomy. Choosing to donate your income instead of spending it is an exercise of personal autonomy, not a diminishment of it. In the same way, choosing to have a child or to have an abortion is an exercise of personal autonomy. Both interventions that increase people's access to abortion and contraceptives and their access to infrastructure and resources that allow for them to carry pregnancies to term and then raise or put children up for adoption <i>increase </i>and allow for the exercise of personal autonomy. The point at which personal autonomy becomes an important consideration is when access to resources that allow for either choice is cut off, either by defunding these services or making them illegal or harder to access. Concerns about personal autonomy should not (and do not) &nbsp;preclude interventions providing support to people who need resources to have a safe, healthy and happy pregnancy and recovery, but they do preclude interventions that would make access to contraceptives or abortions harder.&nbsp;</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "tugbazsen"}}, {"_id": "BTsPAL3HcCFDTDxF8", "postedAt": "2022-12-22T05:26:15.482Z", "postId": "6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn", "htmlBody": "<p>Brief comments here, on request of the OP.

The impression I received from the feedback was that in publishing this post, I would be like a hardcore vegan entering a KFC with a megaphone.</p><p>There's a Venn diagram of policies regarding animal suffering endorsed by hardcore vegans versus by KFC patrons. The shared part of the Venn diagram includes policies like convincing people to voluntarily go vegan, and on the edge of the shared part, there might be the proposal of suspending subsidies for KFC because there's a chance that animal suffering actually matters. The hardcore vegan tries to identify some aspect of the shared part of the Venn diagram to restrict their speech and the ensuing conversation's scope to, so that the KFC patrons will actually take seriously and engage with what they have to say. They settle on \"voluntary animal suffering reduction,\" and make that the headline of their speech.</p><p>Then patrons point out that suspending subsidies for KFC could cause some KFCs to shut down, so people who live in communities where those KFCs shut down won't be able to access their sweet, sweet fried chicken. Therefore, the patrons argue, the hardcore vegan's proposal constitutes <i>involuntary</i> animal suffering reduction, because <i>those</i> people didn't voluntarily choose to go vegan. Now the hardcore vegan is in a bind, because on the one hand, suspending KFC subsidies seems to them like obviously the morally right thing to do. On the other hand, they're the one who chose to restrict the conversation to \"voluntary animal suffering reduction,\" and there's a reasonable argument that suspending KFC subsidies would indeed constitute <i>involuntary </i>animal suffering reduction. So they can either drop the \"voluntary\" part, and be socially ostracized and have everything they have to say duly ignored, or they can enter the semantic debate about which definitions of \"voluntary\" their proposed intervention might fall under.</p><p>The hardcore vegan, having been passionate about animal suffering for years, chooses the latter, in spite of it being pretty motivated reasoning in retrospect. Bruce, a kindly and patient KFC patron, pulls the vegan aside and convinces them that their reasoning was motivated, and here we are.</p><blockquote><p>clearly the extent to which you believe nonvoluntary abortion reduction is morally preferable (and why), and the extent to which readers agree with this line of reasoning are relevant considerations when taking into account your recommendations</p></blockquote><p>I'll just drop a relevant quote from Scott Alexander's <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/30/fetal-attraction-abortion-and-the-principle-of-charity/\">\"Fetal Attraction: Abortion and the Principle of Charity\"</a> and leave it at that:</p><blockquote><p>There are quite a few pro-choice people who believe that abortion is morally wrong, but that the government should not ban it.

This is very related to the extant debates about abortion and public debates in general, where personal autonomy is broadly framed in terms of rights rather than as a synonym for \"choosing to do something\". Your section starts with \"When discussing abortion, it is crucial for us to emphasize the importance of personal autonomy\", and I think that it is at best poorly worded and misleading to use personal autonomy in that way because of the way the term is generally used and understood in public and political debate. <strong>The reason personal autonomy is important to discussions about abortion is because there are a lot of external forces, most importantly legal ones, that prevent people from exercising their personal autonomy to get an abortion. </strong>The opposite of this isn't true for choosing to have a child. There is an argument to be made that the positive social right to have a child and to have the state subsidize the care of that child in one way or another is not being met and that diminishes the capacity of individuals to have as many children as they want because they don't have the means to care them, and that this is a question of personal autonomy, but I disagree with that argument and find it a stretch at best, and in any case that argument isn't being made. In it's current form, using personal autonomy in that section reads like either a result of a poor understanding of the role of personal autonomy in debates about abortion or like a semantic maneuver the preemptively undermine objections on the ground of personal autonomy, which is particularly problematic because of suggestions to defund charities and intervention providing family planning and abortion services.</p>", "parentCommentId": "huGoqw6uGofHH6ha7", "user": {"username": "tugbazsen"}}, {"_id": "PkgJ3FYFbHcundJbA", "postedAt": "2022-12-23T08:40:34.010Z", "postId": "6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn", "htmlBody": "<p>I have a million arguments against this post and maybe in the past I'd have engaged with each of your points and arguments more thoroughly but I lost my patience for these things.

This doesn't immediately clash with personal autonomy as either of us have defined it when your proposition is formed as \"people who want to have children should be able to have them\", but when you form it as \"people who are pregnant should have their children\" (which seems to me to be the actual argument of the post, based on the post and your comments) it is no longer a question of ability but of choice.</p>\n<p>The reason I find the use of personal autonomy in the post objectionable is because using a term that is central to extant debates in a way that is disconnected from and unrelated to its use in those debates implies that it is response to those arguments without actually engaging with them.  This was a bigger problem when the title was personal autonomy does not preclude intervention, but i still think the bidyif the section itself reads as disingenuous in a similar way. Debates around personal autonomy in relation to abortion are not about how one should exersize their personal autonomy, they are about whether or not pregnant people should have the right to exercise their personal autonomy. These are two different arguments and the language functions as semantic tool to separate them. Treating them as if they are the same is unproductive and incorrect,  so differentiating between them is necessary.</p>\n<p>\"where I argue that even though free speech is a very important norm, we shouldn't make the choice to use our free speech to spread hate.\"</p>\n<p>I think this comparison fails because, although personal autonomy is a very important norm, the right to personal autonomy if pregnant people is being weakened or completely stripped away in many places in the world. Additionally,  you are ostensibly making an argument in favor of personal autonomy (people should be able to have and raise ot adopt children if they want to), not against it (people should not be able to have abortions). This, to me, makes personal autonomy irrelevant to your proposal because you are arguing for a moral prescription because it is a prescription on how one should choose to act not on how they have the ability to act.</p>\n<p>\"As for your perspective, I'm not sure whether your opinion is (a) that this post's scope should be broader or (b) that even given this post's stated scope, it's still worth it to address the external forces you brought up.\"</p>\n<p>I think that arguing against abortion without bringing up these external forces and the realities of pregnancy is deeply flawed. Although you make a passing concession to the costs of pregnancy in your post, I do think that these costs are severely minimized. Being pregnant and giving birth to a child, particular particularly an unwanted one, is extremely  burdensome for women economically, socially, mentally and physically. Somewhere in a comment thread you argued that if kidneys were regenerative, EAs would be arguing that everyone should donate kidneys once a year. I think this comparison makes it clear how much these costs are being minimized; having a child once a year, even if they didn't raise the children themselves, would likely have disastrous effects for the women doing it very quickly. Likewise, arguing that personal autonomy should be using in a certain way without recognizing that many women do not have the personal autonomy to make a choice at all feels callous at best.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "XCEZwPgtyyRrtvDHJ", "user": {"username": "tugbazsen"}}, {"_id": "nggDpknEcHGK6kab4", "postedAt": "2022-12-24T04:51:33.394Z", "postId": "6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn", "htmlBody": "<p>I mean, what really are the chances that effective altruism, a largely liberal, left-of-center (i.e., pro-choice) community would broadly endorse the view that terminating a pregnancy is morally wrong?</p>\n<p>For me the problem is, without explicit countervailing frameworks prioritizing the rights and needs of already existing people baked into it, abortion is morally wrong is a direct logical extension of a longtermist view that highly values maximizing the number of people on assumption that the average existing persons life will have positive value.

That this issue exists in the first place is, to me, either indicative of willful oversight and disregard (which is possible and also obviously perfectly fine, if that is what longtermist EAs believe, but in my opinion morally bad), or a serious blindspot that is so enormous in size and implications that it lowers my regard of the intellectual rigor of longtermist EA. I'd also like to add that, in addition to asymmetrical costs and time issues, one reason why I'm not writing advocating for \"maybe we should care about the human rights of currently existing people, and maybe we should care about it more than creating more people in the future\" is that having to argue for caring about human rights in a social movement that is about doing the most good possible is, to me, a clear indicator that that movement is not the right place for me.</p>", "parentCommentId": "AncRfRhJge8eQ55tG", "user": {"username": "tugbazsen"}}, {"_id": "cDfie9KaS9haab7c3", "postedAt": "2022-12-25T11:26:25.278Z", "postId": "6ma8rxrfYs3njyQZn", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for explaining how you feel.

It's very challenging for me personally to find the desire and follow through to sit down and spend hours putting together a post that argues for respect for my rights because, to put it simply, the idea that I need to argue that my rights and the rights of roughly half the worlds population should be valued and respected in this type of format (or at all, even) in the context of a movement that values doing good is extremely disheartening and demotivating, particularly when those rights are already being eroded across the world.

For the (majority) consequentialist part of my moral portfolio:  The main intrinsic bad is suffering, and wellbeing (somewhat broader) is intrinsically good.</p>\n<p>I think any argument about creating people/etc is instrumental - will they or won't they increase wellbeing?  They can both potentially contain suffering/wellbeing themselves, and affect the world in ways that affect wellbeing/suffering now &amp; in the future.  This includes effects before they are born (e.g. on women's lives).

Since abortion access seems good for civilization trajectory (women can have children when the want, don't have their lives &amp; health derailed, etc), more women involved in the development of powerful technology probably makes these fields more cautious/less rash, fewer 'unwanted children' [probably worse life outcomes], etc.  Then abortion access seems good.</p>\n<p>Maybe related: in general when maximizing, I think it's probably best to finding the most important 1-3 things, then focus on those things.
