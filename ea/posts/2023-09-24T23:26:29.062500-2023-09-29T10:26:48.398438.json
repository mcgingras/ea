Keeping the post up to date in 3 locations has been a disaster, and one casualty has been images that linked to source material now don't. I'm reaching out to the LW and EAF team, but until then to see the source material please click through to my blog where the links are intact.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Effective altruism prides itself on truthseeking. That pride is justified in the sense that EA is better at truthseeking than most members of its reference category, and unjustified in that it is far from meeting its own standards. We\u2019ve already seen dire consequences of the inability to detect bad actors who deflect investigation into potential problems, but by its nature you can never be sure you\u2019ve found all the damage done by epistemic obfuscation because the point is to be self-cloaking.&nbsp;</p><p>My concern here is for the underlying dynamics of&nbsp; EA\u2019s weak epistemic immune system, not any one instance. But we can\u2019t analyze the problem without real examples, so individual instances need to be talked about. Worse, the examples that are easiest to understand are almost by definition the smallest problems, which makes any scapegoating extra unfair. So don\u2019t.</p><p>This post focuses on a single example: vegan advocacy, especially around nutrition. I believe vegan advocacy as a cause has both actively lied and raised the cost for truthseeking, because they were afraid of the consequences of honest investigations. Occasionally there\u2019s a consciously bad actor I can just point to, but mostly this is an emergent phenomenon from people who mean well, and have done good work in other areas. That\u2019s why scapegoating won\u2019t solve the problem: we need something systemic.&nbsp;</p><p>In the next post I\u2019ll do a wider but shallower review of other instances of EA being hurt by a lack of epistemic immune system. I already have a long list, but it\u2019s not too late for you to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScaeEnKbZmDs1mWWMSWx0e1cy7DymUijL5EYvnPjP0us9itvQ/viewform?usp=sf_link\">share your examples</a>.&nbsp;</p><h1>Definitions</h1><p>I picked the words \u201cvegan advocacy\u201d really specifically. \u201cVegan\u201d sometimes refers to advocacy and sometimes to just a plant-exclusive diet, so I added \u201cadvocacy\u201d to make it clear.</p><p>I chose \u201cadvocacy\u201d over \u201cadvocates\u201d for most statements because this is a problem with the system. Some vegan advocates are net truthseeking and I hate to impugn them. Others would like to be epistemically virtuous but end up doing harm due to being embedded in an epistemically uncooperative system. Very few people are sitting on a throne of plant-based imitation skulls twirling their mustache thinking about how they\u2019ll fuck up the epistemic commons today.&nbsp;</p><p>When I call for actions I say \u201cadvocates\u201d and not \u201cadvocacy\u201d because actions are taken by people, even if none of them bear much individual responsibility for the problem.&nbsp;</p><p>I specify \u201cEA vegan advocacy\u201d and not just \u201cvegan advocacy\u201d not because I think mainstream vegan advocacy is better, but because 1. I don\u2019t have time to go after every wrong advocacy group in the world. 2. Advocates within Effective Altruism opted into a higher standard. EA has a right and responsibility to maintain the standards of truth it advocates, even if the rest of the world is too far gone to worry about.&nbsp;</p><h1>Audience</h1><p>If you\u2019re entirely uninvolved in effective altruism you can skip this, it\u2019s inside baseball and there\u2019s a lot of context I don\u2019t get into.</p><h1>How EA vegan advocacy has hindered truthseeking</h1><p>EA vegan advocacy has both pushed falsehoods and punished people for investigating questions it doesn\u2019t like. It manages this even for positions that 90%+ of effective altruism and the rest of the world agree with, like \u201cveganism is a constraint\u201d. I don\u2019t believe its arguments convince anyone directly, but end up having a big impact by making inconvenient beliefs too costly to discuss. This means new entrants to EA are denied half of the argument, and harm themselves due to ignorance.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/c2lseugi3kaakncqpyyp\" alt=\"\"></p><p>This section outlines the techniques I'm best able to name and demonstrate. For each technique I\u2019ve included examples. Comments on my own posts are heavily overrepresented because they\u2019re the easiest to find; \u201cgo searching through posts on veganism to find the worst examples\u201d didn\u2019t feel like good practice. I did my best to quote and summarize accurately, although I made no attempt to use a representative sample. I think this is fair because a lot of the problem lies in the fact that good comments don\u2019t cancel out bad, especially when the good comments are made in parallel rather than directly arguing with the bad. I\u2019ve linked to the source of every quote and screen shot, so you can (and should) decide for yourself. I\u2019ve also created a list of all of my own posts I\u2019m drawing from, so you can get a holistic view.&nbsp;</p><p>My posts:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://acesounderglass.com/2023/01/10/iron-deficiencies-are-very-bad-and-you-should-treat-them/\">Iron deficiencies are very bad and you should treat them</a> (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6frs5xTkeLc9vZSRN/iron-deficiencies-are-very-bad-and-you-should-treat-them\">LessWrong</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/e22kvdZWBfRYurPwg/iron-deficiencies-are-very-bad-and-you-should-treat-them-1\">EAForum</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://acesounderglass.com/2023/01/16/vegan-nutrition-testing-project-interim-report/\">Vegan Nutrition Testing Project: Interim Report</a> (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rRkhATuztvfMLFhT8/vegan-nutrition-testing-project-interim-report\">LessWrong</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dbw2mgSGSAKB45fAk/vegan-nutrition-testing-project-interim-report\">EAForum</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://acesounderglass.com/2023/05/13/lessons-learned-from-offering-in-office-nutritional-testing/\">Lessons learned from offering in-office nutritional testing</a> (<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xcEWBkK5jyHfnrK6K/lessons-learned-from-offering-in-office-nutritional-testing\">LessWrong</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LwdcFT5MwiyS5TqLr/lessons-learned-from-offering-in-office-nutritional-testing\">EAForum</a>)</li><li>What vegan food resources have you found useful?

In practice the comments I drew from came from LessWrong (white background) and EAForum (black background).&nbsp; I tried to go through those posts and remove all my votes on comments (except the automatic vote for my own comments) so that you could get an honest view of how the community voted without my thumb on the scale, but I\u2019ve probably missed some, especially on older posts. On the main posts, which received a lot of traffic, I stuck to well-upvoted comments, but I included some low (but still positive) karma comments from unpopular posts.&nbsp;</p><p>The goal here is to make these anti-truthseeking techniques legible for discussion, not develop complicated ways to say \u201cI don\u2019t like this\u201d, so when available I\u2019ve included counter examples. These are comments that look similar to the ones I\u2019m complaining about, but are fine or at least not suffering from the particular flaw in that section. In doing this I hope to keep the techniques\u2019 definitions narrow.</p><h2>Active suppression of inconvenient questions</h2><p>A small but loud subset of vegan advocacy will say outright you shouldn\u2019t say true things, because it leads to outcomes they dislike. This accusation is even harsher than \u201cnot truthseeking\u201d, and would normally be very hard to prove. If I say \u201cyou\u2019re saying that because you care more about creating vegans than the health of those you create\u201d, and they say \u201cno I\u2019m not\u201d, I don\u2019t really have a come back. I can demonstrate that they\u2019re wrong, but not their motivation. Luckily, a few people said the quiet part out loud.&nbsp;</p><p>Commenter Martin Soto pushed back very hard on my first nutrition testing study. Finally I asked him outright if he thought it was okay to share true information about vegan nutrition. His response was quite thoughtful and long, so you should really go read <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rRkhATuztvfMLFhT8/vegan-nutrition-testing-project-interim-report?commentId=jRYqyAY8d6NT2nEsN\">the whole thing</a>, but let me share two quotes</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rRkhATuztvfMLFhT8/vegan-nutrition-testing-project-interim-report?commentId=jRYqyAY8d6NT2nEsN\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/dj0rhpfh3epvctns3vjm\"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He goes on to say:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/zylgpqzvl19kltm66ybq\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And in a later comment</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/gwkpbvhwmetfpg48csgg\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>EDIT 2023-10-03: Martin <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aW288uWABwTruBmgF/ea-vegan-advocacy-is-not-truthseeking-and-it-s-everyone-s-1?commentId=N3xcRdBnLZdHYjND4\">disputes</a> my summary of his comments. I think it's good practice to link to disputes like this, even though I stand by my summary. I also want to give a heads-up that I see his comments in the dispute thread as continuing the patterns I describe (which makes that thread a tax on the reader). If you want to dig into this, I strongly suggest you first read his <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rRkhATuztvfMLFhT8/vegan-nutrition-testing-project-interim-report?commentId=jRYqyAY8d6NT2nEsN\">original comments</a> and come up with your own summary, so you can compare that to each of ours.</p><p>The charitable explanation here is that my post focuses on naive veganism, and Soto thinks that\u2019s a made-up problem. He believes this because all of the vegans he knows (through vegan advocacy networks) are well-educated on nutrition. There are a few problems here, but the most fundamental is that enacting <strong>his desired policy of suppressing public discussion of nutrition issues with plant-exclusive diets will prevent us from getting the information to know if problems are widespread</strong>. My post and a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rRkhATuztvfMLFhT8/vegan-nutrition-testing-project-interim-report?commentId=RXza6x5jM78SnDrc4\">commenter\u2019s report</a> on their college group are apparently the first time he\u2019s heard of vegans who didn\u2019t live and breathe B12.&nbsp;</p><p>I have a lot of respect for Soto for doing the math and so clearly stating his position that \u201cthe damage to people who implement veganism badly is less important to me than the damage to animals caused by eating them\u201d. Most people flinch away from explicit trade-offs like that, and I appreciate that he did them and own the conclusion. But <strong>I can\u2019t trust his math because he\u2019s cut himself off from half the information necessary to do the calculations</strong>. How can he estimate the number of vegans harmed or lost due to nutritional issues if he doesn\u2019t let people talk about them in public?<br><br>In fact the best data I found on this was from <a href=\"https://acesounderglass.com/2023/05/25/playing-with-faunalytics-vegan-attrition-data/\">Faunalytics</a><s>, which found that ~20% of veg*ns drop out due to health reasons. This suggests to me a high chance his math is wrong and will lead him to do harm by his own standards.</s></p><p>EDIT 2023-10-04: . Using <a href=\"https://acesounderglass.com/2023/05/25/playing-with-faunalytics-vegan-attrition-data/\">Faunalytics</a> numbers for self-reported health issues and improvements after quitting veg*nism, I calculated that 20% of veg*ns develop health issues. This number is sensitive to your assumptions; I consider 20% conservative but it could be an overestimate. I encourage you to read the whole post and play with my model, and of course read the <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Faunalytics_Current-Former-Vegetarians_Full-Report.pdf\">original work</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>Most people aren\u2019t nearly this upfront. They will go through the motions of calling an idea incorrect before emphasizing how it will lead to outcomes they dislike. But the net effect is a suppression of the exploration of ideas they find inconvenient.&nbsp;</p><p>This post on Facebook is a good example. Normally I would consider facebook posts out of bounds, especially ones this old (over five years). Facebook is a casual space and I want people to be able to explore ideas without being worried that they\u2019re creating a permanent record that will be used against them.&nbsp; In this case I felt that because the post was permissioned to public and a considered statement (rather than an off the cuff reply), the truth value outweighed the chilling effect. But because it\u2019s so old and I don\u2019t know how the author\u2019s current opinion, I\u2019m leaving out their name and not linking to the post.&nbsp;</p><p>The author is midlist EA- I\u2019d heard of them for other reasons, but they\u2019re certainly not EA-famous.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/nyqv2w8gqd1izk2owcdx\" alt=\"\"></p><p>There are posts very similar to this one I would have been fine with, maybe even joyful about. You could present evidence against the claims that X is harmful, or push people to verify things before repeating them, or suggest we reserve the word poison for actual kill-you-dead molecules and not complicated compound constructions with many good parts and only weak evidence of mild long-term negative effects. But what they actually did was name-check the idea that X is fine before focusing on the harm to animals caused by repeating the claim- which is exactly what you\u2019d expect if the health claims were true but inconvenient. I don\u2019t know what this author actually believes, but I do know focusing on the consequences when the facts are in question is not truthseeking.</p><p>A subtler version comes from the AHS-2 post. At the time of this comment the author, Rockwell, described herself as the leader of EA NYC and an advisor to philanthropists on animal suffering, so this isn\u2019t some rando having a feeling. This person has some authority.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/wpha7nx8zzshimmuoqrc\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This comment more strongly emphasizes the claim that my beliefs are wrong, not just inconvenient. And if they\u2019d written that counter-argument they promised I\u2019d be putting this in the counter-examples section. But it\u2019s been three months and they have not written anything where I can find it, nor responded to my inquiries. So even if literal claim were correct, she\u2019s using a technique whose efficacy is independent of truth.&nbsp;</p><p>Over on the Change My Mind post the top comment says that vegan advocacy is fine because it\u2019s no worse than fast food or breakfast cereal ads</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/ewuckgycoat7j6etc7wz\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019m surprised someone would make this comment. But what really shocks me is the complete lack of pushback from other vegan advocates. If I heard an ally described our shared movement as no worse than McDonalds, I would injure myself in my haste to repudiate them.&nbsp;</p><h3>Counter-Examples</h3><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/v789qKBBQTKNP3mEs/\">This post</a> on EAForum came out while I was finishing this post. The author asks if they should abstain from giving bad reviews to vegan restaurants, because it might lead to more animal consumption- which would be a central example of my complaint. But the comments are overwhelmingly \u201cno, there\u2019s not even a good consequentialist argument for that\u201d, and the author appears to be taking that to heart. So from my perspective this is a success story.</p><h2>Ignore the arguments people are actually making</h2><p>I\u2019ve experienced this pattern way too often.</p><p>Me: goes out of my way to say not-X in a post<br>Comment: how dare you say X! X is so wrong!<br>Me: here\u2019s where I explicitly say not-X.<br>*crickets*</p><p>This is by no means unique to posts about veganism. \u201cThey\u2019re yelling at me for an argument I didn\u2019t make\u201d is a common complaint of mine. But it happens so often, and so explicitly, in the vegan nutrition posts. Let me give some examples.</p><p>My post:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/qentmamkfb88ldkggsg2\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Commenter:</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3Lv4NyFm2aohRKJCH/change-my-mind-veganism-entails-trade-offs-and-health-is-one?commentId=R6r2b4swfGLByuJot\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/kpy6bvry34wnauhdffwd\"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My post:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/w7kdafeo38yfgdfpdwli\" alt=\"\"></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/tvygzbhkawx6dsrwyari\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Commenters:</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3Lv4NyFm2aohRKJCH/change-my-mind-veganism-entails-trade-offs-and-health-is-one?commentId=cJydGWvcvsf4kigza\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/pehodhkhy4nenfmwllue\"></a></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/aazxuilqdq112nstlzqa\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My post:<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/stehytq3hcqcgjpafg8p\"></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/ryonx5tbq662ilvua8s1\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Commenter:&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/kvwky6iidcdxnjb4vwwm\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My post:&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/l7oi2hobb2drj3lnii8b\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Commenter:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/aqa1ah4honzfycn1w1g3\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My post:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/k1minizmckj5vtmrgv7h\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Commenter:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/mseiyrythj9w36gpu8vl\" alt=\"\"></p><p>You might be thinking \u201cwell those posts were very long and honestly kind of boring, it would be unreasonable to expect people to read everything\u201d.

This was my attempt to create something uncontroversially useful, and I\u2019d call it a modest success. The post had 20-something karma on LW and EAForum, and there were several useful-looking resources shared on EAForum. But it also got the following comment on LW:&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/nkud2ede3txqwkijtbdj\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I picked this example because it only takes a little bit of thought to see the jujitsu, so little it barely counts. He disagreed with my implicit claim that\u2026 well okay here\u2019s the problem. I\u2019m still not quite sure where he disagrees. Does he think everyone automatically eats well as a vegan? That no one will benefit from resources like veganhealth.org? That no one will benefit from a cheat sheet for vegan party spreads? That there is no one for whom veganism is challenging? He can\u2019t mean that last one because he acknowledges exceptions in his later comment, but only because I pushed back. Maybe he thinks that the only vegans who don\u2019t follow his steps are those with medical issues, and that no-processed-food diets are too unpopular to consider?&nbsp;</p><p>I don\u2019t think this was deliberately anti-truthseeking, because if it was he would have stopped at \u201cnothing special\u201d instead of immediately outlining the special things his partner does. That was fairly epistemically cooperative. But it is still an example of strong claims made only implicitly.&nbsp;</p><h3>Counter-Examples</h3><p>I think this comment makes a claim (\u201cvegans moving to naive omnivorism will hurt themselves\u201d) clearly, and backs it up with a lot of details.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/zwcwe4zguzzodqzrruy8\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The tone is kind of obnoxious and he\u2019s arguing with something I never claimed, but his beliefs are quite clear. I can immediately understand which beliefs of his I agree with (\u201cvegans moving to naive omnivorism will hurt themselves\u201d and \u201cthat would be bad\u201d) and make good guesses at implicit claims I disagree with (\u201cand therefore we should let people hurt themselves with naive veganism\u201d? \u201cI [Elizabeth] wouldn\u2019t treat naive mass conversion to omnivorism seriously as a problem\u201d?). That\u2019s enough to count as epistemically cooperative.</p><h2>Sound and fury, signifying no substantial disagreement&nbsp;</h2><p>Sometimes someone comments with an intense, strongly worded, perhaps actively hostile, disagreement. After a laborious back and forth, the problem dissolves: they acknowledge I never held the position they were arguing with, or they don\u2019t actually disagree with my specific claims.&nbsp;</p><p>Originally I felt happy about these, because \u201cmostly agreeing\u201d is an unusually positive outcome for that opening. But these discussions are grueling. It is hard to express kindness and curiosity towards someone yelling at you for a position you explicitly disclaimed. Any one of these stories would be a success but en masse they amount to a huge tax on saying anything about veganism, which is already quite labor intensive.</p><p>The discussions could still be worth it if it changed the arguer\u2019s mind, or at least how they approached the next argument. But I don\u2019t get the sense that\u2019s what happens. Neither of us have changed our minds about anything, and I think they\u2019re just as likely to start a similar fight the next week.</p><p>I do feel like vegan advocates are entitled to a certain amount of defensiveness. They encounter large amounts of concern trolling and outright hostility, and it makes sense that that colors their interactions. But that allowance covers one comment, maybe two, not three to eight (Wilkox, depending on which ones you count).&nbsp;</p><p>For example, I\u2019ve already quoted Wilkox\u2019s very fuzzy comment (reminder: this was the top voted comment on that post on LW). That was followed by a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Wiz4eKi5fsomRsMbx/change-my-mind-veganism-entails-trade-offs-and-health-is-one?commentId=YWZopNjcA8uvXWB4F\">13+ comment exchange</a> in which we eventually found he had little disagreement with any of my claims about vegan nutrition, only the importance of these facts. There really isn\u2019t a way for me to screenshot this: the length and lack of specifics is the point.</p><p>You could say that the confusion stemmed from poor writing on my part, but:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/qqt6wy2xllxiicklx5ey\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I really appreciate the meta-honesty here, but since the exchange appears to have eaten hours of both of our time just to dig ourselves out of a hole, I can\u2019t get that excited about it.&nbsp;</p><h3>Counter-Examples</h3><p>I want to explicitly note that Sound and Fury isn\u2019t the same as asking questions or not understanding a post. E.g. here Ben West identifies a confusion, asks me, and accepts both my answer and an explanation of why answering is difficult.&nbsp;</p><h2><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/cgybf4xaahske7gni6fo\"></h2><p>Or in that same post, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3Lv4NyFm2aohRKJCH/change-my-mind-veganism-entails-trade-offs-and-health-is-one?commentId=f3a3DvsNjRtwCJ76W\">someone asked me to define nutritionally dense</a>. It took a bit for me to answer and we still disagreed afterward, but it was a great question and the exchange felt highly truthseeking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Bad sources, badly handled&nbsp;</h2><p>Citations should be something of a bet: if the citation (the source itself or your summary of it) is high quality and supports your point, that should move people closer to your views. But if they identify serious relevant flaws, that should move both you and your audience closer to their point of view. Of course our beliefs are based on a lot of sources and it\u2019s not feasible or desirable to really dig into all of them for every disagreement, so the bet may be very small. But if you\u2019re not willing to defend a citation, you shouldn\u2019t make it.</p><p>What I see in EA vegan advocacy is deeply terrible citations, thrown out casually, and abandoned when inconvenient. I\u2019ve made <a href=\"https://acesounderglass.com/tag/epistemicspotcheck/\">something of a name for myself</a> checking citations and otherwise investigating factual claims from works of nonfiction. Of everything I\u2019ve investigated, I think citations from EA vegan advocacy have the worst effort:truth ratio. Not outright more falsehoods, I read some pretty woo stuff, but those can be dismissed quickly. Citations in vegan advocacy are often revealed to be terrible only after great effort.</p><p>And having put in that effort, my reward is usually either crickets, or a new terrible citation. Sometimes we will eventually drill into \u201cI just believe it\u201d, which is honestly fine. We don\u2019t live our lives to the standard of academic papers. But if that\u2019s your reason, you need to state it from the beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, in the top voted comment on Change My Mind post on EAF,&nbsp; Rockwell (head of EA NYC) has five links in her post. Only links 1 and 4 are problems, but I'll describe them in order to avoid confusion.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/rwz2zi64e10j28dcyo4x\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of the five links:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Wiz4eKi5fsomRsMbx/change-my-mind-veganism-entails-trade-offs-and-health-is-one?commentId=uh8w6JeLAfuZF2sxQ\">Wilkox\u2019s comment</a> on the LW version of the post, where he eventually agrees that veganism requires testing and supplementation for many people (although most of that exchange hadn\u2019t happened at the time of linking).</li><li>cites my past work, if anything too generously.</li><li>an <a href=\"https://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/micronutrient-inadequacies/overview\">estimation of nutrient deficiency in the US</a>.

We don\u2019t have time to get all the flaws in that article, so I\u2019ve put my first hour of criticisms in the appendix. What really gets me here is that I would have agreed the standard American diet sucks without asking for a source. I thought I had conceded that point preemptively, albeit not naming Standard American Diet explicitly.<br><br>And if she did feel a need go the extra mile on rigor for this comment, it\u2019s really not that hard to find decent-looking research about the harms of the Standard Shitty American Diet.&nbsp; I found <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Meat-consumption-and-risk-of-ischemic-heart-A-and-Papier-Knuppel/f03c2cbdf1d8e0f66e460448df5c7969c04625c6\">this paper on heart disease</a> in 30 seconds, and most of that time was spent waiting for Elicit to load. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s actually good, but it is not so obviously farcical as the cited paper.</li><li>The fifth link goes to a description of the Standard American Diet.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Rockwell did not respond to my initial reply (that fixing vegan issues is easier than fixing SSAD), or my <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3Lv4NyFm2aohRKJCH/change-my-mind-veganism-entails-trade-offs-and-health-is-one?commentId=LNzFmHKkRJXjMwzRb\">asking</a> if that paper on the risks of meat eating was her favorite.</p><p>A much more time-consuming version of this happened with Adventist Health Study-2. Several people cited the AHS-2 as a pseudo-RCT that supported veganism (EDIT 2023-10-03: as superior to low meat omnivorism). There\u2019s one commenter on <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Wiz4eKi5fsomRsMbx/change-my-mind-veganism-entails-trade-offs-and-health-is-one?commentId=mpgB9a4Hp3gyA3jaQ\">LessWrong</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3Lv4NyFm2aohRKJCH/change-my-mind-veganism-entails-trade-offs-and-health-is-one?commentId=G7ZK76h99Nrv6GCEq\">two</a> on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3Lv4NyFm2aohRKJCH/change-my-mind-veganism-entails-trade-offs-and-health-is-one?commentId=fNxwRxnqB5LKNC8na\">EAForum</a> (one of whom had previously co-authored a blog post on the study and offered to answer questions). As I <a href=\"https://acesounderglass.com/2023/06/14/adventist-health-study-2-supports-pescetarianism-more-than-veganism/\">discussed here</a>, that study is one of the best we have on nutrition and I\u2019m very glad people brought it to my attention. But calling it a pseudo-RCT that supports veganism is deeply misleading. It is nowhere near randomized, and doesn\u2019t cleanly support veganism even if you pretend it is.</p><p>(EDIT 2023-10-03: To be clear, the noise in the study overwhelms most differences in outcomes, even ignoring the self-sorting. My complaint is that the study was presented as strong evidence in one direction, when it\u2019s both very weak and, if you treat it as strong, points in a different direction than reported. One commenter has said she only meant it as evidence that a vegan diet can work for some people, which I agree with, as stated in the post she was responding to.&nbsp;She disagrees with other parts of my summary as well, you can read more <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aW288uWABwTruBmgF/ea-vegan-advocacy-is-not-truthseeking-and-it-s-everyone-s-1?commentId=brKiqmPhgQsqoFJwx\">here</a>)</p><p>It\u2019s been three months, and none of the recommenders have responded to my analysis of the main AHS-2 paper, despite repeated requests.&nbsp;</p><p>But finding a paper is of lower quality and supports an entirely different conclusion is still not the worst-case scenario. The worst outcome is citation whack-a-mole.</p><p>A good example of this is from the post \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AFPXXepkgitbvTtpH/getting-cats-vegan-is-possible-and-imperative\">Getting Cats Vegan is Possible and Imperative</a>\u201d, by Karthik Sekar. <a href=\"https://karthiksekar.com/\">Karthik</a> is a vegan author and data scientist at a plant-based meat company.&nbsp;</p><p>[Note that I didn\u2019t zero out my votes on this post\u2019s comments, because it seemed less important for posts I didn\u2019t write]</p><p>Karthik cites a lot of sources in that post. I picked what looked like his strongest source and investigated. It was terrible. It was a review article, so checking it required reading multiple studies. Of the cited studies, only 4&nbsp; (with a total of 39 combined subjects) use blood tests rather than owner reports, and more than half of those were given vegetarian diets, not vegan (even though the table header says vegan). The only RCT didn't include carnivorous diets.&nbsp;</p><p>Karthik <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AFPXXepkgitbvTtpH/getting-cats-vegan-is-possible-and-imperative?commentId=StBFGhMswrQbPsWJj\">agrees</a> that paper (that he cited) is not making its case \u201cstrong nor clear\u201d, and cites <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/plant-based-cats-are-healthier-according-to-guardians/\">another one</a> (which AFAICT was not in the original post).</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AFPXXepkgitbvTtpH/getting-cats-vegan-is-possible-and-imperative?commentId=uSe5qJjywNZrK58Dk\">I dismiss</a> the new citation on the basis of \u201cmotivated [study] population and minimal reporting\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AFPXXepkgitbvTtpH/getting-cats-vegan-is-possible-and-imperative?commentId=LbESEykJ7o9ccLAX5\">He retreats to</a> \u201c[My] argument isn't solely based on the survey data. It's supported by fundamentals of biochemistry, metabolism, and digestion too [...] Mammals such as cats will digest food matter into constituent molecules. Those molecules are chemically converted to other molecules--collectively, metabolism--, and energy and biomass (muscles, bones) are built from those precursors. For cats to truly be obligate carnivores, there would have to be something exceptional about meat: (A) There would have to be essential molecules--nutrients--that cannot be sourced anywhere else OR (B) the meat would have to be digestible in a way that's not possible with plant matter. [...So any plant-based food that passes AAFCO guidelines is nutritionally complete for cats. Ami does, for example.]</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AFPXXepkgitbvTtpH/getting-cats-vegan-is-possible-and-imperative?commentId=KYHZ68NB7WgCDorQn\">I point</a> out that AAFCO doesn\u2019t think meeting their guidelines is necessarily sufficient. I expected him to dismiss this as corporate ass-covering, and there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019d be right. But he didn\u2019t.</p><p>Finally, he gets to his real position:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AFPXXepkgitbvTtpH/getting-cats-vegan-is-possible-and-imperative?commentId=73hvaZcdfRfPhkeEy\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/ael1fmmvnivcek57xzr5\"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which would have been a fine aspirational statement, but then why include so many papers he wasn\u2019t willing to stand behind?&nbsp;</p><p>On that same post <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AFPXXepkgitbvTtpH/getting-cats-vegan-is-possible-and-imperative?commentId=Giy85Rkp8RuGFNCxy\">someone else</a> says that they think my concerns are a big deal, and Karthik probably can\u2019t convince them without convincing me.&nbsp; Karthik responds:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/u4ddga5lav7dtdpvrbjd\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So he\u2019s conceded that his study didn\u2019t show what he claimed. And he\u2019s not really defending the AAFCO standards. But he\u2019s really sure this will work anyway? And I\u2019m the one who won\u2019t update their beliefs.&nbsp;</p><p>In a different comment the same <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AFPXXepkgitbvTtpH/getting-cats-vegan-is-possible-and-imperative?commentId=FJEfSpG5nDiw4EjXz\">someone else</a> notes a weird incongruity in the paper. Karthik doesn\u2019t respond.</p><p>This is the real risk of the bad sources: hours of deep intellectual work to discover that his argument boils down to a theoretical claim the author could have stated at the beginning. \u201cI believe vegan cat food meets these numbers and meeting these numbers is sufficient\u201d honestly&nbsp; isn\u2019t a terrible argument, and I\u2019d have respected it plainly stated, especially since he explicitly calls for RCTs.

But when I push back on the serious limitations of the study, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3Lv4NyFm2aohRKJCH/change-my-mind-veganism-entails-trade-offs-and-health-is-one?commentId=HCjgBE8y9YMfqgEg7\">he owns the issues</a> and says he only ever meant the paper to support a more modest claim (while still believing the big claim he did make?).&nbsp;</p><h2>Taxing Facebook</h2><p>When I joined EA Facebook in 2014, it was absolutely hopping. Every week I met new people and had great discussions with them where we both walked away smarter. I\u2019m unclear when this trailed off because I was drifting away from EA at the same time, but let\u2019s say the golden age was definitively over by 2018. Facebook was where I first noticed the pattern with EA vegan advocacy.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in 2014 or 2015, Seattle EA watched some horrifying factory farming documentaries, and we were each considering how we should change our diets in light of that new information. We tried to continue the discussion on Facebook, only to have Jacy Reese Anthis (who was not a member of the local group and AFAIK had never been to Seattle) repeatedly insist that the only acceptable compromise was vegetarianism, humane meat doesn\u2019t exist, and he hadn\u2019t heard of health conditions benefiting from animal products so my doctor was wrong (or maybe I made it up?).&nbsp;</p><p>I wish I could share screenshots on this, but the comments are gone (I think because the account has been deleted). I\u2019ve included shots of the post and some of my comments (one of which refers to Jacy obstructing an earlier conversation, which I\u2019d forgotten about). A third commenter has been cropped out, but I promise it doesn\u2019t change the context.<br><br><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/akoabyernblflswlmzyd\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/cgnzplgeodgzkkdhzo8n\"></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/hgpaeu3n4nntfsnsqoft\" alt=\"\"></p><p>(his answer was no, and that either I or my doctor were wrong because Jacy had never heard of any medical issue requiring consumption of animal products)</p><p>That conversation went okay. Seattle EA discussed suffering math on different vertebrates, someone brought up eating bugs, Brian Tomasik argued against eating bugs. It was everything an EA conversation should be.</p><p>But it never happened again.</p><p>Because this kind of thing happened every time animal products, diet, and health came up anywhere on EA Facebook. The commenters weren\u2019t always as aggressive as Jacy, but they added a tremendous amount of cumulative friction. An omnivore would ask if lacto-vegetarianism worked, and the discussion would get derailed by animal advocates insisting you didn\u2019t need milk.&nbsp; Conversations about feeling hungry at EAG inevitably got a bunch of commenters saying <i>they</i> were fine, as if that was a rebuttal.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeff Kaufman mirrors his FB posts onto his actual blog, which makes me feel more okay linking to it. In <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/two-kinds-of-vegan\">this post</a> he makes a pretty clear point- that veganism can be any of cheaper, or healthier, or tastier, but not all at once.&nbsp; He gets a lot of arguments. One person argues that no one thinks that, they just care about animals more.&nbsp;</p><p>One vegetarian says they\u2019d like to go vegan but just can\u2019t beat eggs for their mix of convenience, price, macronutrients, and micronutrients. She gets a lot of suggestions for substitutes, all of which flunk on at least one criterion.&nbsp; Jacy Reese Anthis has a deleted comment, which from the reply looks like he asserted the existence of a substitute without listing one.&nbsp;</p><p>After a year or two of this, people just stopped talking about anything except the vegan party line on public FB. We\u2019d bitch to each other in private, but that was it. And that\u2019s why, when a new generation of people joined EA and were exposed to the moral argument for veganism, there was no discussion of the practicalities visible to them.&nbsp;</p><p>[TBF they probably wouldn\u2019t have seen the conversations on FB anyway, I\u2019m told that\u2019s an old-person thing now. But the silence has extended itself]</p><h2>Ignoring known falsehoods until they\u2019re a PR problem</h2><p>This is old news, but: for many years ACE said <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20161211181805/https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/interventions/leafleting/2013-leafleting-study/\">leafletting was great</a>.

I wouldn\u2019t call that post very epistemically virtuous; it was clearly hoping to inflame more than inform. But within a few weeks (months?), ACE put up a disavowal of the leafletting numbers.</p><p>I unfortunately can\u2019t look up the original correction or when they put it up; archive.org behaves very weirdly around animalcharityevaluators.org. As I remember it made the page less obviously false, but the disavowal was tepid and not a real fix. Here\u2019s the 2022 version:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qF4yhMMuavCFrLqfz/mf62ydwjbo5psqwugvdc\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are two options here: ACE was right about leafleting, and caved to public pressure rather than defend their beliefs. Or ACE was wrong about leafleting (and knew they were wrong, because they conceded in private when challenged) but continued to publicly endorse it.</p><h1>Why I Care</h1><p>I\u2019ve thought vegan advocates were advocating falsehoods and stifling truthseeking for years. I never bothered to write it up, and generally avoided public discussion, because that sounded like a lot of work for absolutely no benefit. Obviously I wasn\u2019t going to convince the advocates of anything, because finding the truth wasn\u2019t their goal, and everyone else knew it so what did it matter? I was annoyed at them on principle for being wrong and controlling public discussion with unfair means, but there are so many wrong people in the world and I had a lot on my plate.&nbsp;</p><p>I should have cared more about the principle.</p><p>I\u2019ve talked before about the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rRkhATuztvfMLFhT8/vegan-nutrition-testing-project-interim-report?commentId=RXza6x5jM78SnDrc4\">young Effective Altruists</a> who converted to veganism with no thought for nutrition, some of whom suffered for it. They trusted effective altruism to have properly screened arguments and tell them what they needed to know. After my posts went up I started getting emails from older EAs who weren\u2019t getting the proper testing either; I didn\u2019t know because I didn\u2019t talk to them in private, and we couldn\u2019t discuss it in public.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is the default story of not fighting for truth. You think the consequences are minimal, but you can\u2019t know because the entire problem is that information is being suppressed.&nbsp;</p><h1>What do EA vegan advocates need to do?</h1><ol><li>Acknowledge that nutrition is a multidimensional problem, that veganism is a constraint, and that adding constraints usually makes problems harder, especially if you\u2019re already under several.</li><li>Take responsibility for the nutritional education of vegans you create. This is not just an obligation, it\u2019s an opportunity to improve the lives of people who are on your side. If you genuinely believe veganism can be nutritionally whole, then every person doing it poorly is suffering for your shared cause <i>for no reason</i>.<ol><li>You don\u2019t even have to single out veganism. For purposes of this point I\u2019ll accept \u201cAll diet switches have transition costs and veganism is no different, and the long term benefits more than compensate\u201d. I don\u2019t think your certainty is merited, and I\u2019ll respect you more if you express uncertainty, but I understand that some situations require short messaging and am willing to allow this compression.</li></ol></li><li>Be <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jbE85wCkRr9z7tqmD/epistemic-legibility#Epilogue_2__Epistemic_Cooperation\">epistemically cooperative</a>, at least within EA spaces. I realize this is a big ask because in the larger world people are often epistemically uncooperative towards you. But obfuscation is a <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/24/guided-by-the-beauty-of-our-weapons/\">symmetric weapon</a> and anger is not a reason to believe someone.

While we made an effort to survey participants and learn from their feedback, we recognise that others may identify additional strengths or weaknesses based on a high-level summary. By putting these reflections out into the community, we hope to catalyse discussion that will help us and others improve future programming aimed at building existential risk research capacity.&nbsp;</i></p><h1><strong>Executive Summary</strong></h1><ul><li>At ERA, we tried to create a <strong>culture</strong>&nbsp;where fellows felt able to explore diverse x-risk ideas openly and collaboratively</li><li>Our programming included <strong>34 speaker events</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>4 discussion groups</strong>. We contained a number of speaker events in our 2 day long intro workshop and our day trip to Trajan House.</li><li>The intro workshop and the reading groups particularly helped fellows gain knowledge; the <strong>mean satisfaction with knowledge acquisition was 8.4/10.</strong></li><li>Events exposed fellows to many new ideas and cause areas from a diverse range of perspectives, and survey responses suggest that this was a key contributor to a <strong>truth-seeking atmosphere</strong>&nbsp;during the Fellowship.</li><li><strong>Social connections and professional collaboration</strong>&nbsp;between fellows proved very important, as many rated&nbsp;these components as one of the most important aspects of the programme.</li><li>Areas for improvement include organising events earlier, providing more research methodology training and networking events as well as sharing events more broadly (including with other fellowship programmes).</li></ul><h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1><p>During the 2023 ERA Cambridge summer research fellowship, we attempted to create a culture where participants felt able to explore a variety of different ideas related to existential risk (x-risk) - we were intent on creating&nbsp;a space where questioning and exploration of different approaches was encouraged, and wanted to avoid making participants feel like they had to agree with our views on x-risk, but rather to upskill into strong x-risk researchers&nbsp;who could develop important new ideas. Essentially, we wanted to create a space where discovery and debate was encouraged in a collaborative rather than tense way.</p><h1><strong>ERA\u2019s Culture</strong></h1><ul><li>In general, the culture around the office felt exceptionally friendly, with discussion between fellows of different cause areas being a common occurrence.</li><li>Discussion on a multitude of key issues around existential risk happened a lot, with a variety of fellows taking different views.</li><li>It was very clear that there wasn\u2019t an \u2018orthodoxy\u2019 on ways to approach this, which seemed to be very useful in allowing for exploration of a variety of approaches. We took active steps to communicate this to fellows (one example of this can be found in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSEGVU-FBbb2o-9AA3mBBAuZJ8O7iAOrNQlCzG-nmoIqH3P5VdwEkmja0Mm6mraQXPMMLAaUuBpF3eX/pub#h.grv157bbnkhy\"><u>Appendix</u></a>).</li><li>Participants seemed not only excited about exploring ideas around x-risk that seem common in EA, but also a much broader range of ideas including those that may be much less commonly discussed in EA spaces.</li><li>Participants seemed willing and interested to talk about and explore other cause areas; almost every event (including reading groups) had participants from a variety of cause areas.</li><li>Fellows\u2019 professional connections with each other seemed really crucial. Many participants rated interactions with other fellows to be the most important aspect of the fellowship for them.</li><li>Fellows also developed strong social connections with each other away from work settings as well. This likely helped in creating a positive work environment that allowed debates, disagreements and divergences to be fostered in a friendly way, and we expect this to aid our efforts to build a sustainable and collaboratively x-risk research community even after the Fellowship ends.</li></ul><h1><strong>Overview of Programming</strong></h1><p>During the 8 week fellowship, we ran <strong>34 \u2018speaker events\u2019</strong>&nbsp;(including talks, Ask Me Anythings and discussions with external speakers), and hosted <strong>an existential risks discussion group with an external facilitator</strong>&nbsp;(APOCALYPSE), facilitated <strong>2 cause-specific discussion groups in Cambridge</strong>&nbsp;(AI and Nuclear) and joined an existing cause-specific discussion group&nbsp;(GCBR). Fellows also organised<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a one-off discussion group (Climate + Meta) and ran <strong>weekly reflection activities</strong>. A full list of speaker events is in the appendix.</p><p>We began the fellowship with a <strong>2-day introductory workshop</strong>&nbsp;on Tuesday and Wednesday of week 1, followed by a visit from Michael Aird on Monday and Tuesday of week 2. The introductory workshop had the following talks:</p><ul><li>Gideon Futerman (ERA): <strong>Key Concepts in Existential Risk Studies</strong></li><li>Luke Kemp (at the time CSER): <strong>Agents of Doom</strong></li><li>Lalitha Sundaram (CSER): <strong>Governance in Existential Risk Studies</strong></li><li>SJ Beard (CSER): <strong>History and Ethics in Existential Risk Studies</strong></li><li>Michael Aird - recording (Rethink Priorities): <strong>Theory of Change Workshop</strong></li><li>Lara Mani and Luke Kemp (CSER): <strong>Futures and Foresight Methods</strong></li><li>Lara Mani (CSER): <strong>How to do a literature review</strong></li><li>SJ Beard (CSER): <strong>Methods in Existential Risk Studies</strong></li></ul><p>These were meant to be accessible for those with no experience in x-risk (as some of our fellows had never engaged explicitly with x-risk before), but also provide very useful context and content for those heavily involved in x-risk discussions. In general, they were focused on \u2018big questions\u2019 of x-risk, and attempted to give an overview of the breadth of the field.</p><p>Fellows highly valued this set of workshops, with many explicitly mentioning it in their post-fellowship feedback<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg1ghfzhatd8\"><sup><a href=\"#fng1ghfzhatd8\">[1]</a></sup></span>. Those participants with little x-risk experience seemed to get the most out of it, with it seemingly bringing everyone \u2018up to speed\u2019 rather quickly. A few fellows already involved in x-risk found it slightly less useful, though most with existing experience still found it informative. The initial workshops influenced the research questions for some fellows, and, according to others, may have changed the direction of their projects if questions had not already been decided upon.</p><h2>Theory of Change for the Programming</h2><p><i>Note: This was written before the programme started.</i></p><h3>Key objectives:</h3><ul><li>Help inform the work of the fellows during the fellowship, including research skills and other useful <strong>skills they will directly use in the fellowship</strong></li><li>This should directly improve their research output, which is a useful x-risk end in itself. It also will make the research experience more useful and easier, meaning retention in x-risk research is likely higher</li><li>Provide fellows with skills, knowledge and concepts <strong>useful to specific cause areas and x-risk in general.</strong></li><li>This is about training them to be good x-risk researchers, giving them a good basis for further work and awareness of the field as a whole to help with research and prioritisation</li><li>Provide fellows with <strong>networking opportunities</strong>&nbsp;and understanding of the <strong>social organisation of their cause area</strong>&nbsp;and x-risk in general</li><li>This should allow them to be better involved in the core discussions going on in the field, allowing them to be exposed to more ideas via diffusion, opportunities and connections, as well as allowing their research to in turn be communicated to these audiences</li></ul><p>We want fellows to leave the fellowship not just with an understanding of what they researched, but a <strong>better grasp of their cause area and x-risk as a whole</strong>. This means programming should be intentionally broad to expose fellows to as wide a range of concepts as possible, whilst also in depth enough to provide them with a solid basis to explore these concepts further if they so wish. Equipping fellows with this diverse conceptual and skills toolkit is a key outcome of the fellowship that is operationalised through the programming.</p><p><strong>The programming character should change through the fellowship</strong>. The start should focus on skills and concepts directly relevant, or could be directly relevant, to their projects, and on building strong social connections between the fellows. As time goes on, the focus should shift towards networking and broader concepts and skills that may be useful to the fellows in the future.</p><p>This is essentially based on what is necessary to<strong>&nbsp;make the fellows as useful additions to x-risk as possible</strong>: equipping them with skills and knowledge to do novel and useful research towards reducing x-risk, and a network and awareness of the field that will allow them to operationalise this into useful and impactful research.</p><h2>Did the programming fulfil the Theory of Change:</h2><ul><li><strong>Our programming contributed to different fellows\u2019 research in different ways.</strong>&nbsp;In general, for more narrowly scoped projects, the impact tended to be limited, whilst broader projects tended to benefit more. Whether better focused programming could have actually assisted with the more specific projects over such a short window is unclear. Many participants noted the lack of programming for specific research skills that may have been useful specifically for their projects. This may be reflected in the lower score (mean) given for gain in research skills and competencies when compared to knowledge acquisition (7.1 compared to 8.4).</li><li>The programming was clearly<strong>&nbsp;very useful at helping improve fellows\u2019 knowledge of x-risk in general, and for their cause area in particular.</strong>&nbsp;The first of these two aspects seemed to be stronger than the latter. The <strong>mean satisfaction of knowledge acquisition was 8.37</strong>, with the programming, particularly the reading group and initial workshops being mentioned in responses a large number of times. (<i>Note the mean satisfaction with events was 7.7, although most negative comments were related to the last-minute organisation; indeed one fellow rated the quality of events at 9 and the organisation of them at 2</i>).</li><li>It also <strong>somewhat contributed to understanding the social organisation of the cause area</strong>, and some commented on how useful the connections with speakers were (e.g. one person has said it has helped them consider a job at the speaker\u2019s institution). One speaker explicitly offered attendants to reach out to them afterwards, an offer that many attendants of that event picked them up on, leading to multiple calls with the speaker that we have reason to believe were counterfactually very unlikely to happen. Nonetheless, other factors such as discussion with mentors, research managers and other fellows seemed overall more important in connecting people and giving fellows the awareness of what &nbsp;their cause area actually looks like than the events.</li><li>The shift towards networking<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8lqx7dd3yxq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8lqx7dd3yxq\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;didn\u2019t really occur. Fellows did visit other institutions (some attended the Cooperative AI Summer School, and there were visits to Conjecture and Trajan House) which seemed to be quite valuable. Research managers and mentors also put fellows in contact with relevant researchers, and fellows did establish connections with speakers. However, as the programme went on, fellows wanted to spend more time on their research, and because of holidays August is a hard time to organise events. Nonetheless, it is likely that <strong>networking opportunities could be improved</strong>&nbsp;in the future.</li><li>Generally, we feel the programming gave participants <strong>greater awareness of key concepts and ideas</strong>&nbsp;across x-risk in a lot of depth, helping skill them up to be active participants in the x-risk field.</li></ul><h1><strong>How can programming contribute to culture and overall aims</strong></h1><ul><li>The initial workshops (and Michael Aird\u2019s week 2 visit) seemed to immediately signal to participants encouragement for exploration of a variety of viewpoints, and that disagreement would be encouraged, as long as it was truth-seeking (<i>medium confidence</i>).</li><li>This is because speakers openly presented different and disagreeing perspectives about core issues in x-risk. Some speakers were part of the EA community, some ambivalent and some critical of the EA community.</li><li>The initial workshop and the APOCALYPSE reading group encouraged participants to continually explore \u2018big questions\u2019 about x-risk, how to understand it and how to work on it (<i>medium confidence</i>).</li><li>There are compounding factors here, in that a number of the projects were engaging with many big questions of how to conceptualise x-risk.</li><li>The reading and discussion groups encouraged participants to learn and discuss x-risk topics with people in other cause areas (<i>high confidence</i>). Having \u2018general\u2019 events, and having specific events for every cause area encouraged an \u2018equality\u2019 of engagement where people from each cause area learnt things from other cause areas (<i>weak confidence</i>), and led to broader discussion about \u2018big questions\u2019 in XRisk (<i>medium confidence</i>).</li><li>In Week 3, we introduced the <i>ERA Research Circles</i>, cause area-specific reading and discussion groups to facilitate knowledge exchange amongst the fellows. The idea is that Fellows can meet each week to discuss research papers relevant to their cause areas, or wider existential risks research. To encourage the formation of these groups, we supported fellows by covering dinner for the evenings of such discussions. This led to the formation of 2 fellow-led discussion groups. These Research Circles were not restricted specifically to fellows from specific cause areas and helped contribute to a culture of open inquiry and collaboration. Fellows from different cause areas joined each group, exposing themselves to new perspectives and allowing for lively debate that tested assumptions on all sides.</li></ul><h1><strong>What we ought to improve</strong></h1><ul><li>Organisation: <strong>Clearly signal when events are</strong>&nbsp;(rather than just putting them in a calendar). This was the most common complaint of the event organisation.</li><li>Nonetheless, the flexibility that the last minute organising gave to speakers</li><li>Some participants desired <strong>more Q&amp;As or Ask-Me-Anything type sessions</strong>. This may have been more useful, as it is also easier for speakers generally. However, it also may somewhat limit the range of ideas explored and that the participants are exposed to.</li><li><strong>More programming focused on research skills</strong>&nbsp;and methodologies. This is something we attempted, however, we feel we did this rather unsuccessfully. Partially this is because such research skills may be specific to the project (the skills needed for a technical AI Agent Foundation Project may be very different to those needed in a project analysing tail-risk treaties). Working out how to do appropriately tailored programme to research skills and methods will be a challenge, but would potentially be very useful to certain fellows. Moreover, there does generally seem to be a lack of training that can be provided to early career researchers on what good methodologies for x- risk research looks like.</li><li><strong>Sharing more!</strong>&nbsp;The initial workshops had some people from the GCR community in Latin America and from ILINA join, and some of the later programming had participants from CHERI and XLab join. The quality of these sessions seemed no worse when more people joined. Given how valuable they were, and given how many sessions ERA managed to get (35 over 8 weeks), it seems sharing these workshops more may have created more value for others in the x-risk space as well, whilst keeping the same value for the ERA fellows.</li><li><strong>More networking events</strong>. Networking and socialising with others in the X-Risk space can be difficult, and is a key element that ERA brings by bringing together 24&nbsp;researchers together. We had intended to organise specific networking events with other x-risk researchers, but this broadly failed to materialise. Partially, this is due to the fellowship being over the summer, particularly August, which makes this harder.&nbsp;However, the networking fellows had with external people e.g. through their mentors or with speakers seemed very valuable, so more of this may be useful. Making general networking events more tailored to researchers interests may be challenging, and the model of visiting other spaces (e.g. the Trajan visit) may be more fruitful. One potentially good opportunity for networking and sharing which was limited was external people attending the research symposium.</li></ul><h1><strong>How replicable is all of this?</strong></h1><p>It is hard to know how easy it will be to replicate the culture. Active culture forming efforts, including programming, clearly can help, however, many other factors, including simply who the fellows (and research managers) were, contributed to such a truth-seeking culture where diverse opinions are encouraged. Setting the tone for this early, as the initial workshops did, would certainly be important in the future; whether it would be a workshop, or more spread out over the first few weeks, remains to be seen.</p><p>Organising so many events was only possible due to the generosity of time of all our speakers, and the more fellowships are run, the fewer time speakers will likely have to talk. Nonetheless, many x-risk researchers seem keen to communicate with promising young researchers, and so it seems organising so many events in the future may be possible. Whilst the diversity of speakers seemed noticeably larger than previous years of ERA (then CERI), this seems to be the fact we reached out to a greater diversity of speakers from our networks. Certainly, having strong networks in different areas of x-risk made it easier to reach out to people.</p><p>Many of the events were remote, and so could be organised with essentially zero cost. As such, it may be possible to make similar quality events much more accessible to a much broader audience of people interested in existential risk. Whilst it is questionable that participants would gain the same value outside of the fellowship context where conversations and ideas were able to be fostered (although remote fellows did seem to gain a lot from events), this may be a high impact activity to continue and broaden to a much larger audience.</p><h1><strong>Credits</strong></h1><p><img style=\"width:133.73px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uSKQLstvoxHKtWkrg/mgabvzvmmj40bxabze8f\" alt=\"\"></p><p><i>This post was written by Gideon Futerman and Nandini Shiralkar, part of the Existential Risk Alliance (ERA) team, a fiscally sponsored project of Rethink Priorities.

The scenarios can be organized around any one of three potential pillars: Uncertainty-driven scenarios allow for versatile and flexible decision-making (utilizing a 2x2, or n x n matrix format), goal-driven scenarios are centered on a defined vision, acting as a beacon for future strategic moves, and risk-driven scenarios are tailored to anticipate and prepare for known risks, ensuring organizational resilience.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border-style:solid;text-align:center;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</th><th style=\"border-style:solid;text-align:center;vertical-align:top\"><h3><strong>Uncertainty-driven Scenarios</strong></h3></th><th style=\"border-style:solid;text-align:center;vertical-align:top\"><h3><strong>Goal-driven Scenarios</strong></h3></th><th style=\"border-style:solid;text-align:center;vertical-align:top\"><h3><strong>Risk-driven Scenarios</strong></h3></th></tr><tr><th style=\"border-style:solid;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;width:150px\"><h3><strong>Nature and Focus</strong></h3></th><th style=\"border-style:solid;vertical-align:top\">Wide-ranging and exploratory, focusing on diverse outcomes stemming from a broad spectrum of uncertainties.</th><th style=\"border-style:solid;vertical-align:top\">Highly strategic and focused on a specific end-goal, serve the purpose of detailing pathways toward a desired future.</th><th style=\"border-style:solid;vertical-align:top\">Targeted to focus on known risks and the organization's resilience against them.</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;width:150px\"><h3><strong>Types of Uncertainty</strong></h3></td><td style=\"border-style:solid;vertical-align:top\">Best for addressing complex and interdependent uncertainties that could lead to a variety of futures.</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;vertical-align:top\">Best for situations with uncertainty about how to reach a desired and defined future state.</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;vertical-align:top\">Best for situations with uncertainty around known risks and their potential impacts on the organization.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;width:150px\"><h3><strong>Process &amp; Expertise</strong></h3></td><td style=\"border-style:solid;vertical-align:top\">The process involves identifying key uncertainties, constructing a scenario matrix, and interpreting the outcomes.

For example, a 2x2 matrix could be set up with the economy on one axis (ranging from strong to weak) and the environment on the other (ranging from stable to volatile). Four scenarios would then be generated: strong economy-stable environment, weak economy-stable environment, strong economy-volatile environment, and weak economy-volatile environment. The aim of this approach is to create a breadth of potential futures that cover a wide spectrum of possibilities, thereby preparing the organization or decision-maker for a diverse range of outcomes.</p><h2><i>Goal-driven Scenarios: Move toward a clearly defined vision</i></h2><p>Unlike uncertainty-driven scenarios, goal-driven scenarios start with a clear vision or end goal in mind. This approach backcasts from a desired future to the present, plotting a course that bridges the gap between the current reality and the envisioned future. Goal-driven scenarios make sense when the relevant stakeholders have already defined where they want the organization to go, and have some idea of the steps needed to get there. It's beneficial in terms of building commitment and understanding of the goal across an organization, and is particularly useful for situations where there's a high level of agreement about the preferred future, and the challenge lies in defining how to achieve it.</p><h2><i>Risk-driven Scenarios: Ensure robustness against known risks</i></h2><p>Risk-driven scenarios focus on ensuring robustness and resilience against known or identified risks. They model the impacts of specific risks and how they can be mitigated or managed. This type of scenario planning requires the identification of key risks, understanding their potential impacts, and then developing scenarios that test different response strategies. The primary objective is to stress-test strategies against these risks to ensure resilience. It provides an in-depth understanding of specific threats, assists in the preparation for potential disruptions, and allows for proactive risk management.</p><h2>Quantitative Capture of Mental Models in Scenario Construction</h2><p>A vital part of scenario construction lies in the understanding and translation of mental models into quantifiable entities. Mental models, representing individual or collective understanding and interpretation of how the world works, serve as the foundation upon which scenarios are built. These models help identify key variables, the relationships among them, and their potential future states, providing a basis for the narrative of the scenario. When these mental models are captured quantitatively, they become computationally tractable objects, lending themselves to precise and consistent analysis and supporting more accurate decision-making and future learning. The process of capturing mental models can be achieved through techniques such as Bayesian networks, system dynamics, or agent-based modeling, which can represent complex interdependencies and uncertainties.</p><p>By facilitating the capture of mental models into their quantified counterparts during scenario construction, we can integrate them into the QCI framework, allowing these models to evolve dynamically and be carried through each step of the overarching decision-making process.&nbsp;</p><h1>Getting Leverage: Identifying Driving Indicators</h1><p>The next stage involves Identifying Driving Indicators (DIs). These are factors that directly influence scenarios and are therefore crucial to our ability to track progress toward a given scenario or end state. A DI can be measurable or qualitative, as long as the group of experts can agree on its definition and value, allowing for its later integration into a resolution council process during the forecasting stage. Examples of quantitative DI\u2019s might be economic growth, or the number of Covid deaths in a given year, whereas qualitative DI\u2019s might be a leader\u2019s reputation within the international community, or public confidence in institutions. Through expert elicitation, DIs are matched with each scenario and ranked by their causal impact, creating a unique cluster of indicators that can identify each scenario, and guide the strategic planning process.<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;width:140px\"><h3><strong>Key Term</strong></h3></td><td style=\"background-color:#efefef;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center;vertical-align:top\"><h3><strong>Definition</strong></h3></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;width:140px\"><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Driving Indicator (DI)</strong></h3></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">A Driving Indicator is a variable or factor that significantly influences the unfolding of a scenario within a framework of collective intelligence. These indicators are vital for understanding and predicting changes in specific situations or scenarios. They can be quantitative (e.g., economic growth, number of Covid deaths in a given year) or qualitative (e.g., a leader\u2019s reputation within the international community, public confidence in institutions) and are chosen for their causal impact and relationship with the outcomes of interest.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;width:140px\"><h3><strong>Forecast Resolution Council</strong></h3><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">A Forecast Resolution Council refers to a group of experts or representatives assigned to agree upon and establish the interpretation and implications of Driving Indicators (or in some cases, Forecasting Variables \u2013 see below). They calibrate their understanding of each DI to ensure consistent interpretation across the team. Resolution Councils are also responsible for determining when and how an event (like a forecasted scenario) is considered to have occurred, based on agreed-upon indicators and metrics, when the Resolution Mechanism for a given forecast is complex.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;width:140px\"><h3><strong>Forecast Resolution Mechanism</strong></h3></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">A Forecast Resolution Mechanism is a systematic method or process used to resolve the outcomes of forecasts, typically reliant on a single, specified data source or index. A simple resolution mechanism cleanly defines the metrics or states of the future that constitute a resolution of the forecast (i.e., whether the predicted event occurred or not), as well as the procedural steps to assess the actual outcome against the forecast. In situations where the resolution mechanism is complex, a Resolution Council. An agreed-upon resolution mechanism is then used by the Forecast Resolution Council to ensure consistency and objectivity in determining the accuracy of forecasts.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Ensuring Computability: Definition of Forecastable Variables and Temporal and Spatial Boundaries</h1><p>In the next stage of the Quantified Collective Intelligence framework, we engage in the critical task of transmuting Driving Indicators (DIs) into Forecastable Variables (FVs). This transformation aims to distill the essence of DIs, i.e., the core elements that significantly contribute to their impact on the given scenarios. The objective is to capture the most relevant and influential aspects of DIs, while at the same time making them amenable to systematic forecasting.</p><p>A Forecasting Variable is a key concept in the realm of decision-making and future-planning. This component can be delineated as a quantifiable metric or a definable future state that can be quantified, and therefore predicted. Examples of Forecasting Variables are diverse and context-dependent, ranging from the unemployment rate in a specific country, to changes in the technology landscape, such as the launch of a consumer-grade augmented reality (AR) device in the US market.</p><p>In order to transform these variables into actionable forecasting questions, they need a temporal context or a \u201cforecast horizon\". A forecast horizon refers to the specific timeframe within which the prediction is expected to transpire. FVs also require spatial delineation \u2013 is the context local, national, global? Defining the boundaries of a prediction is pivotal because the same variable can lead to a myriad of distinct forecasting questions when different horizons and geographies are applied.</p><p>For instance, consider the Driving Indicator, \u201cWidespread Penetration of Zero Emissions Vehicles.\u201d To fully capture what\u2019s important about this DI, you\u2019d want to consider a range of potential Forecasting Variables, likely using SME expertise to hone in on potential tipping points in the technology, market, and regulatory environments. One specific FV might be: \"Number of electric cars sold\", which you could later use to answer questions like, \u201cWhen will sales to consumers of zero emissions vehicles exceed the sales of vehicles with combustion engines in China?\u201d When a forecast horizon is applied, this FV can be utilized as the basis for various forecasting questions that help to map the landscape, such as \"How many electric cars will be sold in China by December 31, 2025?,\u201d \"What will be the cumulative global sales of electric cars in the year 2025?\" or \"By which month in 2025 will electric car sales in China cross the 1 million mark?\"</p><p>Similarly,consider the variable \"Growth of the artificial intelligence market\". This could lead to forecasting questions like \"What will the size of the AI market be at the end of Q2 2025?\", \"What will be the year-over-year growth rate of the AI market in 2025?\" or \"By which year will the global AI market reach $500 billion?\"</p><p>These examples highlight the critical role of the forecast horizon and spatial definition in shaping forecasting questions. Not only do they provide temporal and spatial boundaries for predictions, but they also drive the specificity and precision of the forecasted outcomes, aiding decision-makers in their strategic planning.</p><p>To accomplish the conversion of DIs to FVs, we integrate specialized knowledge from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs), together with the predictive acumen of professional forecasters. The blend of these two perspectives allows us to draw from a broad spectrum of understanding and expertise, creating a holistic representation of the DIs in the form of FVs.</p><p>A key facet of this process is reaching a consensus on the definition of the resolvable metrics that the FVs will encompass, as well as the resolution mechanisms that will be employed to track and assess these metrics. This is achieved through skilled facilitation, fostering dialogue and agreement among the experts.</p><p>Forecasting Variables, whether they're quantifiable metrics or discernable future states, are central to the process of decision-making and strategic planning. They form the crux of any forecasting exercise, enabling the conversion of Driving Indicators (DIs) into pragmatic, forecastable entities that can be effectively analyzed and predicted.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#efefef;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;width:170px\"><h3><strong>Goal</strong></h3></td><td style=\"background-color:#efefef;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center;vertical-align:top\"><h3><strong>Method</strong></h3></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;width:170px\"><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Identify Factors Relevant to DIs</strong></h3></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Each Driving Indicator will be influenced by a number of events that could potentially occur in the world. For example, a country\u2019s economic growth will be impacted by a wide variety of factors, such as inflation, trade relationships, consumer confidence, and geopolitical events. Defining Forecasting Variables for these factors can provide a clearer understanding of the reasons for changes in the DIs and identify the key risks and outcomes that influence the DI.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;width:170px\"><h3><strong>Create a Shared Understanding</strong></h3></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Forecasts are most useful when the differences in probabilities stem from the mental models, biases, and assumptions each forecaster holds. To be able to compare predictions, forecasters must have a shared understanding of what they\u2019re predicting. Without a shared understanding, additional variability would be introduced into the predictions due to varying interpretations of the outcome of interest. A shared understanding is accomplished by specifying metrics and resolution mechanisms for the Forecasting Variable that are clearly defined and which limit the possible range of interpretations.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;width:170px\"><h3><strong>Determine Relevant Forecast Horizons</strong></h3></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Identifying appropriate forecast horizons is a critical step. An event which occurs one year from now will impact a DI differently than if it were to happen five years from now. Using the judgment of SMEs and professional forecasters, appropriate forecast horizons can be selected to ensure that the resulting probabilistic predictions are well-suited to inform our understanding of the DIs and scenarios.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;width:170px\"><h3><strong>Establish Appropriate Forecast Spatial Boundaries&nbsp;</strong></h3></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Determining the suitable spatial boundaries for a forecast is an equally crucial step in the process.

The regional economic and sociopolitical dynamics, technological advancements, and cultural aspects could all influence the unfolding of the scenario, and therefore the applicability of forecasts in the decision-making process. Leveraging the insights of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and professional forecasters, appropriate spatial boundaries should be defined.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Amplifying Interpretability: Designing A Concept Diagram</h1><p>The creation of a Concept Diagram is a central task in the Amplifying Interpretability stage of our methodology.

This step of the framework seeks to unpack the multifaceted mechanisms within the system being studied, and expand our understanding of the interplay among its various components. A Mechanistic Mapping exercise is not always needed, but sometimes recommended depending on the needs of the project.&nbsp;</p><p>This exploration begins with the process of expert elicitation, involving the input and judgment of subject matter experts. These experts are asked to identify relevant and impactful pairwise associations between the DIs and FVs. The significance of these associations is ranked, effectively establishing a hierarchy of interactions based on their perceived impact on the system's dynamics.</p><p>Following this identification and ranking process, we engage in conditional forecasting rounds. These rounds employ the forecastable variables as conditions and evaluate how changes in these conditions affect the driving indicators and ultimately the scenarios in question. This approach further refines our understanding of the system's dynamics and brings into focus the mechanisms that underlie the relationships between key components of the system.</p><p>The insights derived from the Mechanistic Mapping process provide decision-makers with a nuanced understanding of the system's dynamics and the potential repercussions of various potential future events.

This approach encourages the emergence of a unique, combined forecasting power, capitalizing on the specialized insights of experts from diverse backgrounds and areas of expertise. This collaborative forecasting process bridges the gap between academic theory and practical application, offering a rich foundation of theory-based and experiential insights.</p><p>The first phase of this collaborative forecasting process employs an abbreviated implementation of the Delphi technique, a structured expert elicitation process originally developed by RAND Corporation as a systematic, interactive forecasting method. Each round of the Delphi process begins with individual forecasting, during which each participant uses their expert knowledge to make a prediction based on the provided information. This forecasting stage is accompanied by each individual documenting an explanation of the reasoning behind their prediction, encouraging transparency and enabling a deeper understanding of the diverse perspectives present.</p><p>Upon completion of the individual forecasting stage, we move on to structured small group discussions. These discussions allow the participants to compare, challenge, and refine their forecasts in light of the views presented by others. The results of these discussions are aggregated into a single collective forecast. This method not only harnesses the power of collective intelligence but also serves to balance potential individual biases, contributing to the overall robustness and reliability of the forecast. By integrating these diverse expert inputs, the collective forecasting process creates a refined, comprehensive, and nuanced forecast that can more accurately inform strategic decision-making.</p><p>Asynchronous forecasting may be undertaken during this stage of the process by Pro Forecasters, if required.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#efefef;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;width:150px\"><h3><strong>Concept</strong></h3></td><td style=\"background-color:#efefef;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center;vertical-align:top\"><h3><strong>Description</strong></h3></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;width:150px\"><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Metaculus Pro Forecasters</strong></h3></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Metaculus recruits Pro Forecasters who have demonstrated excellent forecasting ability and who have a history of clearly describing their rationales.

The process concludes with participants updating their forecasts to reflect changes in their understanding that arose from the discussion.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;width:150px\"><h3><strong>Aggregating Forecasts</strong></h3></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Aggregation of forecasts is key to producing the most accurate predictions. Evidence suggests that aggregated predictions are more accurate than individual predictions on average, due to the counteraction of biases within individual predictions and inclusion of a broader base of knowledge. Aggregation unlocks the \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d and ensures more robust predictions.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h1><br><br>Preparing for Action: Eliciting Policy Proposals</h1><p>As we navigate towards the strategic application of the insights gained so far, this next phase of the process sets the groundwork for action, directing the gathered intelligence towards the pragmatic goal of influencing policy-making and strategic decision-making processes within the organization.</p><p>The first step is comprehensively mapping the available actions or policy levers. These levers represent the means by which the organization can exert influence over the Forecastable Variables, and subsequently, the Driving Indicators, and ultimately, the end-state scenarios. Each policy lever should be carefully identified, considering the unique context and capabilities of the organization, its sphere of influence, resources, and position. A list of potential actions should be enumerated, with support from both internal and external experts. These actions encapsulate the practical steps the organization can take to make progress toward their goals, protect against identified risks, or become more resilient.</p><p>Upon the delineation of potential actions, the expertise of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) is again leveraged to assess the expected impact and utility of each action. SMEs provide their expert judgment to rank the potential actions, indicating the degree to which they believe each action will influence the desired outcomes. This step provides a preliminary view of the potential effectiveness of each action, assisting in the prioritization of strategies that have the most promising potential to yield desired results.</p><p>In this way, the process of eliciting policy proposals not only structures and organizes potential actions, but also provides a preliminary assessment of their likely effectiveness. This process aligns the decision-making process with the collective intelligence gathered, ensuring that strategic decisions are informed by expert analysis.</p><h1>Grist for Decision-Making: Causal Forecasting</h1><p>The process culminates with causal forecasting, where the proposed actions are evaluated in terms of their potential impact on Driving Indicators (DIs) and thus on the likely unfolding of the various scenarios. This critical phase leverages the power of forecasting, and crucially of proven, calibrated forecasters, to derive actionable insights which serve as the foundation for informed decision-making.</p><p>Causal forecasting involves producing predictions on the impact of specific actions, while meticulously controlling for potential confounding variables. Confounding variables, if not accounted for, can distort the true relationship between the implemented actions and their impact on DIs. By controlling these variables, a more accurate depiction of the causal relationships can be obtained.</p><p>Under this procedure, each proposed action is subject to a conditional forecast. This implies that the effect of each action on the DIs is measured under the condition that all other variables are held constant. The result is a clearer picture of the potential outcomes and their probabilities, enabling the organization to better understand the expected ramifications of each strategic move.</p><p>Here are two examples of causal forecasting questions within the adoption of zero-emission vehicles context:</p><ol><li>\"Assuming that government subsidies for zero-emission vehicles remain constant, how would a 10% reduction in the cost of electric vehicle (EV) battery production affect the market share of zero-emission vehicles in the U.S. by 2030?\"</li></ol><p>This question examines the causal relationship between the cost of EV battery production (a significant factor in the overall cost of zero-emission vehicles) and the adoption rate of these vehicles. In order to make it a causal forecasting question, forecasters would hold the influence of government subsidies (and potentially other variables) constant, in order to isolate the effect of battery cost reduction.</p><p>2. \"If the number of EV charging stations in the U.S. were to double by 2025, what effect would this have on the percentage of new car sales that are zero-emission vehicles in 2030, assuming no significant changes in the price of gasoline?\"</p><p>This question aims to forecast the impact of the availability of EV charging infrastructure on the adoption of zero-emission vehicles. It assumes that the price of gasoline, another potential influential factor, remains constant.</p><p>Both questions illustrate the concept of causal forecasting: they are designed to forecast the impact of changes in one variable (cost of battery production or number of charging stations), assuming that other potentially influential variables are held constant.</p><p>Causal forecasting serves as the engine that transforms collective intelligence and nuanced forecasting into actionable, insightful directives. This mechanism not only integrates the valuable insights gathered throughout the process but also aligns them with organizational goals, facilitating informed, strategic decision-making that is firmly grounded in expert knowledge and quantified projections. It is only made possible and effective when it is incorporated in a larger framework of quantifying collective intelligence, which ensures that the right questions are being asked, the most important actions considered, and the relevant scenarios are underpinning the entire process.</p><h1>In Conclusion</h1><p>The Quantified Collective Intelligence approach signifies a major advancement in integrating forecasting into strategic decision-making. It harmoniously merges diverse elements such as expert wisdom, analytical models, and illustrative diagrams to formulate a methodology that is not just robust in its predictive accuracy, but also agile in its adaptability to dynamic scenarios and transparent in its underlying mechanisms.</p><p>The strength of this approach lies in its versatility. It utilizes structured scenario development to cover a broad spectrum of possibilities, while the identification of Driving Indicators anchors these scenarios in reality. The transformation of these Indicators into Forecastable Variables establishes a concrete basis for prediction, further supported by the visual elucidation provided by Concept Diagrams and Mechanistic Mapping. The combination of expert and crowd-sourced forecasting creates a rich tapestry of insights, which, when subjected to the rigors of causal forecasting, results in highly actionable information.</p><p>In conclusion, the Quantified Collective Intelligence methodology offers a structured yet flexible framework for navigating an uncertain future. It synergistically brings together diverse elements of forecasting and scenario planning, underpinned by expert knowledge and participatory engagement. This comprehensive approach lends itself to a broad array of contexts, making it a versatile tool for organizations seeking to strategically leverage collective intelligence for decision-making in an increasingly complex and uncertain world.</p><p><strong>Acknowledgements</strong><br><br>Huge thanks to my teammate at Metaculus, Ryan Beck, for his contributions to the forecasting sections of this whitepaper, and to Ramsay Brown for his helpful feedback and encouragement.<br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Gaia Dempsey"}}, {"_id": "H6hxTrgFpb3mzMPfz", "title": "Weighing Animal Worth", "postedAt": "2023-09-28T13:49:10.141Z", "htmlBody": "<p>It's common for people who approach helping animals from a quantitative direction to need some concept of \"<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-weight\">moral weights</a>\" so they can prioritize. If you can avert one year of suffering for a chicken or ten for shrimp which should you choose? Now, moral weight is not the only consideration with questions like this, since typically the suffering involved will also be quite different, but it's still an important factor.</p><p>One of the more thorough investigations here is Rethink Priorities' <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw\">moral weights series</a>. It's really interesting work and I'd recommend reading it! Here's a selection from their bottom-line point estimates comparing animals to humans:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Humans</td><td>1 (by definition)</td></tr><tr><td>Chickens</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Carp</td><td>11</td></tr><tr><td>Bees</td><td>14</td></tr><tr><td>Shrimp</td><td>32</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>If you find these surprisingly low, you're not alone: that giving a year of happy life to twelve carp might be more valuable than giving one to a human is for most people a very unintuitive claim. The authors have a good post on this, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw/p/KXSBb2zgkLE6gnn3K\">Don't Balk at Animal-friendly Results</a>, that discusses how the assumptions behind their project make this kind of result pretty likely and argues against putting much stock in our potentially quite biased initial intuitions.</p><p>What concerns me is that I suspect people rarely get deeply interested in the moral weight of animals unless they come in with an unusually high initial intuitive view. Someone who thinks humans matter far more than animals and wants to devote their career to making the world better is much more likely to choose a career focused on people, like reducing poverty or global catastrophic risk. Even if someone came into the field with, say, the median initial view on how to weigh humans vs animals I would expect working as a junior person in a community of people who value animals highly would exert a large influence in that direction regardless of what the underlying truth. If you somehow could convince a research group, not selected for caring a lot about animals, to pursue this question in isolation, I'd predict they'd end up with far less animal-friendly results.</p><p>When using the moral weights of animals to decide between various animal-focused interventions this is not a major concern: the donors, charity evaluators, and moral weights researchers are coming from a similar perspective. Where I see a larger problem, however, is in broader cause prioritization, such as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HDFxQwMwPp275J87r/\">Net Global Welfare May Be Negative and Declining</a>. The post weighs the increasing welfare of humanity over time against the increasing suffering of livestock, and concludes that things are likely bad and getting worse. If you ran the same analysis with different inputs, such as what I'd expect you'd get from my hypothetical research group above, however, you'd instead conclude the opposite: global welfare is likely positive and increasing.</p><p>For example, if that sort of process ended up with moral weights that were 3x lower for animals relative to humans we would see approximately flat global welfare, while if they were 10x lower we'd see increasing global welfare:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/H6hxTrgFpb3mzMPfz/wuewgvpqvueengkwwknd\" alt=\"welfare chart\"></p><p><i>See</i> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KeYtZseIV18RWv6fySCKMbaSVW89BKuvppxQaz7mhQY/edit#gid=0\"><i>sheet</i></a> <i>to try your own numbers; original chart digitized with via</i> <a href=\"https://www.graphreader.com/\"><i>graphreader.com</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>Note that both 3x and 10x are quite small compared to the uncertainty involved in coming up with these numbers: in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WfeWN2X4k8w8nTeaS/theories-of-welfare-and-welfare-range-estimates\">different post</a> the Rethink authors give 3x (and maybe as high as 10x) just for the likely impact of using objective list theory instead of hedonism, which is only one of many choices involved in estimating moral weights.</p><p>I think the overall project of figuring out how to compare humans and animals is a really important one with serious implications for what people should work on, but I'm skeptical of, and put very little weight on, the conclusions so far.</p>", "user": {"username": "Jeff_Kaufman"}}, {"_id": "PEqDdXKKjDJCDLxfD", "title": "[Linkpost] John Wesley's surprisingly EA-aligned views on the use of money", "postedAt": "2023-09-28T16:09:44.898Z", "htmlBody": "<p>In this post in the <a href=\"https://christandcounterfactuals.substack.com/\">EA for Christians community blog</a>, Dominic Roser reflects on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wesley\">John Wesley's</a> surprisingly EA-aligned views on the use of money.

His words are passionate, radical, simple, and practical. Upon reading it again, I even had wet eyes. The core message of Wesley\u2019s sermon is:&nbsp;<strong>Earn all you can, Save all you can, Give all you can</strong>. This sermon might possibly be the most EA kind of thing that has been written before Peter Singer came along.</p><p>The sermon is posted below (in an abridged version). The purpose of this blogpost is simply to put the sermon up for discussion. In case anyone would like to dig deeper: there is an accompanying and somewhat lengthy blog post <a href=\"https://eachdiscussion.wordpress.com/2017/03/01/john-wesley-the-use-of-money-22/\">here</a> which does the work of filtering out how exactly Wesley\u2019s sermon overlaps (or stands in tension with) Effective Altruism. It also quotes some touching facts on how Wesley himself put his words into practice.</p><hr><h2><strong>\u201cThe Use of Money\u201d by John Wesley</strong></h2><p><i>(Abridged and put into modern English by </i><a href=\"http://theconnexion.net/wp/?p=2873#axzz3hx1oO44C\"><i>Richard Hall</i></a><i>. The full-length version is </i><a href=\"http://www.umcmission.org/Find-Resources/John-Wesley-Sermons/Sermon-50-The-Use-of-Money\"><i>here</i></a><i>.)</i></p><p>\"I tell you, use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourself, so that when it is gone, you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings.\u201d (Luke 16:9)</p><p>The right use of money is of the utmost importance to the Christian, yet it is a subject given too little attention. Wealth has often been regarded by poets and philosophers as a source of evil and yet the fault lies, not with money, but with those who use it. Indeed, money should be regarded as a gift of God for the benefits that it brings in ordering the affairs of civilization and the opportunities it offers for doing good. In the hands of God\u2019s children, money is food for the hungry, clothing for the naked and shelter for the stranger. With money we can care for the widow and the fatherless, defend the oppressed, meet the need of those who are sick or in pain.</p><p>It is therefore most urgent that God\u2019s people know how to make use of their money for his glory. All the necessary instructions can be condensed into 3 simple rules:</p><p><strong>Gain all you can</strong></p><p><strong>Save all you can</strong></p><p><strong>Give all you can</strong></p><h3><strong>Gain all you can</strong></h3><p>With this first rule, we sound like children of the world, and it is our bounden duty to do this. There are, however, limits to this rule. We should not gain money at the expense of life or health. No sum of money, however large, should induce us to accept employment which would injure our bodies. Neither should we begin (or continue in) any business which deprives us of the food and sleep that we need. We may draw a distinction between businesses which are absolutely unhealthy, such as those that deal directly with dangerous materials, and those employments which would be harmful to those of a weak constitution. If our reason or experience shows that a job is unhealthy for us, then we should leave it as soon as possible even if this means that our income is reduced.</p><p>The rule is further limited by the necessity not to undertake any employment which might injure our minds. This includes the pursuit of any trade which is against the law of God or the law of the land. It is just as wrong to defraud the king of taxes as it is to steal from our fellow citizens. There are businesses which might be innocent in themselves but which, at least in England at this time require cheating, lying or other customs which are contrary to good conscience, to provide an adequate income. These, too, we should avoid. There are other trades which many may pursue with complete innocence but which you may not because of some peculiarity of your nature. For example, I am convinced that I could not study mathematics without losing my faith, yet many others pursue a lifetime study in that field without harm. Everyone must judge for themselves and refrain from whatever may harm their mind and soul.</p><p>What is true of ourselves is equally true of our neighbour. We should not \u201cgain all we can\u201d by causing injury to another, whether to his trade, his body or his soul. We should not sell our goods below their market price nor should we entice away, or receive, the workers\u2019 that a brother has need of. It is quite wrong to make a living from selling those things which would harm a neighbour\u2019s health and physicians should not deliberately prolong a patient\u2019s illness in order to improve his own income.</p><p>With these restrictions, it is every Christian\u2019s duty to observe this first rule: \u2018Gain all you can\u2019. Gain all you can by honest work with all diligence. Lose no time in silly diversions and do not put off until tomorrow what may be done today. Do nothing by halves; use all the common sense that God has given you and study continually that you may improve on those who have gone before you. Make the best of all that is in your hands.</p><h3><strong>Save all you can</strong></h3><p>This is the second rule. Money is a precious gift. It should not be wasted on trivialities. Do not spend money on luxury foods, but be content with simple things that your body needs. Ornaments too, whether of the body, house or garden are a waste and should be avoided. Do not spend in order to gratify your vanity or to gain the admiration of others. The more you feed your pride in this way, the more it will grow within you.</p><p>And why should you spoil your children in this way? Fine clothes and luxury are a snare to them as they are to you. Why would you want to provide them with more pride and vanity? They have enough already! If you have good reason to believe that they would waste your wealth then do not leave it to them. Do not tempt them in this way. I am amazed at those parents who think that they can never leave their children enough. Have they no fear of hell? If there is only one child in the family who knows the value of money and there is a fortune to be inherited, then it is that one who should receive the bulk of it. If no child can be trusted in this way then it is the Christian\u2019s duty to leave them only what will keep them from being in need. The rest should be distributed in order to bring glory to God.</p><h3><strong>Give all you can</strong></h3><p>Observing the first two rules is far from enough. Storing away money without using it is to throw it away. You might just as well cast your money into the sea as keep it in the bank. Having gained and saved all you can, then give all you can.</p><p>Why is this? You do not own the wealth that you have. It has been entrusted to you for a short while by the God who brought you into being. All belongs to him. Your wealth is to be used for him as a holy sacrifice, made acceptable through Jesus Christ.</p><p>If you wish to be a good steward of that which God has given to you on loan the rules are simple enough. First provide sufficient food and clothing for yourself and your household. If there is a surplus after this is done, then use what remains for the good of your Christian brothers and sisters. If there is still a surplus, then do good to all people, as you have the opportunity. If at any time you have a doubt about any particular expenditure, ask yourself honestly:</p><p>Will I be acting, not as an owner, but as a steward of the Lord\u2019s goods?</p><p>Am I acting in obedience to the word of God?</p><p>Is this expense a sacrifice to God through Jesus Christ?</p><p>Do I believe that this expense will bring reward at the day of resurrection?</p><p>If you are still in doubt, put these questions as statements to God in prayer: \u201cLord, you see that I am going to spend this money on \u2026 and you know that I am acting as your trusted steward according to your design.\u201d If you can make this prayer with a good conscience then you will know that your expense is right and good.</p><p>These, then, are the simple rules for the Christian use of money. Gain all you can, without bringing harm to yourself or neighbour. Save all you can by avoiding waste and unnecessary luxuries. Finally, give all you can. Do not limit yourself to a proportion. Do not give God a tenth or even half what he already owns, but give all that is his by using your wealth to preserve yourself and family, the Church of God and the rest of humanity. In this way you will be able to give a good account of your stewardship when the Lord comes with all his saints.</p><p>I plead with you in the name of the Lord Jesus, no more delay! Whatever task is before you, do it with all your strength. No more waste or luxury or envy. Use whatever God has loaned to you to do good to your fellow Christians and to all people. Give all that you have, as well as all that you are, to him who did not even withhold his own Son for your sake.</p><h1>John Wesley: The Use of Money (Part 2)</h1><p>John Wesley preached an amazing sermon on \u201cThe Use of Money\u201d. I posted the sermon <a href=\"https://christandcounterfactuals.substack.com/p/john-wesley-the-use-of-money-1\">here</a>. In it, Wesley anticipates a lot of EA thinking 200 years ahead of time. Even the name of the first EA organization - Giving What We Can - corresponds almost literally to the sermon\u2019s slogan.</p><p>In case anyone would like to dig deeper: the below blogpost analyzes the sermon in detail and lists seven points of overlap (or, occasionally, tension) between Wesley and Effective Altruism. At the end of the post, I also add a quote which sheds some light on how Wesley put his words into practice.</p><h2>1. Money is a great tool</h2><p>Wesley is very annoyed about all the people who despise money. While he thinks that, unfortunately, money can be loved and used badly, he emphatically denies that this must be the case. To the contrary: Money can do great things. He speaks in glowing terms of its potential:</p><p>\u201cIn the hands of [God\u2019s] children, [money] is food for the hungry, drink for the thirsty, raiment for the naked: It gives to the traveller and the stranger where to lay his head. By it we may supply the place of an husband to the widow, and of a father to the fatherless. We may be a defence for the oppressed, a means of health to the sick, of ease to them that are in pain; it may be as eyes to the blind, as feet to the lame; yea, a lifter up from the gates of death!\u201d</p><p>When he decries luxury, he does so not only because it harms the soul of the rich. But also because luxury costs so much -- and the money used for buying luxury goods could be put to better use: \u201cCut off all this expense! Despise delicacy and variety\u201d.</p><h2>2. We should earn as much as we can</h2><p>Wesley doesn\u2019t just think it\u2019s permissible, or good, to earn a lot of money. He says that it is \u201cour bounden duty\u201d to do so.</p><p>Interestingly, he qualifies this in a similar way that some EAs qualify it: One shouldn\u2019t harm oneself in earning a lot. For example, one should sleep enough. The advice by <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a> also stresses that one should find one\u2019s work engaging and one should pay attention to avoid burning out.</p><p>However, it must be admitted that while Wesley says that one should not harm oneself by working too hard, some of his advice seems like a sure-thing recipe for burnout: \u201cEvery business will afford some employment sufficient for every day and every hour. That wherein you are placed, if you follow it in earnest, will leave you no leisure for silly, unprofitable diversions. You have always something better to do, something that will profit you, more or less.\u201d I have the impression that he is a bit overly puritan here. His radical views against enjoying any leisure might be particularly off the mark in today\u2019s time where the problem often is an over-working culture rather than sloth. (In contrast, his puritan radicalism against luxuries might be even more relevant today than it was in his days).</p><p>Wesley also diverges from EA when it comes to the limits on Earning to Give. He places much stricter constraints on the kinds of careers one may pursue than typical EAs do. These constraints are of a very deontological nature: we are not allowed to \"do evil that good may come\". He also says: \u201cfor to gain money we must not lose our souls\u201d. (One might question, though, whether his injunction against procuring money in harmful ways chimes well with the scripture on which his sermon is based).</p><h2>3. Aim at the best</h2><p>While Wesley doesn\u2019t use the expressions \u201ccost-effectiveness\u201d and \u201cmaximizing\u201d, his sermon is suffused with the mindset of aiming at the best rather than simply the good. Wesley highlights Jesus\u2019 words: \u201cThe children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light\u201d. The former \u201cmore steadily pursue their end\u201d. And the children of this world more often discuss the right use of money than Christians. Wesley exhorts us to use reason and be diligent in order to improve effectiveness: \u201cYou should be continually learning, from the experience of others, or from your own experience, reading, and reflection, to do everything you have to do better to-day than you did yesterday.\u201d We should be shrewd rather than randomly generous: \u201cWe ought to gain all we can gain, without buying gold too dear, without paying more for it than it is worth.\u201d</p><p>Notice how many times Wesley uses maximizing expressions: He says we should understand how to employ money \u201cto the greatest advantage\u201d. And: \u201cIt is therefore of the highest concern that all who fear God know how to employ [money]; that they be instructed how it may answer these glorious ends [such as helping the poor], and in the highest degree.\u201d He says: \u201cEmploy whatever God has entrusted you with, in doing good, all possible good, in every possible kind and degree\u201d. We should do our work \u201cas well as possible.\u201d</p><h2>4. Be radical</h2><p>Wesley is radical. He speaks out against the simple rule of giving 10%: \u201c\u2018Render unto God,\u2019 not a tenth, not a third, not half, but all that is God's, be it more or less\u201d. He is very skeptical of leaving a bequest for one\u2019s children: \u201cAnd why should you throw away money upon your children \u2026 Have pity upon them, and remove out of their way what you may easily foresee would increase their sins\u201d. He uses strong language throughout the sermon. Imagine a preacher using such language today!</p><p>His radicalness is accompanied by an awareness of the problem of \u201cdemandingness\u201d which also looms large in today\u2019s discussions of EA (i.e. the question whether a radical morality doesn\u2019t crush our spirits by demanding \u201ctoo much\u201d of us). He even says of himself with regard to his injunctions: \u201cWhether I would do it or no, I know what I ought to do\u201d (in other words, he is aware that he might not live up to his high standards). And at one point, he exclaims: \u201cHard saying! who can hear it?\u201d</p><h2>5. Impartiality</h2><p>EA promotes impartiality between humans here &amp; there, now &amp; later, humans &amp; animals, etc. In contrast, Wesley has a \u201cconcentric circle\u201d model for apportioning responsibility: First, we must look after ourselves, then after our household, then after fellow Christians, and lastly after all of humankind. However, this partiality diverges much less from EA than it might seem at first sight. Wesley here only speaks of basic needs: \u201cThings needful for yourself; food to eat, raiment to put on, whatever nature moderately requires for preserving the body in health and strength.\u201d As soon as my own needs are met, it is time for my household\u2019s needs to be met, and as soon as these are met, it is the turn of the needs of the \u201chousehold of faith\u201d, and as soon as these are met, the needs of all humans must be met. In my view, this prioritization of the near &amp; dear is not repugnant since Wesley does not suggest to give priority to increasing the welfare of the near &amp; dear even beyond their basic needs unless the basic needs of strangers are met first. If we take his ideas seriously, we should first meet the basic needs of the poor in distant countries before considering buying nice clothes for ourselves or our children.</p><h2>6. Advice on how much to give</h2><p>In his <a href=\"http://effectivegood.com/how-much-should-christians-give/\">blogpost</a> [broken link], David Wohlever asked how much of our money we ought to keep and how much we ought to give away. This is a challenging question. Wesley isn\u2019t hesitant and claims that there is an easy way to answer:</p><p><i>\u201cIf, then, a doubt should at any time arise in your mind concerning what you are going to expend, either on yourself or any part of your family, you have an easy way to remove it. Calmly and seriously inquire,</i></p><p><i>\"(1.) In expending this, am I acting according to my character? Am I acting herein, not as a proprietor, but as a steward of my Lord's goods? (2.) Am I doing this in obedience to his Word? In what Scripture does he require me so to do? (3.) Can I offer up this action, this expense, as a sacrifice to God through Jesus Christ? (4.) Have I reason to believe that for this very work I shall have a reward at the resurrection of the just?\"</i></p><p><i>You will seldom need anything more to remove any doubt which arises on this head; but by this four-fold consideration you will receive clear light as to the way wherein you should go.</i></p><p><i>If any doubt still remain, you may farther examine yourself by prayer according to those heads of inquiry. Try whether you can say to the Searcher of hearts, your conscience not condemning you,</i></p><p><i>\"Lord, thou seest I am going to expend this sum on that food, apparel, furniture. And thou knowest, I act herein with a single eye as a steward of thy goods, expending this portion of them thus in pursuance of the design thou hadst in entrusting me with them. Thou knowest I do this in obedience to the Lord, as thou commandest, and because thou commandest it. Let this, I beseech thee, be an holy sacrifice, acceptable through Jesus Christ! And give me a witness in myself that for this labour of love I shall have a recompense when thou rewardest every man according to his works.\"</i></p><p><i>Now if your conscience bear you witness in the Holy Ghost that this prayer is well-pleasing to God, then have you no reason to doubt but that expense is right and good, and such as will never make you ashamed.\u201d</i></p><p>Thus, he resists giving a one-size-fits-all-principle but rather instructs us to examine our character and the situation in light of certain questions and in prayer.</p><h2>7. Reasons for giving</h2><p>How does Wesley argue for our duty to give away money generously? His reasons diverge from standard secular EA reasoning. For one, Wesley says that everything belongs to God: \u201cHe placed you here not as a proprietor, but a steward\u201d. A second point is that God himself gave all he had for us: \u201cGive all ye have, as well as all ye are, a spiritual sacrifice to Him who withheld not from you his Son, his only Son\u201d. A third point appears in the (theologically very challenging, I think) scripture on which the sermon is based and also in the closing sentence of the sermon: By giving all you have you are \"laying up in store for yourselves a good foundation against the time to come, that ye may attain eternal life!\"</p><h2>Did Wesley put his words into practice?</h2><p>The topic of money was obviously important to Wesley: He preached at least 27 times on this passage of scripture (Luke 19:9) over the course of 18 years. And he brought up the topic in many other sermons and texts (as is claimed <a href=\"http://www.emk-schweiz.ch/uploads/media/john_wesley_der_rechte_gebrauch_des_geldes.pdf\">here</a>). But Wesley not only preached but also practised the lifestyle that he advocated. <a href=\"http://www.christianitytoday.com/pastors/1987/winter/87l1027.html\">The following account</a> is intriguing:</p><p>\u201cWhile at Oxford, an incident changed [Wesley\u2019s] perspective on money. He had just finished paying for some pictures for his room when one of the chambermaids came to his door. It was a cold winter day, and he noticed that she had nothing to protect her except a thin linen gown. He reached into his pocket to give her some money to buy a coat but found he had too little left. Immediately the thought struck him that the Lord was not pleased with the way he had spent his money. He asked himself, Will thy Master say, \"Well done, good and faithful steward\"? Thou hast adorned thy walls with the money which might have screened this poor creature from the cold! O justice! O mercy! Are not these pictures the blood of this poor maid?</p><p>Perhaps as a result of this incident, in 1731 Wesley began to limit his expenses so that he would have more money to give to the poor. He records that one year his income was 30 pounds and his living expenses 28 pounds, so he had 2 pounds to give away. The next year his income doubled, but he still managed to live on 28 pounds, so he had 32 pounds to give to the poor. In the third year, his income jumped to 90 pounds. Instead of letting his expenses rise with his income, he kept them to 28 pounds and gave away 62 pounds. (...) Even when his income rose into the thousands of pounds sterling, he lived simply, and he quickly gave away his surplus money. One year his income was a little over 1400 pounds. He lived on 30 pounds and gave away nearly 1400 pounds. (\u2026)</p><p>[One] way Wesley limited expenses was by identifying with the needy. He had preached that Christians should consider themselves members of the poor, whom God had given them money to aid. So he lived and ate with the poor. Under Wesley's leadership, the London Methodists had established two homes for widows in the city. They were supported by offerings taken at the band meetings and the Lord's Supper. In 1748, nine widows, one blind woman, and two children lived there. With them lived John Wesley and any other Methodist preacher who happened to be in town. Wesley rejoiced to eat the same food at the same table, looking forward to the heavenly banquet all Christians will share.\u201d</p>", "user": {"username": "EA for Christians"}}, {"_id": "kkPJwjjfwrCfpwKLg", "title": "New FLI Podcast on tackling climate change", "postedAt": "2023-09-28T13:23:48.041Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This is a linkpost for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/podcast/johannes-ackva-on-managing-climate-change/\"><u>https://futureoflife.org/podcast/johannes-ackva-on-managing-climate-change/</u></a> and <a href=\"https://x.com/FLIxrisk/status/1704960893417586992?s=20\"><u>https://x.com/FLIxrisk/status/1704960893417586992?s=20</u></a></p><p>In this podcast, Gus Docker and I discuss a broad set of climate-related issues from a broadly effective altruist lens.

We believe many more people should consider a career in journalism (and expect to write a more detailed post on this in the near future).</p><p>Artificial intelligence is one of the key challenges facing humanity this century and journalists can lead the public debate here in important ways. As AI systems progress, they could pose a catastrophic risk to humanity. Researchers could lose control over advanced AI systems, malicious actors could weaponize this technology, and a deluge of persuasive misinformation could undermine democracy. Relative to their importance, these issues receive much less attention than they deserve.</p><p>The Tarbell Fellowship is creating a community of expert journalists that can focus the collective conversation on the most important risks from AI, drive engagement with specific policy proposals &amp; safety standards, and hold major AI labs accountable in the public arena.</p><h2>Track record</h2><p>The Tarbell Fellowship launched in 2023, selecting<a href=\"https://www.tarbellfellowship.org/2023-fellows\">&nbsp;<u>7 fellows</u></a> from a competitive pool of over 950 applications. 3 fellows are currently at<a href=\"https://time.com/\">&nbsp;<u>TIME</u></a>, one is at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.codastory.com/\"><u>Coda</u></a>, and another is freelancing with the<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/yasmin-rafiei\">&nbsp;<u>New Yorker</u></a>.

A lot of promises were made. A lot of enthusiasm surrounded EA future.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, the unexpected: my <i>main source of funding</i> collapsed. With its downfall, my life spiraled.

I've now sought treatment for this, but every day is a struggle. For years, I sidelined personal pursuits, including forming meaningful personal and romantic relationships outside the movement, dedicating myself to issues like the potential AI apocalypse and other matters that now seem distant and abstract, when compared to the day-to-day struggles of non-Anglo-American privileged and gifted youngsters. In prioritizing these concerns, I lost sight of the spontaneous, daily realities that give life its texture and meaning.</p><p>My experience has also left me <strong>deeply disillusioned with EA's principles and strategies</strong>. I've become nihilistic, doubting if the movement's approach to the world, as noble as it might seem, is genuinely grounded in reality. There's a detachment I've observed, where some of the most crucial elements of our shared human experience, like the importance of spontaneous everyday moments, seem to get lost.</p><p>In sharing this, my hope isn't to condemn or vilify the EA movement but to highlight the dangers of over-commitment and the risk of losing oneself in a cause.

Now the food tastes bad and fewer people are willing to sustain the sacrifice of being vegan.</li><li>People notice this and think \"if vegans are lying to us about how good the food is, are they also lying to us about the health impacts?\" Overall trust in vegans (and utilitarians) decreases.</li></ul><p>Despite thinking that it is the outcomes of actions that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism\">determine whether they are a good idea</a>, I don't think this kind of reasoning <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/effective-altruism-and-everyday-decisions\">about everyday things</a> is actually helpful. It's too easy to tie yourself in logical knots, making a decision that seems counterintuitive-but-correct, except if you spent longer thinking about it, or discussed it with others, you would have decided the other way.</p><p>We are human beings making hundreds of decisions a day, with limited ability to know the impacts of our actions, and a worryingly strong capacity for self-serving reasoning. A full unbiased weighing of the possibilities is, sure, the correct choice if you relax these constraints, but in our daily lives that's not an option we have.</p><p>Luckily, humans have lived for centuries under these constraints, and we've developed ideas of what is \"good\" that turn out to be a solid guide to typical situations.

I'm thankful we have all this learning on makes for harmonious societies distilled into our cultures to support us in our interactions.</p><p>On the other hand, I do think there is a very important place for this kind of reasoning: sometimes our normal ideas of \"good\" are seriously lacking. For example, they don't give us much guidance once scale is involved: a donation that helps a hundred people and one that equivalently helps a thousand people are both \"good\" from a commonsense perspective, even though I think it's pretty clearly ten times better to go with the second. Similarly, if you're trying to decide between working as a teacher in a poor school, therapist in a jail, a manager at a food pantry, or a firefighter in a disadvantaged community, common sense just says they're all \"good\" and leaves you there.</p><p>How do we reconcile this conflict, where carefully getting into the consequences of decisions can take a lot of time and risk strange errors, while never evaluating the outcomes of decisions risks having a much smaller positive effect on the world? I'd propose normally going for \"commonsense good\" and then in the most important cases going for \"creative good\".</p><p>The idea is, normally just do straightforwardly good things. Be cooperative, friendly, and considerate. Embrace the standard virtues. Don't stress about the global impacts or second-order altruistic effects of minor decisions. But also identify the very small fraction of your decisions which are likely to have the largest effects and put a lot of creative energy into doing the best you can. Questions like, what cause areas are most important, or what should I do with my time and/or money? On those decisions, make a serious effort to figure out what will have the best effects: read what other people have to say, talk to people who've made similar decisions, form your own views, consider writing up your conclusions, and stay open to evidence that you could be doing better.</p><p>For example, perhaps after a lot of thinking you decide that animals matter a lot more than most people seem to think they do, especially less-fuzzy ones like <a href=\"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/\">shrimp</a>, and that improving their situation is one of the most urgent ways to make the world better. You might decide to start donating to support animal organizations, or even switch careers to work on it full time. You might decide to stop eating animal products as a way to show how important this is and build the world you want to see.

The report is helpful to journalists looking to understand the basics of how the animal agriculture industry profits from animal suffering, as well as advocates interested in decreasing the power of this industry.</p><p>The findings include graphics about the chicken industry consolidation, hotspot regions for these industries, and a term sheet.</p><p><a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/industry-costs\"><u>https://faunalytics.org/industry-costs</u></a>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Key Findings</strong></h2><ol><li><strong>The fight against animal agriculture is an antitrust fight.&nbsp;</strong>Competition is low in the global animal agriculture industry, with a small number of giant companies that control most of it. Corporations like Tyson or JBS are highly \u201cvertically integrated\u201d: in addition to slaughtering billions of animals a year, they often own the mills that grind corn into feed, the genetics companies that breed fast-growing chickens, hatcheries where chicks are born, flocks comprising millions of birds, slaughterhouses, processing plants, and trucks that deliver products to stores. Integrating all of these stages under one giant corporation makes the production process cheaper and enables these companies to create staggering amounts of animal suffering. These megacorporations have also consolidated their markets by absorbing competitors or driving them out of business, producing a consumer landscape in which seemingly different brands\u2014Jimmy Dean, Hillshire Farm, Ball Park, Sara Lee, and more\u2014are actually all Tyson products. Other companies simply can\u2019t compete, leaving global giants like Tyson and JBS to dictate the rules and giving farmers little choice over which companies they work with.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The U.S., China, and Brazil are key to the chicken, fish, and egg industries.&nbsp;</strong>Not only are they global leaders in production, imports, and exports of animal products, they also literally feed the animal agriculture industry. As one example, Brazilian soybeans are used to feed Chinese fish that are ultimately eaten by U.S. consumers. An understanding of how the animal agriculture industry functions requires advocates to be familiar with the role these three countries play.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The aquaculture industry hasn\u2019t yet consolidated or standardized as much as the broiler chicken and egg industries have, but it will.&nbsp;</strong>Intensive aquaculture is relatively new and uses a wider variety of animals and production methods so it hasn\u2019t yet achieved the same level of efficiency as some other animal agriculture industries. However, this advancement will almost certainly happen in the coming years if nothing is done to stop it. With this intensification comes bigger, more concentrated operations, leading to even more animal suffering. Around the world, many governments consider aquaculture the future and are creating programs and initiatives to support its continued rise. Without intervention, aquaculture companies will consolidate, vertically integrate, and intensify their operations.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Governments have not only allowed but also encouraged animal agriculture to grow to this point.&nbsp;</strong>In the U.S., companies have benefited from indirect subsidies that lower the cost of animal feed, as well as a regulatory environment that has allowed megacorporations to emerge and have considerable influence over the policies that are supposed to regulate them. In Brazil and China, the governments have directly supported animal agriculture with money and programs to promote the growth of companies they favor.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Animal agriculture corporations' profits are sensitive to many risks.</strong>&nbsp;Despite their power, these corporations are subject to a number of risks. In the U.S., current regulations require the ones that are publicly traded to disclose these risks as potential threats to their business so we have some insight into them. Those potential threats include consumer demands for better animal welfare, strengthened environmental policies, having to increase employee wages, and the loss of companies that are major customers.</li><li><strong>The modern model of animal agriculture even hurts the farmers that work for it.&nbsp;</strong>Contract \u201cgrow-out\u201d farmers (who raise the chickens that the megacorporations own) must often take out massive loans to meet those companies\u2019 increasing demands. Even if they wanted to change industries, these farmers get trapped in debt and have little choice but to keep working for that industry. In the U.S. and Brazilian broiler chicken industries, a \u201ctournament system\u201d also pits these farmers against each other and lowers the pay for many. Some experts also fear that the rise of aquaculture could lead to further international exploitation of farmers.</li><li><strong>Animal feed is the biggest cost the animal agriculture industry has to cover.&nbsp;</strong>While this always tends to be true, it has become more extreme over time: Feed now often makes up two-thirds of the money corporations spend to make animal products. Feeding the animals is a necessity, but because it is so costly for them, companies are looking for ways to make animals grow larger or produce more eggs with smaller amounts of food. They also benefit from government policies that make feed ingredients cheap. However, just because feed is the industry\u2019s biggest expense doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s the only thing advocates should focus on. These companies constantly look for cost-saving measures in every aspect of their business, from animal housing to labor costs to slaughter methods. Welfare-focused reforms like cage-free and slower slaughter line speeds aim to help animals but also reduce the industry\u2019s profits. Higher wages for employees and tougher environmental regulations can do the same.&nbsp;</li></ol><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>As animal advocates know, mass&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/farm-animal-welfare-a-review-of-standard-practices-and-their-effects/\"><u>torture</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/global-animal-slaughter-statistics-charts-2022-update/\"><u>death</u></a> are hallmarks of the animal agriculture industry. Such immense suffering would not exist without a market for animal products, requiring both buyers and sellers. A growing body of research explores the demand side of this market, with factors like price, taste, health, convenience, and social norms driving consumers\u2019 purchases (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/going-veg-motivations-and-influences/\"><u>Faunalytics, 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/price-taste-and-convenience-competitive-plant-based-meat-would-not-currently-replace-meat\"><u>Rethink Priorities, 2023</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gfi.org/resource/plant-based-meat-eggs-and-dairy-state-of-the-industry-report/\"><u>Good Food Institute, 2023</u></a>). However, far less research has examined the supply side of the market. In order for customers to have animal products to purchase, there must be companies creating those products in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>The simplest way of understanding the horrors carried out in animal agriculture is through a consideration of the industry\u2019s profit motive. Like all businesses operating under global capitalism, the goal of the companies involved in the chicken, egg, and fish industries is to make money. By investigating the factors that shape profit-seeking actions by these industries, particularly the factors affecting their production costs, advocates can gain crucial knowledge about the industry they seek to change.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Research Team</strong></h2><p>The project\u2019s lead author was Zach Wulderk. Dr. Jo Anderson reviewed and oversaw the work. We would like to thank the Food System Research Fund and an anonymous donor for their generous support of this research. We would also like to thank Bruno Link, who provided invaluable support.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2><h3><strong>Animal Agriculture Is An International Industry</strong></h3><p>The economy is global. This is especially true of most aspects of animal agriculture. Rather than small family farms feeding local communities across the world, the reality is that a small number of multinational megacorporations now dominate nearly every aspect of the industry. U.S. corn is fed to farmed animals in Mexico. Brazilian meat processors own giant U.S. chicken companies. German animal genetics companies supply Chinese corporations modeled after those in the U.S.&nbsp;</p><p>If animal advocates want to be strategic and effective, it is critical to have at least a foundational understanding of this complex web of money and animal suffering. This is not to say that domestic campaigns are no longer important aspects of the movement. Instead, it is a call to consider how actions in one country can shape the industry in another country. Advocates living in major producer countries like the U.S., Brazil, and China, or those living in regions with large amounts of purchasing power, like the E.U., can and should seek to change industry practices around the globe.&nbsp;</p><p>The animal agriculture industry will need to make changes to its production practices as consumers grow more concerned about animal welfare. It\u2019s likely that every reform aimed at improving conditions in animal agriculture would cost the industry more money, such as transitioning to cage-free housing for layer hens or requiring stunning for fish slaughter. As a result, advocates campaigning for welfare reforms can simultaneously increase costs for the meat industry while also marginally reducing the suffering of farmed animals.</p><p>In the globalized animal agriculture industry, producers in one country often have buyers in another. As a result, consumers in one part of the world can demand certain practices of their producers and, unless they are able to find another market, the producers will be obligated to meet these demands (<a href=\"https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2018-06/ia_trade_import-cond-fish_en.pdf\"><u>European Commission, 2018</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2022/733101/IPOL_STU(2022)733101_EN.pdf\"><u>European Parliament, 2022</u></a>). For example, consumers in the E.U. have demanded\u2014and received\u2014certain animal welfare standards for fishes coming from Vietnam (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0044848617325292\"><u>Little et al., 2018</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25000798/\"><u>Lines &amp; Spence, 2014</u></a>). Similarly, regulatory agencies that oversee imports could require that animal products must come from animals that are raised without antibiotics.</p><h3><strong>Consolidation And Vertical Integration Are Hallmarks Of The Industry</strong></h3><p>A small number of animal agriculture megacorporations control much of the industry. For example, about one out of every six chickens slaughtered in the U.S. comes from Pilgrim\u2019s Pride. But in this industry, even a corporation as big as Pilgrim\u2019s is owned by an even bigger corporation: Brazilian-owned JBS, the largest meat producer in the world. Similarly, recognizable U.S. brand names like Ball Park, Jimmy Dean, and Hillshire Farm are all owned by Tyson, which gives consumers the illusion of choice in a more limited market.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides buying other meat-producing companies, one of the main ways that Tyson, JBS, and other giants were able to reach their current \u201cmegacorporation\u201d status is through vertical integration. By not only controlling other meat processors, but also controlling the suppliers of feed and day-old chicks, as well as everything from distribution networks to marketing teams, these companies are able to&nbsp; be much more efficient with their operations than their competitors. This ultimately saves them considerable amounts of money and solidifies their standing atop the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>Although governments sometimes move to block acquisitions that would further increase the power of these companies, they often do little to limit their growth or break up their strangleholds over markets. Strengthened antitrust regulations, which are intended to promote competition in markets by preventing things like monopolies, are a potential tool for governments to use to curb the power of these megacorporations. Advocates could lobby government officials to shift or strengthen current policies in order to limit the industry\u2019s reach. More often, however, governments around the world provide both direct and indirect support to the animal agriculture industry. In some countries, like Brazil and China, governments have even actively facilitated the consolidation of the industry.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that different sections of government play different roles in this dynamic. For example, in the U.S., the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are two of the main bodies tasked with overseeing the legality of business dealings, while the USDA is one of the main agencies involved in promoting the animal agriculture industry, though it also has a regulatory role. Advocates may need to focus their efforts on specific agencies depending on the change they are demanding. For instance, petitioning the USDA for limits on corporate mergers would have little effect because the Department of Justice oversees this type of action. Because there are a number of regulatory bodies overseeing different parts of the industry, advocates have several routes available to them and can investigate which avenues may be the most fruitful.</p><h3><strong>Will Aquaculture Become The Chicken Of The Sea?</strong></h3><p>Of all the industries covered in this report, the U.S. broiler industry provides the most extreme example of intensification. Over nearly a century, it has grown into a highly consolidated industry dominated by just a small number of fully vertically integrated corporations. Through careful breeding and management of genetics, chickens used by these companies now grow faster and larger, better endure horrific farming conditions, and cost less to raise. Moreover, the industry is standardized to a great degree, with automated equipment churning out billions of chicken-derived products each year. In addition to standard pieces of chicken meat like breasts and thighs, the industry has pioneered many value-added products. For example, there are chicken tenders and nuggets, which are made with specialized equipment and use more parts of the chicken, thereby decreasing waste and costs while making the broiler processors more money. There is precedent for other animal agriculture industries trying to copy these money-making aspects of broiler chicken production as well: many other industries, especially pork, have sought to replicate them.&nbsp;</p><p>By contrast, the modern aquaculture industry is quite young and unstandardized, which means it lacks many of the cost-saving efficiencies of the broiler industry. It uses a wide range of fishes and other aquatic animals, many of which are still raised in earthen ponds. Though many large companies are involved, they are often significantly smaller than the companies dominating the U.S. and global broiler chicken industries. Specialized equipment and agricultural knowledge exist in the aquaculture industry, but are rarely as effective or extensive as in industries that exploit chickens. Few value-added products come out of the aquaculture industry, and more standard products are also less consistent in size and other characteristics compared to the broiler and egg industries.&nbsp;</p><p>However, all of this is changing. As the industry consolidates further, grows increasingly vertically integrated, and breeds more \u201cefficient\u201d fishes, the aquaculture industry as a whole will likely grow to resemble the broiler industry more and more. Larger companies will spend more money on capital investments, such as land-based recirculating tanks, allowing them to reap the rewards of economies of scale. Research and development will improve feed conversion ratios and create additional automated machinery. New value-added products will be introduced.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This replication isn\u2019t inevitable. Advocates can see where the aquaculture industry is headed. As a result, they have a unique opportunity to affect its trajectory and prevent the expansion of an already massive system based on animal suffering.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Costlier Animal Products Require More Accessible Alternatives</strong></h3><p>There are many opportunities for advocates to increase the costs of animal products. This would both limit the profitability of animal exploitation and, by raising prices, make animal products less appealing to consumers. However, advocates taking this approach must also be aware of the need to increase access to plant-based alternatives. Many animal products have fairly inelastic demand, meaning that price increases won\u2019t greatly decrease the amount of that product people buy. This is not because the price isn\u2019t a concern, but rather because these products are staples for many people: they see them as irreplaceable. Often the first people who are priced out of these products are those who are already subsisting on low incomes, so advocates need to ensure that increased prices for animal products are met with decreased prices for plant-based products (<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/normal-good.asp\"><u>Kenton, 2023</u></a>). Without improved access to plant-based products of all types, creating costlier animal products would compound the harms marginalized people are already subjected to.</p><p>Successful efforts to improve welfare standards are one way to increase animal agriculture companies\u2019 production costs. These changes would also likely result in higher retail prices. Although higher prices alone may not be enough to shift consumer preferences toward plant-based options, it is important that advocates work to make plant-based products more affordable and widely available (<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/price-taste-and-convenience-competitive-plant-based-meat-would-not-currently-replace-meat\"><u>Rethink Priorities, 2023</u></a>). Improved accessibility is a primary requirement for a plant-based future and must happen at the same time as animal products become less financially appealing to the general public.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Aquaculture Is A Collection Of Industries</strong></h3><p>The broiler and egg industries use only a handful of varieties of chickens, most of which come from a small number of chicken genetics companies. Aquaculture, by contrast, involves hundreds of types of fishes and other aquatic animals, as well as dozens of different rearing techniques. Aquaculture includes everything from salmon to tilapia, sea cages to recirculating tanks, freshwater to saltwater. Although monocultures (i.e., the production of only one species in a system) are becoming increasingly popular, there is a huge amount of diversity in the industry, as well as in consumer preferences.&nbsp;</p><p>One possibility is that the industry will further consolidate around the most commonly farmed fish species: salmon, tilapia, carp, and catfish. However, even those fishes are considerably more different from one another than the different breeds of broiler chicken in use. It may be useful for animal advocates to begin thinking less about the aquaculture industry and more about the salmon industry, the tilapia industry, and so on. Advocates can learn more about these industries through the research conducted by groups like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/research\"><u>Fish Welfare Initiative</u></a>.</p><h3><strong>Advocates Lack Resources For Understanding The Animal Agriculture Industry</strong></h3><p>Much of the animal advocacy movement\u2019s research that has focused on the animal agriculture industry has looked at its animal welfare practices. This work is unquestionably crucial. But to supplement this body of knowledge, the movement needs more advocate-led explorations of other aspects of the animal agriculture industry, like the complexities of the production process. Regardless of advocates\u2019 ultimate goals as they relate to the industry, understanding how it operates is necessary in order to change it.&nbsp;</p><p>This lack of information is especially noticeable as it relates to large producer countries other than the United States. While the scope of this research was limited to English\u2014as noted in the Caveats &amp; Limitations section below\u2014we suspect that few resources exist in languages like Portuguese and Chinese as well. The animal advocacy movement can greatly benefit from sharing research and resources across languages, especially because of the global nature of the animal agriculture industry. For instance, advocates working in Brazil need access to information about what is happening in the U.S. and in China.&nbsp;</p><p>Advocates need to know more about the ins and outs of these industries, as well as the interdependent feed industry, but this is difficult when there is such little information compiled for advocates by fellow advocates. Funders and multilingual advocates can support the movement by translating resources or publishing an overview of the information available in other languages.</p><p>Detailed information on aquaculture is particularly lacking, likely because the industry is so new and diverse. In order for advocates to get out in front of the consolidation, standardization, and expansion of aquaculture, more resources exploring the practices of the industry are necessary. In other words, it\u2019s important for advocates to expand their knowledge of aquaculture before it\u2019s too late.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Opportunities For Advocate Intervention And Collaboration Abound</strong></h3><p>As this report aims to show, the animal agriculture industry has potential points of intervention at every stage of the supply chain. From working to reallocate crop subsidies to improving slaughter conditions, advocates can take steps to reduce and even reverse the industry\u2019s ability to exploit animals. An understanding of the industry\u2019s economics reveals even more pressure points. However, because there are so many places to intervene, advocates would benefit from further analysis of which of these points are most promising.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also countless opportunities for collaboration across movements. For instance, animal advocates\u2019 goals share significant overlap with those of groups focused on climate change and the environment: not just greenhouse gas emissions from animal agriculture, but also several other less-often discussed issues such as single-use plastics and environmentally-unfriendly packaging, as well as pollution from feed crops or the global transportation of animal products. To this end, forthcoming Faunalytics research will highlight opportunities for collaborations between the animal protection movement and the climate and environmental movement.</p><p>Because workers are often exploited in the animal agriculture industry and are a main cost for corporations, there may similarly be opportunities to work with labor groups such as unions. Grow-out farmers, especially those who would like to exit the industry but are too indebted, may be another group of laborers to seek out as partners in working to fight against the big animal agriculture companies. Some people who have historically been viewed as advocates\u2019 enemies may be trapped in the system by debt or their limited alternatives for making a living.</p><h3><strong>Feed and Genetics Are At The Center Of These Industries</strong></h3><p>Feed is usually the main factor affecting the cost of production of animal products, including chicken meat, eggs, and fish products. This often indicates that the industries are highly advanced and have become very efficient in other aspects of their operations, aided by innovations like automated machinery to limit labor costs. A huge share of the world\u2019s supply of two crops, corn and soybeans, is used to feed confined animals, and much of these crops\u2019 global trade takes place among the U.S., Brazil, and China. Especially in the U.S., government policies make these inputs cheaper for the animal agriculture industry, thereby supporting animal suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>Because feed is so costly for the industry, companies have focused on improving feed conversion ratios so that animals grow larger or produce more eggs with less feed. In addition to specially formulated feed blends, advances in feed conversion efficiency has come from genetic management, including with selective breeding. Other focuses of selective breeding and the genetics companies that carry it out include faster growth and tolerance for poor conditions. In both the highly efficient chicken industries and the growing aquaculture industry, genetic advantages such as these will likely remain at the forefront of efforts to become increasingly profitable. Increased efficiency often often means increased suffering for animals. Limiting genetic manipulation and cutting subsidies for animal feed crops could both help prevent the expansion of the industry.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Room For More Research</strong></h3><p>There are many directions for future research to take when considering the factors affecting the cost of production for chicken, fish, and egg products. The following are some of the directions we see as most useful, but it is not a definitive list.</p><p>One option for research is to map out the production process in other high-production countries. The U.S., Brazil, and China are three of the largest players in global animal agriculture, but far from the only ones. Other major producers of chickens, eggs, and fishes include countries like India, Indonesia, and Russia. Because supply and demand are inextricably linked, research could also focus on the biggest consumers of animal products even if they aren\u2019t major producers.&nbsp;</p><p>In general, there seems to be a divide in terms of both economic and industrial development between the large producer countries and countries that produce fewer animal products. In the U.S., Brazil, and China, many of their animal agriculture industries are highly sophisticated and dominated by megacorporations. Other countries that produce massive quantities of animal products are often similarly industrialized. In countries with fewer large-scale producers, the production process is likely quite different and the amount of animal suffering may be much less as well. However, like the broiler industry in Brazil or the aquaculture industry in China, rapid animal agriculture expansion and intensification could occur in any of these countries. Understanding the local context could enable advocates to prevent the industry\u2019s growth in these countries.</p><p>Advocates would also benefit from deeper individual analyses of the industries we cover in this report. This report provides an introduction to many aspects of the chicken, fish, and egg industries around the world, but there is still a lot of information we did not cover about their specific processes and the regulations that govern them. Such resources would provide advocates with a more thorough map of the animal agriculture industry, revealing new points of intervention in the process.&nbsp;</p><p>Future research could also map other industries, such as the pork, beef, and dairy industries. In many ways, these industries resemble those covered in this report. For example, many of the practices used in the modern pork industry were directly modeled off of the broiler industry. China, the U.S., and Brazil are also the three leading slaughterers of cows and all three are among the five largest slaughterers of pigs. However, each industry has its own unique factors that are important for advocates to understand. Moreover, Pakistan is one of the largest slaughterers of cows and is especially under-discussed in research on this topic. Additionally, the E.U. is an important player in the global meat trade, and is home to two of the largest pork-producing countries, Spain and Germany. As a result, explorations of other industries would also provide important background for advocates operating in parts of the world other than North America, South America, and East Asia.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, researchers could also investigate countries that support animal agriculture by importing products rather than producing them. Global animal agriculture couldn\u2019t exist without customers who buy its products. As a result, future research should examine the countries that import the most animal products. For example, Japan is among the top importers of chicken and fish products, while Germany is one of the biggest importers of chicken, fish, and egg products. With a stronger understanding of the context in countries like these, advocates can work to shift consumer preferences to prioritize animal welfare. Advocates in these countries can also call for regulations that require better animal welfare practices in the production of imported products. If customers in these countries demand better treatment of animals, their suppliers in other countries must comply or else risk losing business.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "JLRiedi"}}, {"_id": "RTG4ZAy6bqJqXo7uW", "title": "Our tofu book has launched!!", "postedAt": "2023-09-27T16:25:01.219Z", "htmlBody": "<p>As some of you know, I\u2019m working on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YZNswjspTd2MYAaDf/growing-the-us-tofu-market-a-roadmap-1\"><u>growing the US market for Chinese tofus</u></a>.

In our previous forum posts, we\u2019ve introduced the idea of stakeholder-engaged research - integrating various stakeholders into the research process to improve research outcomes and increase research usage. Our first piece looked at Good Growth's origins in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sKmwrxvjYqitWctmj/diagnosing-ea-research-are-stakeholder-engaged-methods-the\"><u>EA Meta/ Community Building space</u></a>, we then looked at how we have used a similar framework to support the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MCywanQxqsyorfeQN/developing-farmed-animal-welfare-in-china-engaging\"><u>animal welfare community in China</u></a>. This third piece expands the scope to Asia more broadly, taking a detailed look at two landscape studies to understand how stakeholder-engaged research can be used to improve movement capacity in emerging locations.&nbsp;</p><h3>Background</h3><p>In<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MCywanQxqsyorfeQN/developing-farmed-animal-welfare-in-china-engaging\"><u> the previous post</u></a>, we highlighted the reasons for focusing on animal welfare in emerging markets- growing economies with increasing levels of animal product consumption- using China as an example. Relieving animal suffering in these countries is hugely important, neglected and, given recent successes in animal advocacy globally, looks potentially tractable. As one of the key bottlenecks is building effective local movements throughout Asia, this post looks at ways of addressing this.</p><p>Broad interest in large Asian countries means that funding is generally available for projects, particularly from EA-aligned farmed animal funders. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/funding-dynamics-in-farmed-animal-advocacy/\"><u>recent survey of funders</u></a> found that: \u201cAsia was the most-often-mentioned region for expansion, particularly India and China, followed by Africa\u201d. However, in 2021, only $37.5 million (under 20% of the total year-on-year funding) went to projects outside of North America and Western Europe. This mismatch between interest and funding allocation seems to indicate that there aren\u2019t enough promising projects to meet the funders\u2019 capacity.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, a high proportion of funding in neglected countries goes towards supporting international organisations. For example, since 2016, over 75% of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/?focus-area=farm-animal-welfare-in-asia&amp;view-list=false&amp;items=100#categories\"><u>Open Philanthropy</u></a>\u2019s Asian grants in farmed animal welfare have gone to international organisations<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6yxzbeev6ee\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6yxzbeev6ee\">[1]</a></sup></span>. Newly-incubated EA charities are also focusing their work on emerging markets (<a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/\"><u>Fish Welfare Initiative</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/\"><u>Shrimp Welfare Project</u></a>). This has the advantage of bringing existing talent, infrastructure and resources from the EA-aligned global animal advocacy movement into neglected regions.&nbsp;</p><p>However, while there are merits to this approach, we think there are major advantages to supporting existing local organisations and individuals, for example:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Local advocates know the culture, politics and languages of their home country, and recognise the distinct challenges faced by advocates there&nbsp;</li><li>They also have \u2018skin in the game\u2019 and strong attachments, therefore have greater incentives and ability to commit long-term to their home country&nbsp;</li><li>Perceptions of advocacy movements as \u2018home-grown\u2019 are likely to build more local support from the public and government</li></ul><p>But most animal advocacy organisations in Asia are still relatively small and have access to fewer resources than their international counterparts. As such, there is increasing interest in building capacity for Asian animal advocacy organisations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Capacity building</strong> encompasses many activities that make animal advocates better able to do their jobs, from providing access to funding to pro-bono support, or facilitating cooperation with other groups. It can focus on making&nbsp;<a href=\"https://usaidlearninglab.org/community/blog/learning-effectiveness-capacity-building-strategies\"><u>individuals, organisations or systems</u></a> more effective, and can support, or work in tandem with&nbsp;<strong>community&nbsp;</strong>or<strong> movement building</strong>- in our case, growing the community of people who are working to improve outcomes for animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to recent developments&nbsp;elsewhere, we have increasingly good evidence of how a large, high-capacity animal-advocacy movement can drive meaningful change<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Essentially, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/ten-big-wins-for-farm-animals-in-2021/\"><u>major progress</u></a> made in the animal movement in the west, from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22331708/eggs-cages-chickens-hens-meat-poultry\"><u>rapid increases in cage-free egg production</u></a> to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.furfreealliance.com/fur-bans/\"><u>collapse of the European fur industry</u></a>, has been made possible due to a network of a large infrastructure of trained staff, volunteers, supporters, plant-based consumers, experts within industry and academia, and a network of mutually supporting organisations.&nbsp;</p><p>To achieve similar success in Asia, regional movements will likely require increased capacity. Capacity building interventions can use insights gained from the international&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/what-interventions-can-animal-advocates-use-to-build-community-in-their-country/\"><u>animal advocacy movement</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://futuremattersproject.org/FMP_More%20Than%20Just%20Good%20Causes_01-2023.pdf\"><u>climate movement</u></a>, and other successful social movements to equip organisations with the tools to become more effective and impact-focused. This might involve improving research use,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/animal-welfare\"><u>prioritisation</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RiC7DwbezkQmpDNrb/the-case-for-building-more-and-better-epistemic-institutions\"><u>promoting better epistemics</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vtzrZuigkT3ovn4rq/how-will-we-know-if-we-are-doing-good-better-the-case-for\"><u>improving M&amp;E practices</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Capacity-building interventions in the Asian animal advocacy movement have a few other characteristics that make them more promising:</p><ul><li><strong>Building scale</strong>. Working with an existing network has the potential to&nbsp; amplify the impact of advocacy work through harnessing the<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6WKBi5C9vhjRzAzPs/protest-movements-how-effective-are-they\"><u> high potential of large-scale social movements</u></a> for creating change.</li><li><strong>Low-hanging fruit</strong>. There are likely to be some simple, cost-effective interventions that local advocates are already well-placed to address that can have a significant impact, such as establishing cage-free industry standards where none currently exist (as has recently happened in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sinergiaanimalinternational.org/single-post/thai-department-livestock-development-is-working-new-standards-to-keep-hens-out-of-cages\"><u>Thailand</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/af/article/13/1/34/7052110\"><u>China</u></a>), and integrating&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/we-are-the-low-hanging-fruit/\"><u>already-aligned individuals&nbsp;</u></a>into the advocacy movement.</li><li><strong>Path dependency</strong>. While the Asian animal advocacy movement is growing, there is outsized potential to shape the movement in an effective and evidence-based way&nbsp;</li></ul><p><i><strong>How can stakeholder-engaged research facilitate capacity building?</strong></i></p><p>Effectively capacity building for local animal advocacy organisations in Asia requires a nuanced understanding of various cultural, economic and political contexts. It also requires integrating these insights into how we design and implement interventions. We argue that stakeholder-engaged research provides a promising approach for achieving these goals.<br><br>Stakeholder-engaged research (SER) can range from simply exchanging&nbsp; information amongst stakeholders, to consulting with and taking advice from stakeholders, to co-creating research. Different levels of engagements are associated with different goals and outcomes. Lower-level engagement, such as disseminating findings to stakeholders, can facilitate uptake of research and reduce misunderstandings. Higher levels of engagement, such as research co-creation or participatory research,&nbsp; can have distinct advantages when there are numerous interest groups that will be affected by and able to act upon research findings, whose viewpoints provide genuinely valuable, difficult-to-obtain information, and who have the ability to contribute to the research and implementation process.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Zck3mJjFB67cpEsJw/qhmjww845zpn5bixklxt\"></p><p><i>Source:&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.uu.nl/en/research/transdisciplinary-field-guide/in-practice/who-stakeholder-engagement\"><i><u>https://www.uu.nl/en/research/transdisciplinary-field-guide/in-practice/who-stakeholder-engagement</u></i></a><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>These approaches expect that stakeholders will contribute significantly to the project. Although there might be some costs to researchers in involving more stakeholders, primarily the initial time and resource investments, there are some obvious benefits:</p><ul><li>Joint ownership fosters an environment where stakeholders are more inclined to contribute their valuable insights to the research process.</li><li>There are more incentives for stakeholders to actually use the research, as they\u2019ve contributed to it and feel a sense of ownership</li><li>Stakeholder-engaged research (SER) establishes pathways for communication and collaborations that support continued cooperation, which can be more efficient in future iterations</li></ul><p>Examples of high-engagement approaches are well-established in the medical field, where medical professionals are increasingly encouraged to engage at increased levels in the research projects, and where&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-3518-7\"><u>co-creation of research with a capacity building element</u></a> has been identified as a valuable tool for improving patient outcomes.</p><p>Another interesting dimension is that stakeholder-engaged research can be used<strong>&nbsp;</strong>both<strong>&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>on and as&nbsp;</strong></i>capacity building.</p><p>While research is often seen as informing impactful interventions, what is often overlooked is that&nbsp;<strong>the process of research itself can produce capacity building outcomes</strong>. Using stakeholder engaged research methods can produce more useful, informed and relevant findings and insights - in the case of capacity building, making sure that research correctly identifies the relevant contextual factors, and gets to the real questions faced by organisations. But the process of being engaged in the research actually allows organisations- animal advocacy nonprofits in our case- to build their own capacity.&nbsp;</p><p>The benefits of SER are demonstrated in a recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12961-020-0544-9\"><u>meta-review</u></a><u> of 675 studies,</u> which found that the reported outcomes of engaging stakeholders included:&nbsp;</p><p><i>\u201c(1) stakeholders experienced personal benefits from working in a research partnership (n =\u2009104 of 675; 15%); (2) partners reported that the research partnership can create high quality research (n=\u200980, 12%); (3) stakeholders experienced increased capacity, knowledge and skills related to research processes (n =\u200974, 11%); (4) partners reported that the research partnership can create increased capacity to conduct and disseminate the research (n=\u200969, 10%); and (5) partners reported that the research partnership can create system changes or action (n=\u200965, 10%).\u201d</i></p><p><br>So, while research outputs can be improved through SER, the mere process of performing stakeholder-engaged research can also be an inherently capacity building process. Stakeholders who are involved throughout the research process, for example, can become more aware of existing research (e.g. through the literature review process) and better understand different research methods (e.g. through discussions around research design). Engagement can also strengthen relationships between implementing organisations, academics and funders, which can increase trust in research findings and support future collaborations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://health-policy-systems.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12961-020-0544-9\">study</a> also shows that capacity building through SER doesn\u2019t just benefit the partner/ implementing organisations- researchers and research organisations also benefit. For example,&nbsp; working closely with stakeholders can provide improved access to information, generate new ideas through increased interaction, and build institutional knowledge. More indirectly, SER can create a sense of a shared mission, and having a direct connection between your research and real-world impact can improve morale and motivation for researchers.&nbsp;</p><p>We believe the capacity building benefits of SER shouldn\u2019t simply be seen as \u201cpositive externalities\". Instead, we should actively consider and design SER projects to deliver impact, both through their end products&nbsp;<i>and</i> the research process. We explore how various benefits of stakeholder-engaged research could be achieved in the two case studies below:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Studies</strong></p><p>In the spirit of representing views from different stakeholders, our studies come from two different sources to illustrate the use of SER methods across the space. Firstly, we use <a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/asia-landscape\">one of our projects</a> conducted in collaboration with Animal Advocacy Africa (AA Africa), followed by <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6055b89c3909d31da1db63ad/t/639f55cfd6f676387301f01c/1671386580719/%28final%29+Animal+Advocacy+Asia+Forum+2022+Report.pdf\">some valuable research </a>produced by Animal Alliance Asia (AA Asia). The main differences between the pieces were that:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The AA Africa project was focused on \u2018market-entry\u2019, while AA Asia was focused on consolidating and improving their role supporting animal advocates across the continent.</li><li>AA Africa was focused on Farmed Animal Welfare/ Vegan organisations, while AA Asia\u2019s research includes all animal advocates</li><li>We (Good Growth) were involved in the AA Africa study, but had no direct involvement with the AA Asia work&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Read on for details of both studies:</p><h3>Study One: Asia Capacity Building Study (Animal Advocacy Africa)</h3><p>In 2021,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org\"><u>Animal Advocacy Africa</u></a> were thinking of expanding their capacity building program to include parts of Asia. As both continents remain relatively neglected by international advocates and may face some similar challenges, AA-Africa believed that their model may also have worked effectively in the Asian context. They engaged us to better understand the internal challenges and bottlenecks faced by farmed animal welfare / vegan organisations in Asia. The main goals were:</p><ul><li>Explore what capacity building actions/interventions are most needed to solve the challenges faced by organisations in the region</li><li>Assess whether Animal Advocacy Africa\u2019s capacity building programme should be replicated in Asia</li></ul><p><strong>Methods</strong></p><p>After conducting some desk research into publicly available reports and media interviews with advocates we engaged stakeholders directly with a research project using qualitative methods. Our research stages were comprised of:</p><ol><li><strong>Desk Research.</strong> We started by analysing publicly available reports from animal advocacy organisations, charity evaluation reports, and available media resources</li><li><strong>Interviews.&nbsp;</strong>We then conducted semi-structured interviews<strong>&nbsp;</strong>with four regional capacity builders/grantmakers and six local organisations, followed by three informal chats/email interviews with additional regional and local organisations to identify the most important challenges.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Idea Generation.</strong> To address the challenges identified during our research, we developed some capacity building ideas based on these interviews.</li><li><strong>Validation.&nbsp;</strong>We validated these ideas through a small-scale survey with local organisations.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Report</strong>. By synthesising the feedback from the interviews and the survey, we summarised the major challenges and needs of Asian advocates, and were able to recommend high-potential ideas for other capacity builders and donors to consider implementing or exploring in Asia.</li></ol><p><strong>What we learnt</strong></p><p>We discovered that it isn\u2019t easy working as an animal advocate in Asia, but that there are many ways that capacity building could help. Based on our interviews, we divided potential intervention areas into six separate categories, 1) HR, Finance and Communications, 2) Learning and Development, 3) Fundraising, 4) Hiring, 5) Research and 6) Individual Advocate Support. We then split these into specific interventions, which advocates were able to vote for in the survey.&nbsp;</p><p>The following charts indicate which areas the organisations surveyed said they would want support with:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Zck3mJjFB67cpEsJw/lmrgvja4o0cv1oigxkli\"></p><p>Source:&nbsp;<i>Animal Advocacy Africa Report (Unit = Number of organisations choosing an option)</i></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Zck3mJjFB67cpEsJw/edqqdnlfxcyy9zrhus8u\"></p><p><i>Source: Animal Advocacy Africa Report&nbsp;</i></p><p>Firstly, most local groups said that they would benefit from direct, work-related training. Recognising the high impact of corporate and legal interventions, many respondents told us that training in&nbsp;<strong>corporate outreach best practices&nbsp;</strong>would be especially valuable<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>with&nbsp;<strong>public outreach campaign management</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>government-related work</strong> also seen as important. Ideas included providing effective and context-sensitive training in these areas through&nbsp;<strong>work exchanges</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>knowledge-sharing workshops</strong>, or with&nbsp;<strong>personal mentorship</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, groups struggled with the practical challenges of&nbsp;<strong>communications and operations</strong>. Coming up with an effective outreach strategy requires lots of organisational skills, as do the technical tasks of designing appealing social media posts or short videos. Operations represent a bottleneck in many organisations, as there are few available dedicated operations specialists. As such, a highly-recommended suggestion was to support Asian groups in this respect by&nbsp;<strong>providing discounted/sponsored or pro-bono outsourced services&nbsp;</strong>for communications (e.g. social media or design consultants) or operations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Securing funding</strong> is almost always a challenge for local animal advocates. The organisations we interviewed were almost completely reliant on western funding sources, especially for specific farmed animal welfare and vegan advocacy work. This requires appealing to Western funders through grantmaking procedures, which sometimes involves language barriers and other communication issues. Advocates may also have to face potentially restrictive local laws around accepting foreign funding. Finally, as most organisations were relying on a limited set of foreign funding sources, organisations felt vulnerable and had limited opportunities for growth. As such,&nbsp;<strong>support with engaging new funding sources&nbsp;</strong>was proposed as a high-impact capacity building intervention. Solutions might include developing a local base of donors, or partnering with online platforms such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.abillion.com/en/explore\"><u>abillion</u></a> or crowdfunding sites to develop a global small donor reach.&nbsp;</p><p>Although fewer organisations identified these as high-potential interventions, advocates also mentioned&nbsp;<strong>the need for locally-relevant data and research</strong>. For example, one local organisation expressed the need for additional funding to engage academia in local research related to animal welfare standards. They highlighted how this could provide more convincing arguments when speaking with industry and government stakeholders. The organisation also suggested that general market data, such as import/export numbers and regional success stories for high-welfare products, could support their prioritisation and communications.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally,&nbsp;<strong>hiring the right talent&nbsp;</strong>was seen as a problem. The budget for hiring animal advocacy staff in Asian countries is generally limited, and organisations struggle to provide the kind of salaries that would attract highly-skilled graduates from competitive fields. Sadly, the nonprofit sector in many Asian countries tends to be seen as a low-potential, low-salary career path, which, especially in the more competitive, achievement-focused cultures seen across parts of Asia, puts a lot of talented people off animal advocacy careers. Some solutions to these problems are offering&nbsp;<strong>professional development opportunities</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>considering more competitive salaries</strong> for certain roles,&nbsp;<strong>matching skilled volunteers</strong> and working with&nbsp;<strong>existing fellowship programs</strong> to offer early career opportunities to work in local organisations.&nbsp;</p><p>Something that was not explicitly identified as a capacity building intervention, but that came up in the interviews, was the merits of&nbsp;<strong>working with social movements outside of animal advocacy</strong> that could provide support for the Asian animal movement. As the number of dedicated animal advocates in each of these countries is likely to remain small, advocates pointed out the value of allying with other social movements, such as those involved in climate or sustainability activism, sustainability-related businesses, as well as motivated academics and researchers. Some of the successes from other local movements could be used to inspire creative solutions, and this process could play a key role in building an active advocacy movement in Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p><p>Ultimately, our partners at Animal Advocacy Africa decided not to launch their capacity building program in Asia. This research project allowed them to realise that the needs of the broader African and Asian animal welfare movements were more distinct than expected, and that their strategy was less suited to the Asian movement. However, they have decided to make the&nbsp; study publicly available to inform advocates, capacity builders and funders of the exciting opportunities available to support the Asian advocacy movement to become larger and more effective in the years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>Lynn Tan, Co-founder of Animal Advocacy Africa said that the research: \"...&nbsp; directly guided/informed our internal decision making\u2026[and] potentially saved us enormous amounts of time and helped us avoid making difficult-to-reverse actions\".</p><p>Check out the full report&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/asialandscape\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><h3>Study Two: Animal Alliance Asia</h3><p>Animal Alliance Asia is an organisation that&nbsp;focuses on supporting advocates in Asia. Their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalallianceasia.org/our-strategy\"><u>core mission</u></a> is focused on building a more inclusive and effective animal movement from within Asia, with a strong emphasis on bringing together and empowering local animal advocates. They focus on delivering programmes like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalallianceasia.org/animal-advocacy-academy\"><u>Animal Advocacy Academy</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalallianceasia.org/animal-advocacy-forum\"><u>Country Forums</u></a>, and their annual&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalallianceasia.org/animal-advocacy-conference-asia\"><u>Animal Advocacy Conference Asia</u></a> to help educate, create networking opportunities necessary for collaboration, and provide support to individual advocates and organisations across the region. They are currently looking to introduce new programmes such as the Future Leaders Asia Summit, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalallianceasia.org/regranting\"><u>regranting program</u></a> and multiple Asia-specific research projects.&nbsp;</p><p>This particular example is an in-depth qualitative study based on the <a href=\"https://www.animalallianceasia.org/research\">2022 version of the annual&nbsp;<u>country forums</u></a> held by Animal Alliance Asia in 10 different countries. We've chosen to highlight it here as a creative example of engaging stakeholders in&nbsp; research, and the potential impact of such engagement.</p><p>Their goals of this study were to:</p><ul><li>Support local organisations and advocates to reflect and improve on their advocacy by sharing the culturally-specific challenges, opportunities and solutions discussed in the forums;&nbsp;</li><li>Facilitate capacity-building organisations in Asia to identify areas where they can support local animal advocates; and;&nbsp;</li><li>Assist funders who are interested in supporting animal advocacy in Asia to better understand the needs of local organisations and initiatives and maximise the effectiveness in their fund allocations.</li></ul><p><strong>Methods</strong></p><p>In 2022, Animal Alliance Asia conducted a series of forums for advocates across Asia in order to build relationships with Local Animal Advocates (LAAs) and explore culturally specific challenges, opportunities and solutions. Ten Asian countries participated, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam, each with its own&nbsp;<strong>forum sessions</strong>. These forum sessions were semi-structured discussions using open and closed questions, and were designed by AA Asia\u2019s internal team. Country coordinators were encouraged to recruit participants, facilitate discussions and conduct online or offline forums, depending on the country-specific circumstances. Discussions were conducted in local languages and later translated into English. The findings were filled into a standardised form by the country coordinators, and additional desk research and observations were used to complement the data, then a research assistant compiled and analysed the findings.</p><p>The motivation for holding the forums was \u201cto listen to the voices of advocates and better understand their experiences on the ground before determining \u201cwhat works best in each country\u201d.</p><p>During these forums, qualitative data was collected for a cross-country analysis. As part of in-depth discussions, country coordinators were also asked to assess the progress of the animal advocacy movement in their country according to Bill Moyer\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://commonslibrary.org/resource-bill-moyers-movement-action-plan/\"><u>Movement Action Plan (MAP) framework</u></a>. The MAP identifies 8 stages of a social movement, with 1 indicating that the movement is in the beginning stage, and 8 being that the movement has tentatively succeeded in its goals.&nbsp;</p><p>These methods are interesting for a couple of reasons - firstly, while the methods were open-ended and qualitative, AA Asia came into the study with an established theoretical framework for movement growth, working under the assumptions that social movements tend to follow broadly similar trajectories. Second, the researchers used interactive forums instead of focus groups/ interviews, which are more commonly used qualitative methods.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Findings</strong></p><p>In terms of the MAP framework, the research confirmed that the animal welfare movement is still at a nascent stage in most of Asia. Only Taiwan was identified as somewhere where 'conditions were ripening' for the animal advocacy movement, while other countries were in the earlier stages. This provides an interesting update as to how we want to look at building the movement across Asia.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Zck3mJjFB67cpEsJw/nagynwytwhlgrdxcd6re\"></p><p>Some of the bottlenecks and challenges identified in the study were similar to those we identified in the previously mentioned study, providing some support for the claims we had made.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, LAAs (Local Animal Advocates) across ten countries reported gaps in the animal advocacy space regarding country-specific knowledge, advocacy training, and, most significantly, funding. Funding gaps make it difficult to create programs and paid opportunities for LAAs, which in turn is an obstacle to LAAs attempting to pursue animal advocacy as their career path. With this lack of training opportunities, LAAs rarely had any formal training in animal advocacy, and instead had to learn their skills in the field. LAAs emphasised the need for&nbsp;<strong>workshops and training</strong> to build&nbsp;<strong>skills such as leadership, nonprofit management, fundraising, and communication</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>There were also some interesting insights that we hadn't identified:</p><ul><li>Advocates from many countries expressed the desire for a \u201cmiddle entity\u201d or mediator to facilitate collaboration between organisations, or the sharing of resources.&nbsp;</li><li>There is a significant lack of country-specific data and research on local animal advocacy tactics, animal welfare violations, animal agriculture systems, and levels of animal abuse.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>As well as these insights into capacity building, the study also provided some insights into the struggles faced on the ground by advocates, and the kind of advocacy work that would be valuable in specific countries.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Friendly and considerate<strong>,&nbsp;</strong>rather than antagonistic, methods were predicted to be the most effective tactic by advocates. Although this hasn\u2019t been explicitly tested in these regions, advocates report more successful corporate and awareness-raising campaigns when they target audience sympathy rather than guilt.&nbsp;</li><li>When advocates were asked which approaches they believed to be effective in their specific context, most groups emphasised the importance of creating public awareness. This suggests that approaches that may not directly result in a high number of animals saved, such as active rescue work, are seen as contributing significant value through the indirect impact of promoting visibility. These efforts are seen as potentially contributing to community growth, enabling organisations to garner local support, and enhancing fundraising opportunities.</li><li>Attempts to influence policy/ legal reform will vary greatly from countries with effective political/ legal systems (Japan) to those with struggling legal systems (Thailand)</li><li>Islamic countries in particular require nuanced approaches that account for halal dietary norms, and consideration of different stakeholders, such as religious groups</li></ul><p>Finally, there were some interesting takeaways from the relationship between funders and local advocates. Funding usually comes with the pressure to focus on specific areas chosen by foreign funders as a prerequisite condition, which generally doesn\u2019t allow for the input of local advocates. This created challenges for advocates, who were often discouraged from pursuing the interventions that they considered to be more practical or effective in the context.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Limitations&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There are inherent limitations to this kind of research.&nbsp;</p><p>With the AA Africa study, we had a moderate response rate (8 out of 18 target organisations responded to the survey), a limited sample size, and we weren\u2019t able to conduct studies in local languages, meaning that we selected for organisations and countries with some English proficiency. To compensate for this, we also reached out to regional organisations first to provide a better overview of issues across Asia, before diving into some local issues. Therefore the study was more likely to capture broad regional trends, than details with regards to all the specific countries and sub-cause areas where advocates were operating.</p><p>Many of our findings are still at a preliminary insight stage, and need to be tested more rigorously. With AA-Africa, we obtained enough information to target capacity building for the organisations in question, by testing key findings with a small quantitative survey. However, due to the small sample size, external validity is likely to be limited. With both these studies there are some important actionable insights, but there is also a wide range of hypotheses that should be tested more rigorously (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CrJYnufXiyA-aUi_N2m_DrzjrrHtPHIDObQ1PLafZFU/edit?usp=sharing\">see here for a list</a>).</p><p><strong>Discussion</strong></p><p>There are many interventions that funders and international advocates can use to support Asian advocacy groups in tackling community-building challenges. Providing training, fellowships, work exchanges, and pro-bono support for Asian animal organisations are particularly promising. More ambitiously, taking a systematic approach to building an international ecosystem of support for Asian organisations would better allow us to combine the experience and resources of the international movement with local advocates\u2019 understanding of their countries\u2019 distinctive needs.&nbsp;</p><p>These are likely to be high impact interventions, largely because building the capacity of the Asian advocacy movement has the potential to be self-reinforcing. Attracting more skilled people with improved resources leads to advocacy organisations generating better, more fundable ideas, which then allows them to provide evidence of success and build their profile, thus allowing them to attract attention from both local stakeholders and international funders. This process could potentially be a&nbsp;virtuous cycle,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>where increasing the capacity of a local advocacy movements can be self-perpetuating.&nbsp; <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Zck3mJjFB67cpEsJw/hd3xo4pccvgmao7eryu7\"></p><p><strong>Conclusion - What have we learned from (3 years of) doing SER in Asia?</strong></p><p>This post and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MCywanQxqsyorfeQN/developing-farmed-animal-welfare-in-china-engaging\"><u>previous post</u></a> have illustrated our experiences using stakeholder-engaged research methods in Asia over the last few years, and we'll finish this post with a quick overview of some of our learnings.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Working across Boundaries</strong></p><p>Firstly, we\u2019ve learned a few different things about working across cultural boundaries that can inform our perspective on animal welfare interventions:</p><ol><li>We\u2019ve found that local and international animal advocates have different perspectives on what might work, and we typically have high uncertainty about who might be right in a given context. For example, local advocates have informed us that corporate outreach and pressure campaigns, which are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/10/31/18026418/vegan-vegetarian-animal-welfare-corporate-advocacy\"><u>often supported by international advocates</u></a>, may be ineffective and create backlash in certain Asian contexts. On the other hand, smaller-scale interventions, such as direct action (rescues) are sometimes seen by local advocates as playing a role in generating publicity, changing minds and building grassroots support. One of our future goals is to improve communication between international and local groups to test which of these viewpoints is the more accurate, and improve prioritisation based on this.&nbsp;</li><li>In the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MCywanQxqsyorfeQN/developing-farmed-animal-welfare-in-china-engaging\"><u>China studies</u></a>, engaging with consumers has challenged our views on meat reduction and alternative proteins. The array of associations people link to meat-alternatives in China: \u201cmystery\u201d meat and \u201czombie\u201d meat with suspicious origins, soy replacements high in additives, and mock meat served in Buddhist temples, call for very different messaging around protein alternatives. We also found that the differences between modern plant-based meat and mock meat are rarely well understood by regular consumers in China or elsewhere in Asia, which adds an additional challenge to the development of localised marketing strategies.&nbsp;</li><li>We also learnt from our focus groups that older Chinese consumers&nbsp; (grandparents) seem particularly susceptible to meat reduction messaging for health reasons, and were also sympathetic towards welfare messaging. This was a surprising finding that goes against the more common view, held by advocates we\u2019d spoken to, that older people in China are less susceptible to change. We also noted that grandparents have a role in food shopping and preparation for many Chinese families, suggesting that they may have an outsized influence on a family\u2019s diet. Our more recent research has found this to have resonance across multiple Asian contexts, which could inform different outreach strategies for the advocacy movement across Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol><p>These are examples of how our initial assumptions about working in new markets can be wrong or incomplete- this is especially true when assumptions are made by international actors with little experience in diverse contexts. Of course, locally-based advocates can also be wrong, pointing to the need for more engaged research with multiple stakeholders. These findings can allow us and our partners to work better across national and cultural boundaries, to make better decisions and avoid costly mistakes.&nbsp;</p><p>As well as these national and cultural boundaries, we\u2019ve also noted the challenges of working across&nbsp;<strong>epistemological boundaries&nbsp;</strong>- in particular, the gap between people grounded in the EA movement, and local advocates working under a different set of ideas or assumptions.&nbsp;</p><p>The two studies in this article both used qualitative approaches to address similar questions, but had slightly different epistemological approaches. Our approach (with AA Africa) was more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivism\"><u>positivist</u></a> - we used mixed-methods approaches to generate and test hypotheses for effective capacity building interventions - while AA Asia took more of an advocate-led and justice-focused approach to address problems faced by local animal advocacy movements.</p><p>These approaches aren't necessarily contradictory - the practical considerations that come from the social justice approach, such as prioritising respect for local animal advocates, while acknowledging power imbalances in the field, shouldn\u2019t contradict principles of transparency, evidence-based theories of change, and effectiveness. However, this raises interesting issues regarding working more closely with organisations that have different values, or views about what is important, and about how knowledge should be created.&nbsp;</p><p>While EA organisations tend to share a common epistemological framework, this framework is not universally shared by most of the stakeholders any EA-aligned organisation is likely to work with. But as long as preventing animal suffering is a shared goal, navigating these challenges provides increased opportunities to build a more resilient and effective movement.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Changing Strategies through Stakeholder-Engaged Research</strong></p><p>We\u2019ve observed that stakeholders in international animal advocacy, including our partners, have updated their approaches to stakeholder engaged research, and increased consideration of stakeholder-engaged methods is starting to affect the way that organisations develop their strategies.&nbsp;</p><p>A direct example of SER affecting strategies is the extent to which AA Asia and ourselves have made some changes based partly on the findings mentioned in this forum post. AA Asia have launched a new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalallianceasia.org/regranting\"><u>ReRoot Asia regranting fund</u></a> to address funding challenges that local advocates identified in the forums. At Good Growth, two of our potential upcoming projects respond to some of the challenges identified in this research. The first involves satisfying the need for improved information and data with an online&nbsp;<strong>Asia data library</strong>, while the second involves using&nbsp;<strong>user research</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>country workshops</strong> to tackle hiring challenges, and effectively grow and retain animal advocacy talent in Asia.&nbsp;</p><p>Through working in this space, we\u2019ve also noted that stakeholders in international animal advocacy are increasingly identifying the need for more engaged contextual research. Funders and larger advocacy organisations are identifying challenges that are more difficult to address with more straightforward desk-based or survey research, and we\u2019ve noticed an increased demand for more engaged methodologies. On the advocate side, while disseminating our research, multiple local animal advocacy organisations we\u2019ve engaged with have reached out to us to express their interest in learning about SER methods, while others have asked how they might be able to build their research capacity and/or conduct similar research.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Process and Product - Different ways that research can have an impact</strong></p><p>Most organisations go into a research project assuming that the benefits will accrue at the end of the research, when ideas are published and disseminated to stakeholders. However, as we\u2019ve explored more ways of conducting SER, involving more stakeholders at different stages, we\u2019ve identified more benefits elsewhere in the research process. These have involved developing connections, empowering advocates to better use their local knowledge, and capacity-building. This has led to further collaboration with local groups, increasing their contribution to projects and potentially improving their alignment with our goals.&nbsp;</p><p>This increased collaboration and partnership has led us to think about two different ways that research can have an impact, which can be categorised into&nbsp;<strong>product&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>process&nbsp;</strong>outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>product&nbsp;</strong>outcomes are those that result directly from the research outputs - a physical product, a new strategy or intervention, or a set of insights. Engaging stakeholders in product-focused research can improve these outcomes by generating better, more relevant and/or innovative research products, resulting in more usage of the research and improved decision-making. In our case, conducting engaged research with multiple stakeholders on the AA Africa project was intended to improve the quality of our insights, and therefore help the organisation make better strategic decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, the&nbsp;<strong>process</strong> of participating in research can also produce valuable outcomes. For example,&nbsp; the research literacy of stakeholders might be improved through a \u2018learning through doing\u2019 framework or, as in the case of AA Asia\u2019s forums, the research process can facilitate relationship-building between stakeholders, alongside the sharing of knowledge, experience, problems and solutions. Research participation can also empower groups who don\u2019t usually have a say in research decisions to contribute.&nbsp; Another benefit from a shared research process can also be psychological or relational - co-creating research can change the behaviour and attitudes of the participating individuals and groups. This could be a process of cultivating greater value alignment or building links between less aligned communities. These aspects of research process can lay the foundation for collaboration, and potentially lead to improved research design in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Our main update here has been through becoming more cognisant of the benefits accrued through the process of research, and to increasingly consider these benefits while designing research. Better identifying the influence of engagement in both the product and process of research is something that we\u2019re hoping to focus on in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Trade-Offs and Uncertainties</strong></p><p>As a small research organisation with multiple obligations to funders and partners, we\u2019re very aware that engaging stakeholders takes up time and resources. While an online survey can be designed, tested and conducted within a few weeks if necessary, more engaged research methods take longer, while cross-cultural communication can also be challenging and frustrating.&nbsp;<br><br>We haven\u2019t seen a good cost-effectiveness analysis looking at the trade-offs to increased levels of engagement. It seems likely that the benefits from increasing from zero engagement to some engagement with stakeholders- in particular, significantly decreasing the downside risks when working in new cultural contexts- will outweigh the costs. However, moving from moderately- to highly-engaged research methodologies is likely to entail larger trade-offs, which we hope to look at in more detail in the future.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Developing a Better Model of Impact</strong></p><p>Considering stakeholder-engaged methods has helped us to reconsider how research leads to impact. We were previously thinking in terms of a more simplistic, linear model where we use rigorous methods to produce reliable evidence, which leads to evidence-based interventions, which leads to impact. However, this model misses out some important steps towards reaching our goals, and doesn\u2019t capture many of the ways by which impact is created through research.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of our research has depended on developing new insights into animal advocacy and alternative proteins in Asia. After uncovering an insight that stakeholders are able to use, we have to ask: \u201cWhat do we do with this?\u201d. We can publish it in a report or forum post and hope that someone chooses to act upon it. Or we can get in touch with particular stakeholders to start the process of converting insights into interventions or future behaviour, often through workshops, presentations and other events across Asia.<br><br>But we\u2019re increasingly seeing ways in which this kind of dissemination can be sub-optimal, and results in a lack of integration between research and action. When implementers (advocates in our case) and researchers are working separately, implementers don\u2019t always have access to the most up-to-date research that could inform their interventions, while researchers don\u2019t always have access to implementers who could transform their research into action when they design and conduct their research.&nbsp;</p><p>An promising approach to address this is&nbsp;<strong>co-creation</strong>, where stakeholders are actively engaged in identifying research questions, interpreting insights and brainstorming new solutions. Here,&nbsp;partners work together to integrate insights into the decision making process of the implementers, and leverage the contextual knowledge of the implementing/ on the ground partner to develop new strategies and solutions.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, we\u2019re going to try implementing this idea through a series of co-creation workshops later this year, in collaboration with several animal-related conferences. Our goal is to take 3 years worth of research insights and work with local stakeholders to produce novel, context-sensitive solutions to improve the lives of animals. Our vision is to build a Research-to-Action lab, where we can systematically facilitate the process of translating research into effective actions for animals.

Setting norms of good epistemics through advice and content aspirationally may improve that of EA</li></ul><h2>A note on which universities we focus on</h2><p>We think top universities, such as those previously listed as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GZn2xGR37or7N9zLm/many-groups-metrics-have-grown-by-100-to-400-in-the-past%23fn-xziSuHRyzxr8hsuan-2\"><u>focus universities</u></a>, have a high concentration of top talent. That means that we extend higher touch support to top universities and have some programming focused on them specifically (like our summit and residencies). However, the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/czjZgTBFxPtDnPTBv/most-ivy-smart-students-aren-t-at-ivy-tier-schools\"><u>majority</u></a>&nbsp;of talented, altruistic and greatly influential people do not come from top universities. Therefore we think scalable support (like UGAP &amp; OSP) which includes both top and&nbsp;non-top universities is also worthwhile. We have many examples of people who are doing work that we think is really important, who did not come from top universities, and might have not gotten involved with EA ideas if it wasn\u2019t for their university group. We also think people that we help from these universities tend to be particularly counterfactual.</p><p>Separately, we should note that EA is a rapidly changing ecosystem. Changes to bottlenecks in key priorities and cultural norms within EA influence our programming and focus. We are regularly <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/euzDpFvbLqPdwCnXF/university-ea-groups-need-fixing?commentId%3Drx5K7s3Dfwnsb5qz8\"><u>reflecting</u></a>&nbsp;on what the current landscape means for our programming.

We provide students with a mentor, digital resources (e.g. an outreach guide), training, and sometimes a stipend. Since the start of the program in 2021, we have supported <a href=\"https://data.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\"><u>over 200 group organizers</u></a>, coming from every populated continent. This round, we have organizers participating in UGAP from schools including IIT Bombay, University College Dublin, University of Florida, University of Sao Paulo, University of Warwick, and many more.</p><h3>OSP</h3><p>The <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/centreforeffectivealtruism/Organizer-Support-Program-OSP-0aa5dc55d97e444da347d8d227db93d4\"><u>Organizer Support Program</u></a>&nbsp;(OSP) is a mentorship program aimed at university EA group organizers to help them prepare for the start of the semester. Similarly to UGAP, it provides student group organizers with a mentor, resources and training, but no stipend. We ran a very low touch pilot of OSP in the \u201822 spring semester, as we noticed pre-existing EA university groups can also benefit from resources and mentorship - especially if there\u2019s a lot of new organizers running the group. We have now also accepted a few AI safety groups, to explore if our programs are able to add value for those groups. This round, we have organizers participating in OSP from schools including Stanford University, Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, Harvard University, Cambridge, Delft University of Technology, the University of Hong Kong, and many more.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:451px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PatjzJHQev2upDHnr/bpju2warsi7vwtemiysa\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><i>One of our OSP kickoff events</i></figcaption></figure><p>Want to be notified when new rounds of UGAP or OSP open?

This means that some organizers, who in an ideal world we would like to support, do not receive support from us. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5sfwebGDPBmSBcYA2/the-application-is-not-the-applicant\"><u>Application processes are not perfect</u></a>, and sometimes we make mistakes in both directions. We are planning on reevaluating our bar this winter based on how correlated our evaluations of applications are with organizer outcomes. Our selection criteria are similar to that of the <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/open-philanthropy-university-organizer-fellowship/\"><u>Open Philanthropy University Organizer Fellowship</u></a>, though since our support is less money intensive and more introductory, we usually have a slightly lower bar than them. <img style=\"width:624px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PatjzJHQev2upDHnr/zs6vidt5psuaulgnmhzg\" alt=\"\"></p><h3>What\u2019s next for UGAP &amp; OSP?</h3><ul><li>We\u2019re considering switching to needs-based grants for UGAP (as participants can apply to <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/open-philanthropy-university-organizer-fellowship/\"><u>Open Philanthropy\u2019s University Organizer Fellowship</u></a>), but we need to spend more time on looking at whether this is practically feasible</li><li>We\u2019re considering merging UGAP and OSP, to simplify the application process and reduce confusion</li><li>We are considering building out a track for AI safety university group organizers</li></ul><h2>Group organizer summit</h2><p>In May, ahead of EAG London, we hosted a group organizer summit in collaboration with CEA\u2019s Partner Events Team (thank you to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/michel?mention=user\"><u>michel</u></a><a href=\"http://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/\"><u> </u></a>for all his work on this!). The retreat aimed to bring together (mostly) experienced university group organizers from established EA university groups, such as those previously listed as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GZn2xGR37or7N9zLm/many-groups-metrics-have-grown-by-100-to-400-in-the-past%23fn-xziSuHRyzxr8hsuan-2\"><u>focus universities</u></a>. More specifically, the goals of the summit were to facilitate lasting coordination between organizers at established groups, help organizers improve their group\u2019s strategy by learning from guests and their peers, and to kick-off collaborative projects and spark more enthusiasm for EA uni group organizing.</p><h3>Results</h3><ul><li>The guest LTR<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyoouagcepa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyoouagcepa\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(likelihood to recommend) was 8.43/10, but the attendee LTR was 7.68/10</li><li>Attendees reported a mean of 7.13 new connections</li><li>The median counterfactual use of time attendees reported was 3.5x</li></ul><p>Despite a relatively low LTR compared to similar events, our best guess is that this event created important coordination and relationships that otherwise wouldn\u2019t have happened, like a workshop for AIS organizers, more coordination on residencies, and more communication between group organizers.

Their articles are consistently funny, well-written, and sensible. But recently, Mary Townsend <a href=\"https://plus.thebulwark.com/p/effective-altruism-is-a-short-circuit\"><u>wrote a critique of effective altruism</u></a> titled \u201cEffective Altruism Is a Short Circuit,\u201d that seems deeply confused. In fact, I will go further and make a stronger claim\u2014there is not a single argument made in the entire article that should cause anyone to be less sympathetic to effective altruism at all! Every claim in the article is either true but irrelevant to the content of effective altruism or false. The article is crafted in many ways to mislead, confuse and induce negative affect in the reader but is light on anything of substance.</p><p>For instance, the article begins with a foreboding picture of the notorious EA fraudster Sam Bankman Fried. This is not an explicit argument given, of course\u2014it\u2019s just a picture. If it were forced to be an argument, it would not succeed\u2014even if Bernie Madoff gave a lot of money to the Red Cross and has some role in planning operations, that would do nothing to discredit the Red Cross; the same principle is true of EA. But when one is writing a smear piece, they don\u2019t need to include real objections\u2014they can just include things that induce disdain in the reader that they come to associate with the object of the author\u2019s criticism. Such is reminiscent of the flashing red letters that are ubiquitous in attack ads\u2014good if one\u2019s aim is propaganda, bad if one\u2019s aim is truth.</p><p>The article spends the first few paragraphs on mostly unremarkable philosophical musings about how we often have an urge to do good and we can choose what we do, filled with sophisticated-sounding references to philosophers and literature. Such musings help build the author\u2019s ethos as a Very Serious Person, but does little to provide an argument. However, after a few paragraphs of this, the author gets to the first real criticism:</p><blockquote><p>That one could become good through monetary transactions should raise our post-Reformation suspicions, obviously. As a simple response to the stipulation of a dreadful but equally simple freedom, it seems almost designed to hit us at the weakest spots of our human frailty, with disconcerting effects.</p></blockquote><p>Effective altruism doesn\u2019t claim, like those who endorsed indulgences, that one can become good through donating. It claims that one can <i>do</i> good through donating and that one should do good. The second half of that claim is a trivially obvious moral claim\u2014we should help people more rather than less\u2014and the first half of the claim is backed by <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\"><u>quite overwhelming empirical evidence</u></a>. While one can dispute the details somewhat, the claim that we can save the lives of faraway people for a few thousand dollars is incontrovertible given the weight of the available evidence\u2014there\u2019s a reason that critics of EA never have specific criticisms of the empirical claims made by effective altruists.</p><p>Once one acknowledges that those who give to effective charities can save hundreds of lives over the course of their lives by fairly modest donations, a claim that even critics of such giving generally do not dispute, the claim that one should donate significant amounts to charities in order to save the lives of lots of people who would otherwise have died of horrifying diseases ceases to be something that \u201craises our post-reformation suspicions.\u201d One imagines the following dialogue (between Townsend and a starving child):</p><blockquote><p>Child: Please, could I have five dollars. This would allow me to afford food today so I wouldn\u2019t be hungry.</p><p>Townsend: Sorry, I\u2019d love to help, but that one could become good through monetary transactions should raise our post-Reformation suspicions. In addition, though your frail arms seem almost designed to hit us at the weakest spots of our human frailty, with disconcerting effects, I do not think this is an adequate response to the stipulation of a dreadful but equally simple freedom.</p></blockquote><p>Such a response would be, of course, bizarre\u2014when people are struggling who we can help at minimal personal cost, we ought to help them. This is not intended as some grand solution to the fundamental human question\u2014whatever that means\u2014but as a basic ethical principle that is widely accepted: we should help those we can. When children are dying, who could be saved by foregoing some of the lucrative profits from the Bulwark and spending them on malaria nets rather than luxuries, one ought to forego said luxuries.</p><p>The second claim seems equally bizarre. Effective altruism doesn\u2019t seem to be \u201ca simple response to the stipulation of a dreadful but equally simple freedom,\u201d and nor does \u201cdesigned to hit us at the weakest spots of our human frailty, with disconcerting effects.\u201d In fact, effective altruism seems to go against our human frailty\u2014it instructs us to take into account the interests of those whom we cannot see, whose screams we cannot hear, simply because they matter. This runs counter to every bias in the book and is thus only followed by a vanishingly small portion of the population, but those who do follow it do it because they\u2019re convinced that a far-away child dying of malaria or going blind from Vitamin A deficiency is just as important as they would be if they were nearer. The death and blindness of children who we can save imposes on us stringent duties to act.</p><p>Townsend spends the next few paragraphs remarking on the fact that we generally want to do good effectively and describing this as the motivation for effective altruism. Notably, she doesn\u2019t argue against it, or explain why anyone would accept these surprising-sounding conclusions\u2014which can be derived from <a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/longtermism-is-correct-part-1\"><u>simple axioms</u></a>\u2014but instead simply sneers at the odd-sounding implications. She ignores that Longtermism is just a small part of effective altruism, and that one can perfectly well donate to provide malaria nets without being a longtermist, which is what those suspicious of longtermism should do. She next says:</p><blockquote><p>At its heart, longtermism is only the dorky science-fiction version of the nineteenth-century classical utilitarianism that English philosophers John Stuart Mill.</p></blockquote><p>This is false! You don\u2019t have to be a utilitarian to be a longtermist. As long as you think that lives going well is one of the things that matters\u2014which is quite trivial\u2014then making sure that lives go well for literally quadrillions of beings is important. In fact, even if you don\u2019t think that, you should think that the risk of annihilation of life on earth, which experts consistently rate as being not terribly improbable, often giving it above a 10% chance of happening in the next century, is quite significant and worth working on. Thus, you don\u2019t even need to be a longtermist to be sympathetic to nearly everything done by longtermists.</p><p>After falsely claiming that effective altruism requires utilitarianism, Townsend attempts to provide an account of why people find utilitarianism attractive. Here account is totally implausible and amounts to little more than the claim that effective altruists just love numbers:</p><blockquote><p>But it continues to sound reasonable to us long after Mill\u2019s time because it appeals to our desire for solid ethical action in a simple and direct way: through insisting it can offer us mathematical <i>proof</i> that we have done good\u2014and because it exploits our native wish to be generous by offering us the possibility of rationalizing our own desire for comfort and extending its mathematical possibility to limitless, nameless others.</p></blockquote><p>Several points are in order. For one, the psychology of EA doesn\u2019t matter to the assessment of whether EA is good or bad\u2014worthwhile or pointless. It could be that all EAs give to effective charities because they think Sauron from lord of the rings told them so, and that would be sublimely irrelevant to a normative assessment of what effective altruism actually does. In assessing the desirability of some movement or group, one doesn\u2019t need to know anything about the psychology of its members.</p><p>For another, this seems like a wildly implausible psychological account of why people are sympathetic to EA or utilitarianism. If you talk to actually existing effective altruists and ask them, for instance, why they give away a sizeable portion of their lifetime earnings to charity, the answer you will get is never \u201cI just love arithmetic.\u201d Instead, they\u2019ll generally note that doing so allows them to help others a lot, to do extraordinary amounts of good, and that such opportunities to save dozens or hundreds of lives shouldn\u2019t be wasted. In fact, as anyone who witnessed the disaster of me taking calculus can attest, I have no great love of mathematics, yet I do still call myself an effective altruist and donate a sizeable chunk of my earnings to charities. Finally, Townsend gets to her core issue with effective altruism:</p><blockquote><p>But here\u2019s the problem: If your image of enacted goodness is entrusting resources to the person who is best at \u201crunning the numbers,\u201d you\u2019re assuming that person knows for sure <i>what</i> good to pursue with those resources. But it is impossible to simply \u201crun the numbers\u201d without being aware\u2014or perhaps suppressing one\u2019s awareness\u2014that there are unanswered questions left hanging, somewhere. As a contributor to the official EA forum <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/T975ydo3mx8onH3iS/ea-is-about-maximization-and-maximization-is-perilous\"><u>described</u></a> this exact problem shortly before FTX imploded, \u201cEA is about maximizing a property of the world that we\u2019re conceptually confused about, can\u2019t reliably define or measure, and have massive disagreements about even within EA.\u201d</p><p>. . .</p><p>The thing is, a moral claim like <i>forecasted changes in quality-adjusted life-years provide an objective measure of right action</i> sounds good because we are used to giving our trust to math and what is measurable by it; \u201cmaximization\u201d sounds good because if one number is good then two are better, ad infinitum. This is why the QALY sounds less fictional to us than more amorphous claims to goodness. To be sure, it offers more plausibly imagined numbers than people toss out when speculating about how many humans there will be in a million years. But the addition of mathematics to a problem does not make it more practically addressable. Rather, an invented or stipulated unit like QALY is a conceptual apparatus that makes something theoretical <i>appear </i>practical, where our sense of what is \u201ceffective\u201d is simply a better and shinier <i>theory</i>; and this is how the basic deception is practiced.</p></blockquote><p>But this problem avails any attempts to do good. Whenever one tries to better the world, there is a risk they\u2019re not doing any good or not doing the most good they can do. No one doubts that QALYs are an imperfect metric, and there can, of course, be mistaken judgments about the QALYs of some interventions.</p><p>But behind every QALY judgment is some intervention that saves or improves lives. It\u2019s hard to figure out which intervention will help people more. But that\u2019s a reason to think hard before deciding on what to do, rather than jettisoning the project entirely. The response to the difficulty of doing precise comparisons of the good cannot be to jettison effective giving entirely\u2014and give to whatever charity you heard a nice story about from NPR.</p><p>Imagine this feat of illogic being applied to any other domain. Suppose one was deciding how to treat their grandmother\u2019s cancer. They note that it\u2019s really hard to know which cancer treatments are most effective. And so their solution is to ignore effectiveness entirely! After noting how difficult it is to decide what is best for their grandparent\u2014how to trade off happy life vs slightly sickened life\u2014it would be sick and perverse to just throw up one\u2019s hands and not try to do what\u2019s best for their grandparents.</p><p>But the core insight of effective altruism is that we should do the same for strangers as we do for our loved ones. It may be hard to precisely calculate the effectiveness of various interventions, but when children are starving, dying of disease, and going blind, it is callous and cruel to just throw one\u2019s hands up and not even try to figure out what will help people the most. Because the faraway children matter just as much to their loved ones as our own children do to us.</p><blockquote><p>Unfortunately, there are fates worse than death, and goods that sit beyond merely staying alive longer. And almost every human good there is beyond mere accumulation of healthy days or years\u2014for instance, the goods of justice, love, truth, and compassion\u2014are not amenable to numbers, let alone predictable by dint of them. For a previous generation, the appeal of utilitarian comfort rested in part upon the conviction that human life was real while things like justice or dignity, not visible to the naked eye, were not. But this is not a supposition that we can afford these days. And the question of what happens to the life of the human you\u2019ve saved\u2014before and after they don\u2019t die from malaria, if indeed they don\u2019t happen to die from anything else\u2014is not something we can just leave alone. If you send a mosquito net to someone whose primary threats to healthy living include political oppression and genocide, something more is going on there than has been dreamt of in your philosophy.</p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s the entire rationale for QALYs. Because there are things that make a person\u2019s life worse without killing them, if we are going to try to do good we will need some method of comparison. That\u2019s why one of the top EA charities is primarily about averting blindness.</p><p>The final swing at EA in the article is perhaps the most bizarre:</p><blockquote><p>Latent fanaticism is present in any kind of morality that prioritizes \u201cmore\u201d good over the courageous challenge of doing the good present at hand, that denigrates <a href=\"https://www.plough.com/en/topics/culture/music/dolly-parton-is-magnificent\"><u>the beautifully good</u></a> in its pursuit of the unearthliness of <i>more</i>. And any morality that prioritizes the distant, whether the distant poor or the distant future, is a theoretical-fanaticism, one that cares more about the coherence of its own ultimate intellectual triumph\u2014and not getting its hands dirty\u2014than about the fate of human beings: muddy, hairy, smelly, messy people who, unlike figures in a ledger or participants in a seminar, will not thank you for handing them a dollar, and indeed, might be likelier to cuss you out for it, for the perfectly reasonable sake of their own dignity.</p></blockquote><p>But EA requires no fanaticism, and such fanatical reasoning is frequently criticized by effective altruists, including MacAskill. To think we should do more good rather than less, one need not think we should violate rights or conduct grossly immoral acts in pursuit of some ultimate aim.</p><p>The idea that caring about future people is fanatical is bizarre. There\u2019s no justification given for this claim in the article. Fanaticism is about what one is willing to do in pursuit of what they find valuable, not what they find valuable.</p><p>But the oddest idea is that caring about far-away people is fanatical. Any morality worth its salt will hold that where a person lives\u2014whether far away or nearby\u2014has nothing to do with our duty to help them. When a person boards a plane, my duties to them do not lessen the further away they fly. If we can help faraway people hundreds of times more than nearby ones, we ought to do so. For the faraway people are just as \u201cmuddy, hairy, smelly, messy,\u201d and far less likely to thank you.</p><p>The reason EA urges giving up one\u2019s money to help faraway people isn\u2019t because of some fanatical devotion to mathematics. EA treats faraway people the way we treat nearby ones. EA is not about what one looks like when they help others or whether; it is, as giving should be, about those we can help.</p><p>Throughout the entire article, there is not one mention of the people whose lives have been bettered by effective altruism. The <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/15/the-reluctant-prophet-of-effective-altruism\"><u>upwards of 100,000 people</u></a> who would have otherwise died from malaria who now will not because of effective altruism\u2019s bednet distribution. It\u2019s all very well to muse about abstract morality and take potshots at effective altruists who one perceives to be annoying, but when children are dying of diseases that affluent westerners can stop at minimal personal costs, then self-righteous defenses of why one has no duty to lift a finger to save the lives of children start to ring hollow, especially when combined with scorn towards those who do <i>anything</i> to address these horrifying problems. The motivation for effective altruism has nothing to do with the aesthetic that upsets Townsend so, and everything to do with the children like <a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/the-lives-we-can-save\"><u>Abdul</u></a> who would be sicker and blinder if EAs had done nothing, many of whom would be dead, to whom Townsend turns a blind eye, while sanctimoniously declaring that doing anything to help them would be \u201cfanatical.\u201d</p>", "user": {"username": "Omnizoid"}}, {"_id": "ZmpEZgi5cQMuf7b2p", "title": "Announcing EA Virtual Programs Pilot Biosecurity Book Club", "postedAt": "2023-09-27T01:35:37.386Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>EA Virtual Programs is starting a new pilot Biosecurity Book Club</strong></p><p>In this reading group, we will meet weekly to read and discuss the book Biosecurity Dilemmas, a book that has insights into the important trade-offs for biosecurity professionals, policy makers, researchers, and more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Project based, collaborative learning</strong></p><p>We will also work on and complete short biosecurity related projects, either individually or in small groups, with the guidance and support of facilitators.

None of the organizations with which I'm affiliated should be taken to endorse or support any particular conclusions or resources listed herein based on this post.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1><p>If you attended my talk at EAG London in May 2023, you may remember this basic narrative:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Insects might matter morally. There are a lot of them. We can use scientific evidence to make their lives better.</strong></p><p>This is the quick case I provide for working on insect welfare. Since that talk, I\u2019ve been encouraged by the amount of interest in the topic among members of the EA community, so many of whom want to learn about insects and their welfare in farmed, wild, and research contexts. The lives and capabilities of our planet\u2019s ~5.5 million species of insects are often surprising and quite<i>&nbsp;</i>poorly understood (even by entomologists!), which can lead us all to make empirically-unsupported assumptions about their sentience, capacity for welfare, and welfare concerns. Although there are many significant unknowns in the science of insect sentience and welfare, it is clear that if we want to help insects, we need to learn what we can about them.</p><p>Lots of advocates are doing just that: they\u2019re putting in the work to understand insects\u2019 nervous systems, behavior, and physiology\u2014as well as the scale and contexts of their use and management. I\u2019m heartened to see people take insects seriously. So, as an insect neurobiologist and physiologist by training, I want to do my part to make it easier to learn about these fascinating, diverse, and highly neglected animals.</p><p>This post is a quick, non-exhaustive, and lightly-annotated list of resources that can serve as a primer for folks interested in getting up to speed on insect pain, sentience, and welfare as of September 2023. For future readers, it also points toward some places where people can go for the most recent information on insect welfare and sentience.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope this guide is useful for introducing you to the topic \u2013 and for demonstrating that there is a lot of rigorous empirical, or otherwise expert, conversation currently happening on the topics of insect sentience and welfare.</p><h1><strong>Quick caveats</strong></h1><ul><li>The welfare-focused work on this list (as compared to the pain and sentience research) is skewed toward the work of Rethink Priorities, my collaborators\u2019 publications, and my own efforts. I\u2019m obviously biased, but I think these folks have done much of the most rigorous work in the space to date.&nbsp;</li><li>The list is biased towards biological information over, say, economic models or philosophical considerations. I\u2019m a biologist. It\u2019s also probably biased towards neurobiology and physiology over, say, ethology (though I\u2019ve tried hard to include behavioral resources, too).</li><li>The list is&nbsp;<i>intentionally&nbsp;</i>non-exhaustive\u2014it\u2019s a primer, not a research database (if you want that, check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.insectwelfare.com/research-library\"><u>this link here</u></a>)\u2014so you shouldn\u2019t expect these resources to provide a complete overview of everything you might need to contribute meaningfully to the conversation on insect sentience or welfare.</li><li>This list won\u2019t be updated regularly. It\u2019s the list \u2018as of September 2023\u2019. The insect welfare and sentience space is starting to move faster, so this may be seriously out of date within a year or two.&nbsp;</li><li>Not all work on this list is peer-reviewed (at least in the traditional, academic sense).&nbsp;</li><li>Inclusion doesn\u2019t equal endorsement. Instead, inclusion on this list is an expression of confidence that either (1) there\u2019s something of value to the work conducted therein or (2) it is an important part of the history and debate of the discipline.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h1><strong>Insect Sentience and Capacity for Welfare</strong></h1><p>By far the most rigorous and up-to-date work on insect pain/sentience is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065280622000170\"><u>Gibbons et al. 2022</u></a> (<i>Advances in Insect Physiology</i>) which reviews over 350 studies across six orders of insects and two life stages.

Participants developed forecasts on questions related to existential and catastrophic risk, as well as other questions on humanity\u2019s future. A public survey of college graduates (largely from the UK and US) was also conducted alongside the XPT, which included a subset of XPT questions.</p><p>Participants in the XPT made individual forecasts and were encouraged to develop written rationales for their forecasts. Participants were later grouped into teams to discuss their forecasts and develop a team forecast. Teams were asked to combine their rationales into a team wiki describing the strongest argument for the team\u2019s median forecast, along with rationales for lower- and higher-end forecasts that they considered plausible, and describing key areas of disagreement and uncertainty.</p><p>Further detail on the tournament and the overall results are available in this <a href=\"https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf\"><u>report</u></a>.

Their median prediction of the year of human extinction was the year 15,000 [90% CI: 2250, 1,640,000], and they predicted that there would be 500 billion future humans [11.7 billion, 100 trillion]].&nbsp;XPT experts predicted 6261 as the median year of extinction [2080, 4,750,000], and 135 billion future humans [6.19 billion, 170 trillion]. Respondents to the public survey were notably more pessimistic than XPT participants: the median public prediction put the year of human extinction at 2500, and the number of future humans at 9 billion. This prediction of the number of future humans seems overly pessimistic, even assuming a year of human extinction of 2500.

These included:</p><ul><li>Starting with a base rate for species extinction and adjusting for factors that would suggest human extinction risk deviates from this base rate. Several base rates were suggested, including the average lifespan of a mammalian species and the average lifespan of a hominid species. Adjustment was usually based on estimated impact of technology.</li><li>Combining estimates of extinction risk in different periods to develop a forecast (e.g. for the next century and then beyond).</li><li>Combining probability estimates of humanity reaching different milestones (e.g. interstellar travel).</li><li>Using the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_argument\"><u>Doomsday Argument</u></a>, a statistical argument for the expected total population of humans using the number of humans born to date, and combining this with birth rates to come to an expected year of extinction.</li></ul><p>Most forecasters developed their estimate for the number of future humans by combining their expected duration of humanity\u2019s future with estimates of the future birth rate. Others used the Doomsday Argument.</p><p>The areas of disagreement were the degree of existential risk posed by technology (especially AI), the plausibility of the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/time-of-perils\"><u>time-of-perils hypothesis</u></a>, the likelihood of interstellar travel, and whether technological change would see post-human beings emerge.</p><p>The public survey did not gather rationales for predictions, so it is unclear what assumptions are driving the low estimates from respondents.</p><h1>Attitudes in America</h1><p>Several XPT questions asked about the attitudes of Americans.

On motivation, some forecasters suggested that there aren\u2019t political or economic incentives to create such a colony. However others suggested that the desires of billionaires may be sufficient for this to occur. Others also suggested that economic incentives may become apparent in the future. On feasibility, some referred to previous difficulties in establishing colonies in inhospitable places (e.g., Antarctica), but more optimistic forecasters pointed to the potential for rapid technological advancement to overcome challenges.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>The questions discussed in this post involve a high degree of uncertainty. Amongst XPT participants, and respondents to the public survey, there was substantial variation in individual forecasts on these questions. However, there are a few interesting patterns in these results. Notably, the college graduates we surveyed were generally more pessimistic about humanity\u2019s future than XPT forecasters. This was most obvious in the forecasts on the number of humans who will be born from 2023 onward and the year of human extinction. Unfortunately, we did not collect data on rationales for these forecasts, so the causes of this pessimism are unclear.</p><p>Compared to superforecasters, XPT experts were generally more pessimistic about humanity\u2019s future, predicting lower numbers of future human lives, an earlier date of human extinction, lower reported happiness amongst Americans, an earlier date of when most Americans would wish they had been born in an earlier generation, and an earlier date for when most Americans would choose not to have children due to concerns about the future. One area where experts were more optimistic was in the proportion of people living under an autocratic regime.</p><p>The team rationales showed the variety of considerations that XPT forecasters used to generate forecasts and there was substantial disagreement on many topics. One prominent area of disagreement was about the impacts of AI, particularly the degree of extinction risk it poses, but also the likelihood of AI enabling progress, and whether it would promote or suppress autocracy.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn4l5ligmfima\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref4l5ligmfima\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;For these questions, \u201chumans\u201d were defined as biological creatures who (A) can be traced back genealogically, via a chain of live births, to 2022 humans OR (B) could mate with 2022 humans and produce viable offspring OR (C) would be identified as Homo by at least 50% of a hypothetical panel of 100 randomly selected professors of biology from 2022, sampled from major universities.

This approach stems from a significant gap between the number of active Effective Altruists (EAs) and the broader pool of all EAs. According to the 2019 EA Survey, there are approximately 7,500 active EAs compared to the 150,000 subscribers to the 80,000 Hours newsletter. Subscribing to the newsletter suggests an interest in EA concepts and potential alignment with EA-related work. While not everyone from this group will engage, there are still only about 700 job postings on 80,000 Hours. So it seems that the community needs a more efficient means to engage individuals who might lose interest without sustained momentum.</p><h2><strong>Potential alternatives that would address the labor mismatch:</strong></h2><p>- I could explore the possibility of supporting EA organizational development, which could result in the creation of more job opportunities.</p><p>- ???

Thanks to Joseph Bloom and Denizhan Akar for feedback, and major thank you to all of our wonderful TAs and the MATS London team\u2013 your positive contributions to the program have been innumerable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><h2><strong>TL;DR</strong></h2><p>We ran a bootcamp aimed at teaching people ML engineering for alignment. The goal was to prepare people for the current alignment landscape, both technically and career-wise. Our three primary goals were:</p><ol><li>Technical Upskilling</li><li>Alignment Career Acceleration</li><li>Improving Inside Views</li></ol><p>We think these goals were successfully achieved overall - we noticed significant improvements in our participants ability as well as their career opportunities, and we received positive feedback on the course (with some variance between different sections). We aim to run the program again, though with some changes.&nbsp;</p><p>If you just want to skim this post, some of the most important sections (in our view) are:</p><ul><li><strong>What we would do differently </strong>(x3), where we discuss the ways we plan to adjust the program in the future to better achieve each of the three goals above.</li><li><strong>Considerations for running ARENA again</strong>, where we summarize a few arguments for / against further iterations of ARENA.</li><li><strong>Capstone Projects</strong>, where we give a brief description of the capstone projects some of our participants worked on at the end of the program (which generally far exceeded our expectations).</li><li><strong>APPENDIX: Summary of planned structural changes to ARENA</strong>, where we discuss the changes to the curriculum we're planning for future iterations.</li></ul><hr><h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1><p><a href=\"https://www.arena.education/\"><u>ARENA</u></a> (Alignment Research Engineer Accelerator) had its second iteration from the 22nd of May to the 30th of June (duration 6 weeks). The program covered the fundamentals of neural networks, transformers and mechanistic interpretability, reinforcement learning, training at scale, and a capstone project for students to advance their work independently.</p><p>The project was oriented around three goals:</p><ol><li>To help participants learn relevant machine learning skills for alignment research.</li><li>To help produce people who wanted to work in alignment and help them make the relevant career steps.</li><li>To help participants inform their own views about different alignment agendas.</li></ol><p>This report is an analysis of how we attempted to achieve each goal, how we measure our success, and what we might do differently in the future.&nbsp;</p><hr><h1><strong>Goal One: Technical Upskilling</strong></h1><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How we aimed to achieve this</strong></h2><p>The main theory of impact for the program was upskilling participants. For the most part, this was done through the content of the program itself. This is easily also the most straightforward goal to achieve: we aimed to provide participants a place where they could spend at least 240 hours thinking just about alignment, upskilling.</p><p>The curriculum was based on a combination of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum/tree/master\"><u>Jacob Hilton\u2019s deep learning curriculum</u></a>, Redwood Research\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.redwoodresearch.org/mlab\"><u>Machine Learning for Alignment Bootcamp</u></a>, and feedback from the first iteration of ARENA (which also drew a lot of inspiration from both of these courses). It was divided up into four main chapters of content:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Prerequisites (5 days), </strong>which covers several ML basics, including neural networks, training, optimization, and backpropagation.</li><li><strong>Transformers &amp; Mechanistic Interpretability&nbsp;(8 days), </strong>which starts with building a transformer from scratch, and then goes through a sample of work in mechanistic interpretability, much of it based on Neel Nanda\u2019s open-source material.</li><li><strong>Reinforcement Learning&nbsp;(7 days), </strong>which covers the basics of RL theory, before moving through tabular learning, DQN, PPO, and RLHF.</li><li><strong>Training at Scale&nbsp;(4 days), </strong>which was designed as an introduction to topics like GPUs, parallelism, distributed training, etc.</li></ol><p>Like MLAB, the course placed a lot of emphasis on exercises, so that participants knew how to use these skills rather than just reading about them. We also had participants work on capstone projects at the end of the program, which we\u2019ll discuss more later in this document.</p><p>Hands-on engineering experience is a massive bottleneck for starting a career in AI safety. Academic programs are far behind the cutting edge (our participants reported not learning about things like transformer architecture in their undergraduate courses), and independently upskilling is often challenging, or under-resourced. We aimed to provide both a challenging, up-to-date curriculum, a space where people could learn in a group, and have access to experienced TAs. Participants also benefited from in-person pair programming.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How we measured this</strong></h2><h3>Survey Data</h3><p>Our primary and most immediate sources of data about the program were our feedback forms. While this is subjective, it also allows us to more directly and immediately address our biggest concerns. For raw data, one can look in the appendix at some graphs that record people\u2019s responses.&nbsp;</p><h3>Capstones</h3><p>Participants\u2019 capstone projects were a chance for them to test their abilities to delve more in depth into specific subjects of the material that was covered. Rather than structured, pre-written exercises, a successful capstone project would show that the participants understood the material in such depth that they could work on it and engage with it unsupervised. See later in this document for a summary of some particularly impressive capstone projects.</p><h3>Difficulties Measuring</h3><p>There is some difficulty measuring the counterfactual impact we had. There are other programs in which participants can learn these skills, and some resources available online. However, programs are competitive to the extent that it\u2019s valuable to provide more opportunities, and online learning is often less rigorous or good for networking.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Whether we were successful</strong></h2><h3>Surveys</h3><p>Overall, we feel the program did a good job upskilling participants, despite some variations across different sections of the curriculum. This sentiment is supported by our survey data. We asked participants \u2018What was the main thing that you hoped you would learn from the program? How well did you learn this thing?\u2019 Answers included:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Learn about/become more familiar with transformer architecture</li><li>Mechanistic Interpretability Tools: Probing, TransformerLens</li><li>Training At Scale: Slurm</li><li>General intuitions and familiarity with research agendas/tools/best practices for alignment and machine learning</li><li>RL: RLHF&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The majority of our survey respondents said that their expectations were fulfilled, and that they learned what they had set out to learn. However, those that said they wanted to learn about Training at Scale and RLHF felt like they learned a little, but could have been given a deeper understanding. Particularly, <strong>they would have preferred more of a from-first-principles approach, rather than working with pre-existing libraries which abstracted away the details which are crucial for developing understanding</strong>.</p><p>We also asked our participants to rank each section based on various criteria, 1-10, 1 being the least, 10 the most. There are various conclusions one could draw from this data, we have included graphs representing participants\u2019 answers. However, a short summary:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Transformers and Mechanistic Interpretability was the most favorably reviewed section, with a median score of 9/10 on being both \u2018intellectually challenging\u2019 and \u2018well-structured material.\u2019&nbsp;</li><li>Most participants said that they would not have been able to counterfactually learn Transformers and Mechanistic Interpretability or Training at Scale without Arena (rated this 8/10)</li><li>Generally, Training and Scale and Reinforcement Learning were reviewed the lowest. The median scores for 'intellectually challenging' were 7/10 for both, but the median scores for 'well-structured material' was just 5 and 6 respectively.</li></ul><h3>Capstone Projects</h3><p><strong>The capstone projects significantly exceeded our expectations, with several participants continuing to work on their capstones long after the program finished</strong>. A sample of capstone projects which we found particularly impressive and exciting:</p><ul><li><strong>Localizing goal misgeneralization in a maze-solving policy network.</strong> This work attempts to understand how goal misgeneralization happens in the same network which was&nbsp;investigated by Alex Turner et al. Writeup can be found <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vY9oE39tBupZLAyoC/localizing-goal-misgeneralization-in-a-maze-solving-policy\">here</a>. Mentors: Joseph Bloom, Paul Colognese.</li><li><strong>Understanding the Information Flow inside Large Language Models.</strong> The internal flow of information inside language models was investigated. Conclusions were drawn related to how relevant information is stored and aggregated across sequence positions in long prompts. Alex Variengien as mentor. Writeup can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/xNgdJEep9DQQWhSbv/understanding-the-information-flow-inside-large-language\"><u>here</u></a>.</li><li><strong>Automated Persona-Modulation Attacks on LLMs.&nbsp;</strong>This work investigated persona-modulation attacks, which leverage the tendency of LLMs to act as particular characters (personas) to circumvent misuse safeguards. An automated version of this attack was developed, which successfully makes GPT-4, Claude 2, and Vicuna 33B produce harmful completions, tested across 43 misuse categories. Quentin Feuillade-Montixi and Stephen Casper as mentors.</li><li><strong>Probing model activations for truthfulness.</strong> Using methodologies from the Inference-Time Intervention work to investigate \u201ctruth directions\u201d in GPT2-XL on the TQA dataset.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What we would do differently</strong></h2><h3>Improve Training at Scale &amp; RLHF content.&nbsp;</h3><p>Specifically, we intend to focus more on implementing things from scratch, in order to properly build understanding. The training at scale material will no longer be its own chapter, but instead the most crucial parts of that chapter will be moved into other chapters.</p><p>More generally, we think that a large factor in the drop-off in ratings for the last two chapters was that the material was less extensively user-tested (unlike the first two chapters). This is something we are working to address in future iterations, by requesting more feedback from people with domain-specific knowledge.</p><h3>Better metrics for measuring project success</h3><p>Each section had unstructured exercises for participants to explore on their own. We would find some metric on which to test their success, so we could see how well they\u2019ve learned through methods other than self-reporting.&nbsp;</p><p>Particularly, we think we should have more standardized requirements for reporting on their capstone projects, so we could test for independent research skill as well as depth of understanding. We would in the future want a method to evaluate each project on</p><ul><li>Depth of understanding</li><li>Originality</li><li>Team collaboration and organization</li><li>Clarity of communication and explanation of results, replicability</li><li>Research Engineering skills and good practice in code</li></ul><hr><h2><strong>Goal Two: Alignment Career Acceleration</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How we aimed to achieve this</strong></h2><h3>Networking Opportunities</h3><p>Between the other participants and TAs, as well as the many other alignment researchers working out of the MATS London office, and the speakers that we brought in, the participants would get the opportunity to meet people who would be advantageous to their career. Breaking into any field without personal connections is challenging; We believed our participants would benefit from the ability to meet others at varying different stages of their careers. In particular, this helps with having a clearer idea of who is working on similar research agendas, or knowing people who could introduce them to people working on similar research agendas. For example, most of our participants had a 1-on-1 discussion with Joseph Bloom, to discuss their capstone projects &amp; broader questions around independent research.</p><h3>Talks from alignment professionals</h3><p>Throughout the program, we invited several professionals to come speak at Arena. We tried to speak with a variety of workers, including safety work at capabilities labs, academia, independent research, and safety-focused organizations. In addition to this, we had people come speak specifically on not just their work, but specific career paths one could take. We hoped that we would be able to provide participants with an inside view of what kinds of research one can do at different organizations and gauge personal fit.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How we measured this</strong></h2><h3>Survey</h3><p>Again, our exit survey provides useful data about whether or not people feel as though their careers have been accelerated by this program. We tried to engineer the survey to avoid people subjectively self-reporting. In addition, our application had several questions about people\u2019s career goals, so, while their goals might have been updated during the program, this still functions as a good standard against which to measure any career progress.&nbsp;</p><h3>Follow up meetings with participants</h3><p>We plan on reaching out to participants in about six months and seeing what they are doing. At this point, we would want to gauge whether having participated in ARENA was beneficial to getting hired at their current position, and whether the skills they learned at ARENA were useful in their current position, and the network they built while at ARENA has been useful for career opportunities and projects.</p><h3>Full time roles secured by participants</h3><p>Directly after the program ended, recruiters from both OpenAI and Anthropic reached out to ARENA to ask if there were any participants in the program who we were excited about or thought might be a good fit for working there - we consider this a positive signal that the skills ARENA are trying to provide are ones that these orgs are interested in hiring for. We will also see how many participants go on to be hired by highly competitive labs; if this number is high then we will consider this a success on our part. This is a signal which might take some time to come through however, especially since many of our participants were undergraduates during the program, and will not have jobs until at least a year or two after completing ARENA.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Whether we were successful</strong></h2><h3>Survey results</h3><p>In our application, we asked what would be most helpful for people\u2019s career goals. We then put the more common answers in a question that asked them to rank how much they agreed that Arena had helped them meet that goal. The goals were&nbsp;</p><ul><li>After ARENA, I feel as though I have more valuable connections in the Alignment Field<ul><li>13 strongly agreed, 2 agreed, 1 disagreed</li></ul></li><li>I am more confident that I am a good fit for the alignment field after having completed ARENA<ul><li>5 strongly agreed, 7 agreed, 3 were neutral, and 1 disagreed.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>I have gained practical skills that I would need to thrive in my ideal job<ul><li>14 strongly agree, 2 agree</li></ul></li><li>After doing my Capstone project, I have a clearer idea of what independent research looks like, and feel better prepared for it.<ul><li>9 strongly agree, 3 agree, 3 are neutral</li></ul></li><li>I have gleaned more knowledge on the specific subjects that were bottlenecking me on my career plans as a researcher<ul><li>8 strongly agree, 4 agree, 3 are neutral, 1 disagrees.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><p>We also asked people to self-report the biggest updates to their career plans that they\u2019d made during the program. Broadly, the most common responses were:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Realizing how much they valued working in a collaborative, alignment oriented environment like Arena</li><li>Being more interested in doing governance work<ul><li>This is a bit of an update for us. While we value governance work very highly, we did aim to produce people who wanted to work in technical safety.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Being more confident in their skill set, feeling more prepared to take next steps</li><li>Being more interested in applying for grants for independent research.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The final relevant question on our exit survey was asking people about their next steps. Broadly, each participant reported doing one or more of the following:</p><ul><li>Returning to their undergraduate/graduate program in the fall</li><li>Completing a short research fellowship after Arena (defined as working with a mentor at an institution in depth on one specific AI safety project, as opposed to upskilling or working independently)</li><li>Continuing their capstone project independently</li><li>Applying for grants and researching independently</li><li>Applying to labs/safety orgs</li></ul><h3>Follow up meetings with participants</h3><p>See previous section, where we discuss this.</p><h3>Full time roles secured by participants</h3><p>As mentioned, we don\u2019t expect this to provide a strong signal immediately. However, we have already had one of our participants hired by OpenAI\u2019s DC Evals team, and another who reached the final rounds of DeepMind\u2019s Research Engineering interview process. This already seems like somewhat strong positive evidence that we were successful in our goal.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What we would do differently</strong></h2><p>We would like for us to be able to provide more specific advice to our participants. If possible, we would like to expand our network of organizations doing safety work in London that our participants&nbsp; could speak to, compile a list of universities that have good graduate programs for safety work, or provide other more clear career recommendations for them.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, there was a higher quantity of people who left the program more interested in governance than when they came in. Since it is high value that there are technically informed people who work in governance, we might dedicate time to thinking about what governance agendas we are most optimistic about, to running reading groups for governance papers or having policy-oriented speakers.</p><hr><h1><strong>Goal Three: Improving Inside Views&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How we aimed to achieve this</strong></h2><h3>Reading Groups/Talks</h3><p>We intended to facilitate in depth discussions through reading groups and talks from researchers. This way, participants would be deeply exposed to the intricacies of various views on alignment, from multiple perspectives. Reading groups would give them a chance to have structured discussions about specific topics, and talks would give them a chance to see things from a specific perspective.&nbsp;</p><h3>Independent Research</h3><p>When working on their capstone projects and some of the unstructured exercises, participants should have gotten to see how certain alignment related theories work in practice, and test if they think the theories empirically function the way they would like. We feel this is a crucial part of the ARENA program; to be able to engage with alignment agendas in an hands-on way rather than just reading about them.</p><h3>Informal Social Discussion</h3><p>There is a lot of value in having a space where people can consistently share their views with their peers, who are thinking intensely about the same problems.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How we measured this</strong></h2><p>Our exit survey asks some questions about how participants have changed their mind or updated throughout the program, it also asks for some general information about alignment views. It is somewhat difficult to measure whether we have succeeded here, as there isn\u2019t really a \u2018correct\u2019 belief here.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What we would do differently</strong></h2><h3>Broader focus of the alignment-related course content (not just mech interp)</h3><p>Of all the alignment agendas in this course (either in exercises or discussed in reading groups), mechanistic interpretability took up a very large fraction of total time. There are some good reasons for this: mechanistic interpretability has good feedback loops, helps to convey many of the most difficult parts of current alignment research, can be researched without masses of prior knowledge or access to compute, has many open problems, etc. However, we still feel that the course could be a lot more balanced.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6FkWnktH3mjMAxdRT/what-i-would-do-if-i-wasn-t-at-arc-evals#Creating_concrete_projects_and_research_agendas\"><u>Part of the reason</u></a> mechanistic interpretability is so popular with new researchers is the abundance of educational material from programs like ARENA, and we strongly believe that ARENA is in an ideal position to cover other subfields of technical AI safety with just as much depth.</p><p>We will be updating the core content of ARENA in two main ways (1) putting a greater focus on techniques related to model internals which are not just interpretability (e.g. inference-time intervention), and (2) more focus on other alignment agendas such as adversarial training and scalable oversight, especially via the capstone projects / paper replication which will come at the end of the course.</p><h3>Reading Groups/Talks</h3><p>In general, we think that this element of the program was not as organized as we\u2019d have liked, and it could have benefited from a more concrete vision of what we want to discuss, and how to link that to the curriculum. We plan to do this next time, and to this end we\u2019ve planned out a concrete set of reading materials for each week, which tie in directly to the core program content. For example, the reading groups will cover topics like reward misspecification and IDA while the participants are implementing RLHF.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Considerations for running ARENA again&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>In this section, we address a few different considerations relevant for whether we will be running the program again. Some of these points have already been discussed earlier, but this should provide a short overview of what we think are the most important ones.</p><h2><strong>Cost</strong></h2><p>The program was quite expensive to run. In the current climate, funding is a tradeoff that requires a lot of attention. Creating good alignment researchers feels like one of the most important problems to be putting money towards, but at the same time, we think we could capture most of the program\u2019s value on a much tighter budget in the future. We have concrete plans for reducing the cost of the program, if we were to run it again (for example, we will be working with the London Initiative for Safe AI which has now attained office space in London, which will bring down the cost per desk from the previous iteration).</p><h2><strong>Number of open positions of the kind we\u2019re skilling up for</strong></h2><p>An important consideration is whether there are enough full time roles in technical AI alignment to provide for the people who are going through our program. Roles at the top safety labs are rare and highly competitive. That said, we still feel that there are enough roles and demand for highly skilled individuals to fill these roles to make ARENA worthwhile (one of our participants being hired by OpenAI\u2019s DC Evals team, and one reaching the final round for Research Engineering at DeepMind, provides some evidence for this).</p><p>A pathway we\u2019re also excited about is moving from ARENA to other programs which will help participants develop as independent researchers, for examples&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/seri-mats\"><u>SERI MATS</u></a> (which will be opening applications later this year), or the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/r5kffvkLfknn9yojW/announcing-the-era-cambridge-summer-research-fellowship\"><u>ERA Cambridge Summer Research Fellowship</u></a> (which multiple participants in ARENA 2.0&nbsp; went on to do once the program finished). We hope that many of these people will continue developing into strong researchers, possibly even being able to start their own organizations (see Marius Hobbahn\u2019s recent post, making the case for there being&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MhudbfBNQcMxBBvj8/there-should-be-more-ai-safety-orgs\"><u>more AI safety orgs</u></a>).</p><h2><strong>Ability of other EA groups to run similar programs</strong></h2><p>If other groups are interested in running programs like ARENA, they might be able to benefit from the material which has been created for ARENA. We have already been contacted by several individuals / groups who are interested in this, including:</p><ul><li>Prospective organizers of a mechanistic interpretability program in Southeast Asia,</li><li>Several Europe-based EA organizers during the EAGxBerlin conference,</li><li>The ML4Good program (who requested the use of parts of the ARENA material in their most recent iteration).</li></ul><p>Running in-person versions of ARENA can multiply these benefits, because it\u2019s one of the most effective ways of getting rapid feedback on the material.</p><h2><strong>Other ways ARENA can scale / add value</strong></h2><p>There are several other ways we feel ARENA can provide value, other than in-person programs:</p><ul><li>Many people have studied the material virtually (we now have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/arena-la82367/shared_invite/zt-1uvoagohe-JUv9xB7Vr143pdx1UBPrzQ\"><u>Slack group</u></a> with over 300 members). We\u2019ve continued adding to the available content, (e.g. exercises implementing PPO on MuJoCo &amp; Atari environments), as well as creating more virtual resources such as support for study groups.</li><li>The materials were also shared by some prominent alignment researchers (e.g. being tweeted by Neel Nanda &amp; retweeted by Chris Olah). The number of unique visitors to the site hosting the exercises is now over 2800.</li><li>We\u2019ve started a series of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/EYjH8M5KLmjuNtJEj\"><u>Monthly Algorithmic Problems in Mechanistic Interpretability</u></a>, to accompany the chapter of ARENA on transformers &amp; interpretability.&nbsp;</li><li>The ARENA material was also used extensively by Neel Nanda\u2019s SERI MATS cohort during the training phase (6/15 participants in this cohort rated it as one of the top 3 most helpful resources for them).</li><li>Many SERI MATS participants were interested in studying the material while we were sharing office space with them, and we feel this is something we can continue to do while we\u2019re working in the same office space as the London MATS cohort (which we will be if we run a third iteration later this year).</li></ul><p>As we mentioned in the previous point, running ARENA in person is one of the fastest ways we can get feedback on the program &amp; iterate, so all these points either directly or indirectly benefit from more in-person ARENA cohorts. However, they probably make the in-person program slightly less valuable relative to the virtual resources<i> </i>(not necessarily less valuable in absolute terms).</p><hr><h2><strong>APPENDIX: Survey Data</strong></h2><p><br><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/C7DbrkCpSe4AdcMek/r6piiqpixtlponhu85aw\" alt=\"Forms response chart.

Read that first if you'd like. But the basic idea is that we can pass otherwise unpassable policies by agreeing today that we will enforce them in the future. (In that article, I said a 100-year delay, but I probably should have made it 50 years.)</p>\n<h1>Are these contracts enforceable? Yes.</h1>\n<p>Most commenters believed this delay to be unworkable. Surely there\u2019s no way to force a government to hold to promises made 50 years ago. Right?</p>\n<p>Well, here\u2019s my attempted solution to the reneging problem in the case of land value taxes.</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say the government issues $1 trillion of what are essentially inflation-adjusted perpetuities, except upon the institution of the delayed law, they cease to pay out. (Unless the law is instituted before the 50-year period, in which case, they only cease to pay out after 50 years.) If the law is not instituted, then they continue to be perpetuities.</p>\n<p>So the future government can either enact the policy and get their debt wiped for free, or they can continue to pay the debt. If reneging is guaranteed, we\u2019re essentially just selling regular perpetuities. No big deal; we pay a fair interest rate. If there\u2019s a no chance of reneging, we\u2019re selling a kind of annuity, and we will still pay a fair interest rate.</p>\n<p>And there is basically no chance of reneging: name a government that wouldn\u2019t accept the offer to wipe their debt without consequence. So at no cost to ourselves, we can offer the future government a trillion dollars, but only if they do the right thing. All we do is issue \u201cenforcement perpetuities\u201d instead of issue regular debt, whenever today\u2019s government needs liquidity.</p>\n<p>But let\u2019s say the worst-case scenario occurs: we actually sold perpetuities (the future government is going to renege) but the market thought we were selling a 50-year annuity, so they paid less than it was worth. How much less? Since cashflows occurring more than 50 years into the future are discounted by at least 1+d to the 50th power, not very much. As unlikely as it is to ever happen, it\u2019s not that bad of a financial mistake on our part.</p>\n<p>So if everything goes to plan, aren\u2019t the landowners losing money here? Again, not really, due to the money being discounted by 50 years. But if you want to correct that rounding error, here\u2019s how you do it. Upon selling the enforcement perpetuities, the government splits the ownership of all property into two assets: land and buildings. So if you own a house, now you own the house itself, as well as a financial asset for the land underneath it. The land asset pays off a cashflow equal to the land value tax (if you\u2019re taxed $1000 on Jan 1st, the government pays you $1000 on the same day). Now, some of the money raised from the enforcement perpetuities can be immediately used to buy those land assets from all current landowners at the fair present value. And since the land assets only start paying cashflows after 50 years, they cost very little.</p>\n<p>Whether that\u2019s the best solution or not, I don\u2019t know. Even if there\u2019s something wrong with the contract I just laid out, I would be shocked if there were not a way to do this correctly. I\u2019m sure there are plenty of creative solutions.</p>\n<p>I think this idea for an enforcement perpetuity works generally, but passing laws that can only be reversed via supermajority is also plausible (though I\u2019m not a legal expert, so this with a grain of salt). For the America\u2019s terrible presidential voting system, you could make a constitutional amendment requiring a unanimous vote to overturn it. The amendment would say something like \u201cThe electoral system will switch to system X on Jan 1st 2073\u201d.</p>\n<h1>How do you know which policies will be good in the future?</h1>\n<p>Someone asked me what policies I would have advocated for 50 years ago, and whether they are still good policies today. I responded that we didn\u2019t have a theoretical foundation for what makes a policy optimal at that point. Given that, there is no policy I would have tried to have advocated for in this way (even though the land value tax was invented before 1879).</p>\n<p>I\u2019m actually in the middle of writing a series that lays out those theoretical foundations, which you can read here: <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NbK7ENNDRxefcZttt/the-benevolent-ruler-s-handbook-part-1-the-policy-problem\">The Benevolent Ruler\u2019s Handbook (Part 1): The Policy Problem</a>. I\u2019ll probably make a future post on how exactly that series applies to this policy idea.</p>\n<p>That said, this delay strategy is definitely a last resort. If you can implement a good policy today, then do that. But if you face insurmountable road blocks, and you know the policy is optimal by some reasonable definition (again, read the linked articles), then it may very well be the best option available to you.</p>\n<h1>On silliness</h1>\n<p>As a side note, another problem people had was that the idea seems \u201csilly\u201d. To my mind, anything that solves a big problem is not silly, but I\u2019ll take them at their word. I assume they say this only because no one has done it before. In December, putting a dead tree in your house and covering it with lights doesn\u2019t seem silly because it\u2019s something that everyone does. The first successful instance of this will be much harder than every other attempt.</p>\n<h1>Have I changed my mind?</h1>\n<p>So I still stand by my claim that this tactic of delayed policy is something with a lot of potential, and that we should try it.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "FCCC"}}, {"_id": "pydpzj9sxcdSsAngr", "title": "New page on animal welfare on Our World in Data", "postedAt": "2023-09-25T22:08:10.511Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Our team at Our World in Data just launched a <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/animal-welfare\">new page on animal welfare</a>!

This post, my first ever post on the EA forum, is inspired by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZYPTdny6iuKTZhC8A/three-lessons-i-ve-learnt-from-starting-a-small-ea-org\"><u>Three lessons I've learnt from starting a small EA org</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/eCKhhWXa25TcecZbJ/why-and-how-to-start-a-pilot-project-in-ea\"><u>Why and how to start a pilot project in EA</u></a> - so thank you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/ben-williamson?from=post_header\">Ben Williamson</a>.</p><p>The purpose of this post is to [1] document my journey publicly (hopefully to inspire others who are thinking they want to start a side project, or apply to CE, or go down the path of charity entrepreneurship), [2] maximize feedback as per<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZYPTdny6iuKTZhC8A/three-lessons-i-ve-learnt-from-starting-a-small-ea-org\"><u> Ben\u2019s post</u></a>&nbsp;<i>(both directly through the post (in the comments) and indirectly (people who reach out privately with additional suggestions/ advice))</i>, and [3] share key lessons &amp; milestones to hopefully contribute to the forum via actual work examples.</p><p>The hope is that it is going to be a follow along post sequence, as my co-founder&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/peter-s-park\"><u>Dr. Peter S. Park</u></a> and I get our nonprofit startup up and running.</p><p>Though the journey with EA has only been 2 months, I already have so many people to thank who have answered questions, provided feedback and pointed me in the right direction. I am forever grateful for you :)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Catalyst: The Layoff that Sparked My Journey</h2><p>I first found out about Effective Altruism from my Google search about impactful tithing. As a Christian, I have been tithing 10% of my income for many years, but because I was laid off from shortage of work in my previous marketing role, I was interested in finding more impactful ways to give due to our now lowered family income.</p><p>This is when I stumbled upon&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZuxtR4YpebXQqsjXa/a-new-strategy-for-broadening-the-appeal-of-effective-giving\"><u>GivingMultiplier.org</u></a> and was introduced to the idea of super-effective charities. I was intrigued by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XdSgum2LcQyvvjryr/giving-multiplier-after-14-months\">their approach</a> where you can still give from the heart (your favorite charity), but at the same time incentivizes you to give more to super-effective charities by matching your donations (the higher % you give to super-effective charities, the higher the matching rate). The concept of super-effective charities was so intriguing, I read through all eight \u201cwebsites we recommend\u201d (most notably EA and 80k).</p><p>With the gift of time of no longer being at a full-time job, this began my deep dive into EA. I was ecstatic when I found out about the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://charityentrepreneurship.com\"><u>CharityEntrepreneurship.com</u></a> (CE) incubator program within the first week on the EA forum, as I have always had the dream of starting a non-profit to help in bettering the world. The dream of doing high-impact work was born 19+ years ago since co-leading fundraisers in my high school years. My eyes were opened to how first world dollars can have a major positive impact in the developing world, when what seemed like a small amount of funds raised actually built new schools in Tibet.</p><p>After about a week, I knew I had found a group of likeminded people who care about doing good in the world while effectively using our limited resources. My job lay off was a blessing before finding EA because I was able to spend more time with my kids. Then after learning about EA, the lay off turned out to be an opportunistic time to shift my career to doing high-impact work, changing my dormant dream into a (hopefully) reality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Effective Altruism Influence</h2><p>Throughout the last two months, the first material I read through was the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/f7D4spNoAYqhFfbBz/announcing-the-new-80-000-hours-career-guide-by-benjamin\"><u>80000 Hours Career Guide</u></a>. Then, because I found out about CE so soon in my EA journey and I knew I wanted to apply to the incubator, the rest of the 200+ hours towards my metaphorical undergraduate degree in Effective Altruism (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/QxCpXjGmHbpX45nxo/how-to-increase-your-odds-of-starting-a-career-in-charity\"><u>suggested here</u></a>) was trying to get through as many resources as I can highlighted below (I broke the 3 lists into to-do items to systemize the process):</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/applicant-resources\"><u>https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/applicant-resources</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/post/how-to-increase-your-odds-for-ce\"><u>https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/post/how-to-increase-your-odds-for-ce</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MFyQzn6eNgDyvnfde/so-you-want-to-be-a-charity-entrepreneur-read-these-first\"><u>https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MFyQzn6eNgDyvnfde/so-you-want-to-be-a-charity-entrepreneur-read-these-first</u></a>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Between all the reading/watching/listening, another important influence was talking with other like-minded people. Please see below&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ngk6AFo5uNHB3ZKQY/inside-the-mind-of-an-aspiring-charity-entrepreneur-follow#A_Heartfelt_Thank_You_to_the_Effective_Altruism_Community\">I\u2019m so grateful for everyone who has been a part of the journey thus far</a> for more details.</p><p>Lastly, for anyone who has been a part of EA for even a small amount of time knows, you will come to love Google Forms. Like others, I have applied to many EA official programs, volunteering roles, paid jobs, career advising opportunities, incubator programs etc\u2026&nbsp; and to my surprise these have also affected me in a profound way I had not anticipated before. Particularly, answering all these Google Form questions and doing the test tasks have clarified my thinking to put things on paper (well, digitally paper), that previously had been unorganized and swirling in my head.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Challenges: What I've Faced So Far</h2><h3>Getting started quickly in EA</h3><p>There are a lot of resources, and I guess that can be a double-edged sword. Within a week of skimming, I knew EA was in alignment for me. So, as someone who wanted to hit the ground running, it was like trying to drink from a firehose sorting through the different topics and information initially. However, I\u2019m very lucky I was inspired to go down the co-founding path early on, and so I stuck mostly to a semi structured way to devour resources based on the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ngk6AFo5uNHB3ZKQY/inside-the-mind-of-an-aspiring-charity-entrepreneur-follow#The_Effective_Altruism_Influence\">3 lists as per above</a>.</p><p>Other than that, as suggested by many people, the most valuable way to learn the ideas of Effective Altruism isn\u2019t by merely reading (e.g. the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XKfnWebzJsdxecBDw/about-this-handbook\"><u>EA handbook</u></a>, forum, books etc), but by conversing, exchanging ideas and learning from other like-minded people. The official way to do that is via the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BuR7RLQAtJtC5jK5d/there-will-now-be-ea-virtual-programs-every-month\"><u>monthly EA Virtual Intro Program</u></a> and this is a great experience as I\u2019m going through it right now.</p><p>However, for someone who wants to get moving ASAP, that is&nbsp;<strong>waiting in most cases <u>an entire month</u></strong> between applying, hearing back and starting the eight week EA Virtual Intro Program. This waiting period, if not properly handled, could have been a semi hindrance.</p><p>That\u2019s why for me, I\u2019m very grateful for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sK7neZ9rHGEL5JP7q/ea-anywhere-slack-consolidating-professional-and-affinity\"><u>EA Anywhere group where professional and affinity groups were consolidated into one space</u></a>. I was able to get connected to multiple events/groups to learn and get feedback (it\u2019s so easy to find events compared to hunting down different interest groups on their respective websites). Additionally, there is the #study-buddy chat room (that's joint with the EA Virtual Programs Slack) that you can find others to who are reading through resources that might be of interest to you.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CAWvSaGWNbCnoRccd/supporting-online-connections-what-i-learned-after-trying-to\"><u>See here for other promising ways to connect to others online</u></a>.</p><p>So while waiting to hear back from EA VP, I kept busy with the 80k Career Guide (I&nbsp;gave feedback here to help improve this amazing guide - <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AgihXxbw6aHAuNzLg/give-feedback-on-the-new-80-000-hours-career-guide\">consider doing this too if you recently read it</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BhzqvnaZiqfsssquM/new-80-000-hours-feature-listen-to-audio-versions-of-our\"><u>80k podcast with transcripts for easy note taking</u></a>, other CE recommended resources and attending group meetings found in EA Anywhere. To be honest, I didn\u2019t even know there was an official handbook until a few weeks in. It is only now because I\u2019m going through the intro fellowship that I am realizing my \u201corganic discovery\u201d of EA had already led me to read a number of the required readings (like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZhNaizQgYY9dXdQkM/introduction-to-effective-altruism-17\"><u>Introduction to Effective Altruism</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wYjMsKsEkDPgHeAbS/four-ideas-you-already-agree-with\"><u>Four Ideas You Already Agree With</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NmDrpKdmjrkYiKeAj/scope-insensitivity-failing-to-appreciate-the-numbers-of\"><u>Scope insensitivity: failing to appreciate the numbers of those who need our help</u></a>).</p><p><i>Aside: From what I was told,&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gYseq5uNfHw2R8JPx/ama-we-organize-ea-anywhere-ask-us-anything\"><i><u>EA Anywhere group</u></i></a><i> wasn\u2019t meant to intake total newbies like I was (and hence not heavily advertised). But, I really am glad I found it somehow during my second week in EA, because it skyrocketed my learning and helped me prioritize where to drill deeper inside of EA.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Applications</h3><p>Another challenge I had was similar to others described in the post&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jmbP9rwXncfa32seH/after-one-year-of-applying-for-ea-jobs-it-is-really-really\"><u>After one year of applying for EA jobs: It is really, really hard to get hired by an EA organization</u></a>, where basically both post author and commenters echo in saying that EA community jobs are extremely competitive.</p><p>In fact, I think incubator programs and even official programs, volunteering or career advising opportunities are just as difficult to get into.</p><p>Because of my recent lay off, I had the luxury of full-time hours diving into EA and applying to multiple opportunities (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ngk6AFo5uNHB3ZKQY/inside-the-mind-of-an-aspiring-charity-entrepreneur-follow#The_Application_Breakdown___Handling_Rejections\">Application Breakdown &amp; Handling Rejections</a> below if interested) since July. However, the difference is that I went into the applications having the expectation that getting accepted into anything will be difficult.</p><p>Particularly, I remember this paragraph from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/c2fhqaKEGJxGMCz4x/new-ea-book-how-to-launch-a-high-impact-nonprofit-by-charity\"><u>How to Launch a High-Impact Nonprofit</u></a> on page 375:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>Why is there so much interest from such talented people? It\u2019s because the big idea of \u201ceffective altruism\u201d is appealing to many smart individuals, and they want to devote their careers to having an impact and helping others.</i></p></blockquote><p>Even with this mentality, being someone who is mid-career and has 14+ years of work experience looking to deploy my career capital, I really didn\u2019t expect to</p><ul><li>Get rejected by 80000 Hours\u2019 career advising</li><li>Get complete radio silence from a career advising application (not even an acknowledgement of application received)</li><li>Get again radio silence from multiple volunteering opportunities where I thought I was very qualified for and could do easily</li></ul><p>Having said this, all the closed doors didn\u2019t really bug me or get to me. Maybe because in my career I have faced much worse objections, failures, losses and valleys and have learned to fail forward. In fact, each closed door was listed as a gratitude item in my prayer journal. As a Christian, I gave thanks for every opportunity that was shut down as I know I did my best with those applications and left the rest to God. I found comfort in the verses:</p><blockquote><p>'For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the Lord, 'plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future. ' \u2014 Jeremiah 29:11.</p></blockquote><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Triumphs: Small Wins and Big Milestones</h2><p>I was taught to celebrate successes big and small during my entrepreneurial days. And I\u2019m glad others in the EA feel the same way about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FSvq8f8PMiziaJgNc/celebrations-and-gratitude-thread\"><u>celebration and gratitude</u></a>.</p><p>The small wins along the way are detailed below at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ngk6AFo5uNHB3ZKQY/inside-the-mind-of-an-aspiring-charity-entrepreneur-follow#A_Heartfelt_Thank_You_to_the_Effective_Altruism_Community\">I\u2019m so grateful for everyone who has been a part of the journey thus far.</a> I&nbsp;<strong>love this EA community because from most of my encounters so far, most people are genuinely willing and wanting to help</strong>. There is no hidden agenda compared to the typical for-profit world, because EAs generally are driven by the impact they can have (less monetary motivations). Which means, even if it\u2019s something they have spent hours and hours working on, I found many are still willing to share. Whether they are actively thinking about maximizing their indirect impact, or just trying to help because they are paying it forward, the&nbsp;<strong>EA environment has been one of <u>the most collaborative, energizing and helpful ones I\u2019ve found</u></strong> after 14+ years of networking and being in the business world.</p><p>And because of all you wonderful people lending a help, contributing and sharing your knowledge/wisdom, in short after two months, I thankfully I made it through and was accepted to 4 of the 19 applications (two career advising calls, one official CEA program - EA Virtual Intro, and one co-founder opportunity) - more details in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ngk6AFo5uNHB3ZKQY/inside-the-mind-of-an-aspiring-charity-entrepreneur-follow#The_Application_Breakdown___Handling_Rejections\">Application Breakdown &amp; Handling Rejections</a> section.</p><p>Yes, I was encouraged each time I got a yes. And yes, I was overjoyed I was offered the co-founder position!!!</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Tip for Future EA Applicants: Apply early</h2><p>One tip I learned that has become apparent after the multiple applications (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ngk6AFo5uNHB3ZKQY/inside-the-mind-of-an-aspiring-charity-entrepreneur-follow#The_Application_Breakdown___Handling_Rejections\">breakdown of applications below</a> if interested) is that you should err on the side of applying early (aka within the week the application is first posted), rather than waiting to submit just before the deadline.</p><p>My previous strategy for applications which has worked well outside of EA is to do my best preparing for the application, so that I can put my best foot forward during the 1st impression stage (initial application form, cover letter, etc). This is why even though I found out about the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AfXC5CDtSKezpiyf6/ce-incubation-programs-2024-applications-are-now-open-our\"><u>2024 CE incubator program</u></a> back in July, I scheduled the CE application as a to-do for the last week of Sep (I\u2019m extremely excited about this as I will be applying this week to the incubation program with our own intervention idea: the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stakeout.ai/\"><u>StakeOut.AI</u></a>\u2019s mission and intervention).</p><p>From the top of my head, here are two examples to demonstrate why it\u2019s better to apply early:</p><p>1. To quote&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/c2omdmRxWJyGdLDBb/high-impact-leadership-coaching-program-applications-open\"><u>High Impact Leadership Coaching Program \u2013 Applications Open</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Fill out this short application form (10-20 mins) to apply. The deadline is 23:59 UTC October 1st. Be aware: applying earlier may give you an advantage vs applying very near the deadline.</p></blockquote><p>2. Even though I felt I was very qualified for this particular job as I have 14+ years direct hands-on and managerial experience for the exact role description (caveat is my time in EA is very short), I got this response from the application:</p><blockquote><p>This was a very difficult process on our side; we received a huge number (&gt;150) of applications for this position and we were only able to progress with a small number of candidates.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Feedback for EA Organizations Taking Applications</h2><h3>Reference CE\u2019s application round for easier applicants processing</h3><p>From what I gathered after the multiple applications (whether it\u2019s a job ad, volunteering role, career advising or incubator programs) is that there might be a&nbsp;<i>slight</i> bottleneck when it comes to processing applications. This is because many EA organizations are smaller in size compared to typical for profit companies with dedicated HR departments. Thus, handling the sheer volume of applications coming through (again because \u201cso much interest from such talented people\u201d as per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/c2fhqaKEGJxGMCz4x/new-ea-book-how-to-launch-a-high-impact-nonprofit-by-charity\"><u>How to Launch a High-Impact Nonprofit</u></a>), is hard to process without a systemized setup from the beginning to filter through applicants.</p><p>How to Launch a High-Impact Nonprofit wrote in-depth about the hiring process and this is definitely something our organization will implement in the future when we reach the point we need to hire staff. In particular:</p><ul><li>Page 310 talks about \u201cThe project job ad\u201d</li><li>Page 312 talks about \u201cDesigning an application form\u201d and gives a Google Form template for you to follow.

I might be wrong because auto scoring wasn\u2019t fully explained in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/c2fhqaKEGJxGMCz4x/new-ea-book-how-to-launch-a-high-impact-nonprofit-by-charity\"><u>How to Launch a High-Impact Nonprofit</u></a>\u2026 However, after analyzing the application and doing a little reverse engineering:</p><ul><li>13 are admin, logistics, legal, feedback, optional questions</li><li>15 required multiple choice questions</li><li>2-3 required questions are short form questions (3rd question only if you are applying with your own idea)</li><li>41 required rating scale pages (fit assessment statements)</li></ul><p>This shows 94.9% of the required questions ((15+41)/(15+3+41)=94.9%) asked in CE\u2019s application form are multiple choice or rating scale questions, while only 2-3 questions ((3)/(15+3+41)=5.1%) are short form questions that require manual processing. Which means, the setup of the connected spreadsheet plays a crucial role and does a lot of the heavy lifting sorting through thousands of applicants. With the right formulas set up, scores can easily be calculated to get a general gist of how well the applicant fits, even before a team member manually looks through the short answer questions.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, whether you have a big or small team, processing hundreds and thousands of applicants from one stage to the next (whether it\u2019s the \u201cinterview\u201d or \u201ctest task\u201d stage) can be relatively quick. <u>This is compared to if someone designed their entire application form with only short answer questions - which is the majority of the applications I filled out</u>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since CE is used to taking on thousands of applications (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xnHnsrFEMEMPXBWqR/ask-charity-entrepreneurship-anything?commentId=cZFfSufiYwMthyuCi\"><u>KarolinaSarek said \u201cwe start with ~3000 applications and only accept a small number\u201d</u></a>), I think other EA organizations can learn from CE\u2019s robust system to eliminate the bottleneck of processing applications. At the very least, it is worth taking a look and having a conversation. Again, I might be wrong and please let me know if this is the case. However, if I\u2019m right, I\u2019m very well versed with spreadsheets in general and happy to help put together a template if there is interest. Of course, I\u2019m just deducing the exact process CE has here, it would be better to get the template example from the original source.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Send responders a copy of their response</h3><p>On the topic of Google Forms (while I have come to love because this is the method of application in EA), I personal dislike seeing the below message after I poured time (sometimes hours) into the application form and hitting submit:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ngk6AFo5uNHB3ZKQY/y9wdecmo6fbttpuj6czb\"></p><p>At the very least, please enable the setting \"Send responders a copy of their response\" for your applicants so they can see their hours of hard work (probably also an emotional endeavor as your application might be the 10th or 15th application the applicant has done in the last few weeks/months) indeed has gone through:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ngk6AFo5uNHB3ZKQY/nilg8h87bxqphfkhksf4\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Can we at least get a response?</h3><p>Lastly, there are still a few applications I\u2019m still waiting to hear back from. As an applicant, I think if you asked for my email on the application form, then it would be nice (and courteous) to at least get a response back if I didn\u2019t make the cut - even if it\u2019s followed by <i>\u201cAt this stage we don't have the capacity to offer individual feedback on your application.\u201d</i></p><p>It might be the norm to not hear back if you didn\u2019t make it through the 1st stage when applying to a \u201cnormal\u201d job via Linkedin, or through a job posting by sending a resume and cover letter to a specified email address.</p><p>But for whatever reason, when I was applying through Google Forms, I had an expectation of a response. Maybe because I assumed the responses are captured by a spreadsheet and hence sorting through candidates who didn\u2019t make it would be easier. I\u2019m not sure if this is shared by other applicants, or maybe it's just me being misguided.</p><p>Anyway, that\u2019s why I\u2019m very appreciative of all the rejection responses I got. Because at the very least I know where I stand - versus the applications that were met with radio silence (makes me suspicious too if my application even went through in the first place).</p><p>Of course, even better if an EA organization can implement the potential solutions to help keep up the morale within EA, as described in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Khon9Bhmad7v4dNKe/the-cost-of-rejection\"><u>The Cost of Rejection</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The Application Breakdown &amp; Handling Rejections</h2><p>Here is a rough look at the applications (including ones I\u2019ve applied to and still looking to apply to like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/incubation-program\"><u>CE incubator program</u></a> this week,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FAHHFFmJuDqxBMCNH/save-the-date-eagxvirtual-2023\"><u>EAGxVirtual 2023</u></a> that just started accepting applications): &nbsp;</p><ul><li>4 official CEA programs (1 accepted, 1 rejected, 2 to apply next week)</li><li>5 career advising (2 accepted, 2 rejected, 1 radio silence)</li><li>4 co-founder opportunities/incubators (1 accepted, 1 rejected after 3rd of 3 steps with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SZ6reaQ2HkABAcY2N/job-opportunity-to-found-charity-entrepreneurship-ngo\"><u>internal CE applicant getting the position</u></a>, 1 radio silence, 1 to apply this week)</li><li>2 paid jobs/contractors (1 waiting, 1 rejected)</li><li>4 volunteering opportunities (1 waiting, 3 radio silence)</li></ul><p><br>In total, that\u2019s 19 applications in roughly a two month timeframe.</p><p>I found out many of the opportunities I applied to from EA Anywhere, and the occasional ones from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZA5HNrc8AtWGub4fk/ea-internships-board-now-live\"><u>EA Opportunities Board</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JhXdzzzexELaQNorj/ea-opportunities-a-new-and-improved-collection-of\"><u>\"other EA opportunity collections\" like 80000 Hours</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XgeFZxBzbXuFieZ5H/probably-good-published-a-list-of-impact-focused-job-boards\"><u>Probably Good job board</u></a>).</p><p>To the point of embracing the rejections. Here is a perspective that might help if you have applied for a bunch of things and still haven\u2019t haven\u2019t gotten an offer in EA. This is something I learned from a passionate, upright and caring role model of mine&nbsp;<a href=\"https://homeword.com/about/jim-burns/\"><u>Dr. Jim Burns</u></a>: we have to \u201c<i>to say no to good things, so that we can say yes to the most important things.</i>\u201d When I looked it up just now to find the original quote, it seems like there are variations of this out there but the point is consistent:</p><blockquote><p><i>Learn to say 'no' to the good so you can say 'yes' to the best. - </i>John C. Maxwell</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things. - </i>Steve Jobs</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What\u2019s the perspective? I\u2019m very grateful for all the no\u2019s because these no\u2019s to good things (regardless of you saying \u2018no\u2019, or they saying \u2018no\u2019), will eventually lead you to saying \u2018yes\u2019 to the best things, or most important things.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe I\u2019m being optimistic, or maybe it\u2019s because I have a faith that stabilizes me (like I mentioned above with Jeremiah 29:11). Regardless, I think this perspective could help. Especially if you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jmbP9rwXncfa32seH/after-one-year-of-applying-for-ea-jobs-it-is-really-really\"><u>resonate with the EA applicant</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>At least for me, handling multiple rejections was mentally challenging. Additionally, the process may foster resentment towards the EA community. I am aware the following statement is super in-accurate and no one is literally saying that, but sometimes this is the message I felt I was getting from the EA community:</p><p>\u201cHey you! You know, all these ideas that you had about making the world a better place, like working for Doctors without Borders? They probably aren\u2019t that great. The long-term future is what matters. And that is not funding constrained, so earning to give is kind of off the table as well. But the good news is, we really, really need people working on these things.

How do these trends cash out, and what\u2019s the overall trajectory?</p><p>I\u2019ve used human and farmed animal population data, estimates of welfare ranges across different species, and estimates of the average wellbeing of different species to get a rough sense of recent trends in total global welfare. Importantly, this initial analysis is limited to humans and some of the most abundant farmed animals\u2014it does not consider effects on insects or wild animals, the inclusion of which could plausibly change the top-line conclusions (see e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/humanitys-net-impact-on-wild-animal-suffering/\"><u>here</u></a>). I focus on the years from 1961-2021, as this is the period for which the most reliable data exists, and the period most relevant to understanding the current trajectory.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>My tentative conclusion is that net global welfare may be both negative and declining. That is, the entire good of humanity may be outweighed by the cumulative suffering of farmed animals, with total animal suffering growing faster than human wellbeing is increasing, especially in recent decades.</strong> Below I lay out some of the many assumptions upon which this work depends, the core of my analysis, and some tentative reflections on how these findings shape my thinking about the future.&nbsp;</p><h2>Notes and Assumptions</h2><ul><li>This analysis was performed as a quick/rough estimate, and should not be mistaken for a comprehensive treatment of the topic. I am highly uncertain about both the quantitative findings and my interpretations.&nbsp;</li><li>I opted for using point estimates rather than confidence intervals for the sake of simplicity. My confidence intervals would be wide if they were included. That said, I\u2019ve aimed to make my estimates such that they fall at or below the median of my best-guess distributions (i.e. for the parts of the analysis that relied on my own judgment calls, I think it\u2019s more likely than not that I\u2019ve underestimated animal suffering relative to humans, rather than overestimated).</li><li>I\u2019ve limited the scope of this analysis to humans and farmed animals, in part due to data availability, in part for simplicity, and in part to focus on humanity\u2019s most direct impacts on other beings. Inclusion of wild animals in this analysis could plausibly change the signs of my conclusions.&nbsp;</li><li>This work draws heavily on the Moral Weight Project from Rethink Priorities and relies on the same assumptions: utilitarianism, hedonism, valence symmetry, unitarianism, use of proxies for hedonic potential, and more. Although I think the Rethink Priorities welfare range estimates are currently the best tool available for interspecies welfare comparisons, I do not necessarily endorse these assumptions in full, nor do I think the Rethink Priorities welfare ranges are the \u201ccorrect\u201d weights\u2014only the best available. I consider the following entries in the Moral Weight Project Sequence to be particularly useful background reading:<ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw/p/hxtwzcsz8hQfGyZQM\"><u>An Introduction to the Moral Weight Project</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw/p/Qk3hd6PrFManj8K6o\"><u>Rethink Priorities\u2019 Welfare Range Estimates</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw/p/KXSBb2zgkLE6gnn3K\"><u>Don\u2019t Balk at Animal-friendly Results</u></a></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Analysis</h2><h3>Background and Definitions</h3><p>The central concept of my analysis is that the total welfare of a given species in a given year can be calculated as follows:</p><p><i>Welfare Capacity = Population * Welfare Range</i></p><p><i>Total Welfare = Welfare Capacity * Welfare Percentile</i></p><p>The terms of these equations are defined as:</p><ul><li><strong>Population:</strong> Number of individuals alive at any time for each year.</li><li><strong>Welfare Range:&nbsp;</strong>The difference between the best and worst welfare states an individual of a given species can realize, on a scale from 0 upward, with 1 being the welfare range of humans.</li><li><strong>Welfare Capacity:&nbsp;</strong>The total amount of welfare that all members of a species could collectively realize in a given year. (Note: this value is distinct from an&nbsp;<i>individual\u2019s&nbsp;</i>capacity for welfare as described by Rethink Priorities, which is calculated as the individual\u2019s welfare range multiplied by their lifespan.)</li><li><strong>Welfare Percentile:&nbsp;</strong>The average position of animals of a given species within their respective welfare ranges, on a scale from -1 to 1, with -1 being the worst welfare state an individual of that species could experience, and 1 being the best.</li></ul><h3>Populations</h3><p>I used data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to compile population information for many of the most commonly farmed animal species, and used human population numbers from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/world-population-by-year/\"><u>here</u></a>. Data on the numbers of individual animals were available for terrestrial animals, but data for fish and shrimp are only reported as gross weights, which I used to estimate the numbers of individuals at a given time using strategies adapted from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fishcount.org.uk/fish-count-estimates-2/numbers-of-farmed-fish-slaughtered-each-year\"><u>fishcount.org.uk</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/shrimp-the-animals-most-commonly-used-and-killed-for-food-production\"><u>Rethink Priorities</u></a>, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EeD5kpSj8NchxkpYL/gunlqnttfylxby0qb3d5\"></p><p>Shrimp, fish, and chickens presently dominate by total population. However, this is a relatively recent phenomenon. In 1961, humans outnumbered all animals except for chickens, and even chickens only outnumbered humans by less than a billion individuals. Now, as of 2021, there are &gt; 4x as many farmed chickens as humans, and more than an order of magnitude more farmed fish and shrimp.&nbsp;</p><h3>Welfare Capacities</h3><p>Next, I multiplied annual population numbers by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/welfare-range-estimates\"><u>estimated welfare ranges</u></a> of each species to get the total capacity for welfare of each species over time. For species for which welfare range estimates have not been rigorously generated, I made conservative estimates based on the ranges of other species. In addition to the annual welfare capacities for each individual species, I also calculated the total welfare capacity of all non-human animals.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EeD5kpSj8NchxkpYL/ic6wetchgmjfpzq5dtqc\"></p><p>Sixty years ago the welfare capacity of humans may have been greater than the total welfare capacity of non-human farmed animals, but this has changed dramatically, with farmed animals now plausibly having &gt;2x the welfare capacity of all humanity. Perhaps most strikingly, the annual welfare capacity of farmed chickens alone may have risen above that of humans. In industrializing and expanding animal agriculture, humanity may have brought populations into existence whose moral significance now outweighs our own.

Entrepreneurship\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dWzh0Se0nhbPxe2Ye3o-tr3BoOBtdiCbMkpPuw2rBFE/edit#gid=1196679822\"><u>weighted animal welfare index</u></a> and assumed that average welfare for each non-human species was static over the relevant time period. This assumption is almost certainly incorrect, as the transition to factory farming has occurred at least in part during the relevant time period, and the rapid population growth for chickens, fish, and shrimp in particular has come with increased densities and efficiencies which have probably reduced average welfare. However, I\u2019ve stuck with static estimates because 1) there is hardly any data available from which to easily estimate these trends, and 2) trends toward lower average welfare would intensify, rather than weaken, the observed trends in total net welfare, making this a conservative assumption, and 3) the changes in population (and therefore in welfare capacity) for the key non-human species are so great that they dominate the total welfare equation.</p><p>For humans, I assumed that welfare improved from 0.4 to 0.6 between 1961 and 2021, based on a rough synthesis of information from Our World in Data (previously compiled&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/has-life-gotten-better-the-post-industrial-era/\"><u>here</u></a>) and using Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s weighted animal welfare index for relevant anchors.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EeD5kpSj8NchxkpYL/uwzgrotflrmuznr2epfz\"></p><p>Based on this analysis, the suffering of farmed animals is sufficiently intense, and their populations have grown sufficiently large, that the scale of their suffering may outweigh all of humanity\u2019s progress. In other words, if humans and farmed animals are considered together, total global welfare may be declining at increasing speed, and could already be well below zero.</p><p>Interestingly, this analysis suggests that net welfare across all species was positive and relatively stable for the first ~20 years of this period before it dipped below zero and started dropping at an increasing rate. However, I don\u2019t see the concerning trajectory as purely a recent phenomenon or an aberration. The underlying trends and driving forces likely extend back much further than these graphs, to the start of industrialization, which has been a key driver of both the significant welfare improvements for humanity of the past few hundred years and the development and subsequent explosion of intensive animal agriculture. It\u2019s only recently that we\u2019re starting to see the full moral costs.</p><h2>Tentative Reflections</h2><ul><li><strong>Danger of lock-in.</strong> This analysis makes our current trajectory look really, really bad. Humanity may have set systems in motion that put the total welfare of the world on a steep downward trajectory. If true, lock-in\u2014of the current state, but even more so of the current trend\u2014may be a moral catastrophe. This conclusion is in contrast to analyses that suggest extrapolation and acceleration of recent progress would likely be morally positive, on the basis of humanity\u2019s trajectory alone.</li><li><strong>Importance of higher order effects.</strong> Humanity did not set out to create hell on earth for other animals, only to improve ourselves. We have, however, prioritized our own progress and wellbeing with little consideration for the downstream effects, and in doing so may have inadvertently undermined every bit of the good we\u2019ve achieved. To me, this is a strong argument for including higher order effects in analyses of different priorities and paths to impact, even effects that stretch across conventional cause areas (e.g. modeling the animal welfare impacts of human health and global development interventions). Notably, this also suggests not taking the conclusions of this work at face value, and prioritizing the development of more rigorous models of net welfare trends that include wild animals and other higher order effects.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Implications of our track record.</strong> A central motivation for pursuing this analysis was to understand the backdrop onto which humanity might soon bring sentient digital beings into existence. What will the welfare capacity and total welfare graphs look like over time if/when we develop digital systems with morally relevant experiences? Our recent record suggests the default path is not a good one. This track record is also concerning through another lens: if powerful digital systems are learning from and adopting humanity\u2019s example of neglecting the wellbeing of others in pursuit of our own gain,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23777171/ai-animals-rights-cruelty-transhumanism-bostrom\"><u>we should be very worried</u></a>. Frighteningly, such systems may appear, and even&nbsp;<i>be</i>, wholly aligned to human values.</li></ul><h2>Future Directions</h2><p>Nearly every aspect of this analysis would benefit from more rigorous research and investigation. Below is an incomplete list of things I\u2019d be excited to see progress on:</p><ul><li>More rigorous quantitative analysis of the welfare of different animal species, including trends over time (see e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://welfarefootprint.org/\"><u>Welfare Footprint</u></a> for early work in this direction)</li><li>Refinement and expansion of Rethink Priorities\u2019 welfare range estimates</li><li>Extrapolation of total welfare trends, incorporating projected slowing of human population growth and potential plateaus in animal product consumption</li><li>Modeling the impact of potential human and/or animal-focused interventions on this overall welfare trend</li><li>Exploration of \u201cdifferential interventions\u201d aimed at improving total welfare and reversing these trends, rather than focusing locally on human or non-human (e.g. farmed animal) welfare</li><li>A probabilistic version of this same analysis</li><li>A version of this modeling that accounts for effects on wild animal populations</li></ul><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>Many thanks to Lewis Bollard, Sofia Davis-Fogel, Ryan Duncombe, Bob Fischer, Kasey Fish, Jason Schukraft, and others for helpful discussions and/or feedback on drafts of this post.

Only 23% of U.S. adults trust AI companies to put safety over profits, and 27% trust the creators of an AI to maintain control of current and future versions.

We also found significant increases from 2021 to 2023 in moral concern, mind perception, perceived threat, and support for banning sentience-related AI technologies.

I found the course to be eye opening and very effective. I would recommend it for anyone remotely new to EA. The course dives into different EA concepts and topics, ideas and thoughts including many different cause areas. Throughout the weeks in the course, doing the assigned readings, exercises and partaking in discussions with my facilitator and fellow attendees, my connection to EA grew.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of the course\u2019s effectiveness and impact on me, and because I have a personal goal to become more reflective in my life and work, I\u2019ve decided to share my reflections gained from my time in the course (and follow on thoughts after completing the course). What I share is a combination of thoughts, questions, ideas and insights that stemmed from the course. Admittedly they are still shallow and unrefined but serve as the starting point for my own personal research to follow. I figured maybe it would be interesting to the forum readers, anyone considering the course, or attendees currently in or who have finished it. I\u2019ll be following the feedback, so feel free to comment about anything that connects.</p><p>I will break down the content by chapters that correlate to those of the EA handbook on the forum, which is what the course structure was based on.&nbsp;</p><h3>Chapter 1 \u2013 The Effectiveness Mindset</h3><ul><li>Often times when I see discussions/debates (particularly where one side wishes to highlight that something isn\u2019t up to par and should be improved) the other side retorts that things are so much better than they used to be. To my mind that never made sense because I follow a mindset of continuous improvement. Naturally for me it\u2019s always about making progress, even if we\u2019ve made a lot of it already. But I was never able to put that concept into the simplicity as the readings in this chapter did by saying that we should hold the below three truths all at the same time, always:&nbsp;<ul><li>The world is much better than it used to be (Past)</li><li>The world is horrible (Present)</li><li>The world can become much better (Future)</li><li>I think anyone who can\u2019t accept all three of these ideas simultaneously would be critically hampered from effectively helping the world</li></ul></li><li>EA should have a personal flavor for each individual to work best and achieve the greatest impact<ul><li>For better or worse, humans are emotional beings. By our nature, we are more emotional than logical, so to follow a structure that completely removes emotion for logic might be removing a very powerful force as it relates to humanity and our potential impact. My suspicion is that we need some type of balance between the two to create the most effective movement we can. If we feel especially drawn or pulled to a specific cause area or direction, I think it\u2019s most likely related to our emotions rather than logic or analysis. It\u2019s related to innate preferences to a large degree, and I don\u2019t see it as a bad thing. Following along with that connection is probably not only personally best, but because of the stronger connection, it might objectively be the most impactful thing to do as well. I sincerely believe a stronger connection to what we\u2019re doing translates to better and more impactful work. It\u2019s not always about finding the most impact, it\u2019s about creating the most impact where we feel called.</li><li>This idea has been mentioned before with \u201cfuzzies\u201d and \u201cutilons\u201d and it\u2019s not a bad thing to follow. Just be aware of which is which. We have to analyze and develop some kind of understanding of why specific cause areas mean more to us than others. This will help to get to know ourselves and be able to maximize our impact in EA work. We shouldn\u2019t be afraid to acknowledge or even pursue the fuzzies, but we should understand our motivations.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>A lot of EA focus is on cost-effectiveness of direct impact, for example on direct lives or DALYs saved by an intervention. It seems to me that EA does a great job of analyzing impact through cost-effectiveness. But each direct action has an immediate reaction, and follow-on ripple effects. Like dropping a stone in water (action) first we have the disturbance (reaction) and then after that goes away we have ripples that are created. I\u2019m not sure if EA puts enough emphasis on follow on ripples as opposed to that first direct reaction.&nbsp;<ul><li>We do a very good job of calculating the effectiveness of the primary reaction to an action. For example, a donation to a charity can save x number of lives. But are we asking what the indirect, follow-on ripples will be? What good effect will ripple out from those lives saved. Would those helped directly then have capacity to help others in meaningful ways? For example, if a specific action has a reaction that saves X number of lives, and the follow-ripple effect saves Y number of lives, as compared to a second specific action that has a direct reaction that saves only .8X number of lives, but has a follow-on ripple effect that saves 2*Y number of lives\u2026which is better? I\u2019m not sure how feasible it would be to research this ripple effectiveness but we could also consider a 2<sup>nd</sup> and a 3<sup>rd</sup> ripple (or even more) in the analysis too. To my understanding most cost-effectiveness models today consider the impact of the reaction to an intervention, but not the ripple effects. Maybe we should have both a \u201cdirect cost-effectiveness\u201d and \u201cindirect cost-effectiveness\u201d analysis for each intervention.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>We are in triage every second of every day<ul><li>This is admittedly a very sobering thought, but if we look around it can\u2019t really be denied. To me this isn\u2019t a thought that we should hold actively every minute of every day. That\u2019s just too depressing. Instead think about it sporadically. This way it reinforces to each individual how important their involvement in the work of helping the world is. It creates a high-level perspective that is needed when the everyday part of life might pull our focus and attention to the smaller daily tasks and troubles. But it should absolutely never be forgotten.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Thank you for taking the time to read through these reflections and feel free to leave any feedback you think relevant.

The summary was written by Riley Harris.</i></p><p>At some point in the future we may invent sophisticated simulations. If we do so, we could run millions of simulations of minor variants of the 21st century, each inhabited by simulated people. To those simulated people, it will appear as if they really lived in the 21st century. But that is exactly how our world appears to us, and perhaps we live in a simulation.</p><p>Indeed, according to Bostrom (2003) if there are many more simulated than non-simulated people, then we are most likely simulated. However, this argument can only ever be as strong as our belief that there actually are many more simulated than non-simulated people. For example, Bostrom believes there is only about a one-third probability that there really are many more simulated people than non-simulated people, so this argument is compatible with a two-thirds probability that we are not in a simulation. In \u201cSimulation Expectation\u201d, Teruji Thomas develops a novel argument for the claim that we are living in a simulation.</p><h2><strong>The argument for the simulation hypothesis</strong></h2><p>Thomas\u2019 argument relies on the concept of a \u2018reference class\u2019. To illustrate, suppose I smoke, and I want to know the probability that I\u2019ll develop lung cancer. If I knew that one out of fifteen smokers develop lung cancer, I could use my reference class (people who smoke) to make a prediction (1/15 probability of developing lung cancer). In general, a reference class is a way of assigning an initial probability to \u2018things like this\u2019.</p><p>Thomas applies this kind of reasoning to our probability of being in a simulation. He suggests that we use the reference class of people who inhabit \u2018Earthy\u2019 worlds: that is, people who inhabit minor variations of twenty-first-century earth.</p><p>The argument goes like this:</p><p><strong>Premise 1:</strong> Suppose that we ourselves are non-simulated. Then the expected ratio of simulated to non-simulated people living in Earthy worlds is very high.</p><p><strong>Premise 2:</strong> The fact that we are living in an Earthy world includes almost all the relevant evidence we have.</p><p><strong>Premise 3:</strong> Given 1 and 2, the probability that we are living in a simulation is also very high.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Therefore, the probability that we are living in a simulation is very high.</p><p>Premise 1 notes that, even though it may be unlikely that our descendants are ever able to create sophisticated simulations of the 21st century, if they do, then they may well create a very large number of simulated worlds broadly like our own. Thus, if we are not simulations (so that base-reality is an Earthy world), then the expected ratio of simulated to non-simulated people in Earthy worlds is very high.</p><p>Premise 2 is important because additional evidence could change the resulting probability. In our first example, if a genetic test showed that I had a gene associated with increased lung cancer risk, then the probability that I develop lung cancer would be greater than 1/15. In this case, the fact that we live in a minor variation of twenty-first-century earth includes almost all of the evidence we have about whether or not we live in a simulation. It leaves out personal details such as what I ate for breakfast or the colour of my socks, but these details are almost entirely irrelevant to the question of whether or not we live in a simulation.</p><p>The paper contains a mathematical proof of Premise 3. The upshot is that the expected ratio of simulated to non-simulated people in our reference class provides a lower bound to the odds that we live in a simulation. Together, these premises support the conclusion that the probability that we are in a simulation is very high indeed.</p><h2><strong>Carefully interpret evidence</strong></h2><p>There is a potential objection to Premises 1 and 2: perhaps we cannot define \u201cEarthy\u201d in a way that includes almost all of the relevant evidence (Premise 2) while also ensuring that the expected ratio of simulated to non-simulated people is high (Premise 1).</p><p>Consider the (apparent) fact that our world is more than ten billion years old and was mostly lifeless for many of those billions of years. Even if our descendants create many simulations of our world, it is unlikely that many of those simulated worlds will themselves contain vast empty stretches for billions of years; they would just appear that way.&nbsp; So, if we include this fact in what it means to be an \u201cEarthy\u201d world, then Premise 1 may well fail. If, however, we exclude this fact from what it means to be an \u201cEarthy\u201d world, then Premise 2 may well fail, because we are excluding an important piece of evidence. One possible way to resolve this is to try to understand our evidence, not in terms of how the world is, but in terms of how the world appears to be. Potentially, we can keep both Premises 1 and 2 if the definition of \u201cEarthy\u201d includes the fact that the world appears to be old and mostly lifeless but doesn\u2019t require the world to actually be that way. This raises some complicated issues.</p><p>Because of these considerations, we must carefully interpret any evidence we encounter. Imagine stumbling upon a lab running billions of simulations. Would your new evidence make it likely that you live in a simulation? Bostrom (2006, p. 9) and Greene (2020) think so, but the situation is unclear. If your new evidence is only that the lab appears to be running billions of simulations, then it is unclear which way the new evidence points. On the other hand, most simulations probably do not house their own simulations\u2013\u2013so if your new evidence is that the lab really is running billions of simulations, then that could make it less likely that you are in a simulation.</p><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><p>Nick Bostrom (2003). <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/pq/article/53/211/243/1610975\">Are we living in a computer simulation?</a> <i>The Philosophical Quarterly</i> 53/211.</p><p>Nick Bostrom (2006). <a href=\"http://www.simulation-argument.com/computer.pdf\">Do we live in a computer simulation?</a> <i>NewScientist</i> 192/2579.</p><p>Preston Greene (2020). <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-018-0037-1\">The termination risks of simulation science</a>. <i>Erkenntnis</i> 85/2.</p><p>Teru Thomas (2021). <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/simulation-expectation-teruji-thomas-global-priorities-institute-university-of-oxford/\">Simulation Expectation</a>. <i>GPI Working Paper</i> <i>No. 16\u20132021.</i></p>", "user": {"username": "Global Priorities Institute"}}, {"_id": "NfgMAS67nKTGzmQMB", "title": "\u201cX distracts from Y\u201d as a thinly-disguised fight over group status / politics", "postedAt": "2023-09-25T15:29:42.289Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>1. Introduction</h1><p>There\u2019s a popular argument that says:</p><blockquote><p>It\u2019s bad to talk about whether future AI algorithms might cause human extinction, because that would be a distraction from the fact that current AI algorithms are right now causing or exacerbating societal problems (misinformation, deepfakes, political polarization, algorithmic bias, maybe job losses, etc.)</p></blockquote><p>For example, Melanie Mitchell makes this argument (link &amp; my reply&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LNwtnZ7MGTmeifkz3/munk-ai-debate-confusions-and-possible-cruxes\"><u>here</u></a>), as does Blake Richards (link &amp; my reply&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rgPxEKFBLpLqJpMBM/response-to-blake-richards-agi-generality-alignment-and-loss\"><u>here</u></a>), as does Daron Acemoglu (link &amp; a reply by Scott Alexander&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/contra-acemoglu-onoh-god-were-doing\"><u>here</u></a> &amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/when-does-worrying-about-things-trade\"><u>here</u></a>), and many more.</p><p>In Section 2 I will argue that if we try to flesh out this argument in the most literal and straightforward way, it makes no sense, and is inconsistent with everything else these people are saying and doing. Then in Section 3 I\u2019ll propose an alternative elaboration that I think is a better fit.</p><p>I\u2019ll close in Section 4 with two ideas for what we can do to make this problem better.</p><p>(By&nbsp;<i>\u201cwe\u201d</i>, I mean \u201cpeople like me who are very concerned about future AI extinction risk (x-risk<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgejhruwf4fl\"><sup><a href=\"#fngejhruwf4fl\">[1]</a></sup></span>)\u201d. That\u2019s my main intended audience for this piece, although everyone else is welcome to listen in too. If you\u2019re interested in why someone might believe that future AI poses an x-risk in the first place, you\u2019re in the wrong place\u2014try&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\"><u>here</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/4basF9w9jaPZpoC8R/intro-to-brain-like-agi-safety-1-what-s-the-problem-and-why\"><u>here</u></a>.)</p><h1>2. Wrong way to flesh out this argument: This is about zero-sum attention, zero-sum advocacy, zero-sum budgeting, etc.</h1><p>If we take the \u201cdistraction\u201d claim above at face value, maybe we could flesh it out as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Newspapers can only have so many front-page headlines per day. Lawmakers can only pass so many laws per year. Tweens can only watch so many dozens of TikTok videos per second. In general, there is a finite supply of attention, time, and money. Therefore, if more attention, time, and money is flowing to Cause A (= future AI x-risk), then that means there\u2019s&nbsp;<i>less</i> attention, time and money left over for any other Cause B (= immediate AI problems).</p></blockquote><p>I claim that this is&nbsp;<i>not</i> the type of claim that people are making. After all, if that\u2019s the logic, then the following would be equally sensible:</p><ul><li>\u201cIt\u2019s bad to talk about police incompetence, because it\u2019s a distraction from talking about police corruption.\u201d</li><li>\u201cIt\u2019s bad to talk about health care reform, because it\u2019s a distraction from talking about climate change.\u201d</li></ul><p>Obviously, nobody makes those arguments. (Well,&nbsp;<i>almost&nbsp;</i>nobody\u2014see next subsection.)</p><p>Take the first one. I think it\u2019s common sense that concerns about police incompetence do not distract from concerns about police corruption. After all, why would they? It\u2019s not like newspapers have decided&nbsp;<i>a priori</i> that there will be one and only one headline per month about police problems, and therefore police incompetence and police corruption need to duke it out over that one slot. If anything, it\u2019s the opposite! If police incompetence headlines are getting clicks, we\u2019re likely to see&nbsp;<i>more</i> headlines on police corruption, not fewer. It\u2019s true that the&nbsp;<i>total&nbsp;</i>number of headlines is fixed, but it\u2019s perfectly possible for police-related articles to&nbsp;<i>collectively&nbsp;</i>increase, at the expense of articles about totally unrelated topics like Ozempic or real estate.</p><p>By the same token, there is no good reason that concerns about future AI causing human extinction should be a distraction from concerns about current AI:</p><ul><li><i>At worst,</i> they\u2019re two different topics, akin to the silly idea above that talking about health care reform is a problematic distraction from talking about climate change.</li><li><i>At best,</i> they are&nbsp;<i>complementary</i>, and thus akin to the&nbsp;<i>even sillier</i> idea above that talking about police corruption is a problematic distraction from talking about police incompetence.</li></ul><p>Supporting the latter perspective,&nbsp;<strong>immediate AI problems are not an entirely different problem from possible future AI x-risk</strong>. Some people think they\u2019re&nbsp;<i>extremely</i> related\u2014see for example&nbsp;<a href=\"https://brianchristian.org/the-alignment-problem/\"><u>Brian Christian\u2019s book</u></a>. I don\u2019t go as far as he does, but I do see some synergies. For example, both current social media recommendation algorithm issues and future AI x-risk issues are exacerbated by the fact that huge trained ML models are very difficult to interpret and inspect. By the same token, if we work towards international tracking of large AI training runs, it might be useful for&nbsp;<i>both</i> future AI x-risk mitigation&nbsp;<i>and</i> ongoing AI issues like disinformation campaigns, copyright enforcement, AI-assisted spearphishing, etc.</p><h2>2.1 Side note on Cause Prioritization&nbsp;</h2><p>I said above that \u201cnobody\u201d makes arguments like \u201cIt\u2019s bad to talk about health care reform, because it\u2019s a distraction from talking about climate change\u201d. That\u2019s an exaggeration. Some weird nerds like me do say things&nbsp;<i>kinda</i> like that, in a certain context. That context is called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/cause-prioritization\"><u>Cause Prioritization</u></a>, a field of inquiry usually associated these days with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism\"><u>Effective Altruism</u></a>. The whole shtick of Cause Prioritization is to take claims like the above seriously. If we only have so much time in our life and only so much money in our bank account, then there&nbsp;<i>are</i> in fact tradeoffs (on the margin) between spending it to fight for health care reform, versus spending it to fight for climate change mitigation, versus everything else under the sun. Cause Prioritization discourse can come across as off-putting, and even offensive, because you inevitably wind up in a position where you\u2019re arguing&nbsp;<i>against</i> lots of causes that you actually care deeply and desperately about. So most people just reject that whole enterprise. Instead they don\u2019t think explicitly about those kinds of tradeoffs, and insofar as they want to make the world a better place, they tend to do so in whatever way seems most salient and emotionally compelling, perhaps because they have a personal connection, etc. And that\u2019s fine.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc7dc9jjrmn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc7dc9jjrmn\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But Cause Prioritization is about facing those tradeoffs head-on, and trying to do so in a principled,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iupkbiubpzDDGRpka/other-centered-ethics-and-harsanyi-s-aggregation-theorem\"><u>other-centered</u></a> way.</p><p>If you want to do Cause Prioritization properly, then you have to dive into (among other things) a horrific minefield of quantifying various awfully-hard-to-quantify things like \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/forecasting-transformative-ai-whats-the-burden-of-proof/\"><u>what\u2019s my best-guess probability distribution for how long we have until future x-risk-capable AI may arrive?</u></a>\u201d, or \u201cexactly how many suffering chickens are equivalently bad to one suffering human?\u201d, or \u201chow do we weigh better governance in Spain against preventing malaria deaths?\u201d.</p><p>Anyway, I would be shocked if anyone saying \u201cwe shouldn\u2019t talk about future AI risks because it\u2019s a distraction from current AI problems\u201d arrived at that claim via a good-faith open-minded attempt at Cause Prioritization.</p><p>Indeed, as mentioned above, there&nbsp;<i>are&nbsp;</i>people out there who do try to do Cause Prioritization analyses, and \u201cmaybe future AI will cause human extinction\u201d tends to score right at or near the top of their lists. (<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\"><u>Example</u></a>.)</p><h2>2.2 Conclusion</h2><p>So in conclusion, people say \u201cconcerns about future AI x-risks distract from concerns about current AI\u201d, but if we flesh out that claim in a superficial, straightforward way, then it makes no sense.</p><p>\u2026And that was basically where Scott Alexander left it in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/when-does-worrying-about-things-trade\"><u>his post on this topic</u></a> (from which I borrowed some of the above examples). But I think Scott was being insufficiently cynical. I offer this alternative model:</p><h1>3. Better elaboration: This is about zero-sum group status competition</h1><p>I don\u2019t think anyone is&nbsp;<i>explicitly</i> thinking like the following, but let\u2019s at least consider the possibility that something like this is lurking below the surface:</p><blockquote><p>If we endorse actions to mitigate x-risk from future AIs, we\u2019re implicitly saying&nbsp;<i>\u201cthe people who are the leading advocates of x-risk mitigation, e.g. Eliezer Yudkowsky, were right all along.\u201d</i> Thus, we are granting those people status and respect. And thus&nbsp;<i>everything else</i> that those same people say and believe\u2014especially but not exclusively on the topic of AI\u2014implicitly gets more benefit-of-the-doubt.</p><p>Simultaneously on the other side, if we endorse actions to mitigate x-risk from future AIs, we\u2019re implicitly saying&nbsp;<i>\u201cthe people who are leading advocates against x-risk mitigation, e.g. Timnit Gebru, were wrong all along.\u201d</i> Thus, we are sucking status and respect&nbsp;<i>away</i> from those people. And thus&nbsp;<i>everything else</i> that those people say and believe\u2014especially but not exclusively on the topic of AI\u2014gets some guilt-by association.</p><p>Now, the former group of people seem much less concerned about immediate AI concerns like AI bias &amp; misinformation than the latter group. <i>[Steve interjection: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that simple\u2014see Section 4.2 below\u2014but I do think some people currently believe this.]</i> So, if we take actions to mitigate AI x-risk, we will be harming the cause of immediate AI concerns, via this mechanism of raising and lowering people\u2019s status, and putting \u201cthe wrong people\u201d on the nightly news, etc.</p></blockquote><p>Do you see the disanalogy to the police example? The people most vocally concerned about police incompetence, versus the people most vocally concerned about police corruption, are generally&nbsp;<i>the very same people</i>. If we elevate those people as reliable authorities, and let them write op-eds, and interview them on the nightly news, etc., then we are simultaneously implicitly boosting all of the causes that these people are loudly advocating, i.e. we are advancing&nbsp;<i>both</i> the fight against police incompetence&nbsp;<i>and</i> the fight against police corruption.</p><p>As an example in the other direction, if a left-wing USA person said:</p><blockquote><p>It\u2019s bad for us to fight endless wars against drug cartels\u2014it\u2019s a distraction from compassionate solutions to drug addiction, like methadone clinics and poverty reduction.</p></blockquote><p>\u2026then that would sound perfectly natural to me! Uncoincidentally, in the USA, the people advocating for sending troops to fight drug cartels, and the people advocating for poverty reduction, tend to be political adversaries on almost every other topic!</p><h1>4. Takeaways</h1><h2>4.1 Hey AI x-risk people, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re not pointlessly fanning these flames</h2><p>As described above, there is no&nbsp;<i>good</i> reason that taking actions to mitigate future AI x-risk should harm the cause of solving immediate AI-related problems; if anything, it should be the opposite.</p><p>So: we should absolutely, unapologetically, advocate for work on mitigating AI x-risk. But we should not advocate for work on mitigating AI x-risk&nbsp;<i>instead of working on immediate AI problems</i>. That\u2019s just a stupid, misleading, and self-destructive way to frame what we\u2019re hoping for. To be clear, I think this kind of weird stupid framing is&nbsp;<i>already</i> very rare on \u201cmy side of the aisle\u201d\u2014and far outnumbered by people who advocate for work on x-risk and then advocate for work on existing AI problems in the very next breath\u2014but I would like it to be even rarer still.</p><p>(I wouldn\u2019t be saying this if I didn\u2019t see it&nbsp;<i>sometimes</i>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/steve47285/status/1683226281972756480\"><u>here\u2019s an example of me responding to (what I perceived as) a real-world example on twitter</u></a>.)</p><p>In case the above is not self-explanatory: I am equally opposed to saying we should work on mitigating AI x-risk&nbsp;<i>instead of working on the opioid crisis</i>, and for the same reason. Likewise, I am equally opposed to saying we should fight for health care reform&nbsp;<i>instead of fighting climate change</i>.</p><p>I\u2019m not saying that we should suppress these kinds of messages because they make us look bad (although they obviously do); I\u2019m saying we should suppress these kinds of messages because they are misleading, for reasons in Section 2 above.</p><p>To make my request more explicit: If I\u2019m talking about how to mitigate x-risk, and somebody changes the subject to immediate AI problems that don\u2019t relate to x-risk, then I have no problem saying \u201cOK sure, but afterwards let\u2019s get back to the human extinction thing we were discussing before\u2026.\u201d Whereas I would&nbsp;<i>not</i> say \u201cThose problems&nbsp;<i>you\u2019re</i> talking about are much less important than the problems&nbsp;<i>I\u2019m</i> talking about.\u201d Cause Prioritization is great for what it is, but it's not a conversation norm. If someone is talking about something they care about, it's fine if that thing isn't related to alleviating the maximum amount of suffering. That doesn't give you the right to change the subject. Notice that even the most ardent AI x-risk advocates seem quite happy to devote substantial time to non-cosmologically-impactful issues that&nbsp;<i>they</i> care about\u2014NIMBY zoning laws are a typical example. And that\u2019s fine!</p><p>Anyway, if we do a good job of making a&nbsp;case that literal human extinction from future AI is a real possibility on the table, then we win the argument\u2014the Cause Prioritization will take care of itself. So that\u2019s where we need to be focusing our communication and debate. Keep saying: \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the future-AI-causing-human-extinction thing. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s a real possibility.\u201d Keep bringing the discussion back to that. Head-to-head comparisons of AI x-risk versus other causes tend to push discussions&nbsp;<i>away</i> from this all-important crux. Such comparisons would be a (ahem)&nbsp;<i>distraction</i>!</p><h2>4.2 Shout it from the rooftops: There are people of all political stripes who think AI x-risk mitigation is important (and there are people of all political stripes who think it\u2019s stupid)</h2><p>Some people have a strong opinion about \u201csilicon valley tech people\u201d\u2014maybe they love them, or maybe they hate them. Does that relate to AI x-risk discourse? Not really! Because it turns out that \u201csilicon valley tech people\u201d includes many of the most enthusiastic believers in AI x-risk (e.g. see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/technology/anthropic-ai-claude-chatbot.html\"><u>the New York Times profile of Anthropic</u></a>, a leading AI company in San Francisco)&nbsp;<i>and</i> it&nbsp;<i>also</i> includes many of its most enthusiastic doubters (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://a16z.com/ai-will-save-the-world/\"><u>tech billionaire Marc Andreessen:</u></a> \u201cThe era of Artificial Intelligence is here, and boy are people freaking out. Fortunately, I am here to bring the good news: AI will not destroy the world\u2026\u201d).</p><p>Likewise, some people have a strong opinion (one way or the other) about \u201cthe people extremely concerned about current AI problems\u201d. Well, it turns out that this group likewise includes&nbsp;<i>both</i> enthusiastic believers in future AI x-risk (e.g. Tristan Harris)&nbsp;<i>and</i> enthusiastic doubters (e.g. Timnit Gebru).</p><p>By the same token, you can find people taking AI x-risk seriously&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jacobin.com/2022/09/socialism-longtermism-effective-altruism-climate-ai\"><u>in Jacobin magazine on the American left</u></a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FGWfTxsXk7euh4QGk/i-think-eliezer-should-go-on-glenn-beck\"><u>on Glenn Beck on the American right</u></a>; in fact,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Rg7h7G3KTvaYEtL55/us-public-perception-of-cais-statement-and-the-risk-of\"><u>a recent survey of the US public</u></a> got supportive responses from Democrats, Republicans, and Independents\u2014all to a quite similar extent\u2014to questions about AI extinction risk being a global priority.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi7i3dzff06b\"><sup><a href=\"#fni7i3dzff06b\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>I think this situation is good and healthy, and I hope it lasts, and we should try to make it widely known.

I observed myself making some of them and realising that I am making them! The post is slightly biased towards college experience examples (because I'm a student) but the ideas should apply generally.&nbsp;<br><br>I reproduce the content below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>The human mind is a wonderful example of emergent behaviour. A certain number of neurons fire together in coordination to give rise to conscious optimisers that are able to take independent decisions. And yet, the human mind is a morally and rationally flawed apparatus. One constantly encounters situations in day-to-day life when they are faced with a moral crisis - a dead-end in the decision making process if one is assumed to be guided by a set of principles.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>In this post, I\u2019ll explore a few logical fallacies that if not overlooked and corrected for can lead to a more enriching living experience. The fallacies I note here can be explored from a sociological, economical, or psychological lens and would ideally lead to different conclusions.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>## Disordered causality</strong></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Man plants seeds in his backyard.</p><p>2. After some time, saplings sprout in his backyard.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>2 is caused by 1. This is a pretty simple one-directional causal relation. But identifying causal relationships in real life is messy and complicated. It is important to perform this identification because it allows us to attribute importance to actions correctly and hence optimise our behaviour. In the above example, what if the man also performs a shamanic dance whenever he plants seeds in his backyard for whatever reason?</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>1. Man performs shamanic dance in his backyard.</p><p>2. After some time, saplings sprout in his backyard.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>This is, of course, absurd to us <i>_because we have out-of-context knowledge_</i> (namely the scientifically proven theory of flora growth). But as you can imagine, dismissing a complex relationship as absurd and to even consider the existence of a secondary cause requires external knowledge which is not generally available for most humans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A very common example is the fake sense of entitlement that some IITian derive from <i>_being IITians_</i>. Their reasoning is based on the institute\u2019s reputation which is based on the long history of talented and skilled engineers who have proved themselves on their own merit around the globe. This reputation has nothing to do with their own merit. IIT is a filter that brings together the smartest and sincere students together. It never promised to be a ticket to heaven.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>## Heuristic inference</strong></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>In the face of complex computation, our brain makes \u201creasonable\u201d approximations to quickly find answers and make decisions. These heuristical inferences must have served us well because evolution has ingrained us with it. But they are not always right - especially in an environment evolving at a mismatched rate to the evolution of the mind.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Age and seniority is considered a mark of wisdom. Older people have lived for longer and have more experience. Therefore, they must be wiser. This may not always be true and can lead to devastating results if left unchallenged. What we forget to take into account is the <i>_quality of experiences_</i>; the quality of experiences can differ wildly in the modern context and people at different stages of life can have disproportionately varying quality of experiences and by extension, wisdom&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, which is better: spending 25 years of one\u2019s life honing one particular skill and becoming 99.9% good at it or to spend 8 years of one\u2019s life to become 80% good at 5 different things? Opportunity costs forces us to rethink our basic model of evaluating humans and human values.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>One possible solution to the seniority-wisdom disparity problem is to move towards a different indicator. I lay more emphasis on personal projects done by a person than their resumes (which I think fails to serve its purpose anyway&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>## Popular value systems</strong></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>It is extremely easy to fool oneself into thinking that they need things that others do. Or are capable of doing things that others do. Every person behaves according to their own internal value system either consciously or subconsciously (the \u201cset of principles\u201d I mentioned before). The problem arises when value systems tend to converge onto \u201cpopular\u201d ones.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>What do I even mean? Let\u2019s say your friend winds down by partying on weekends. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily imply that partying on weekends would help you release your stress. Their value system and yours are not identical. In the absence of sufficient awareness, one\u2019s mind latches onto the first value system it finds and tries to [\u201crationalise\u201d it][0]. This microscopic behaviour leads to the macroscopic phenomenon of gradual convergence of value systems for majority people. This leads to development of human institutions and social structures that rewards people with such value systems and penalise everyone else.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>This is bad news because we want varied value systems but more importantly, the incentive for people to experiment with new value systems without being heavily penalised. An appallingly nasty example is the concreted career paths available to youths in India.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>## End-goal misalignment</strong><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Sufficiently rational agents would tend to optimise the signal that measures a metric rather than the metric itself. One might learn for learning\u2019s sake but once they start to notice that learning <i>_for exams_</i> is enough to get them marks they will shift their worldview from \u201cstudy for life\u201d to \u201cstudy for exam\u201d. This is probably known to a lot of smarter people than me. But the real problem arises out of the ignorance and disregard to acknowledge this as a socio-economic problem. I have heard professors and teachers sermonise about the merits of a good education, one that values learning over evaluation and asking us to \u201ctry\u201d. What most people fail to assimilate is the fact that deviating from an optimal strategy is a long-term loss game and no rational agent would take that path. Thus, we have engineered a social system where the optimal strategy is a long-term undesirable one.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>End-goal misalignment is closely tied to the [principal-agent problem][1] which is unsolved as of yet. I\u2019ll talk about this in detail in a future post.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>## Temporal goal discounting</strong></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Let us assume that you are a rational agent trying to live your life according to your own value system. You may have some goals that you wish to achieve in the future. You may then proceed to define smaller subgoals (so-called [\u201cinstrumental goals\u201d][2]) that you think will help you achieve your goal.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>However, more often than not, you will make the mistake of discounting the set of skills and indeed all experiences that you will gather along the way to your goal temporally. This may not seem like a big issue but if you are constantly updating your world view based on new information, you may develop better subgoals to achieve your goal or perhaps realise your goal is actually another instrumental goal for something else entirely.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>This is bad news because it deeply skewed a rational agent\u2019s agenda to achieve any goal. Moreover, it presents a real difficulty to train a sufficiently general and intelligent system that updates an internal worldview based on new information. As soon as it updates its worldview, the system must recalculate its trajectory to achieve its goal and so on. In principle, we must recalibrate our trajectories every moment (which, of course, is absurd). Thus, we are stuck with a new worldview with a stale set of trajectories to achieve our goals.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>## Corrective measures</strong></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>What can we do to combat these fallacies (and possibly many more)? Here I present a few higher level ways that I find most appealing. Be warned that they heavily deviate from the \u201coptimal\u201d or rational and are scientifically untested although backed by much empirical data.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>A recurrent shortcoming that seems to have fueled or augmented the above fallacies arises from a constrained worldview. This is the internal mental picture of how the world works. Thus, to get better at making decisions would require a deliberate attempt to internalise new ideas.

Discussion of the potential&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\">catastrophic risks</a> of misaligned or uncontrollable AI also became&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/technology/ai-threat-warning.html\">more prominent</a>, potentially opening up opportunities for policy that could mitigate the threats.</p><p>There\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty about which strategies for AI governance and coordination would be best, though parts of the community of people working on this subject may be coalescing around some ideas. See, for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/12-tentative-ideas-for-us-ai-policy/\">a list of potential policy ideas</a> from Luke Muehlhauser of Open Philanthropy and a survey of expert opinion on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.governance.ai/research-paper/towards-best-practices-in-agi-safety-and-governance\">best practices in AI safety and governance</a>.</p><p>But there\u2019s no roadmap here. There\u2019s plenty of room for debate about which policies and proposals are needed.</p><p>We may not have found the best ideas yet in this space, and many of the existing policy ideas haven\u2019t yet been developed into concrete, public proposals that could actually be implemented. We hope to see more people enter this field to develop expertise and skills that will contribute to risk-reducing AI governance and coordination.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In a nutshell:</strong> Advanced AI systems could have massive impacts on humanity and potentially pose global catastrophic risks. There are opportunities in AI governance and coordination around these threats to shape how society responds to and prepares for the challenges posed by the technology.</p><p>Given the high stakes, pursuing this career path could be many people\u2019s highest-impact option. But they should be very careful not to accidentally exacerbate the threats rather than mitigate them.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why this could be a high-impact career path</strong></h2><p>Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly. In 2022 and 2023, new language and image generation models gained widespread attention for their abilities, blowing past previous benchmarks the technology had met.</p><p>And the applications of these models are still new; with more tweaking and integration into society, the existing AI systems may become easier to use and more ubiquitous in our lives.</p><p>We don\u2019t know where all these developments will lead us. There\u2019s reason to be optimistic that AI will eventually help us solve many of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">world\u2019s problems</a>, raising living standards and helping us build a more flourishing society.</p><p>But there are also substantial risks. AI can be used for both good and ill. And we have concerns that the technology could, without the proper controls, accidentally lead to a major catastrophe \u2014 and perhaps even cause human extinction. We discuss the arguments that these risks exist in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\">in-depth problem profile</a>.</p><p>Because of these risks, we encourage people to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/\">work on finding ways to reduce the danger through technical research and engineering</a>.</p><p>But a range of strategies for risk reduction will likely be needed. Government policy and corporate governance interventions in particular may be necessary to ensure that AI is developed to be as broadly beneficial as possible and without unacceptable risk.</p><p>Governance generally refers to the processes, structures, and systems that carry out decision making for organisations and societies at a high level. In the case of AI, we expect the governance structures that matter most to be national governments and organisations developing AI \u2014 as well as some international organisations and perhaps subnational governments.</p><p>Some aims of AI governance work could include:</p><ul><li>Preventing the deployment of any AI systems that pose a significant and direct threat of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\">catastrophe</a></li><li>Mitigating the negative impact of AI technology on other catastrophic risks, such as nuclear weapons and biotechnology</li><li>Guiding the integration of AI technology into our society and economy with limited harms and to the advantage of all</li><li>Reducing the risk of an \u201cAI arms race,\u201d in which competition leads to technological advancement without the necessary safeguards and caution \u2014 between nations and between companies</li><li>Ensuring that those creating the most advanced AI models are incentivised to be cooperative and concerned about safety</li><li>Slowing down the development and deployment of new systems&nbsp;<i>if</i> the advancements are likely to outpace our ability to keep them safe and under control</li></ul><p>We need a community of experts who understand the intersection of modern AI systems and policy, as well as the severe threats and potential solutions. This field is still young, and many of the paths within it aren\u2019t clear and are not sure to pan out. But there are relevant professional paths that will provide you valuable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/\">career capital</a> for a variety of positions and types of roles.</p><p>The rest of this article explains what work in this area might involve, how you can develop career capital and test your fit, and where some promising places to work might be.</p><h2><strong>What kinds of work might contribute to AI governance?</strong></h2><p>What should governance-related work on AI actually involve? There are a variety of ways to pursue AI governance strategies, and as the field becomes more mature, the paths are likely to become clearer and more established.</p><p>We generally don\u2019t think people early in their careers should be aiming for a specific job that they think would be high-impact. They should instead aim to develop skills, experience, knowledge, judgement, networks, and credentials \u2014 what we call&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/\"><i>career capital</i></a> \u2014 that they can later use when an opportunity to have a positive impact is ripe.</p><p>This may involve following a pretty standard career trajectory, or it may involve bouncing around in different kinds of roles. Sometimes, you just have to apply to a bunch of different roles and test your fit for various types of work before you know what you\u2019ll be good at. The main thing to keep in mind is that you should try to get excellent at something for which you have strong&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/\">personal fit</a> and that will let you contribute to solving pressing problems.</p><p>In the AI governance and coordination space, we see at least six large categories of work that we expect to be important:</p><ul><li>Government work</li><li>Research on AI policy and strategy</li><li>Industry work</li><li>Advocacy and lobbying</li><li>Third-party auditing and evaluation</li><li>International work and coordination</li></ul><p>There aren\u2019t necessarily openings in all these categories at the moment for careers in AI governance, but they represent a range of sectors in which impactful work may potentially be done in the coming years and decades. Thinking about the different skills and forms of career capital that will be useful for the categories of work you could see yourself doing in the future can help you figure out what your immediate next steps should be. (We discuss how to assess your fit and enter this field below.)</p><p>You may want to \u2014 and indeed it may be advantageous to \u2014 move between these different categories of work at different points in your career. You can also test out your fit for various roles by taking internships, fellowships, entry-level jobs, temporary placements, or even doing independent research, all of which can serve as career capital for a range of paths.</p><p>We have also reviewed career paths in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/\">AI technical safety research and engineering</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/information-security/\">information security</a>, which may be crucial to reducing risks from AI, and which may play a significant role in an effective governance agenda. People serious about pursuing a career in AI governance should familiarise themselves with these fields as well.</p><h3><strong>Government work</strong></h3><p>Taking a role within government could lead to playing an important role in the development, enactment, and enforcement of AI policy.</p><p>Note that we generally expect that the US federal government will be the most significant player in AI governance for the foreseeable future. This is because of its global influence and its jurisdiction over much of the AI industry, including the top three AI labs training state-of-the-art, general-purpose models (Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google DeepMind) and key parts of the chip supply chain. Much of this article focuses on US policy and government.</p><p>But other governments and international institutions may also end up having important roles to play in certain scenarios. For example, the UK government, the European Union,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/china-related-ai-safety-and-governance-paths/\">China</a>, and potentially others, may all present opportunities for impactful AI governance work. Some US state-level governments, such as California, may also offer opportunities for impact and gaining career capital.</p><p>What would this work involve? Sections below discuss how to enter US policy work and which areas of the government that you might aim for.</p><p>But at the broadest level, people interested in positively shaping AI policy should aim to gain the skills and experience to work in areas of government with some connection to AI or emerging technology policy.</p><p>This can include roles in:&nbsp;<strong>legislative branches, domestic regulation, national security, diplomacy, appropriations and budgeting, and other policy areas.</strong></p><p>If you can get a role out of the gate that is already working directly on this issue, such as a staff position with a lawmaker who is focused on AI, that could be a great opportunity.</p><p>Otherwise, you should seek to learn as much as you can about how policy works and which government roles might allow you to have the most impact, while establishing yourself as someone who\u2019s knowledgeable about the AI policy landscape. Having almost any significant government role that touches on some aspect of AI, or having some impressive AI-related credential, may be enough to get you quite far.</p><p>One way to advance your career in government on a specific topic is what some call \u201cgetting visibility\u201d \u2014 that is, using your position to learn about the landscape and connect with the actors and institutions that affect the policy area you care about. You\u2019ll want to be invited to meetings with other officials and agencies, be asked for input on decisions, and engage socially with others who work in the policy area. If you can establish yourself as a well-regarded expert on an important but neglected aspect of the issue, you\u2019ll have a better shot at being included in key discussions and events.</p><p>Career trajectories within government can be broken down roughly as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Standard government track:</strong> This involves entering government at a relatively low level and building up your career capital on the inside by climbing the seniority ladder. For the highest impact, you\u2019d ideally end up reaching senior levels by sticking around, gaining skills and experience, and getting promoted. You may move between agencies, departments, or branches.</li><li><strong>Specialisation career capital:</strong> You can also move in and out of government throughout your career. People on this trajectory will also work at nonprofits, think tanks, industry labs, political parties, academia, and other organisations. But they will primarily focus on becoming an expert in a topic \u2014 such as AI. It can be harder to get seniority this way, but the value of expertise and experience can sometimes outweigh seniority.</li><li><strong>Direct-impact work:</strong> Some people move into government jobs without a longer plan to build career capital because they see an opportunity for direct, immediate impact. This might look like getting tapped to lead an important commission or providing valuable input on an urgent project. We don\u2019t generally recommend planning on this kind of strategy for your career, but it\u2019s good to be aware of it as an opportunity that might be worth taking at some point.</li></ul><h3><strong>Research on AI policy and strategy</strong></h3><p>There\u2019s still a lot of research to be done on the most important avenues for AI governance approaches. While there are some promising proposals for a system of regulatory and strategic steps that can help reduce the risk of an AI catastrophe, there aren\u2019t many concrete and publicly available policy proposals ready for adoption.</p><p>The world needs more concrete proposals for AI policies that would really start to tackle the biggest threats; developing such policies, and deepening our understanding of the strategic needs of the AI governance space, should be high priorities.</p><p>Other relevant research could involve surveys of public opinion that could inform communication strategies, legal research about the feasibility of proposed policies, technical research on issues like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BHPxe8YuuJ4SZWAF3/what-is-compute-transformative-ai-and-compute-1-4\">compute governance</a>, and even higher-level theoretical research into questions about the societal implications of advanced AI. Some research, such as that done by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://epochai.org/\">Epoch AI</a>, focuses on forecasting the future course of AI developments, which can influence AI governance decisions.</p><p>However, several experts we\u2019ve talked to warn that a lot of research on AI governance may prove to be useless, so it\u2019s important to be reflective and seek input from others in the field \u2014 both from experienced policy practitioners and technical experts \u2014 about what kind of contribution you can make. We list several research organisations below that we think would be good to work at in order to pursue promising research on this topic.</p><p>One potentially useful approach for testing your fit for this work \u2014 especially when starting out in this research \u2014 is to write up analyses and responses to existing work on AI policy, or investigate some questions in this area that haven\u2019t been the subject of much attention. You can then share your work widely, send it out for feedback from people in the field, and evaluate how much you enjoy the work and whether you might productively contribute to this research longer term.</p><p>But it\u2019s possible to spend too long testing your fit without making much progress, and some people find that they\u2019re best able to contribute when they\u2019re working on a team. So don\u2019t overweight or over-invest in independent work, especially if there are few signs it\u2019s working out especially well for you. This kind of project can make sense for maybe a month or a bit longer \u2014 but it\u2019s unlikely to be a good idea to spend much more than that without meaningful funding or some really encouraging feedback from people working in the field.</p><p>If you have the experience to be hired as a researcher, work on AI governance can be done in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/academic-research/\">academia</a>, nonprofit organisations, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/think-tank-research/\">think tanks</a>. Some government agencies and committees, too, perform valuable research.</p><p>Note that universities and academia have their own priorities and incentives that often aren\u2019t aligned with producing the most impactful work. If you\u2019re already an established researcher with tenure, it may be highly valuable to pivot into work on AI governance \u2014 this position may even give you a credible platform from which to advocate for important ideas.</p><p>But if you\u2019re just starting out a research career and want to focus on this issue, you should carefully consider whether your work will be best supported inside or outside of academia. For example, if you know of a specific programme with particular mentors who will help you pursue answers to critical questions in this field, it might be worth doing. We\u2019re less inclined to encourage people to pursue generic academic-track roles with the vague hope that one day they can do important research on this topic.</p><p>Advanced degrees in policy or relevant technical fields may well be valuable, though \u2014 see more discussion of this in the section on how to assess your fit and get started.</p><h3><strong>Industry work</strong></h3><p>While government policy is likely to play a key role in coordinating various actors interested in reducing the risks from advanced AI, internal policy and corporate governance at the largest AI labs themselves is also a powerful tool. We think people who care about reducing risk can potentially do valuable work internally at industry labs. (Read our career review of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/non-technical-roles-in-ai-labs/\">non-technical roles at AI labs</a>.)</p><p>At the highest level, deciding who sits on corporate boards, what kind of influence those boards have, and to what extent the organisation is structured to seek profit and shareholder value as opposed to other aims, can end up having a major impact on the direction a company takes. If you might be able to get a leadership role at a company developing frontier AI models, such as a management position or a seat on the board, it could potentially be a very impactful position.</p><p>If you\u2019re able to join a policy team at a major lab, you can model threats and help develop, implement, and evaluate promising proposals internally to reduce risks. And you can build consensus around best practices, such as strong information security policies, using outside evaluators to find vulnerabilities and dangerous behaviours in AI systems (red teaming), and testing out the latest techniques from the field of AI safety.</p><p>And if, as we expect, AI labs face increasing government oversight, industry governance and policy work can ensure compliance with any relevant laws and regulations that get put in place. Interfacing with government actors and facilitating coordination over risk reduction approaches could be impactful work.</p><p>In general, the more cooperative AI labs are with each other and outside groups seeking to minimise catastrophic risks from AI, the better. And this doesn\u2019t seem to be an outlandish hope \u2014 many industry leaders have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk\">expressed concern about extinction risks</a> and have even&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-65616866\">called for regulation</a> of the frontier technology they\u2019re creating.</p><p>That said, we can expect this cooperation to take substantial work \u2014 it would be surprising if the best policies for reducing risks were totally uncontroversial in industry, since labs also face huge commercial incentives to build more powerful systems, which can carry more risk. The more everyone\u2019s able to communicate and align their incentives, the better things seem likely to go.</p><h3><strong>Advocacy and lobbying</strong></h3><p>People outside of government or AI labs can influence the shape of public policy and corporate governance via advocacy and lobbying.</p><p>As of this writing, there has not yet been a large public movement in favour of regulating or otherwise trying to reduce risks from AI,&nbsp;<strong>so there aren\u2019t many openings that we know about in this category.</strong> But we expect growing interest in this area to open up new opportunities to press for political action and policy changes at AI labs, and it could make sense to start building career capital and testing your fit now for different kinds of roles that would fall into this category down the line.</p><p>If you believe AI labs may be disposed to advocate for generally beneficial regulation, you might want to try to work for them, or become a lobbyist for the industry as a whole, to push the government to adopt specific policies. It\u2019s plausible that AI labs will have by far the best understanding of the underlying technology, as well as the risks, failure modes, and safest paths forward.</p><p>On the other hand, it could be the case that AI labs have too much of a vested interest in the shape of regulations to reliably advocate for broadly beneficial policies. If that\u2019s right, it may be better to join or create advocacy organisations unconnected from the industry \u2014 supported by donations or philanthropic foundations \u2014 that can take stances that are opposed to the labs\u2019 commercial interests.</p><p>For example, it could be the case that the best approach from a totally impartial perspective would be at some point to deliberately slow down or halt the development of increasingly powerful AI models. Advocates could make this demand of the labs themselves or of the government to slow down AI progress. It may be difficult to come to this conclusion or advocate for it if you have strong connections to the companies creating these systems.</p><p>It\u2019s also possible that the best outcomes will be achieved with a balance of industry lobbyists and outside lobbyists and advocates making the case for their preferred policies \u2014 as both bring important perspectives.</p><p>We expect there will be increasing public interest in AI policy as the technological advancements have ripple effects in the economy and wider society. And if there\u2019s increasing awareness of the impact of AI on people\u2019s lives, the risks the technology poses may become more salient to the public, which will give policymakers strong incentives to take the problem seriously. It may also bring new allies into the cause of ensuring that the development of advanced AI goes well.</p><p>Advocacy can also:</p><ul><li>Highlight neglected but promising approaches to governance that have been uncovered in research</li><li>Facilitate the work of policymakers by showcasing the public\u2019s support for governance measures</li><li>Build bridges between researchers, policymakers, the media, and the public by communicating complicated ideas in an accessible way to many audiences</li><li>Pressure corporations themselves to proceed more cautiously</li><li>Change public sentiment around AI and discourage irresponsible behaviour by individual actors, such as the spreading of powerful open-source models</li></ul><p>However, note that advocacy can sometimes backfire. Predicting how information will be received is far from straightforward. Drawing attention to a cause area can sometimes trigger a backlash; presenting problems with certain styles of rhetoric can alienate people or polarise public opinion; spreading misleading or mistaken messages can discredit yourself and fellow advocates. It\u2019s important that you are aware of the risks, consult with others (particularly those who you respect but might disagree with tactically), and commit to educating yourself deeply about the topic before expounding on it in public.</p><p>You can read more in the section about doing harm below. We also recommend reading our article on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/accidental-harm/\">ways people trying to do good accidentally make things worse and how to avoid them</a>.</p><h3><strong>Third-party auditing and evaluation</strong></h3><p>If regulatory measures are put in place to reduce the risks of advanced AI, some agencies and organisations \u2014 within government or outside \u2014 will need to audit companies and systems to make sure that regulations are being followed.</p><p>One nonprofit, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignment.org/\">Alignment Research Center</a>, has been at the forefront of this kind of work. In addition to its research work, it has launched a program to evaluate the capabilities of advanced AI models. In early 2023, the organisation&nbsp;<a href=\"https://evals.alignment.org/blog/2023-03-18-update-on-recent-evals/\">partnered with two leading AI labs</a>, OpenAI and Anthropic, to evaluate the capabilities of the latest versions of their chatbot models prior to their release. They sought to determine in a controlled environment if the models had any potentially dangerous capabilities.</p><p>The labs voluntarily cooperated with ARC for this project, but at some point in the future, these evaluations may be legally required.</p><p>Governments often rely on third-party auditors as crucial players in regulation, because the government may lack the expertise (or the capacity to pay for the expertise) that the private sector has. There aren\u2019t many such opportunities available in this type of role that we know of as of this writing, but they may end up playing a critical part of an effective AI governance framework.</p><p>Other types of auditing and evaluation may be required as well. ARC has said it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://evals.alignment.org/\">intends</a> to develop methods to determine which models are appropriately aligned \u2014 that is, that they will behave as their users intend them to behave \u2014 prior to release.</p><p>Governments may also want to employ auditors to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/lennart-heim-compute-governance/\">evaluate the amount of compute</a> that AI developers have access to, their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/information-security/\">information security</a> practices, the uses of models, the data used to train models, and more.</p><p>Acquiring the technical skills and knowledge to perform these types of evaluations, and joining organisations that will be tasked to perform them, could be the foundation of a highly impactful career. This kind of work will also likely have to be facilitated by people who can manage complex relationships across industry and government. Someone with experience in both sectors could have a lot to contribute.</p><p>Some of these types of roles may have some overlap with work in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/\">AI technical safety research</a>.</p><p>One potential advantage of working in the private sector for AI governance work is you may be significantly better paid than you would be in government.</p><h3><strong>International work and coordination</strong></h3><p><strong>US-China</strong></p><p>For someone with the right fit, cooperation and coordination with China on the safe development of AI could be a particularly impactful approach within the broad AI governance career path.</p><p>The Chinese government has been a major funder in the field of AI, and the country has giant tech companies that could potentially drive forward advances.</p><p>Given tensions between the US and China, and the risks posed by advanced AI, there\u2019s a lot to be gained from increasing trust, understanding, and coordination between the two countries. The world will likely be much better off if we can avoid a major conflict between great powers and if the most significant players in emerging technology can avoid exacerbating any global risks.</p><p>We have a separate career review that goes into more depth on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/china-related-ai-safety-and-governance-paths/\">China-related AI safety and governance paths</a>.</p><p><strong>Other governments and international organisations</strong></p><p>As we\u2019ve said, we focus most on US policy and government roles. This is largely because we anticipate that the US is now and will likely continue to be the most pivotal actor when it comes to regulating AI, with a major caveat being about China, as discussed in the previous section.</p><p>But many people interested in working on this issue can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to work in US policy \u2014 perhaps because they live in another country and don\u2019t intend on moving.</p><p>Much of the advice above still applies to these people, because roles in AI governance research and advocacy can be done outside of the United States. And while we don\u2019t think it\u2019s generally as impactful in expectation as US government work, opportunities in other governments and international organisations can be complementary to the work to be done in the US.</p><p><strong>The United Kingdom</strong>, for instance may present another strong opportunity for AI policy work that would complement US work. Top UK officials have expressed interest in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/may/26/rishi-sunak-races-to-tighten-rules-for-ai-amid-fears-of-existential-risk\">developing policy around AI</a>, perhaps even a new international agency, and reducing extreme risks. And the UK government announced in 2023 the creation of a new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tech-entrepreneur-ian-hogarth-to-lead-uks-ai-foundation-model-taskforce\">AI Foundation Model Taskforce</a>, with the expressed intention to drive forward safety research.</p><p>It\u2019s possible that by taking significant steps to understand and regulate AI, the UK will encourage or inspire US officials to take similar steps by showing how it can work.</p><p>And any relatively wealthy country could use portions of its budget to fund AI safety research. While a lot of the most important work likely needs to be done in the US, along with leading researchers and at labs with access to large amounts of compute, some lines of research may be productive even without these resources. Any significant advances in AI safety research, if communicated properly, could be used by researchers working on the most powerful models.</p><p>Other countries might also develop liability standards for the creators of AI systems that could incentivise corporations to proceed more cautiously and judiciously before releasing models.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>European Union</strong> has shown that its data protection standards \u2014 the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) \u2014 affect corporate behaviour well beyond its geographical boundaries. EU officials have also pushed forward on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/14/eu-parliament-approves-ai-act/\">regulating AI</a>, and some research has explored the hypothesis that the impact of the union\u2019s AI regulations will extend far&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.governance.ai/research-paper/brussels-effect-ai\">beyond the continent</a> \u2014 the so-called \u201cBrussels effect.\u201d</p><p>And at some point, we do expect there will be AI treaties and international regulations, just as the international community has created the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Biological Weapons Convention, and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to coordinate around and mitigate other global catastrophic threats.</p><p>Efforts to coordinate governments around the world to understand and share information about threats posed by AI may end up being extremely important in some future scenarios.</p><p>The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is one place where such work might occur. So far, it has been the most prominent international actor working on AI policy and has created the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://oecd.ai/en/\">AI Policy Observatory</a>.</p><p>Third-party countries may also be able to facilitate cooperation and reduce tensions betweens the United States and China, whether around AI or other potential flashpoints, should such an intervention become necessary.</p><h2><strong>How to assess your fit and get started</strong></h2><p>If you\u2019re early on in your career, you should focus first on getting skills and other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/\"><i>career capital</i></a> to successfully contribute to the beneficial governance and regulation of AI.</p><p>You can gain career capital for roles in many ways, and the best options will vary based on your route to impact. But broadly speaking, working in or studying fields such as politics,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/should-you-go-to-law-school/\">law</a>, international relations,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/communication/\">communications</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/economics-phd/\">economics</a> can all be beneficial for going into policy work.</p><p>And expertise in AI itself, gained by studying and working in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/machine-learning-phd/\">machine learning</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/\">technical AI safety</a>, or potentially related fields such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/become-an-expert-in-ai-hardware/\">computer hardware</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/information-security/\">information security</a>, should also give you a big advantage.</p><h3><strong>Testing your fit</strong></h3><p>One general piece of career advice we give is to find relatively \u201ccheap\u201d tests to assess your fit for different paths. This could mean, for example, taking a policy internship, applying for a fellowship, doing a short bout of independent research as discussed above, or taking classes or courses on technical machine learning or computer engineering.</p><p>It can also just involve talking to people currently doing a job you might consider having and finding out what the day-to-day experience of the work is like and what skills are needed.</p><p>All of these factors can be difficult to predict in advance. While we grouped \u201cgovernment work\u201d into a single category above, that label covers a wide range of positions and types of occupations in many different departments and agencies. Finding the right fit within a broad category like \u201cgovernment work\u201d can take a while, and it can depend on a lot of factors out of your control, such as the colleagues you happen to work closely with. That\u2019s one reason it can be useful to build broadly valuable career capital, so you have the option to move around to find the right role for you.</p><p>And don\u2019t underestimate the value at some point of just applying to many relevant openings in the field and sector you\u2019re aiming for and seeing what happens. You\u2019ll likely face a lot of rejection with this strategy, but you\u2019ll be able to better assess your qualifications for different kinds of roles after you see how far you get in the process, if you take enough chances. This can give you a lot more information than just guessing about whether you have the right experience.</p><p>It can be useful to rule out certain types of work if you gather evidence that you\u2019re not a strong fit for the role. For example, if you invest a lot of time and effort trying to get into reputable universities or nonprofit institutions to do AI governance research, but you get no promising offers and receive little encouragement even after applying widely, this might be a significant signal that you\u2019re unlikely to thrive in that particular path.</p><p>That wouldn\u2019t mean you have nothing to contribute, but your&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/comparative-advantage/\">comparative advantage</a> may lie elsewhere.</p><p><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/#think-like-a-scientist\"><strong>Read the section of our career guide on finding a job that fits you.</strong></a></p><h3><strong>Types of career capital</strong></h3><p>For a field like AI governance, a mix of people with technical and policy expertise \u2014 and some people with both \u2014 is needed.</p><p>While anyone involved in this field should work to maintain an evolving understanding of both the technical and policy details, you\u2019ll probably start out focusing on either policy or technical skills to gain career capital.</p><p>This section covers:</p><ul><li>Generally useful career capital</li><li>Policy-related career capital</li><li>Technical career capital</li><li>Other specific forms of career capital</li></ul><p>Much of this advice is geared toward roles in the US, though it may be relevant in other contexts.</p><p><strong>Generally useful career capital</strong></p><p>The chapter of the 80,000 Hours career guide on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-policy-and-strategy/(https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/)\">career capital</a> lists five key components that will be useful in any path:&nbsp;<strong>skills and knowledge, connections, credentials, character, and runway.</strong></p><p>For most jobs touching on policy, social skills, networking, and \u2014 for lack of a better word \u2014&nbsp;<i>political</i> skill will be a huge asset. This can probably be learned to some extent, but some people may find they don\u2019t have these kinds of skills and can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to acquire them. That\u2019s OK \u2014 there are many other routes to having a fulfilling and impactful career, and there may be some roles within this path that demand these skills to a much lesser extent. That\u2019s why testing your fit is important.</p><p><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/\"><strong>Read the full section of the career guide on career capital.</strong></a></p><p><strong>Policy-related career capital</strong></p><p>To gain skills in policy, you can pursue education in many relevant fields, such as political science, economics, and law.</p><p>Many master\u2019s programmes offer specific coursework on public policy, science and society, security studies, international relations, and other topics; having a graduate degree or law degree will give you a leg up for many positions.</p><p>In the US, a master\u2019s, a law degree, or a PhD is particularly useful if you want to climb the federal bureaucracy. Our article on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/us-policy-masters-degrees/\">US policy master\u2019s degrees</a> provides detailed information about how to assess the many options.</p><p>Internships in DC are a promising route to evaluate your aptitude for policy work and to establish early career capital. Many academic institutions now offer a strategic \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jTzQGoGABJq7uAynr/consider-semester-in-dc-programs-if-you-re-a-us-student\">Semester in DC</a>\u201d programme, which can let you explore placements of choice in Congress, federal agencies, or think tanks. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KBHHremiibvwjin7L/accepting-apps-college-students-interested-in-us-policy\">Virtual Student Federal Service (VSFS)</a> also offers part-time, remote government internships. Balancing their academic commitments, students can access these opportunities during the academic year, further solidifying their grasp on the intricacies of policy work. This technological advance could be the stepping stone many aspiring policy professionals need to ascend in their future careers.</p><p>Once you have a suitable background, you can take entry-level positions within parts of the government where you can build a professional network and develop your skills. In the US, you can become a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/congressional-staffer/\">congressional staffer</a>, or take a position at a relevant federal department, such as the Department of Commerce, Department of Energy, or the Department of State. Alternatively, you can gain experience in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/think-tank-research/\">think tanks</a> \u2014 a particularly promising option if you have a strong aptitude for research \u2014 and government contractors, private sector companies providing services to the government.</p><p>In Washington, DC, the culture is fairly unique. There\u2019s a big focus on networking and internal bureaucratic politics to navigate. We\u2019ve also been told that while merit matters to a degree in US government work, it is not the primary determinant of who is most successful. People who think they wouldn\u2019t feel able or comfortable to be in this kind of environment for the long term should consider whether other paths would be best.</p><p>If you find you can enjoy government and political work, impress your colleagues, and advance in your career, though, that\u2019s a strong signal that you have the potential to make a real impact. Just being able to thrive in government work can be an extremely valuable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/comparative-advantage/\">comparative advantage</a>.</p><p><i>US citizenship</i></p><p>Your citizenship may affect which opportunities are available to you. Many of the most important AI governance roles within the US \u2014 particularly in the executive branch and Congress \u2014 are only open to, or will at least heavily favour, American citizens. All key national security roles that might be especially important will be restricted to those with US citizenship, which is required to obtain a security clearance.</p><p>This may mean that those who lack US citizenship will want to consider not pursuing roles that require it. Alternatively, they could plan to move to the US and pursue the long process of becoming a citizen. For more details on immigration pathways and types of policy work available to non-citizens, see this blog post on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/e7NKpwD5z2Mnc7y7G/working-in-us-policy-as-a-foreign-national-immigration\">working in US policy as a foreign national</a>.

So it will be very helpful if you\u2019ve studied a relevant subject area for an undergraduate or graduate degree, or a particularly productive course of independent study.</p><p>We have a guide to technical&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/\">AI safety careers</a>, which explains how to learn the basics of machine learning.</p><p>The following resources may be particularly useful for familiarising yourself with the field of AI safety:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.redwoodresearch.org/mlab\">Redwood Research\u2019s MLAB bootcamp curriculum</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/\">BlueDot Impact\u2019s AI Safety Fundamentals</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.mlsafety.org/intro-to-ml-safety\">Center for AI Safety\u2019s Introduction to ML Safety course</a></li></ul><p>Working at an AI lab in technical roles, or other companies that use advanced AI systems and hardware, may also provide significant career capital in AI policy paths. (Read our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-an-ai-lab/\">career review</a> discussing the pros and cons of working at a top AI lab.)</p><p>We also have a separate career review on how becoming an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/become-an-expert-in-ai-hardware/\">expert in AI hardware</a> could be very valuable in governance work.</p><p>Many politicians and policymakers are generalists, as their roles require them to work in many different subject areas and on different types of problems. This means they\u2019ll need to rely on expert knowledge when crafting and implementing policy on AI technology that they don\u2019t fully understand. So if&nbsp;<i>you</i> can provide them this information, especially if you\u2019re skilled at communicating it clearly, you can potentially fill influential roles.</p><p>Some people who may have initially been interested in pursuing a technical AI safety career, but who have found that they either are no longer interested in that path or find more promising policy opportunities, might also decide that they can effectively pivot into a policy-oriented career.</p><p>It is common for people with STEM backgrounds to enter and succeed in US policy careers.&nbsp;<strong>People with technical credentials that they may regard as fairly modest \u2014 such as computer science bachelor\u2019s degrees or a master\u2019s in machine learning \u2014 often find their knowledge is highly valued in Washington, DC.</strong></p><p>Most DC jobs don\u2019t have specific degree requirements, so you don\u2019t&nbsp;<i>need</i> to have a policy degree to work in DC. Roles specifically addressing science and technology policy are particularly well-suited for people with technical backgrounds, and people hiring for these roles will value higher credentials like a master\u2019s or, better even, a terminal degree like a PhD or MD.</p><p>There are many fellowship programmes specifically aiming to support people with STEM backgrounds to enter policy careers; some are listed below.</p><p>This won\u2019t be right for everybody \u2014 many people with technical skills may not have the disposition or skills necessary for engaging in policy. People in policy-related paths often benefit from strong writing and social skills as well as a comfort navigating bureaucracies and working with people holding very different motivations and worldviews.</p><p><strong>Other specific forms of career capital</strong></p><p>There are other ways to gain useful career capital that could be applied in this career path.</p><ul><li>If you have or gain great&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/communication/\">communication skills</a> as, say, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/journalism/\">journalist</a> or an activist, these skills could be very useful in advocacy and lobbying around AI governance.<ul><li>Especially since advocacy around AI issues is still in its early stages, it will likely need people with experience advocating in other important cause areas to share their knowledge and skills.</li></ul></li><li>Academics with relevant skill sets are sometimes brought into government for limited stints to serve as advisors in agencies such as the US Office of Science and Technology. This isn\u2019t necessarily the foundation of a longer career in government, though it can be, and it can give an academic deeper insight into policy and politics than they might otherwise gain.</li><li>You can work at an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/non-technical-roles-in-ai-labs/\"><strong>AI lab in non-technical roles</strong></a>, gaining a deeper familiarity with the technology, the business, and the culture. (Read our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-an-ai-lab/\">career review</a> discussing the pros and cons of working at a top AI lab.)</li><li>You could work on&nbsp;<strong>political campaigns</strong> and get involved in&nbsp;<strong>party politics</strong>. This is one way to get involved in legislation, learn about policy, and help impactful lawmakers, and you can also potentially help shape the discourse around AI governance. Note, though, the previously mentioned downsides of potentially polarising public opinion around AI policy; and entering party politics may limit your potential for impact whenever the party you\u2019ve joined doesn\u2019t hold power.</li><li>You could even try to&nbsp;<strong>become an elected official</strong> yourself, though it\u2019s obviously competitive. If you take this route, make sure you find trustworthy and highly informed advisors to rely on to build expertise in AI, since politicians have many other responsibilities and won\u2019t be able to focus as much on any particular issue.</li><li>You can focus on developing specific skill sets that might be valuable in AI governance, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/information-security/\">information security</a>, intelligence work, diplomacy with China, etc.<ul><li><strong>Other skills</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/organisation-building/\">Organisational</a>, entrepreneurial, management, diplomatic, and bureaucratic skills will also likely prove highly valuable in this career path. There may be new auditing agencies to set up or policy regimes to implement. Someone who has worked at high levels in other high-stakes industries, started an influential company, or coordinated complicated negotiations between various groups, would bring important skills to the table.</li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>Where can this kind of work be done?</strong></h2><p>Since successful AI governance will require work from governments, industry, and other parties, there will be many potential jobs and places to work for people in this path. The landscape will likely shift over time, so if you\u2019re just starting out on this path, the places that seem most important might be different by the time you\u2019re pivoting to using your career capital to make progress on the issue.</p><p>Within the US government, for instance, it\u2019s not clear which bodies will be most impactful when it comes to AI policy in five years. It will likely depend on choices that are made in the meantime.</p><p>That said, it seems useful to give our understanding of which parts of the government are generally influential in technology governance and most involved right now, to help orient. Gaining AI-related experience in government right now should still serve you well if you end up wanting to move into a more impactful AI-related role down the line when the highest-impact areas to work in are clearer.</p><p>We\u2019ll also give our current sense of important actors outside government where you might be able to build career capital and potentially have a big impact.</p><p>Note that this list has by far the most detail about places to work within the US government. We would like to expand it to include more options as we learn more. You can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEy-kk29jR5d0Rpf8M3c4JLbJYAFIwO-JQpoBqWqcUcidAgQ/viewform\">this form</a> to suggest additional options for us to include. (And the fact that an option isn\u2019t on this list shouldn\u2019t be taken to mean we recommend against it or even that it would necessarily be less impactful than the places listed.)</p><p>We have more detail on other options in separate (and older) career reviews, including the following:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/china-related-ai-safety-and-governance-paths/\">China-related AI safety and governance paths</a></li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/party-politics-uk/\">Party politics (UK-focused)</a></li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/policy-oriented-civil-service-uk/\">Policy-oriented government jobs (UK-focused)</a></li></ul><p>You can view the list of places to potentially work <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-policy-and-strategy/#wheretowork\">in the full review on the 80,000 Hours website</a>.</p><p>Our job board also features opportunities in <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/job-board/ai-safety-policy/\">AI safety and policy</a>.</p><p>If you think this path could be a great option for you, we might be able to advise you on next steps, one-on-one.

(You may also want to read our article on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/harmful-career/\">harmful careers</a>.)</p><p>It seems likely there\u2019s a lot of potential to inadvertently cause harm in the emerging field of AI governance. We discussed some possibilities in the section on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/ai-policy-and-strategy/#advocacy\">advocacy and lobbying</a>. Some other possibilities include:</p><ul><li>Pushing for a given policy to the detriment of a superior policy</li><li>Communicating about the risks of AI in a way that ratchets up geopolitical tensions</li><li>Enacting a policy that has the opposite impact of its intended effect</li><li>Setting policy precedents that could be exploited by dangerous actors down the line</li><li>Funding projects in AI that turn out to be dangerous</li><li>Sending the message, implicitly or explicitly, the risks are being managed when they aren\u2019t, or that they\u2019re lower than they in fact are</li><li>Suppressing technology that would actually be extremely beneficial for society</li></ul><p>The trouble is that we have to act with incomplete information, so it may never be very clear when or if people in AI governance are falling into these traps. Being aware that they are potential ways of causing harm will help you keep alert for these possibilities, though, and you should remain open to changing course if you find evidence that your actions may be damaging.</p><p>And we recommend keeping in mind the following pieces of general guidance from our article on accidental harm:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/accidental-harm/#1-ideally-eliminate-courses-of-action-that-might-have-a-big-negative-impact\">Ideally, eliminate courses of action that might have a big negative impact.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/accidental-harm/#2-dont-be-a-naive-optimizer\">Don\u2019t be a naive optimizer</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/accidental-harm/#3-have-a-degree-of-humility\">Have a degree of humility</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/accidental-harm/#4-develop-expertise-get-trained-build-a-network-and-benefit-from-your-fields-accumulated-wisdom\">Develop expertise, get trained, build a network, and benefit from your field\u2019s accumulated wisdom</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/accidental-harm/#5-follow-cooperative-norms.\">Follow cooperative norms</a></li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/accidental-harm/#6-match-your-capabilities-to-your-project-and-influence\">Match your capabilities to your project and influence</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/accidental-harm/#7-avoid-hard-to-reverse-actions\">Avoid hard-to-reverse actions</a>.</li></ol><h3><strong>Burning out</strong></h3><p>We think this work is exceptionally pressing and valuable, so we encourage our readers who might have a strong personal fit for governance work to test it out. But going into government, in particular, can be difficult. Some people we\u2019ve advised have gone into policy roles with the hope of having an impact, only to burn out and move on.</p><p>At the same time, many policy practitioners find their work very meaningful, interesting and varied.</p><p>Some roles in government may be especially challenging for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>Some roles can be very fast-paced, involving relatively high stress and long hours. This is particularly true in Congress and senior executive branch positions and much less so in think tanks or junior agency roles.</li><li>It can take a long time to get into positions with much autonomy or decision-making authority.</li><li>Progress on the issues you care about can be slow, and you often have to work on other priorities. Congressional staffers in particular typically have very broad policy portfolios.</li><li>Work within bureaucracies faces many limitations, which can be frustrating.</li><li>It can be demotivating to work with people who don\u2019t share your values. Though note that policy can select for altruistic people \u2014 even if they have different beliefs about how to do good.</li><li>The work isn\u2019t typically well paid relative to comparable positions outside of government.</li></ul><p>So we recommend speaking to people in the kinds of positions you might aim to have, getting a sense of whether the career path would be right for you. And if you do choose to pursue it, look out for signs that the work may be having a negative effect on you, and seek support from people who understand what you care about.</p><p>If you end up wanting or needing to leave and transition into a new path, that\u2019s not necessarily a loss or a reason for regret. You will likely make important connections and learn a lot of useful information and skills. This career capital can be useful as you transition into another role, perhaps pursuing a complementary approach to AI governance and coordination.</p><h2><strong>What the increased attention on AI means</strong></h2><p>We\u2019ve been concerned about risks posed by AI for years. Based on the arguments that this technology could potentially cause a global catastrophe, and otherwise have a dramatic impact on future generations, we\u2019ve advised many people to work to mitigate the risks.</p><p>The arguments for the risk aren\u2019t completely conclusive, in our view. But the arguments are worth taking seriously, and given the fact that few others in the world seemed to be devoting much time to even figuring out how big the threat was or how to mitigate it (while at the same time progress in making AI systems more powerful was accelerating) we concluded it was worth ranking among our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">top priorities</a>.</p><p>Now that there\u2019s increased attention on AI, some might conclude that it\u2019s less neglected and thus less pressing to work on. However, the increased attention on AI also makes many interventions potentially more tractable than they had been previously, as policymakers and others are more open to the idea of crafting AI regulations.</p><p>And while more attention is now being paid to AI, it\u2019s not clear it will be focused on the most important risks. So there\u2019s likely still a lot of room for important and pressing work positively shaping the development of AI policy.</p><h2><strong>Learn more</strong></h2><p>From 80,000 Hours:</p><ul><li>Podcast:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/ezra-klein-ai-and-dc/\">Ezra Klein on existential risk from AI and what DC could do about it</a></li><li>Podcast:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/mustafa-suleyman-getting-washington-and-silicon-valley-to-tame-ai/\">Mustafa Suleyman on getting Washington and Silicon Valley to tame AI</a></li><li>Podcast:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/holden-karnofsky-how-ai-could-take-over-the-world/\">Holden Karnofsky on how AIs might take over even if they\u2019re no smarter than humans, and his four-part playbook for AI risk</a></li><li>Podcast:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/markus-anderljung-regulating-cutting-edge-ai/\">Markus Anderljung on how to regulate cutting-edge AI models</a></li><li>Podcast:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/lennart-heim-compute-governance/\">Lennart Heim on the compute governance era and what has to come after</a></li><li>Podcast:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/tom-kalil-government-careers/\">Tom Kalil on how to have a big impact in government &amp;

The production of meat and animal products is projected to expand substantially.</strong> This growth is expected to be highest for animals who typically experience the poorest welfare conditions on farms (such as chickens, fish, and crustaceans). Furthermore, farming is likely to become more intensive. All of these factors mean that significantly more animals will experience severe suffering for the sake of the production of meat and animal products.</p><p><strong>A key driver of this growth is the expansion of intensive animal agriculture in low and lower-middle income countries.</strong> As a country's agriculture industry expands, the number of animals farmed in intensive conditions in that country depends on two key factors: per-capita meat consumption (consumption) and the level of industrialisation in meat production systems (production). Both of these key factors follow average trends relating to demographics. Generally, as countries become wealthier, per-capita meat consumption tends to increase, and the meat production system becomes more industrialised.</p><p><strong>Critically, there is variation in trends of meat consumption and meat production across different developing countries.</strong> Some countries have much lower per-capita meat consumption than other countries with similar levels of wealth, and some countries have become wealthier without a significant increase in per-capita meat consumption. On the production side, some countries exhibit much lower levels of intensification compared to other countries with similar levels of wealth. This suggests that countries can achieve economic growth while minimising harms to animals.</p><p><strong>Why does this variation exist? When countries have low per-capita consumption, rates of per-capita consumption that are not increasing, or low levels of intensification, is this because the country has pursued certain policies? If so, what are these policies - and can they be replicated in other countries?</strong> Identifying these policies could unlock strategies to prevent large numbers of animals being farmed in abhorrent conditions while developing countries experience economic growth. Alternatively, it is possible that these trends are influenced by factors other than policies, which may not be replicable in other countries.</p><p><strong>This report is aimed at animal advocacy&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>researchers</strong></i><strong>. In particular, this report is intended for researchers who are interested in exploring whether there are particular policies that can influence meat consumption and production as countries develop.</strong> We do not make any specific policy recommendations in this report, as the research is still at an early stage. However, we believe that building on this research will indeed uncover impactful policy recommendations in the future.</p><p><strong>In this report, we seek to provide a foundation on which other researchers can build and identify promising directions for further research.</strong> We have obtained datasets that can be used to identify these outlying countries. For the consumption side, initial exploration of individual countries has taken place, and potential research directions that the movement could pursue are identified. Regarding the production side, data availability has limited our analysis, so we have identified opportunities for the movement to improve the available data.</p><p><strong>If you are a researcher interested in slowing the growth of industrial animal agriculture in developing countries, we think the most promising research directions are as follows</strong>:</p><ul><li>For consumption, we identified two countries with steady or declining meat and fish consumption: Slovakia and Thailand. It is possible that these steady/declining trends are due to policies that can be replicated in other countries. So, it could be worthwhile for the movement to investigate these two countries in greater depth.</li><li>For consumption, we identified nine countries with low&nbsp;<i>baseline</i> consumption (rather than a steady/declining&nbsp;<i>trend</i> in consumption): Botswana, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Eswatini, and India. It could also be worthwhile to investigate the reasons for this low consumption.</li><li>For production, we have identified a dataset&nbsp;(1) that could be useful for figuring out why some countries adopt intensive animal production systems while others do not. But the dataset is incomplete. Spending some time developing this dataset would enable the movement to start investigating which countries have lower-than-expected levels of intensification, and whether this is due to any particular policies that could be replicated in other countries.</li><li>For both consumption and production, comparing different regions&nbsp;<i>within</i> a country could also be a promising research direction. This could also identify policies that explain differences in meat consumption or industrialisation between regions. Due to time constraints, we have only focused on comparing differences&nbsp;<i>across</i> countries.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/f6xvvrvdje5jweas08km\"></p><p>Figure 1: Summary of our conceptual approach and results.</p><h1>Table of Contents</h1><p><strong><u>1.

Introduction</h1><h2><strong>Animal agriculture in developing countries</strong></h2><p>Unless policies change, the next few decades represent a catastrophe for farmed animals. Consumption of meat and animal products is projected to increase substantially over the coming decades, with one study projecting a global increase of 38% between 2020 and 2050&nbsp;(2). For the consumption of animal products to grow by this magnitude over the next three decades, many more animals will suffer and die to meet this demand&nbsp; - in fact, since the growth will be dominated by small-bodied animals like fish, crustaceans, and chickens, the number of&nbsp;<i>individual</i> animals farmed is likely to increase by much more than 38%&nbsp;(3). These are also the groups of animals who, generally speaking, experience the worst welfare conditions out of all farmed animals and require the most suffering per unit of food&nbsp;(8\u201311). Moreover, the catastrophe could be compounded by the growing insect farming industry, which will likely involve farming trillions of insects - who, the evidence strongly suggests, have the capacity to feel pain (12) - to provide feed for the farming of poultry, fish, pigs, and other animals (13).</p><p>The growth will be highest in low and lower-middle income countries&nbsp;(2,3). For example, the share of global meat consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa will probably at least double by 2100, and a quadrupling of its global share seems possible&nbsp;(4). This growth will likely be supported by the intensification of agriculture - more animals will be produced, and they will be farmed under more intensive conditions. By intensive animal farming, we mean the system of commercial animal farming that involves large-scale, indoor facilities, where animals are 'confined indoors under strictly-controlled conditions'&nbsp;(5). The definition is slightly different for fish and crustaceans, for whom intensive farming refers to systems with high stocking densities and high levels of input and management (e.g. feed); these systems are associated with numerous welfare problems&nbsp;(6,7). There are signs that intensive animal agriculture is politically well-supported and becoming more common in Sub-Saharan Africa&nbsp;(4). The growth will be highest for fish, crustaceans, and chickens&nbsp;(3). These are the groups of animals who, generally speaking, experience the worst welfare conditions out of all farmed animals and require the most suffering per unit of food&nbsp;</p><p>We cannot overstate the severity of the crisis unfolding before us and the urgency with which the animal advocacy movement must meet this challenge. The way that farmed animals are treated by humanity is already a catastrophe - trillions of animals routinely suffer and die under abhorrent conditions. Furthermore, since agriculture is projected to become more intensive, it is likely that the suffering experienced by the average individual animal will become more severe. The growth in consumption will be highest for the very species who already experience the most suffering (fish, crustaceans, and poultry). Moreover, the catastrophe could be compounded by the growing insect farming industry, which will likely involve farming trillions of insects - who, the evidence strongly suggests, have the capacity to feel pain&nbsp;(12) - to provide feed for the farming of poultry, fish, pigs, and other animals&nbsp;(13).</p><p>The growth will be highest in low and lower-middle income countries (2,3). For example, the share of global meat consumption in Sub-Saharan Africa will probably at least double by 2100, and a quadrupling of its global share seems possible (4). This growth will likely be supported by the intensification of agriculture - more animals will be produced, and they will be farmed under more intensive conditions. By intensive animal farming, we mean the system of commercial animal farming that involves large-scale, indoor facilities, where animals are 'confined indoors under strictly-controlled conditions' (5). The definition is slightly different for fish and crustaceans, for whom intensive farming refers to systems with high stocking densities and high levels of input and management (e.g. feed); these systems are associated with numerous welfare problems (6,7). There are signs that intensive animal agriculture is politically well-supported and becoming more common in Sub-Saharan Africa (4).</p><p>Campaigns to oppose industrialisation have been gaining initial attention and consideration in the animal advocacy movement (4,14,15). For example, mitigating the growth of industrialised farming in Africa was a key resolution from the 6th Africa Animal Welfare Conference in Gaborone, Botswana in 2022. Still, It is unknown whether it is possible for advocates in developing countries to limit the intensification of animal agriculture (4,15); expert opinions are divided (15).</p><p>Likewise, if there are ways to limit the consumption of meat and animal products, then this could cause fewer animals to be farmed for food. Since the scale of animal production in developing countries is projected to grow substantially, succeeding in either of these areas could affect a disproportionately large number of animals. As such, influencing the trajectory of animal farming in developing countries is a major opportunity for improving the lives of animals. This is a critical knowledge gap for the animal advocacy movement. The goal of this report is to help advance the research into this question.</p><h2><strong>Key sources on influencing farmed animal welfare in developing countries</strong></h2><p>Existing research on influencing the intensification of animal farming in developing countries is relatively limited. A few key sources are as follows:</p><ul><li>Delgado et al.&nbsp;(17), motivated by disease risks and environmental challenges, analyse what determines the scale of production in animal farming in four developing countries. The authors conclude that many smallholders could remain economically viable for a long time, and the authors suggest ways to promote small-scale farming.</li><li>Schneider&nbsp;(18) describes the concept of the 'meat grab', which involves land deals undertaken to allow industrial meat production. These land deals can be direct (e.g. animal housing and stocking) or indirect (e.g. feed crop production). Schneider argues that the spread of industrial livestock production is driven by 'agribusiness-led and state-brokered industrial meat regimes' that involve land grabbing, hiding externalised costs, and promoting narratives that link meat consumption with progress.</li><li>Von Keyserlingk and H\u00f6tzel&nbsp;(19) discuss how studying intensive animal farming practices can generate insights for addressing animal welfare in developing countries. The authors provide a roadmap on how animal welfare could be addressed in developing countries, and they call for tailored, culturally relevant, and science-based solutions for animal welfare reform.</li><li>Lam et al.&nbsp;(20) examine the expansion of industrial animal farming in 10 low- and middle-income countries. This study shows that domestic policies - such as the government's objectives and the practices that are encouraged - are an important factor in the industrialisation of animal farming.</li><li>Gbejewoh et al.&nbsp;(21) explore one potential avenue to influencing animal production in sub-Saharan Africa: plant-based meats. The authors call for further research on the health effects of plant-based meats, as well as consumer research on the socio-cultural connotations and barriers to adoption in Africa.</li></ul><p>These key sources provide the foundation for understanding the intensification of animal farming in developing countries.</p><p>To build on this foundation, it would be valuable to examine the factors that determine whether, and how, this intensification of animal farming occurs as countries develop. As far as we know, there has not yet been a major, global-scale analysis on this question. Do all countries necessarily develop an intensified animal farming sector, or is it possible for animal farming to remain extensive and small-scale? Are there policies that can meaningfully limit the number of animals living in intensive agriculture as a country develops? If so, what are these policies? In this report, we hope to begin this line of thinking and begin some research directions for the animal advocacy movement to pursue.</p><h1>2. Our Approach for Analysing Trends of Meat Production and Consumption</h1><p>As discussed above, intensive animal agriculture is particularly harmful for animal welfare. In this report, we aim to uncover whether there are any ways to limit the number of animals living in intensive animal agriculture as a country develops. To answer this question, we need to analyse how the number of animals living in intensive animal agriculture changes as a country develops.</p><p>The number of animals living in intensive agriculture in a country depends on two major factors, one relating to consumption and one to production:</p><ol><li>(Consumption) The demand for meat in that country, which can be expressed as the meat consumed per person. If the people in a country eat more meat, then there will be higher demand for meat, which would translate to more animals being farmed and killed. This factor can be measured using the metric&nbsp;<i>meat consumption per capita</i>, which is the average amount of meat consumed per person in a country.</li><li>(Production) The level of intensification in animal agriculture in that country. If the farms in a country are more intensive, then a higher proportion of animals will live and die under intensive conditions. This factor can be measured using the metric&nbsp;<i>proportion of intensive animal production</i>, which is the fraction of animal farming operations in a country that use intensive (rather than extensive) production systems.</li></ol><p>As a country develops, those two major factors also evolve in a predictable way. It is well-established that, on average, as a country becomes wealthier, meat demand per person increases. Likewise, on average, as a country becomes wealthier, animal agriculture transitions from mostly extensive to mostly intensive. We review the evidence supporting these two trends below.</p><p>Critically, these trends hold on average, but not necessarily for every country individually. Averages can obscure useful information. For both of these trends, some countries are outliers.</p><p>It may be the case that, on average, people in wealthier countries consume more meat, but are there individual countries that have become more wealthy while keeping per-person meat consumption steady? Wealthier countries tend to transition towards intensive agriculture, but are there individual countries that have not done so? And if there are individual countries that do not follow these trends - in other words, if some countries have lower meat consumption or a lower proportion of intensive agriculture than would be expected - is the reason that these countries have pursued policies that could be replicated in other countries? These questions are our focus in this report.</p><p>Note that, for our analysis of consumption, we focus on meat and fish and we refer to the total weight of animal products consumed. Ideally, an analysis would include all animal products (especially eggs) and convert the weights of meat, fish, and animal products into 'number of animals slaughtered per capita' or 'number of animals alive at any one time'. This would require some tricky calculations and assumptions - it would be a fruitful endeavour for the next study on this topic, but our current study is just a first look. Sans and Combris&nbsp;(22) (discussed below) found that meat is the most important of the four, though it's still possible for fish, eggs, or milk to increase over time even where meat doesn't.</p><h1>3. Consumption: How Does Meat Consumption Change as Countries Develop?</h1><p>This section of the report will focus on the first of the two major drivers: the consumption of meat per capita.</p><h2><strong>Wealthier countries eat more meat, but there is variation</strong></h2><p>It is well-established that meat consumption per capita and wealth are strongly correlated. As countries grow richer, the average meat consumption of the people living in those countries tends to increase.</p><p>Milford et al&nbsp;(23) analysed the factors that explain the meat consumption per capita observed across countries. The authors identify a number of drivers of meat consumption per capita, which they divide into four categories:</p><ul><li>Economic factors, like income per capita. As people in a country become wealthier, they tend to eat more food per capita ('expansion effect') and then shift away from carbohydrate-rich staples like cereals, roots and tubers towards vegetable oils, sugars, and animal products ('substitution effect').</li><li>Natural endowment factors, like land availability and a climate suited to animal agriculture.</li><li>Social factors. One key factor is urbanisation: people in cities tend to eat away from home and prefer pre-cooked convenience foods. Cities also bring supermarkets, transportation systems, and mass media that may advertise globalised trends, like Western animal-based diets. Social factors also include female participation in the workforce and religious views, for example.</li><li>Globalisation factors. There is no consensus on the relationship between globalisation and diet.</li></ul><p>The authors found that the two most important drivers of meat consumption per capita are income per capita and urbanisation.</p><p>Critically, not every country follows a positive relationship between meat consumption per capita and wealth. Although there is a positive relationship between meat consumption per capita and wealth on average, there are individual countries where meat consumption per capita has not grown even as the country becomes richer.</p><p>Sans and Combris&nbsp;(22) analysed trends of meat consumption for 1961-2011 for 183 countries. The authors also analysed fish, dairy, and egg consumption. The authors find that the consumption of meat and these other animal-based proteins is positively correlated with both GDP per capita and urbanisation. Most of the increase in animal-based protein consumption over time is explained by growth in meat consumption, rather than the consumption of fish, dairy, or eggs.&nbsp;</p><p>But crucially, the authors point out that periods of economic growth are not always accompanied by growth in consumption of meat and other animal-based proteins: Argentina experienced economic growth, but meat protein consumption fell significantly (\u22128 g meat protein /person/day). For China and Spain, the periods where meat consumption grew the most were not the periods where economic growth was highest. The authors discuss the importance of cultural and religious factors in explaining different trends in meat consumption across countries.</p><p>Whitton et al&nbsp;(24) analysed trends of meat consumption for 2000-2019 for 35 countries monitored by the Food and Agriculture Organization and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The authors identified two types of countries: countries in which GDP per capita is correlated with meat consumption, and countries in which there is no such correlation. There were nine countries (all highly wealthy) where GDP per capita was unrelated to meat consumption: Switzerland, Norway, the USA, Australia, Canada, Israel, the UK, New Zealand, and Saudi Arabia. In fact, for some of these countries (New Zealand, Canada, Switzerland), meat consumption appears to be decreasing. The authors believe that this is because many people in these wealthy countries are consciously reducing their meat consumption, motivated by concerns for the environment, health, and animal welfare, as well as higher availability of alternative proteins. This finding is less relevant for our report - while decreasing meat consumption in wealthy countries is a good thing, here we are most interested in the short- and medium-term future of animal farming in developing countries.</p><p>This body of literature shows that there is a positive relationship between GDP per capita and meat consumption per capita. However, there seem to be some individual exceptions - not every country follows this relationship, so there are some countries where GDP per capita increases but meat consumption per capita does not.</p><p>We seek to a) identify countries where meat consumption per capita has not grown, even as the country develops, and b) see if those countries have any policies causing meat consumption per capita not to grow. If we can identify any such policies, those policies could potentially form the basis for campaigns by animal advocacy organisations in other developing countries.</p><h2><strong>How can we look for countries with lower meat consumption?</strong></h2><p>When it comes to the relationship between meat consumption per capita and wealth, we are interested in two types of outliers. These are visualised in the conceptual graphs shown in Figure 2, below.</p><ul><li>The first type of outliers we will call 'raw outliers'. Imagine we produce a graph showing a number of countries for a particular year. The horizontal axis shows the GDP per capita, and the vertical axis shows meat consumption per capita (Figure 2A). The data points would show a positive correlation (grey points). But there may also be some countries that sit below the trend, meaning that their value for meat consumption per capita is lower than would be expected for the country's GDP per capita. These countries are indicated in Figure 2A using an arrow and gold data points.</li><li>The second type of outliers we will call 'slope outliers'. Imagine we produce a graph showing a number of countries for a particular year. The horizontal axis simply lists all of the countries. The vertical axis shows the slope of meat consumption per capita over time. A positive value means that the country's meat consumption per capita has increased over the years. A zero or negative value means that the country's metric has not increased over the years. This means that the country's value for a given metric has remained steady, or has decreased, even as the country develops (assuming the country's GDP per capita has indeed increased over time). These countries are indicated in Figure 2B using an arrow and blue data points.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/ccyib6tjyhszmqn6l6q5\"></p><p>Figure 2: Conceptual graphs showing our approach for analysing meat consumption. A = graph of GDP per capita against meat consumption per capita, with countries with comparatively low meat consumption highlighted in gold (see Figure 3). B = the rate of change of meat consumption per capita over time, with countries with falling or steady meat consumption highlighted in blue (see Figure 4).</p><p>To examine the relationship between GDP per capita and meat consumption per capita - and to identify interesting, outlying countries (as shown in Figure 2) - the steps in our analysis were as follows. For access to our raw data and R code, see the appendix of this report.</p><p>We obtained data on countries'&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/meat-consumption-vs-gdp-per-capita\"><u>meat consumption per capita</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/fish-consumption-vs-gdp-per-capita\"><u>fish consumption per capita</u></a>, and GDP per capita from Our World in Data. Meat consumption per capita and fish consumption per capita are each measured in kg per year. Wealth is measured as GDP per capita, given in international dollars. The data covers the period between 1961 and 2017, plus some older, historical data points.</p><p>We cleaned the data as follows:</p><ul><li>We added meat consumption per capita and fish consumption per capita together to create a new variable: meat + fish consumption per capita.</li><li>We removed entities that did not correspond to individual countries (e.g. supranational bodies, continents).</li><li>We removed data points prior to 1961, as the data contained some older, historical records.</li><li>We removed data points that did not have data for&nbsp;<i>all three of</i> meat consumption per capita, fish consumption per capita, and GDP per capita. This allows us to compare, for each country, the trend in meat + fish consumption and GDP per capita across a single, consistent time period.</li></ul><p>Firstly, we wanted to reproduce Figure 2A, which means identifying countries with unexpectedly low values for meat + fish consumption per capita, given their wealth. We did so, and the resulting graph is Figure 3. We did this as follows:</p><ul><li>We produced a graph of per capita meat + fish consumption vs GDP per capita for one year (Figure 3). We chose 2017, as this is the most recent year with complete data.</li><li>There is no formal way to identify countries that have unexpectedly low values for meat + fish consumption per capita. Therefore, we simply identified countries in the lowest 10% of meat + fish consumption per capita, compared to what would be expected from their GDP per capita. In technical terms, we identified the 10% of countries with the lowest residuals for the relationship between meat + fish consumption per capita and GDP per capita. We chose the value of 10% arbitrarily.</li></ul><p>These countries are coloured in gold in Figure 3.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/loa632bzcdold3wszu5u\"></p><p>Figure 3: Income (GDP per capita, in international dollars) versus per capita meat + fish consumption for 2017. Countries highlighted in gold are in the lowest 10% of residuals, meaning that these countries have a meat + fish consumption per capita that is much lower than would be expected based on their income. Note that the horizontal axis is logged. This graph corresponds to the conceptual graph shown in Fig 2A.</p><p>Secondly, we wanted to produce Figure 2B, which means identifying countries with unexpectedly low&nbsp;<i>changes in&nbsp;</i>meat + fish consumption per capita over time, given their change in wealth over time. We did so, and the resulting graph is Figure 4. We did this as follows:</p><ul><li>For each country, we calculated the rate of change (slope) of meat + fish consumption per capita over time. And we calculated the rate of change (slope) of GDP per capita over time. We also calculated 90% confidence intervals for each of those two slopes.</li><li>We limited this analysis to countries with a positive rate of change (slope) for GDP per capita over time. This means that we ignore countries that did not see an increase in wealth over the time period of the data set.</li><li>We limited this analysis to countries that, for at least one year in the data set, had a GDP per capita below $15,000. This means that we ignore countries like Switzerland, which were wealthy to begin with.</li><li>We limited this analysis to countries where the range of values for GDP per capita was at least $1,000. This means we ignore countries that experienced only small wealth increases (below $1,000) over the time period of the data set.</li><li>We limited this analysis to countries with at least 3 years with data for both GDP per capita and meat consumption per capita.</li><li>We produced a graph showing the rate of change (slope) of meat + fish consumption per capita (and the 90% confidence interval) for each country, ordered from lowest slope to highest slope (Figure 4).</li><li>We wanted to identify countries that meet all of the above criteria and for which the country's slope for meat + fish consumption per capita over time is zero or negative. This criterion means that the country did not see an increase in meat + fish consumption per capita over the data's time period. (Rather than use the estimate of the country's slope for the second criterion, we used the lower bound of the 90% confidence interval for the slope - this lets us include more potentially interesting countries.)</li></ul><p>These countries are coloured in blue in Figure 4.</p><p>We have chosen not to include milk or egg consumption per capita. Really, the best way would be to combine all four, then convert to '# animals slaughtered per capita' or '# animals alive at any one time'. This would require some tricky calculations and assumptions - it would be a fruitful endeavour for the next study on this topic, but our current study is just a first look. Sans and Combris found that meat is the most important of the four, though it's still possible for fish, eggs, or milk to increase over time even where meat doesn't.</p><h2><strong>Examining countries of interest in our dataset</strong></h2><p>Our results show that:</p><ul><li>Meat + fish consumption per capita and GDP per capita are strongly correlated (Figure 3)</li><li>But there is variance in that correlation, meaning that there are countries with relatively low meat + fish consumption per capita for any particular value for GDP per capita (Figure 3, gold points)</li><li>There are many countries that appear to have experienced an increase in GDP per capita but not meat + fish consumption (Figure 4, blue points).</li></ul><p>These findings are consistent with the literature.</p><p>We have identified some countries of interest:</p><ul><li>The 10% of countries with the lowest meat + fish consumption per capita, given GDP per capita, are coloured in gold in Figure 3.</li><li>The 22 countries that have developed but not meat consumption are coloured in blue in Figure 4.

A higher position (above 0) on the vertical axis means that the country's meat + fish consumption per capita has grown over time, while a lower position (below 0) means that it has fallen over time. There are 22 countries highlighted in blue - these are the countries that have experienced a falling or steady meat + fish consumption per capita over time, despite having experienced economic growth. This graph corresponds to the conceptual graph shown in Fig 2B.</p><p>For each of the 22 countries highlighted in Figure 4, we have generated a detailed graph showing how meat + fish consumption and GDP per capita change over time (see Appendix).</p><p>Once the two sets of outliers were identified based on the country-level data, we investigated some especially promising countries in more depth. Our aim here was to find countries whose meat-consumption trends contain useful lessons for animal welfare strategy in other developing countries.</p><p>Owing to time constraints, we didn\u2019t investigate all the outliers in Figures 3 and 4 in more depth. Instead we focused mostly on the developing countries with meat consumption slopes that showed sudden trend changes. Our hope was that some of these trend changes were indicative of policy choices that could be reproduced in other countries.</p><h3><i>Some countries have low absolute consumption</i></h3><p>First, we\u2019ll take a brief look at the outliers in Figure 3 (gold), those countries with low levels of fish + meat consumption given their level of GDP per capita. We didn\u2019t research any of these countries in depth. Of these 17 countries, 9 look like promising avenues for further investigation, while 8 are less relevant. In the table below, we give a simplified summary of these 17 countries, after which we discuss each country in detail.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Countries</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Relevant to further research?</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Explanation</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Turkey</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#f4cccc;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>No</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>These are not low or low-middle income countries</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Algeria, Djibouti, Iraq, Iran</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#f4cccc;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>No</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>The aridity in these countries causes meat prices to be high, which appears to be the reason for low meat consumption.

Firstly, Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, and possibly Turkey aren\u2019t developing countries, so they aren\u2019t as relevant to this report. Secondly, Djibouti, Iraq, Algeria, and Iran are all especially arid countries, and all have unusually high meat prices, which plausibly explains the low levels of consumption. Thirdly, Lebanon\u2019s low levels of meat consumption is a result of the general economic crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at Numbeo data on beef and chicken as a percentage of total food expenditure (using the fixed \u2018Asian food composition\u2019 basket), a sample of twenty random LMICs averaged 37% of total food expenditure on beef and chicken. On the other hand, in the five most arid countries on Earth, beef and chicken made up 47% of total food expenditures. In light of this data, that Djibouti, Iraq, Algeria, and Iran average 45% seems fairly typical for arid countries. While this data isn\u2019t conclusive, it suggests a correlation between aridity and high meat prices, which plausibly explains low levels of meat consumption in arid countries. This hypothesis could be more conclusively tested via a regression examining the relationship between annual rainfall and meat consumption or prices across all countries (while controlling for GDP per capita). On the assumption that this hypothesis is sound, arid countries with low meat consumption (and high meat prices) probably don\u2019t contain especially useful lessons for animal welfare policy in other countries.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of Lebanon, the decline in per capita meat consumption is probably explained by the extremely high meat prices (62% of total food expenditure) that are a result of the general economic crisis. This is corroborated by the Lebanon graphs of the raw data for meat + fish consumption and wealth contained in the Appendix of this report.</p><h3><i>More relevant countries for baseline consumption</i></h3><p>This leaves nine countries with low absolute levels of meat consumption that are relevant to our project. These countries are Lebanon, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Eswatini, India, Botswana, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. These nine countries can be divided into two groups, leaving India as a special case.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The first group includes Botswana, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. In these three cases, meat prices are relatively low. Using the same Numbeo data as above, beef and chicken account for 33% or less of total food expenditures in all three countries. This is below the LMIC average of 37%. So, these countries have low meat consumption&nbsp;<i>despite</i> having low meat prices.</li><li>The second group includes North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Eswatini. For each of these countries, beef and chicken make up 43% or more of total food expenditures. This suggests the causes of low meat consumption in these countries do operate (at least partly) via raising meat prices. As none of these countries are especially arid, it\u2019s unclear what these causes might be at this stage. Based on the Numbeo data, meat seems disproportionately expensive in the poorest European countries, which may help to explain the prices in the three European countries, though it\u2019s still unclear what the mechanism might be. (The mechanism may also help explain Slovakia\u2019s decline in meat consumption, which we discuss later in this report.)</li><li>This leaves India. India\u2019s low level of meat consumption is mostly explained by high rates of vegetarianism among Hindus, but there are a number of caveats to this. Firstly, even if this is true, keeping rates of vegetarianism high within India could still be a major priority for animal advocates, given the large population and rising wealth of the country. Secondly, rates of vegetarianism across the country and across different social groups vary significantly&nbsp;(25), so Indian states with low rates of vegetarianism might still contain lessons about meat consumption that apply to other countries. Finally, if the link between Hindu belief and vegetarianism has grown stronger over time, Indian culture and policy may still contain lessons for public outreach in other countries. (Of course, care must be taken given the relationship between vegetarianism, nationalism, and caste in India.)</li></ul><h3><i>Some countries have a falling or steady consumption over time</i></h3><p>Next we\u2019ll discuss the countries identified in Figure 4 as having a falling or steady level of meat + fish consumption over time, despite having experienced economic growth. There are 22 of these countries, and we investigated nine of these in more depth to check the validity of the country-level consumption trends (Slovakia, Thailand, Uruguay, Paraguay, Botswana, Tanzania, Kyrgyzstan, Kenya, and Ethiopia). We investigated in-depth. This leaves 13 countries for future investigations: Mongolia, Maldives, Guyana, Dominica, Timor, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, Lebanon, Zambia, Eswatini, Bulgaria, Barbados, Ghana, and Estonia.</p><p>These nine countries were selected due to either having an especially clear divergence in their meat + fish consumption and GDP per capita trends (Tanzania, Kyrgyzstan, and Botswana), or showing sudden discontinuities in their consumption trends (Slovakia, Thailand, Paraguay, Uruguay, Kenya, and Ethiopia).&nbsp;</p><p>Here\u2019s a table summarising our research into these outliers we identified in Figure 4.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Country</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Policy/Strategy Relevant?</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Explanation</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Slovakia</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Yes</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Ending of meat subsidies in the early 1990s plausibly contributes to a sustained (25-year) decline in meat consumption.</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Thailand</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Yes</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Meat consumption plateaus at an unusually low level from the ~1992 onward.

These countries may suggest lessons for averting the global development of factory farming:</p><ul><li>The sustained consumption decline in Slovakia may be a result of ending consumer subsidies in the early 1990s. If this is true it\u2019s very encouraging that the effects of such policy changes could be so long lasting. We didn\u2019t encounter any explanations of the sudden uptick in meat + fish consumption around 2015. It\u2019s possible that this uptick was the result of policy changes. If this is the case, avoiding analogous policy changes in other countries may be a priority.</li><li>Thailand plateauing at a moderate level of meat + fish consumption remains unexplained. It looks like rising exports (as in Paraguay and Uruguay) don\u2019t explain this trend. Additionally, the FAO consumption data may be called into question due to its reliance on Thailand's fisheries catch data, the accuracy of which has been criticised by academic studies. We are unsure whether there is a strong reason to be sceptical about this data.</li></ul><p>Five of the countries\u2019 trends didn\u2019t suggest any lessons for averting the global development of factory farming (Lebanon, Kenya, Ethiopia, Paraguay, Uruguay).&nbsp;</p><ul><li>As we mentioned above, Lebanon\u2019s decline in per capita meat consumption is probably a result of the general economic crisis.&nbsp;</li><li>The decline in Ethiopia and Kenya is likely due to the 2011 East African Drought.</li><li>The consumption decline in Paraguay and Uruguay is likely due to rising beef exports, so mimicking their policies probably won\u2019t help to reduce the consumption of animal products globally. The exception is Uruguay\u2019s removal of domestic beef price controls in the 1990s, which is relevant.</li></ul><p>Three countries were inconclusive (Botswana, Kyrgyzstan, Tanzania).</p><ul><li>The literature around meat consumption in Botswana and Kyrgyzstan lacked deeper explanations of the FAO data, though it\u2019s possible that more information could be pieced together through relevant government reports.</li><li>Low meat consumption in Tanzania seems overdetermined by a range of economic factors, but these factors all seem quite harmful for economic development, and hence aren\u2019t worth pursuing. It\u2019s possible that comparing Tanzania with similar countries (or comparing different regions within Tanzania) could uncover additional factors explaining the low meat consumption which aren\u2019t economically harmful, which may provide a basis for policy in other countries.</li></ul><h3><i>Promising country #1: Slovakia</i></h3><p>Now we can move on to Slovakia and Thailand, which are the most encouraging cases we investigated in depth.</p><p>Slovakia became an independent country in 1993, Czechoslovakia dissolved into Slovakia and Czechia. As such, meaningful data for Slovakia is only available from 1993. (Immediately after Czechoslovakia dissolved, per-capita meat consumption was higher in the Czechia than in Slovakia, so using data from Czechoslovakia would overestimate the actual consumption in the lands that would become Slovakia.)&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/um73awwck76utkvygurc\"></p><p>Figure 5: The per-capita consumption of meat and animal products in Slovakia over time. The first year in the data is 1993. Data source: FAO Food Balances data.</p><p>Looking at the graph of animal product consumption in Slovakia, we see a steady decline between 1993 and 2014, followed by a sudden uptick beginning in 2015.</p><p>When we consider that Slovakia's economy grew during this period (a graph of the GDP per capita is available in the Appendix), this sustained decline in meat consumption remains mysterious. Slovakia enjoyed roughly 5% annual per capita GDP growth between 1993 to 2008. The consumption data for Czechia shows the same initial steep decline in the early 1990s, but notably lacks the sustained decline over the next 20 years that makes Slovakia such an anomaly. This is despite Slovakia staying at roughly 85% of Czechia\u2019s per capita GDP throughout the entire period.</p><p>As we did, Hupkova et al&nbsp;(26) note that Slovak incomes grow from 1995. The authors note that this coincides with the rise in poultry consumption that flattens out the overall decline in meat and fish consumption. They also claim that rising beef prices in EU member states, plus the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in 2000/2001, contribute to the sustained decline in beef consumption. However, this still leaves us with a number of questions. Why did per capita pork consumption also decline until the 2010s? Why did chicken consumption decline from 2006? Why were the declines in beef and pork consumption strong enough to drag down Slovakia\u2019s overall trend while Czechia remained steady?</p><p>Prokeinova and Hanova&nbsp;(27) point out that, in the early 1990s, Slovakia abolished subsidies for the production and consumption of meat. We were unable to find more detail on the precise nature of these subsidies, beyond an expert telling us that these subsidies included a negative sales tax on beef (28). However, if the removal of consumption subsidies in the early 1990s really is the key factor explaining the long term decline, this is potentially encouraging for the animal advocacy movement. If this hypothesis is sound, it suggests that removing consumption or production subsidies in countries with unusually high levels of meat consumption may have especially long-lasting effects.</p><p>This hypothesis may be corroborated by the removal of domestic price controls leading to a decline in beef consumption in Uruguay (which we discuss below). The obvious downside to these points is the fact that they seem to have the strongest effect on the consumption of beef, and possibly pork, which are likely less harmful from an animal welfare production than the consumption of chicken&nbsp;(9\u201311). In developed countries, where chicken acts as a substitute for beef and pork, this may mean that this policy can cause more harm to animals than good&nbsp;(9\u201311). (This conclusion may differ in some low-income countries if chickens are raised extensively by families, rather than intensively on large-scale farms.)</p><h3><i>Promising country #2: Thailand</i></h3><p>Moving on to Thailand, we see that meat + fish consumption appears to peak in 1992, and then very gradually decline from then on (Figure 6, bottom panel). It plateaus at around 55 kg of per capita consumption - significantly lower than other countries in the region, such as Myanmar (108 kg), China (102 kg), and Vietnam (94 kg) (FAO 2019 per capita consumption data). This plateau in meat + fish consumption, despite further steady economic growth, is encouraging - but it comes with a major caveat.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/dmdgljxxhdei7jnb9dz7\"></p><p>Figure 6: Thailand's GDP per capita (top) and meat + fish consumption (bottom) over time. Data source: Our World in Data (See \"Data and Analysis\", above).</p><p>Derrick et al&nbsp;(28) investigated the marine fisheries catches that Thailand reported to the FAO between 1950 and 2014 and found that reconstructed fisheries catches were nearly three times larger than the data Thailand reported to the FAO. While Derrick et al\u2019s investigation only focused on reported catch data, not domestic consumption data, it might suggest that some of Thailand's trend is an artefact of the data. We haven\u2019t found any resources either confirming or disconfirming the possibility that this underreporting applies to the FAO consumption data for Thailand as well (and we are exploring this point with experts). In the absence of any such confirmation, we can note that Derrick et al seem to regard the post-1970 consumption data reliable enough to use it to estimate small-scale fisheries catches during the period, which is some encouragement.</p><p>If the FAO consumption data is accurate, we can ask what might explain the plateau that we have identified. Unfortunately, we were unable to find any conclusive explanations.&nbsp;</p><p>We do not think that this plateau can be explained by exports. Thailand is a major exporter of chicken, and even more so of fish, so we considered exports raising prices and displacing domestic consumption as a hypothesis. However, unlike in Paraguay and Uruguay, Thailand primarily exports non-luxury meats - therefore, rising prices would not necessarily displace domestic consumption. Additionally, Piumsombun&nbsp;(29) notes: \u201cDespite the fact that Thailand is a net fish exporting country, domestic per capita fish consumption is relatively high compared to consumption of other three main animal protein commodities, namely pork, beef, and chicken\u201d. Piumsombun\u2019s data also shows that per capita fish consumption rose by 3% per annum between 1980 and 2000. This was the period that Derrick et al argue contains the greatest increase in catches, further supporting the idea that rising fish exports can\u2019t explain flat domestic consumption post-1992.</p><p>In light of this, we are still unsure what might explain the plateau in Thailand\u2019s meat + fish consumption, so further research in this area may be beneficial.</p><h3><i>Four countries are false positives (Kenya, Ethiopia, Paraguay, Uruguay)</i></h3><p>Looking at the four \u2018false positive\u2019 countries, they fall into two groups. The meat + fish consumption declines in Kenya and Ethiopia are likely a result of the 2011 East African Drought. The declines in Paraguay and Uruguay are likely due to rising beef exports displacing domestic meat consumption despite the overall increase in domestic meat production.</p><p>Kenya and Ethiopia both show a significant and lasting decline in per-capita meat consumption beginning around 2010-12, coinciding with the 2011 East African Drought. Though we didn\u2019t look for sources that aimed to establish the causal relationship between the drought and the decline in meat consumption, it is plausible that it was significant, so we de-prioritised investigating Ethiopia and Kenya in more depth. It\u2019s worth mentioning that other sources do provide alternate explanations for the decline in Ethiopia, with Whitton et al&nbsp;(24) claiming: \u201cDecrease in per capita meat consumption in Nigeria and Ethiopia is also driven by population growth with meat consumed only on special occasions.\u201d</p><p>Paraguay and Uruguay are a more interesting case. Nin et al.&nbsp;(30) examine domestic beef production in Paraguay and Uruguay from the 1970s and find that both countries underwent a significant increase in their beef production and beef exports during the period, especially between ~1990 and the mid 2000s, yet their beef consumption steadily declined during the period. Specifically, Paraguayan beef consumption peaked at 44 kg/capita in 1992, and bottomed out at 11 kg/capita in 2009, and Uruguayan beef consumption peaked in 1994 at 63 kg/capita, and bottomed out in 2007 at 19 kg/capita (FAOSTAT Food Balances data). Both countries' beef consumption remained relatively flat through the 2010s as well (FAOSTAT Food Balances data). Whitton et al.&nbsp;(24) explicitly connect this decline to an increasingly lucrative export market displacing domestic consumption in the case of Paraguay. Nin et al.&nbsp;(30) attribute Uruguay\u2019s increase in beef exports/production and simultaneous decline in domestic consumption to a number of liberalising economic policy changes during the 1990s. The most important changes included the lifting of export taxes and various domestic beef subsidies and price controls (similar to the case of Slovakia).</p><p>Nin et al. (32) discuss three likely aspects of the causal chain: increasing exports causes increasing domestic beef prices, which causes lower domestic meat consumption. Firstly, as beef exports to wealthier markets increased, this drove up the price of scarce inputs like land (and possibly calves), leading to a higher floor on domestic prices. Secondly, in order to secure access to more demanding export markets, both countries introduced strict quality and health controls during the 1990s and 2000s. This increased domestic production costs, which was plausibly passed on to consumers. Finally, soybean production and exports also increased significantly in both countries during this period, which may have increased land prices, and hence the cost of beef production, by restricting the supply of cheap pasture.&nbsp;</p><p>This explanation of beef exports displacing domestic meat consumption seems broadly plausible, especially considering the unusually central role of beef as a staple food in both countries. Aside from the removal of domestic price controls in Uruguay (a policy change also present in Slovakia), it seems like declining meat consumption in Uruguay and Paraguay doesn\u2019t suggest any policy proposals for reducing meat consumption in developing countries as a whole. Rather, this seems to be a case of reducing consumption in one country while increasing it elsewhere. It is worth noting that good long-run data showing an increase in the domestic price of meat, especially beef, in both countries during this period would provide stronger evidence for our hypothesis that exports displaced domestic consumption. Unfortunately we\u2019ve so far been unable to find such data for the relevant period.&nbsp;</p><h3><i>Three countries are inconclusive (Botswana, Kyrgyzstan, Tanzania)</i></h3><p>We now move on to the three inconclusive countries. In the case of Botswana and Kyrgyzstan, our literature review didn\u2019t uncover any deeper explanations of the trends in the FAO data. Our review was somewhat preliminary, so it\u2019s possible a more thorough investigation - especially of relevant government policy reports - could uncover more useful information.</p><p>Our investigation into the causes of Tanzania\u2019s declining meat + fish consumption wasn\u2019t especially encouraging, though we found more relevant information than in the case of Botswana and Kyrgyzstan. Hartwich et al&nbsp;(31) and Wang et al&nbsp;(32) both present a picture of widespread production inefficiency hampering levels of meat consumption. Hartwich et al focus on red meat production, where they note that low levels of red meat consumption may be caused by poor vertical integration, a lack of access to credit, opaque markets, and a general lack of demand for (or regulation of) meat quality. Wang et al note general inefficiencies associated with small-scale, mostly household-level production of animal products in rural areas as another factor.</p><p>Neither of these sources compared the prevalence of these factors in Tanzania with other economically similar countries with rising meat consumption. As a consequence, it\u2019s difficult to determine which of these factors explain the unusual trend in Tanzanian meat + fish consumption. So, further research examining trends in different regions within Tanzania, or comparing Tanzania with similar countries could be productive. However, even if some of these features of the Tanzanian market were identified as being responsible for the declining meat + fish consumption, it\u2019s difficult to see how they could be turned into worthwhile policy recommendations. If the animal advocacy movement seeks to prevent the intensification of animal agriculture in developing countries, while fully supporting human economic development, it doesn\u2019t look like recreating the conditions of Tanzania\u2019s meat market is a viable path forward.</p><h2><strong>Future research for consumption</strong></h2><p>We identified two countries with steady or declining meat + fish consumption: Slovakia and Thailand. It is possible that these steady/declining trends are due to policies that can be replicated in other countries. So, it could be worthwhile for the movement to investigate these two countries in greater depth. Also, we identified three countries with low&nbsp;<i>baseline</i> consumption (rather than a steady/declining&nbsp;<i>trend</i> in consumption): Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and Eswatini. It could also be worthwhile to investigate the reasons for this low consumption.</p><h1>4. Production: How Does Animal Farming Become More Intensive as Countries Develop?</h1><p>This section of the report will focus on the second of the two major drivers: the level of intensification of a country's animal agriculture sector.</p><h2><strong>Wealthier countries intensify their animal production, but there is variation</strong></h2><p>Published evidence supports the idea that countries, on average, intensify their animal agriculture sectors as wealth increases.</p><p>Steinfeld et al&nbsp;(33) describe, in general terms, how countries' animal agriculture operations evolve as the countries develop. As a country becomes wealthier and more urbanised, the demand for meat increases. This leads to the emergence of large-scale operators using intensive farming methods. Intensive farms initially emerge near towns and cities, where demand is highest, before moving away from human populations as technology and infrastructure develops to enable this move.</p><p>Chaiban et al&nbsp;(34) analysed chicken farms in four countries: Nigeria, Thailand, Argentina, and Belgium. The authors found that intensification, as measured by the average number of chickens per farm, was higher in countries with a higher GDP per capita.</p><p>Gilbert et al&nbsp;(1) identified a few reasons why there may be a link between GDP per capita and the levels of intensification in animal agriculture. Wealth is both a 'cause and a consequence' of intensification. GDP per capita can drive intensification: wealthier people demand more meat, which creates an economic incentive for a country to invest in intensive animal agriculture; at the same time, to shift towards intensive production methods, producers require investments, which can be more easily found in countries with increasing incomes. But it is plausible that intensification can also drive GDP per capita: intensive animal agriculture can produce profits, which translate to higher incomes.</p><h2><strong>How can we look for countries with less intensive animal production?</strong></h2><p>When it comes to the relationship between intensive production and wealth, we take a similar approach as we did for consumption (above). However, the available data is more limited. As such, we are mainly interested in one type of outlier. This is visualised in the conceptual graph shown in Figure 7, below.</p><ul><li>There is limited data for 'raw outliers' (Figure 7A). We discuss this limited data below.</li><li>Currently, there is insufficient data to consider 'slope outliers' for the proportion of intensive animal production (Figure 7B).</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/fsol4tox1aggwpwnanzh\"></p><p>Figure 7: Research into the relationship between intensive animal production and wealth is hindered by data availability. There is only limited data for the relationship between wealth and the proportion of intensive animal production (A), and there is completely insufficient data for analysing the slope of the proportion of intensive animal production over time (B).</p><p>Gilbert et al provide the strongest quantitative analysis of the relationship between GDP per capita and intensification of animal agriculture. To measure the level of intensification of animal agriculture in a country, Gilbert et al&nbsp;(1) use the measure 'proportion of animals farmed under intensive systems'. The authors obtained data from various sources like government publications on the proportion of animals raised under intensive vs extensive production systems. This enabled the authors to produce a dataset covering 86 countries for chickens and 97 countries for pigs.</p><p>We have graphed this data below. There does appear to be some spread in the data - if you look at the data points with a GDP per capita between roughly $1,000 and $10,000 USD PPP, there are countries at similar levels of wealth (horizontal axis) but with very different levels of intensification (vertical axis).&nbsp;</p><p>There is less variance in the very wealthy countries. Above roughly $10,000 USD PPP, most countries have a very high proportion of intensively raised animals.</p><p>Nevertheless, this is quite a promising result - it suggests that it may be possible for countries to be relatively wealthy yet have low levels of intensification in animal farming.</p><p>Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in contacting Gilbert et al to obtain the raw data. So, we cannot tell which country corresponds to which data point. It could be possible to deduce the countries' identities using careful detective work, as the graph in Gilbert et al also gives population data. Due to time constraints, we have not attempted to do this. (We're specifically interested in the graphs in Gilbert et al labelled Figure 2, which corresponds to our Figure 8 in the present report. Every other graph in their paper is supported by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/A7GQXG\"><u>model projections which are available</u></a>, but those graphs are less directly relevant for our purposes.)<br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/joy7eef1bgprlktm1d0o\"></p><p>Figure 8: Data on wealth versus the proportion of intensively raised farm chickens (left) and pigs (right), from Gilbert et al&nbsp;(1). Note that the horizontal axis is on a logarithmic scale. This graph corresponds to the conceptual graph shown in Figure 8A.</p><p>There are other metrics that could be used. One candidate is the average scale of production, perhaps measuring the mean number of chickens per farm&nbsp;(33\u201335). However, we have not encountered data on the average scale of production for a large number of countries. The closest thing we found is data on average farm size, available from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/farm-size#average-farm-size-by-country\"><u>Our World in Data</u></a>, but this focuses on plant agriculture. Another candidate is productivity, perhaps measuring the weight of meat produced per animal per year&nbsp;(1). This data is indeed available from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production#productivity-yield-per-animal\"><u>Our World in Data</u></a>. Broiler chickens farmed under intensive conditions generally have a higher productivity than those farmed under extensive conditions&nbsp;(36). However, the opposite trend has been observed for other animals like cows&nbsp;(37). Also, the breed of chickens used (fast-growing vs slow-growing) is a much stronger predictor of productivity than the production system&nbsp;(36). So, productivity is likely to be a poor proxy for a country's level of intensification.</p><h1>5. General Discussion</h1><h2><strong>You could also analyse different regions&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>within</strong></i><strong> a country</strong></h2><p>In this report, we have focused on analysing differences in consumption and production of meat products&nbsp;<i>between</i> different countries. However, it could be equally useful to look at different regions&nbsp;<i>within a single country</i>. If a country consists of different regions, or states, or territories, then it is possible that those different areas have different patterns of meat consumption or industrialisation of meat production. Perhaps one state within a country has become wealthier but has maintained a steady per-capita meat consumption, or maybe a particular region has been slower to industrialise its animal agriculture industry than other regions. If future research can identify such regions, then that might also be a promising place to search for policies that can slow the growth of industrial animal agriculture.</p><h2><strong>How could alternative proteins affect things?</strong></h2><p>We believe that influencing the trajectory of animal farming in developing countries should be a major priority for the animal advocacy movement, despite the small possibility that factory farming may be made obsolete by alternative proteins (e.g. currently available plant-based products, or future products made from cultivated meat). It is unclear how alternative proteins will develop in the future. We do not know whether alternative proteins will grow into a meaningful and permanent competitor for meat and animal products&nbsp;(38\u201340), and we do not know how the performance of alternative proteins will differ across countries. This means that relying on alternative proteins to prevent the colossal amount of animal suffering in the world's future is very risky. Separately, restricting factory farming may help alternative proteins take hold - some animal welfare improvements can make meat and animal products less economically competitive, and some improvements can even reduce the number of animals farmed in a country&nbsp;(41). As such, even if you are optimistic about alternative proteins, policies that restrict the growth of factory farming in developing countries are nevertheless an important tool for the animal advocacy movement.</p><h2><strong>The importance of human justice</strong></h2><p>Finally, we would like to emphasise that animal advocacy in developing countries is different from animal advocacy in developed countries in many ways. For example, many people and governments see the growth of animal agriculture as one pathway to economic growth and development. The issue of requiring animal welfare standards or limiting industrial growth for those living in poverty is the subject of debate&nbsp;(42). At the same time, issues facing humans such as poverty, disease, and food insecurity which makes it difficult for many people to see animal welfare as a priority&nbsp;(15). Furthermore, animal advocacy has a history of being used to oppress people who undertake practices that do not conform to dominant Western ideals&nbsp;(43\u201345). When people in developed countries advocate against particular practices overseas, this can reinforce harmful racial prejudices&nbsp;(46,47). That said, animal welfare is not a concept unique to Western countries - in one study across a wide variety of countries, participants in all countries agreed that the welfare of both farmed and companion animals were important, and participants supported laws protecting animal welfare&nbsp;(48). The authors of this present report are based in wealthy, developed countries, and we acknowledge the bias and blindspots that this position brings. Our primary aim is to provide tools, including this report, to assist the work of animal advocates living and working in developing countries - indeed, one such collaboration with an organisation based in Uganda provided the initial motivation to write this report. We are aware of many animal advocacy organisations in developing countries that are enthusiastic about limiting the growth of intensified animal farming in their own countries, and it is this work that we aim to support.</p><h1>6. Conclusion: Research Directions for the Animal Advocacy Movement</h1><p>Based on the data and analysis in this report, there are some fruitful topics of research that would benefit the animal advocacy movement if explored further:</p><ul><li>Consumption: We identified two especially promising countries with steady or declining meat + fish consumption: Slovakia and Thailand. It is possible that these steady/declining trends are due to policies that can be replicated in other countries. The same applies for Uruguay\u2019s removal of domestic beef subsidies in the 1990s. So, it could be worthwhile for the movement to investigate these three countries in greater depth. Additionally, the twelve countries with a steady/declining trend in meat consumption which we didn\u2019t investigate in depth represent promising avenues for future research. Also, we identified nine countries with low&nbsp;<i>baseline</i> consumption (rather than a steady/declining&nbsp;<i>trend</i> in consumption): Botswana, Nigeria, Sri Lanka, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Eswatini, and India. It could also be worthwhile to investigate the reasons for this low baseline consumption.&nbsp;</li><li>Production: It would be useful to improve upon the data in Figure 8 by figuring out which countries correspond to which data points. This would identify countries with levels of intensification in animal farming that are lower than would be expected based on those countries' wealth. Exploring why those countries have low levels of intensification may identify policies that could be replicated in other developing countries. This could be achieved by obtaining the raw data from Gilbert et al (although&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/A7GQXG\"><u>their model projections are available</u></a>, our attempts to contact the authors for raw data have been unsuccessful), some careful detective work on the dataset, or by replicating the data collection that was conducted by Gilbert et al to create a new dataset.</li><li>For both consumption and production, it could also be promising to compare different regions&nbsp;<i>within</i> a single country. This could also help identify policies that explain differences in meat consumption or the level of industrialisation between regions.</li></ul><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p>Thank you to the members of the Melbourne Effective Altruism community who provided useful comments on this report.</p><h1>Appendix: Access to Raw Data and Code</h1><p>The raw data, R code, and figures from this report can be accessed in the OSF repository here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://osf.io/cfe5v/\"><u>https://osf.io/cfe5v/</u></a>.</p><h1>Appendix: Graphs of Raw Data for Consumption and Wealth</h1><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/mq4titm24mamxxd5ftm6\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/uagllmvegno1qrolcvnx\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/l27jekglic4czcvgjlsf\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/rgz6bbw5zw6snnujhaaq\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/ghljetxyp4zgoxx648om\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/n5u4v7kp5htvscqszh5k\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/enaube4nsgjhh0mkv3ie\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/gciqe7kne4zp5brvogpv\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/pmmluohxuzl2tlxifuig\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/kchugmyevbiee5emu4q0\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/gi8kfhfesjfxeshlvxcz\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/passctqktmlabaopfqxi\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/z5ayqe0rxh0ma2gy0643\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/hoi4bma73x7mddlsmfs1\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/d5pza5psfsppwnuaua9a\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/dyeqywsb6hkpywqi2eyb\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/azgjrd50clekqu1yxyfm\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/t3clb6t0gi7qfofxjxpj\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/dmdgljxxhdei7jnb9dz7\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/iy66iomolewu28coaa3q\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/zqdrbcd26seopnimoyql\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hjX7FRKH58HysoNup/m70zeck8mvdiubqodhki\"></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>References</h1><p>1.

There are a few options:</p><p><strong>Full steam ahead.</strong> We try to get to AGI as fast as possible: we scale up as quickly as we can; we only spend time on safety evaluations to the extent that it doesn\u2019t interfere with AGI-building efforts; we open source models to leverage the pool of talent not at AGI labs.</p><p><i>Quick take.</i> I think this would be bad, as it would drastically increase x-risk.</p><p><strong>Iterative deployment.</strong> We treat AGI like we would treat many other new technologies: something that could pose risks, which we should think about and mitigate, but ultimately something we should learn about through iterative deployment. The default is to deploy new AI systems, see what happens with a particular eye towards noticing harms, and then design appropriate mitigations. In addition, rollback mechanisms ensure that we can AI systems are deployed with a rollback mechanism, so that if a deployment causes significant harms</p><p><i>Quick take.</i> This is better than full steam ahead, because you could notice and mitigate risks before they become existential in scale, and those mitigations could continue to successfully prevent risks as capabilities improve<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefotocnaqg78\"><sup><a href=\"#fnotocnaqg78\">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p><p><strong>Conditional pause.</strong> We institute regulations that say that capability improvement must pause once the AI system hits a particular threshold of riskiness, as determined by some relatively standardized evaluations, with some room for error built in. AI development can only continue once the developer has exhibited sufficient evidence that the risk will not arise.</p><p>For example, following&nbsp;<a href=\"https://evals.alignment.org/\"><u>ARC Evals</u></a>, we could evaluate the ability of an org\u2019s AI systems to autonomously replicate, and the org would be expected to pause when they reach a certain level of ability (e.g. the model can do 80% of the requisite subtasks with 80% reliability), until they can show that the associated risks won\u2019t arise.</p><p><i>Quick take.</i> Of course my take would depend on the specific details of the regulations, but overall this seems much better than iterative deployment. Depending on the details, I could imagine it taking a significant bite out of overall x-risk. The main objections which I give weight to are the overhang objection (faster progress once the pause stops) and the racing objection (a pause gives other, typically less cautious actors more time to catch up and intensify or win a capabilities race), but overall these seem less bad than not stopping when a model looks like it could plausibly be very dangerous.</p><p><strong>Unconditional temporary pause.</strong> We institute regulations that ban the development of AI models over some compute threshold (e.g. \u201cmore powerful than GPT-4\u201d). Every year, the minimum resources necessary to destroy the world drops by 0.5 OOMs<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwhm3sjtn0q9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwhm3sjtn0q9\">[2]</a></sup></span>, and so we lower the threshold over time. Eventually AGI is built, either because we end the pause in favor of some new governance regime (that isn\u2019t a pause), or because the compute threshold got low enough that some actor flouted the law and built AGI.</p><p><i>Quick take.</i> I\u2019ll discuss this further below, but I think this is clearly inferior to a conditional pause, and it\u2019s debatable to me whether it is better or worse than iterative deployment.</p><p><strong>Unconditional permanent pause.</strong> At the extreme end, we could imagine a complete ban on making progress towards AGI. We aren\u2019t just avoiding training new frontier models \u2013 we\u2019re preventing design of new architectures or training algorithms, forecasting via scaling laws, study of existing model behaviors, improvements on chip design, etc. We\u2019re monitoring research fields to nip any new paradigms for AGI in the bud<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrc73o4gltln\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrc73o4gltln\">[3]</a></sup></span>.</p><p><i>Variant 1:</i> This scenario starts like the unconditional temporary pause story above, but we use extreme surveillance once the compute threshold becomes very low to continue enforcing the pause.</p><p><i>Variant 2:</i> In addition to this widespread pause, there is a tightly controlled and monitored government project aiming to build safe AGI.</p><p><i>Quick take.</i> I don\u2019t usually think about these scenarios, but my tentative take is that the scenario I outlined, or Variant 2 (but not Variant 1), would be the best outcome on this list. It implies a level of global coordination that would probably be sufficient to tackle other societal challenges, decreasing the importance of getting AGI soon, and we can likely obtain many of the benefits of AGI eventually by developing the relevant technologies ourselves with our human intelligence. (We could probably even get an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/how-digital-people-could-change-the-world/\"><u>intelligence explosion from digital people</u></a>, e.g. through whole-brain emulation.) Nonetheless, I will set these scenarios aside for the rest of this post as I believe there is widespread consensus that this is not a realistic option available to us.</p><h3>Why I prefer conditional over unconditional pauses</h3><p>There are many significant advantages of a conditional pause, relative to an unconditional temporary pause:</p><ol><li>There is more time for safety research with access to powerful models (since you pause later, when you have more powerful models). This is a huge boost for many areas of alignment research that I\u2019m excited about<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffyw9s642hsa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfyw9s642hsa\">[4]</a></sup></span>. (This point has been discussed elsewhere via the \u201coverhang\u201d objection to an unconditional pause.)</li><li>While I\u2019m very uncertain, on balance I think it provides more serial time to do alignment research. As model capabilities improve and we get more legible evidence of AI risk, the will to pause should increase, and so the expected length of a pause should also increase<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref29iilk6me3p\"><sup><a href=\"#fn29iilk6me3p\">[5]</a></sup></span>.</li><li>We get experience and practice with deploying and using more powerful models in the real world, which can be particularly helpful for handling&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/thinking-about-risks-ai-accidents-misuse-and-structure\"><u>misuse and structural risks</u></a>, simply because we can observe what happens in practice rather than speculating on it from our armchairs<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8qcacyfzdau\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8qcacyfzdau\">[6]</a></sup></span>.</li><li>We can get much wider support for a conditional pause. Most people can get on board with the principle \u201cif an AI system would be very dangerous, don\u2019t build it\u201d, and then the relevant details are about when a potential AI system should be considered plausibly very dangerous. At one end, a typical unconditional pause proposal would say \u201canything more powerful than GPT-4 should be considered plausibly very dangerous\u201d. As you make the condition less restrictive and more obviously tied to harm, it provokes less and less opposition.</li><li>It is easier to put in place, because it doesn\u2019t require anyone to give up something they are already doing.</li></ol><p>In contrast, the advantages of an unconditional pause seem relatively minor:</p><ol><li>Since it is simpler than the conditional pause, it is easier to explain.<ul><li>This is a big advantage. While the conditional pause isn\u2019t that much harder to explain, for public advocacy, I\u2019d guess&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4ZvJab25tDebB8FGE/you-get-about-five-words\"><u>you get about five words</u></a>, so even small differences lead to big advantages.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Since it is simpler than the conditional pause, it is easier to implement correctly.<ul><li>This doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal, governments routinely create and enforce regulations that are way more complicated than a typical conditional pause proposal.</li></ul></li><li>Since there are fewer moving parts to manipulate, It is harder to game.<ul><li>This might be a big deal in the longer run? But in the short term, I don\u2019t expect the current leading companies to game such a regulation, because I expect they care at least a bit about safety (e.g. the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment\"><u>Superalignment commitment</u></a> is really unlikely in worlds where OpenAI doesn\u2019t care at all, similarly for the signatures on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk\"><u>CAIS statement</u></a>).</li></ul></li><li>There\u2019s less risk that we fail to pause at the point when AI systems become x-risky.<ul><li>We can choose a conditional pause proposal that makes this risk tiny, e.g. \u201cpause once an agent passes 10 or more of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://evals.alignment.org/blog/2023-08-01-new-report/\"><u>ARC Evals tasks</u></a>\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh55wh0jo718\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh55wh0jo718\">[7]</a></sup></span>.</li></ul></li></ol><p>Upon reading&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JYEAL8g7ArqGoTaX6/ai-pause-will-likely-backfire?commentId=tjHJwJLm8t6W4mWG2\"><u>other content from this week</u></a>, it seems like maybe a crux for people is whether the pause is a stopgap or an end state. My position stays the same regardless; in either case I\u2019d aim for a conditional pause, for the same reasons.</p><h2>What advocacy is good?</h2><p>I think about three main types of advocacy to achieve these goals:</p><ol><li>Targeted advocacy within AGI labs and to the AI research community</li><li>Targeted advocacy to policymakers</li><li>Broad advocacy to the public<ul><li>Note that I\u2019m only considering advocacy with the aim of producing public pressure for a pause \u2013 I\u2019m not considering e.g. advocacy that\u2019s meant to produce new alignment researchers, or other such theories of change.</li></ul></li></ol><p>I think there is a fairly widespread consensus that (1) and (2) are good. I\u2019d also highlight that (1) and (2) are&nbsp;<i>working</i>. For (1) look at the list of people who signed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk\"><u>CAIS statement</u></a>. For (2), note the existence of the UK Frontier AI Taskforce and the people on it, as well as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/20230913-senator-wiener-introduces-safety-framework-artificial-intelligence-legislation\"><u>intent bill SB 294</u></a> in California about \u201cresponsible scaling\u201d (a term from ARC that I think refers to a set of policies that would include a conditional pause).</p><p>I think (3) is much less clear. I\u2019d first note that the default result of advocacy to the public is failure; it\u2019s really hard to reach a sizable fraction of the public (which is what\u2019s needed to produce meaningful public pressure). But let\u2019s consider the cases in which it succeeds. In these cases, I expect a mix of advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are:</p><ol><li><strong>Will:</strong> There would be more pressure to get things done, in a variety of places (government, AGI labs, AI research community). So, more things get done.</li></ol><p>(I\u2019ve only put down one advantage, but this is a huge advantage! Don\u2019t judge the proposal solely on the number of points I wrote down.)</p><p>The disadvantages are:</p><ol><li><strong>Lack of nuance:</strong> Popular AI x-risk would not be nuanced. For example, I expect that the ask from the public would be an unconditional pause, because a conditional one would be too nuanced.<ul><li>Note that it is possible to have a good cop / bad cop routine: build public pressure with a \u201cbad cop\u201d that pushes goals that lack nuance, and have a \u201cgood cop\u201d use that pressure to achieve a better, more nuanced goal<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefu35u60xa75\"><sup><a href=\"#fnu35u60xa75\">[8]</a></sup></span>.</li><li>This is also discussed as \u201cinside game\u201d / \u201coutside game\u201d in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/vw6tX5SyvTwMeSxJk/p/Y4SaFM5LfsZzbnymu\"><u>Holly\u2019s post</u></a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Goodhart\u2019s Law (labs):</strong> Companies face large pressure to do safety work that would look good to the public, which is different from doing work that is actually good<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgu747zjpsla\"><sup><a href=\"#fngu747zjpsla\">[9]</a></sup></span>. At the extreme, existing safety teams could be replaced by compliance and PR departments, which do the minimum required to comply with regulations and keep the public sufficiently happy (see also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/why-not-slow-ai-progress\"><u>Why Not Slow AI Progress?</u></a>).<ul><li>This is already happening a little: public communication from labs is decided in part based on the expected response from AI x-risk worriers. It will get much worse when it expands to the full public, since the public is a much more important stakeholder,&nbsp;<i>and</i> has much less nuance.</li><li>This seems especially bad for AI alignment research, where the best work is technical, detail-oriented, and relatively hard to explain.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Goodhart\u2019s Law (govts):</strong> Similarly, policymakers would be under a lot of pressure to create policy that looks good to the public, rather than policies that are actually good.<ul><li>I\u2019m very uncertain about how bad this effect is, but currently I think it could be pretty bad.

As a result, I think disadvantage 2 (AGI labs Goodharting on public perception) is a really big deal and is sufficient by itself to put me overall&nbsp;<strong>against</strong> public advocacy with the aim of producing pressure for a pause.

In particular, I was not expecting nearly this much anti-moratorium sentiment; I would have also focused on arguing for a conditional pause rather than no pause. I also didn\u2019t expect alignment optimism to be such a common theme. Rather than rewrite the post (which takes a lot of time), I decided to instead add some commentary on each of the other posts.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/vw6tX5SyvTwMeSxJk/p/3hSEQnEN2D3SSzHWn\"><u>What\u2019s in a Pause?</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/vw6tX5SyvTwMeSxJk/p/fwdjMtJLpkyJ2Gice\"><u>How could a moratorium fail?</u></a>: I&nbsp;<i>think</i> the idea here is that we should eventually aim for an international regulatory regime that is not a pause, but a significant chunk of x-risk from misaligned AI is in the near future, so we should enact an unconditional pause right now. If so, my main disagreement is that I think the pause we enact right now should be conditional: specifically, I think it\u2019s important that you evaluate the safety of a model after you train it, not before<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwucyjfl46gr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwucyjfl46gr\">[18]</a></sup></span>. I may also disagree (perhaps controversially) that a significant chunk of x-risk from misaligned AI is in the near future, depending on what \u201cnear future\u201d means.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/vw6tX5SyvTwMeSxJk/p/JYEAL8g7ArqGoTaX6#Fast_takeoff_has_a_really_bad_feedback_loop\"><u>AI Pause Will Likely Backfire</u></a>: I weakly agree with the part of this post that argues that an unconditional pause would be bad, due to (1) overhangs / fast takeoff and (2) advantaging less cautious actors (given that a realistic pause would not be perfect). I think these don\u2019t bite nearly as hard for conditional pauses, since they occur in the future when progress will be slower<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref85nwwl47uzm\"><sup><a href=\"#fn85nwwl47uzm\">[19]</a></sup></span>, they are meant to be temporary to give us time to improve our mitigations, and they are easier to build a broad base of support for (and so are easier to enforce across all relevant actors).</p><p>I have several disagreements with the rest, which argues for optimism about alignment, but I also don\u2019t understand why this matters. My opinions on pausing wouldn\u2019t change if I became significantly more optimistic or pessimistic about alignment, because the decision-relevant quantity is whether pausing lets you do better than you otherwise would have done<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo1kjfkmcmc\"><sup><a href=\"#fno1kjfkmcmc\">[20]</a></sup></span>.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/vw6tX5SyvTwMeSxJk/p/DG6bf5YW3jxLRD7KN\"><u>Policy ideas for mitigating AI risk</u></a>: I mostly agree with the outline of the strategic landscape, establishing the need to prevent catastrophe-capable AI systems from being built. Thomas then provides some concrete policy proposals, involving&nbsp;<i>visibility</i> into AI development and&nbsp;<i>brakes</i> to slow it down. These seem fine, but personally I think we should be more ambitious and aim to have a conditional pause<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsntpjjgle8q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsntpjjgle8q\">[21]</a></sup></span>.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/vw6tX5SyvTwMeSxJk/p/fZmQ6WQ6MQPa5q39R\"><u>How to think about slowing AI</u></a>: I agree with this post; I think it says very similar things as I do in the \u201cWhich goals are good?\u201d section.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/vw6tX5SyvTwMeSxJk/p/fSeDA7B7Hve5LeaWq\"><u>Comments on Manheim's \"What's in a Pause?\"</u></a>: There isn\u2019t a central point in this post, so I will mostly not respond to it. The one thing I\u2019ll note is that a lot of the post is dependent on the premise that if smarter-than-human AI is developed in the near future, then we almost surely die, regardless of who builds it. I strongly disagree with this premise, and so disagree with many of the implications drawn (e.g. that it approximately doesn\u2019t matter if you differentially advantage the least responsible actors).</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/vw6tX5SyvTwMeSxJk/p/k6K3iktCLCTHRMJsY\"><u>The possibility of an indefinite AI pause</u></a>: I had two main comments on this post:</p><ol><li>I agree that you eventually need a \u201cglobal police state\u201d to keep an AI pause going indefinitely&nbsp;<i>if you allow AI research and hardware improvements to continue</i>. But you could instead ban those things as well, which seems a lot easier to do than to build a global police state.</li><li>I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to worry that an indefinite AI pause would be an x-risk by stalling technological progress, given that there are many other non-AI technologies that can enable continued progress (human augmentation and whole brain emulation come to mind).</li></ol><p>I did agree with Matthew\u2019s point that the existing evidence for an AI catastrophe isn\u2019t sufficient to justify creating a global police state.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/vw6tX5SyvTwMeSxJk/p/Y4SaFM5LfsZzbnymu\"><u>The Case for AI Safety Advocacy to the Public</u></a>: I agree with this post that advocacy can work for AI x-risk, and that the resulting public pressure could lead to more things being done<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6z6rrihd8ax\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6z6rrihd8ax\">[22]</a></sup></span>. I agree that conditional on advocacy to the public, you likely want the message to be some flavor of pause, since other messages would require too much nuance. I\u2019m on board with shifting the burden of proof onto companies to show that their product is safe (but I\u2019m not convinced that this implies a pause).</p><p>I agree that the inside-outside game dynamic (or good cop / bad cop as I call it) has worked in previous cases of advocacy to the public. However, I expect it only works in cases where the desirable policy is relatively clear (and not nuanced), unlike AI alignment, so I\u2019m overall against.</p><p>A couple of points where I had strong disagreements:</p><ol><li><i>\u201c\u201cPause AI\u201d is a simple and clear ask that is hard to misinterpret in a harmful way\u201d</i> \u2013 this is drastically underestimating either people\u2019s ability to misinterpret messages, or how much harm misinterpretations can cause.</li><li><i>\u201cI predict that advocacy activities could be a big morale boost\u201d</i> \u2013 I experience existing advocacy efforts as very demoralizing: people make wildly overconfident contrarian claims that I think are incorrect, they get lots of attention because of how contrarian the takes are, and they use this attention to talk about how the work I do isn\u2019t helping.</li></ol><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zd5inbT4kYKivincm/ai-is-centralizing-by-default-let-s-not-make-it-worse\"><u>AI is centralizing by default; let's not make it worse</u></a>: Half of this post is about how AI is easier to control than humans. I agree with the positive arguments outlining advantages we have in controlling AIs. But when addressing counterarguments, Quintin fails to bring up the one that seems most obvious and important to me, that AIs will become much more capable and intelligent than humans, which could make controlling them difficult. Personally, I think it\u2019s still unclear whether AI will be easier or harder to control than humans.</p><p>The other half of the post is about centralization effects of AI, warning against extreme levels of centralization. I didn\u2019t get a good picture about what extreme levels of centralization look like and why they are x-risky (are we talking totalitarianism?). I\u2019m not sure whether the post is recommending against pauses because of centralizing effects, but if it is I probably disagree because I expect the other effects of a pause would be significantly more important.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/vw6tX5SyvTwMeSxJk/p/q8jxedwSKBdWA3nH7\"><u>We are not alone: many communities want to stop Big Tech from scaling unsafe AI</u></a>: I agree with the title, but I think the mitigations that other communities would want would be quite different from the ones that would make sense for alignment.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnotocnaqg78\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefotocnaqg78\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>One might say that iterative deployment is no better than full steam ahead because mitigations will fail to generalize to higher capability levels, either because x-risks are qualitatively different or because mitigations tend to break once you exceed human-level.

This doesn\u2019t defend against situations where a small group of individuals can build AGI in their basement \u2013 but I assign very low probability to that scenario. It\u2019s only once you can build AGI with small amounts of compute and publicly available techniques that you need extreme surveillance to significantly reduce the chance that AGI is built.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnfyw9s642hsa\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreffyw9s642hsa\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I initially had an exception here for mechanistic interpretability: most current work isn\u2019t done on the largest models, since the core problems to be solved (e.g. feature discovery, superposition, circuit identification) can be easily exhibited with small models.

In particular, there is a decent chance that there are significant architecture changes on the way to powerful models; it is much better for mechanistic interpretability to know that earlier rather than later.

However, these are evidential effects, and for decision-making we should ignore these. The more relevant point is: if you take a world where we \u201ccould have\u201d implemented an unconditional pause at GPT-4, hold fixed the level of motivation to reduce AI risk, and instead implement a conditional pause that kicks in later, probably the conditional pause will last longer because the potential harms for GPT-5 will galvanize even more support than existed at the time of GPT-4.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn8qcacyfzdau\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref8qcacyfzdau\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>There are also safety techniques like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly_detection\"><u>anomaly detection</u></a> on model usage that benefit from real-world usage data.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnh55wh0jo718\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefh55wh0jo718\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This isn\u2019t a great conditional pause proposal; we can and should choose better evaluations.

We\u2019ve heard from many of you that one of the best things about having found Giving What We Can is learning that there are other people with similar values.

Our mission isn't just to marginally increase the amount of money going to effective charities; we\u2019re aiming for meaningful cultural change \u2014 with a goal to make giving&nbsp;<i>effectively and significantly</i> a global norm, in service of a better world. The community we\u2019ve built (and are continuing to build) is instrumental to reaching that goal.</p><p>The way that GWWC has engaged with the community has changed a lot over the years. It all started as small local groups bound by a common thread of pledging 10% back in 2009 through \u201cGiving What We Can Chapters\u201d.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img

requests to restart local groups, given that some of its strongest growth historically came from our former Chapters. Many of our smaller initiatives (e.g. one-off events, working with EA groups, and running the ambassador program) have shown a desire for this too.</p><p>We\u2019ve also been excited to see successful communities around effective giving start to grow and adapt to local cultural contexts i.e. in London and in the Netherlands with their successful <a href=\"https://tienprocent.club\">Tien Procent Club</a>.</p><p>With all of this in mind\u2026</p><p><strong>We are excited to announce that we are revitalising our global giving community at the local level by relaunching GWWC Groups!</strong></p><h2>What will GWWC Groups look like?</h2><p>GWWC groups are local or virtual groups of community members who connect over a desire to do good effectively through giving. As part of a group you might: discuss how to give effectively, fundraise for effective charities and spend time with people who have similar values. We\u2019re also excited to see groups sharing resources, opportunities and advice with one another, as well as their broader community.</p><p>All GWWC Groups will have a volunteer Group Leader (or leaders), who will welcome new members, connect the community and organise ~quarterly events that are aimed at engaging new and existing community members in effective giving. The quarterly events might be a mix of fundraising, speaker, and social events, and we provide guidance and support in planning and running them.</p><p>GWWC Group events are relaxed, friendly events that bring people who care about doing good through their donations to come together.</p><p>They are aimed at growing the community of effective givers by helping people to connect around their shared values and aspirations to make the world much better through consistent, significant, and effective giving. Ideally, these events would attract people across a wide age range, and across a variety of backgrounds. We aim to create an environment where community members feel excited to invite their friends and family who may share similar interests along to these events and encourage them to get involved.</p><h2>Locations for GWWC Groups</h2><p>We want to ensure that we\u2019re providing enough support to the local groups we start as we trial this program. Therefore, we are committing to support 5-10 local groups around the world in the next 12 months.</p><p>The following places have been locked in:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/london\"><u>London</u></a> (with Gemma Paterson, Denise Melchin and Chris Rouse)</li><li><a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/berlin\"><u>Berlin</u></a> (with Julia Mueller)</li><li><a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/melbourne\"><u>Melbourne</u></a> &nbsp;( with Grace Adams)</li><li><a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/sydney\"><u>Sydney</u></a> (with Luke Freeman)</li><li><a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/new-york\"><u>New York</u></a> (with John Yan)</li><li><a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/vancouver\"><u>Vancouver</u></a> (with Spencer Ericson)</li></ul><p>There are also several other locations we\u2019d really like to see groups launch, and for which we hope to find volunteer Group Leaders. In particular, we\u2019d be very excited to see applications to lead groups in the following places:</p><ul><li>Toronto</li><li>Bay Area / San Fransisco</li><li>Los Angeles</li><li>Boston</li><li>Singapore</li></ul><p>We think the most important part of a successful group are enthusiastic Group Leaders, so if you\u2019re excited about the idea of a group in your city even if it\u2019s not on the list above, please consider applying to run a group! <a href=\"https://dashboard.effectivealtruism.org/public/question/2f55e237-034c-47bd-8b0c-5f5ba373f906\"><u>See current numbers of pledges by city/metropolitan area</u></a></p><p>We would ideally have 2-3 co-leaders for each GWWC Group so if there\u2019s already a group in your area, please still apply!</p><h2>What if we already have a local group focused on creating community around effective giving?</h2><p>We\u2019d love to support you!</p><p>If you\u2019re already organising local events, why not apply to become a GWWC Group Leader so you can access the support and resources we provide?</p><p>If you\u2019re interested in promoting effective giving in a different format, we think that\u2019s great too! We\u2019d encourage you to submit your group to our new&nbsp;<a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/effective-giving-community-directory\"><u>Effective Giving Community Groups Directory</u></a>, so we can let people know about your group and the events you host!</p><h2>Help run a GWWC Group</h2><p>We are actively looking to recruit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/groupleader\"><u>GWWC Group Leaders</u></a>!</p><p>If you\u2019re passionate about effective giving \u2014 and growing the community through organising events and meeting with community members \u2014 we\u2019d love you to apply.</p><p>Responsibilities:</p><ul><li>Organise 4 (quarterly) community events in a 12-month period (with the option, but not expectation, to host more if you\u2019d like)</li><li>Welcome new members to the community via email or call if they reach out</li><li>Be active on the relevant group channel in our new community slack workspace</li><li>Work with other local members and relevant groups (EA groups) to coordinate fundraising activities or other events in your city</li><li>Congratulate members and donors on milestones (e.g. pledge anniversaries)</li><li>Work with your co-leaders to divide up tasks and manage the group</li></ul><p>What we provide:</p><ul><li>Guides on running community events, including what to organise, how to find speakers, etc</li><li>Regular check-in calls with staff who can help you troubleshoot problems and provide guidance</li><li>Support when leaders have questions about how to run events ormake things happen</li><li>Training on supporting new members, such as how to make them feel welcome, talking points about GWWC</li><li>Opportunities to present at workplaces, or for other aligned groups etc</li><li>Coordination of regular calls with other leaders in the region</li><li>Public acknowledgement on our website that you\u2019re a Group Leader</li><li>Sharing internal stakeholder updates</li></ul><p>[<a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/groupleader\"><u>APPLY NOW</u></a>]&nbsp;</p><p>Applications for GWWC Group Leaders will be assessed on a rolling basis.</p><p>Please note that we currently have limited capacity and we want to be able to support all our Groups and Group Leaders well as we test and scale this program, so we may not be able to accept all the submitted applications. We are planning to run this program in a maximum of 10 regions for the next year.</p><h2>Can I run events about effective giving if I\u2019m not part of a group?</h2><p>Yes! We make our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g1QEYnS8kKWP0igBm7J5ct7wb_eUuJDKEmvIiXJHWPk/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>organising resources available for you</u></a> to run your own giving game, introductory talk about effective giving, and more!&nbsp;</p><p>We are excited about our community taking initiative to run their own events, utilising the resources we make available. In some cases, i.e. for giving games, we are even able to sponsor donations to help your event run smoothly.</p><p>Always feel free to get in touch with us at community@givingwhatwecan.org if you have any questions about running an event.</p><p>Please note that while you are welcome (and encouraged!) to self-organise events using the resources we make available on our website, we cannot allow people to launch official GWWC Groups without our support or permission (See more info in the FAQs, below.)</p><p>We\u2019d also like to emphasise the importance of being mindful of creating events that are safe and inclusive to all, and strongly encourage you to read our guide before planning an event.</p><h2>One for the World is helping to support our groups</h2><p>When we were running the idea for GWWC local groups by stakeholders, our friends at <a href=\"https://1fortheworld.org/\">One for the World</a> generously offered to use some of their staff time to provide support to our new Group Leaders over the next 12 months.

The Index offers an assessment of current practices and provides clear, actionable processes for improving shrimp welfare depending on the issues present in each pond. V1 of the Index is nearly complete, but we expect to iterate and test it over the next year, with the Index likely becoming a core part of SWPs work in the medium to long term.</li></ul><p>As we\u2019re now focusing on the above projects, we want to&nbsp;<strong>highlight some potentially impactful ways we believe others could help shrimps</strong>, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Wild-Caught</strong>: The number of shrimps&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/shrimp-the-animals-most-commonly-used-and-killed-for-food\"><u>used and killed for food production</u></a> is dominated by wild-caught shrimps, in particular the species&nbsp;<i>A. japonicus</i>, which are crushed and used to produce&nbsp;<i>shrimp paste</i>. Other warm and cold-water fisheries also contribute significantly to this number. As we are focusing on aquaculture, we think there is a huge opportunity for impact in the wild-caught space.</li><li><strong>Specialisation work</strong>: Projects that would likely involve high degrees of specialisation we think could have a huge impact, such as working to accelerate alternative shrimps, aligning emerging shrimp farming tech with higher welfare production, developing new welfare oriented aqua technology, and work on replacing animal feeds with plant-based alternatives</li><li><strong>\u201dShrimp-Inclusive\u201d work</strong>: Finally there are a number of projects that we think are relatively intractable as a shrimp-focused org, but could have huge impact if shrimps are considered a core part of an organisation with a broader focus\u2019 Theory of Change (for example for organisations that work with aquatic animals).

These agreements involve purchasing the first stunner for a producer who commits to stun a minimum of 100M shrimps per year. So far, we have signed four commitments which will collectively reduce the suffering of&nbsp;<strong>1B shrimps (in expectation) each year</strong> (you can learn more about how we arrived at this number through our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/22982\"><u>Guesstimate model</u></a>).</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Qo3559TqP5BzoQyWX/j5mqwtvrfotx50dki35b\"></p><p><strong>Retailer engagement</strong> - We have ongoing dialogues with retailers (currently primarily in the UK), such as Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose, among others. Our goals for these interactions are to encourage retailers to publish welfare / responsible sourcing policies (SWP are currently mentioned in the policies for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://corporate.marksandspencer.com/sites/marksandspencer/files/marks-spencer/Aquaculture/MS-Decapod-Welfare-Policy%20v2FINAL.pdf\"><u>M&amp;S</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.johnlewispartnership.co.uk/content/dam/cws/pdfs/Juniper/ethics-and-sustainability/Crustacean-Welfare-policy.pdf\"><u>Waitrose</u></a>). These conversations have also often led to us being put in touch with their suppliers, which has led to stunner commitments.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>ASC Shrimp Welfare Technical Working Group (TWG)&nbsp;</strong>- Along with a number of other stakeholders, SWP is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://asc-aqua.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Shrimp-Health-Welfare-Slides-EN.pdf\"><u>a member</u></a> of the TWG to introduce welfare standards into ASC\u2019s certification. ASC&nbsp;<a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/shared/7Q5JNF6KS?:display_count=y&amp;:origin=viz_share_link&amp;:embed=y\"><u>currently certifies</u></a> approximately 29B shrimps annually.</p><h2><strong>Farmer Support</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100085827435709\"><strong><u>Sustainable Shrimp Farmers of India (SSFI)</u></strong></a> - We launched SSFI, which provides welfare-focused technical expertise to shrimp farmers in India. SSFI has shown promise as a scalable and effective approach to reach farmers in order to improve shrimp welfare. Our goal is to test interventions that can be cost-effectively scaled, such as providing free technical advice to farmers via WhatsApp, convincing groups of farmers to lower stocking densities, and implementing additional pond preparation (like sludge removal).</p><p><strong>Pilot Study</strong> - We conducted a pilot study in India, to test and demonstrate the profitability of a lower stocking density model of shrimp farming. The results of our pilot were promising, and we are currently validating this model more rigorously through a partnership with Tamil Nadu Dr.J.Jayalalithaa Fisheries University (TNJFU).</p><p><strong>Scoping Reports (</strong><a href=\"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/india-scoping-report\"><strong><u>India</u></strong></a><strong> and&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/vietnam-scoping-report\"><strong><u>Vietnam</u></strong></a><strong>)</strong> - Our desk-based research indicated that both India and Vietnam would be promising places to work with farmers. In order to validate our evidence review we conducted an on-the-ground needs assessment in both countries, which were then written up into scoping reports in order to clarify our thinking, as well as share knowledge with the wider aquatic animal advocacy community.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Qo3559TqP5BzoQyWX/ppastun7vhwxga2fvyod\"></p><h2><strong>Research</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report\"><strong><u>Shrimp Welfare Report</u></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>- A literature review on factors affecting shrimp welfare, including eyestalk ablation, disease, stunning and slaughter, stocking density, environmental enrichment, transport and handling, food quality, and various water quality factors. Faunalytics published a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/taking-care-of-shrimp-welfare-in-aquaculture/\"><u>summary of the report</u></a> in February 2023. Additionally, we wrote an article based on the report for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fondation-droit-animal.org/118-le-bien-etre-des-crevettes-en-aquaculture-quels-sont-les-facteurs-cles/\"><u>La Fondation Droit Animal</u></a> (<i>The Animal Law, Ethics and Sciences Foundation</i>) in September 2023. The report also highlighted to us the gaps in the literature, leading to us collaborating with the University of Stirling to conduct a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/university-of-stirling-research-on-electrical-stunning-for-shrimp/\"><u>study on electrical stunning</u></a>, with the initial results estimated for early 2024.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/194DOvIQr4GyONl-rW7Jgbt3Vjx1KbZbNimIMtYv5ZCU/edit\"><strong><u>Supply &amp; Demand Impacts</u></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>- Once we determined that lowering stocking densities may become a core part of our farmer support work, we did an economic analysis in order to estimating the effects of a reduction in stocking density on the total number of shrimps produced and the total number of shrimp days in ponds (<i>tl;dr: we estimate a total discount factor of 0.23-0.54</i>).</p><p><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/design/DAFvD7tcRzo/NEalaX-Dn1pggsK6FW8Uzw/view?utm_content=DAFvD7tcRzo&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=publishsharelink\"><strong><u>Consumer Attitudes Towards Shrimp Welfare</u></strong></a> - Early on, we carried out some exploratory work on consumer awareness using the research platform&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.prolific.co/\"><u>Prolific</u></a>.

So within the workstreams listed above, the following we expect to become the core of what we do at Shrimp Welfare Project going forward (at least in the short to medium term).</p><h2><strong>Humane Slaughter Initiative</strong></h2><p><strong>What\u2019s the project?&nbsp;</strong>- Significantly accelerating the adoption of electrical stunning in the farmed shrimp industry. We purchase the first stunner for a few different medium-large producers in different countries/contexts and in different farming systems. This is to remove perceived barriers to uptake, and shift the industry towards electrical stunning as a norm. This work involves engaging with retailers (often in Europe, primarily the UK) and their suppliers in Asia and Latin America. We offer to buy a producer a single stunner if they commit to stunning a minimum of 100,000,000 shrimps per year (each stunner costs approximately $65,000).</p><p><strong>Why are we excited about it?&nbsp;</strong>- Almost all of our (direct) impact to date has come from this initiative and currently have commitments to stun&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimpact\"><strong><u>1B shrimps</u></strong></a><strong> (in expectation) each year</strong>. We think the purchasing of equipment for industry is fairly novel and highly cost-effective. We also think that by directly targeting the barriers to uptake, the potential flow-through effects of the work could be significant.</p><p>A great write-up of this work was published on the Forum in July 2023 by MHR -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CmAexqqvnRLcBojpB/electric-shrimp-stunning-a-potential-high-impact-donation\"><i><u>Electric Shrimp Stunning: a Potential High-Impact Donation Opportunity</u></i></a>. Originally in this post, we had included a few paragraphs on Crucial Considerations we wanted to highlight for this initiative. But we\u2019ve decided to post it as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CmAexqqvnRLcBojpB/electric-shrimp-stunning-a-potential-high-impact-donation?commentId=b6wuf8E8NRkiKd6MJ\">a comment</a> on MHR\u2019s post instead (both to shorten and improve the overall flow of this post, but also because we thought it made sense to continue the discussion already in the comments on that post).</p><p><i>We\u2019re currently&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/design/DAFmipds-i4/CfV3em4SXjCGnN2F2DJ1gg/view?utm_content=DAFmipds-i4&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=publishsharelink\"><i><u>actively fundraising for shrimp stunners</u></i></a><i>. We estimate the cost-effectiveness of each stunner to be&nbsp;<strong>~1,500+ shrimps humanely stunned per $</strong> (in expectation per year). Additionally, it\u2019s worth noting that this figure does not incorporate potential flow-through effects, which could increase the cost-effectiveness.

It\u2019s still in more of an exploratory phase than our Corporate Engagement work as we\u2019re testing a number of promising interventions to scale up. For example, when farmers join SSFI they\u2019re added to a WhatsApp group, where farmers can receive free welfare-focused technical assistance. We\u2019re also exploring interventions that affect shrimps for their entire lives in the growout pond such as supporting a move to lower stocking densities, or promoting additional pond preparation (such as removing sludge at the bottom of the ponds).</p><p><strong>Why are we excited about it?</strong> - SSFI has shown promise as a scalable and cost-effective approach to improving shrimp welfare. We\u2019re also excited that SSFI aims to address chronic suffering (in contrast to our stunner's work, which addresses acute suffering) allowing us to have a portfolio approach in terms of reducing suffering. Additionally, having an on-the-ground presence with farmers gives us practical knowledge of shrimp farming that is otherwise hard to get from desk-based research. It also gives us some credibility within the industry that we have this practical know-how, which indirectly supports our Corporate Engagement work (and vice-versa - farmers are aware we\u2019re an international organisation who regularly speak to buyers, which gives us credibility with farmers).</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Qo3559TqP5BzoQyWX/the3as1shxa0vukaviqv\"></p><h2><strong>Shrimp Welfare Index</strong></h2><p><strong>What\u2019s the Project?</strong> - The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/shrimp-welfare-report\"><u>Shrimp Welfare Report</u></a> was our first attempt to pull together a comprehensive understanding of shrimp welfare. After we published the report, we wanted to make it actionable, to try to quantify how much each factor affected shrimp welfare, and provide actionable feedback on how to improve a score. Our current research focus therefore, is on the development of a Shrimp Welfare Index. The Index assesses the most important factors for shrimp welfare, weighted by their relative importance, and provides an overall score. The index will serve as a roadmap to improve shrimp welfare, offering an assessment of current practices and providing clear, actionable processes for improving shrimp welfare depending on the issues present in each pond. Although we hope to begin testing the first version of the Index towards the end of 2023, we expect it to be an iterative process, with the Index becoming a core part of our work only in the medium to long-term.</p><p><strong>Why are we excited about it?</strong> - After a year or so of working with stakeholders, we realised that our original vision of having a single, comprehensive set of Asks just didn\u2019t make sense, considering the variety of contexts in which shrimps are farmed (which varies depending on country and intensity of the pond system). Asking for lower densities seemed intractable for more intensive systems, and asking for consistently high water quality didn\u2019t make sense for low-input \u201cExtensive\u201d systems. We needed a way to understand the welfare implications of any particular pond, and point to what is higher or lower welfare across many different contexts. The Welfare Index gives us that flexibility, allowing us to work with a variety of systems, being very clear about how we arrived at any particular score, as well as how welfare can be improved (and by how much). We also hope that we can publish the Welfare Index in academic journals, so that it can form part of the scientific literature, which will hopefully inform future decisions by Certifications/Policymakers.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Qo3559TqP5BzoQyWX/ktcz0nl8zj7n30oohbiq\"></p><h1><strong>What We Aren't Doing</strong></h1><p>(or:&nbsp;<i><strong>The White Space of Shrimp Welfare</strong></i>)</p><p>While shrimp welfare may be a niche within the overall enormous global shrimp industry, it's still an incredibly nuanced and complex niche. The term \"shrimp\" covers multiple species and an incredibly wide range of farming and fishing techniques, making it nearly impossible for any one organisation to cover the many welfare challenges that shrimp face. Additionally, as we move into our \u201cExploit phase\u201d, we want to mostly focus on our programs above in order to not misallocate our resources. If we indefinitely continue exploring, we might grow to unmanagebable organisational complexity, and/or invest resources in work that doesn\u2019t lead to impact. We therefore wanted to use this post to also make clear what we aren\u2019t doing, in the hope that others may seriously consider exploring these areas (we\u2019d be more than happy to support other organisations working on shrimp welfare!)</p><h2><strong>Wild-Caught</strong></h2><p>Rethink Priorities report&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/shrimp-the-animals-most-commonly-used-and-killed-for-food\"><i><u>Shrimp: The animals most commonly used and killed for food production</u></i></a> states: \u201c<i>25 trillion (90% SCI: 6.5 trillion - 66 trillion) wild shrimp are directly slaughtered annually, a figure that represents the vast majority of all animals directly killed by humans out of which food is produced.\u201d.&nbsp;</i>We (SWP) think that a project set up to work on wild-caught shrimps could be extremely high-impact.</p><p><i>Although right now SWP doesn\u2019t do any work with Wild-Caught fisheries, it\u2019s possible that our Humane Slaughter work evolves in the future and we explore the possibility of deploying stunners on boats. However, we expect this to be the extent to which we\u2019d focus on Wild-Caught, likely not doing any work to address shrimp trawling or shrimp paste, so would welcome projects with this focus.</i></p><p><strong>Shrimp Paste Fisheries</strong> - The majority of wild-caught shrimps are a single species -&nbsp;<i>A. japonicus</i> - and are crushed and used to produce&nbsp;<i>\u201cshrimp paste\u201d</i>, a salty, fermented condiment used in Southeast Asian and Southern Chinese cuisine. We believe the shrimp paste market is very different to the contexts in which we work (i.e. the international import/export market for&nbsp;<i>L. Vannamei</i> /&nbsp;<i>P. Monodon</i> shrimps). It\u2019s often made by fishing families in coastal villages, and production techniques can vary from village to village. We think a new project focused on shrimp paste in particular could potentially be very high impact.</p><p><i>We do have a volunteer who has recently started researching shrimp paste for us, which we plan to write-up and publish when finished. We\u2019re working on this because we believe it could have significant informational value to the movement at relatively low cost to SWP, rather than because we anticipate SWP directly working on shrimp paste in the future</i></p><p><strong>Warm-water/Cold-water Fisheries&nbsp;</strong>- Outside of shrimp paste, other shrimp fisheries can be divided into warm and cold water fisheries. We\u2019re not sure to what extent practices differ between these two types of fisheries, so have bundled them together here (we expect them to be more similar to each other than to shrimp paste fisheries). We expect the major welfare issues here to be similar to those present at harvest in aquaculture (crushing and overcrowding whilst in the net, and asphyxiation once taken out of the water). There are also likely issues with bycatch (particularly with trawlers). Additionally, we think some shrimp fisheries also operate as fisheries for other species during certain months of the year. So a project working in this space may need to have a more \u201czoomed out\u201d focus on fisheries more broadly (similar to the other ideas in \u201cShrimp-Inclusive work\u201d below) in order to more fully understand and work with the industry.</p><h2><strong>Specialisation work</strong></h2><p>The following are ideas that would likely require quite a lot of in-house specialisation (technical or otherwise), in addition to potentially benefiting from a For-Profit, or Social-Entrepreneurship type of organisation, rather than necessarily a Non-Profit setup.</p><p><strong>Alternative Shrimps&nbsp;</strong>- As noted above, we\u2019ve written a report on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.canva.com/design/DAFpKvUGbeU/VuLEUBAZ294N-xq_6v0OxQ/view?utm_content=DAFpKvUGbeU&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=publishsharelink\"><u>Alternative Shrimps</u></a>, in which we tried to understand the current Market, the Feasibility of producing alt shrimps, as well as the Barriers currently preventing alternative shrimps. For each barrier, we tried to determine some potential solutions (both in general, and any specialised roles we could see for NGOs). The report was written as we needed more clarity on potential interventions that could potentially radically pivot SWPs work. However, we are now focusing on the projects above, and not on Alt Shrimps. We still believe however that there is a lot of potential in this space, and think that more focused attention and effort on Alt Shrimps (or similar products, like shrimp paste) could be really valuable.</p><p><strong>Market Shaping (Shrimp Farming Technology)</strong> - Shrimp farming is currently going through further intensification, largely due to technological innovations such as Machine Learning and Computer Vision. This means it\u2019s quite likely that shrimp farming in 10-20 years looks quite different to how it does today. Many new \u201cAqua tech\u201d companies discuss the benefits of their technology for sustainability, but also sometimes link it to welfare. We think that during this period of potential transition, trying to shape the market into making \u201chigh welfare an intrinsic part of high tech\u201d, could lead to an industry with much higher welfare for the average shrimp. This idea is somewhat underdeveloped compared to our others, but we think it has potential.</p><p><strong>\u201cBad Cop\u201d campaigns</strong> - We don\u2019t engage in typical aggressive \u201cbad-cop\u201d campaigns and do not expect to do so at any point in the future. Our chosen direction is one of collaboration and dialogue. Engaging in meaningful dialogue with industry stakeholders underscores our commitment, setting the stage for mutual progress in shrimp welfare.</p><p><strong>Developing Welfare Tech</strong> - If we didn\u2019t have the ability to purchase stunners to provide to the industry, our most cost-effective program wouldn\u2019t exist. We think it\u2019s possible that engineers focused on welfare could produce similar technological innovations that could have a large impact on shrimps (this could even be an innovation like producing a cheaper stunner).</p><p><strong>Animal Feeds (i.e. Fishmeal/Fish Oil)&nbsp;</strong>- As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ali.fish/blue-loss\"><u>highlighted</u></a> by the Aquatic Life Institute (among others), a huge number of animals are fed to other animals to support the aquaculture industry (for example, the use of Fishmeal/Fish Oil). We\u2019re currently trying to estimate the impact of this in the shrimp industry in particular, and expect to publish a report at some point in the future, but expect the numbers to be significant. Additionally FMFO is expensive, and as such the industry already has incentive to replace it. We believe that an organisation that focused on increasing plant-based feed alternatives could potentially alleviate some downstream suffering. (This is one of the ideas we\u2019re least confident in, as we\u2019re unsure if reducing FMFO in shrimp feed would actually reduce the number of fish caught, in addition to further uncertainty about wild animal welfare).</p><h2><strong>\u201dShrimp-Inclusive\u201d work</strong></h2><p>The following are ideas that fall under a somewhat nebulous grouping. They are ideas that we think would benefit from a more shrimp-specific focus, but we don\u2019t believe that an exclusively shrimp-focused charity can make much of an impact. Rather, it\u2019s likely that an organisation would need to focus on Aquatic Animals more broadly, but be sure to include shrimps as a core part of their strategy. They are ideas we gave quite a bit of thought to, and consulted with a number of experts, before ultimately deciding we couldn\u2019t make much progress with on our own (outside of a light touch, i.e. Policy as part of EuroGroup for Animals).</p><p><strong>Consumer Awareness</strong> - We don\u2019t currently make any major effort on consumer awareness of shrimp welfare (apart from our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.canva.com/design/DAFvD7tcRzo/NEalaX-Dn1pggsK6FW8Uzw/view?utm_content=DAFvD7tcRzo&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=publishsharelink\"><u>exploratory study</u></a>), and are unsure if such a targeted one-species approach would make sense (particularly for a species that\u2019s outside of most people\u2019s moral circle), though some organisations have done work in this area (in particular,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arcj.org/en/issues-en/animal-welfare-en/shrimpsmatter-campaign-final-report/\"><u>raising awareness of eyestalk ablation</u></a>). Additionally&nbsp;<a href=\"https://shrimpinsights.com/blog/wake-call-shrimp-industry\"><u>we have seen</u></a> that increased consumer awareness has led to the shrimp industry making shrimp welfare a higher priority. We think more work in this area could lead to accelerating progress on welfare improvements.</p><p><strong>Policy&nbsp;</strong>- We\u2019re a member of EuroGroup for Animals, and contribute to their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/what-we-do/policy-areas/aquatic-animals\"><u>Aquatics</u></a> work where possible. However, it seems like any Policy changes that are made, would likely need to \u201cfollow the trend\u201d for fishes more broadly, rather than any specific legislation singling out shrimps. Additionally, policy work is often very region specific and requires a lot of localised knowledge and expertise. We therefore think that having a global-and-shrimp-specific policy charity probably doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense, but integrating shrimps into the Theory of Change for animal-focused policy organisations could be quite impactful.</p><p><strong>China&nbsp;</strong>- We gave a lot of thought to China, but unfortunately for a few reasons China fits outside of the Theory\u2019s of Change for our primary projects. For example they\u2019re the largest producer of shrimps in the world, but unusually, they don\u2019t export most of their volume, rather consuming it domestically, meaning leveraging the global import/export market to increase adoption of stunners isn\u2019t possible. It\u2019s also difficult for a foreign NGO to operate in China, and the animal movement in general is less developed (and shrimps are already pretty niche for the wider animal movement). Here again, we believe there is significant opportunity to help shrimps, but can\u2019t currently see a path for a shrimp-specific charity. Any change would likely need to have a broader aquaculture focus, with a proportional focus on shrimps.</p><h1><strong>How You Can Help&nbsp;</strong></h1><h2><strong>Funding</strong></h2><p>As stated above, we\u2019re currently&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.canva.com/design/DAFmipds-i4/CfV3em4SXjCGnN2F2DJ1gg/view?utm_content=DAFmipds-i4&amp;utm_campaign=designshare&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_source=publishsharelink\"><u>actively fundraising for shrimp stunners</u></a>. We estimate the cost-effectiveness of each stunner to be&nbsp;<strong>~1,500+ shrimps humanely stunned per $</strong> (in expectation per year).

ASC are currently (<i>Sep-Oct 2023</i>) engaging in a stakeholder consultation for&nbsp;<strong>Shrimp Health &amp; Welfare indicators to be included in their revised certification</strong>. We believe these can be stronger than the recommendations currently proposed, in particular in relation to increasing the adoption of electrical stunning. However we also think that many of the respondents to the stakeholder consultation are likely to be affiliated with the industry, and the new indicators could potentially be watered down as a result.&nbsp;</p><p>We therefore think that a push of support for shrimp welfare could be a potentially quick and impactful action that concerned citizens (ASC\u2019s term) or NGOs can take to improve shrimp welfare. We\u2019ve prepared some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iI9w1kTAzw66_REKmPbH77ZU-g9yW8job2OOCiXouAU/edit?usp=sharing\"><strong><u>recommended responses</u></strong></a> that people can to refer to if you\u2019re interested in providing feedback regarding the proposed indicators (though it\u2019s important to note that any duplicated responses may be discarded, so we\u2019d recommend&nbsp;<strong>rewriting our responses in your own words</strong>, or with the help of an AI tool such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\"><u>ChatGPT</u></a>).</p><h2><strong>Volunteer or work with us</strong></h2><p>We have an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/work-with-us\"><u>open call for volunteers</u></a> on our website, and are pretty excited about giving enthusiastic people the opportunity to help us help shrimps! We are typically looking for generalist volunteers in the areas of Research, Comms, and Operations, though have also had success with very specialised skill sets (such as people with PhDs in aquaculture). We prefer where possible to give people discrete projects and regular feedback, with the intention of giving volunteers the opportunity to \u201cown\u201d a piece of work, hopefully building up their skills and contributing to their portfolio of work for their CV.</p><p>In addition (though we\u2019re not hiring currently), we\u2019re a relatively small team, and any hire we make has significant influence on SWP as a whole. Although new roles are typically posted on various relevant Job Boards/Slack channels, they\u2019re often first announced via our\u2026</p><h2><strong>Newsletter &amp; social media</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/newsletter\"><u>Signing up to our Newsletter</u></a> is the best way to keep up to date with SWPs work. We tend to publish a newsletter every 1-2 months and use it to announce our progress and impact (such as signing a new corporate commitment, or when we\u2019ve published new research), events we\u2019re attending (or attended), jobs and volunteer opportunities in aquatic animals, and other links we think are useful to share with people interested in shrimp welfare.

Firstly, <strong>nitrogen</strong> and <strong>phosphorus</strong> are becoming scarce in forms, which are necessary to grow plants (such as nitrates and phosphates). Although using them as fertilizers allows us to feed around&nbsp;a <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/how-many-people-does-synthetic-fertilizer-feed\"><u>two times larger</u></a> global population, we are currently dependent on artificially producing them to sustain this population. At the same time, both nitrogen and phosphorus production currently depends on non-renewable sources - natural gas for nitrogen and phosphate mining for phosphorus.</p><p>Fortunately, Denkenberger and his colleagues have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X15005216\"><u>found out</u></a> nitrogen can be cheaply and sustainably replaced, as it can be isolated from the air using renewable energy, with an efficiency loss of only 1 %. Finding a renewable source of phosphorus seems more tricky, however, Denkenberger mentions even a 10x increase in its price would hardly affect the price of food. Nevertheless, the phosphorus we do \"use up\" isn't inevitably lost, just more expensive to extract. And<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rtoGkzQkAhymErh2Q/are-we-going-to-run-out-of-phosphorous\">&nbsp;<u>Halstead</u></a> estimates it would take at least 6,000 years to use up all phosphorus reserves, which means that we have a relatively long time to discover technologies which would make its extraction cheaper.</p><p>The concern with <strong>energy</strong> relates to its increasing scarcity, which partly owes to the transition from fossil fuels. Denkenberger&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/david-denkenberger-sahil-shah-using-paper-mills-and-seaweed-in-catastrophes/?t=6418#energy-and-food-prices-020718\"><u>mentions</u></a> this scarcity could be well managed, if solar and wind power are combined with alternative energy storage methods (compressed air, pumped hydro) that just aren't incentivized by the current markets. Nevertheless, there has been an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wXzc75txE5hbHqYug/the-great-energy-descent-short-version-an-important-thing-ea\">extensive debate</a>, as to whether these methods will get implemented quickly enough to prevent an economic decline.</p><p>The optimistic sentiments were also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/luisa-rodriguez-why-global-catastrophes-seem-unlikely-to-kill-us-all/#resource-scarcity-022307\"><u>echoed</u></a> on the podcast by Luisa Rodriguez who wrote a comprehensive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GsjmufaebreiaivF7/what-is-the-likelihood-that-civilizational-collapse-would\"><u>report</u></a> on existential risks from civilizational collapse. Importantly, Luisa concludes that even catastrophes which would erase 99 % of humanity would be very unlikely to permanently halt humanity\u2019s potential. Therefore, resource depletion seems unlikely to pose an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/existential-risk?tab=wiki\"><u>existential risk</u></a>, as all humanity would need to run off a resource, which is irreplaceable and necessary for life. Nevertheless, it may exacerbate other risks that require global cooperation, as I\u2019ll expand below.</p><p>Similarly, in a short mention in The Precipice (p. 117), Toby Ord implies he hasn't found evidence that the scarcity of fossil fuels, phosphorus, topsoil, fresh water, or metals would pose a threat to humanity's long-term potential. Ord has also written an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180808140711/http://amirrorclear.net/files/overpopulation-or-underpopulation.pdf\"><u>article</u></a>, in which he argues that given the intrinsic value of human life, it would likely be good if Earth was more populated (particularly if resources were distributed more efficiently via social change or technological progress).</p><p>In What We Owe the Future (pp. 147-150), MacAskill mentions that having easily accessible <strong>fossil fuels</strong> may be crucial to allow a civilization recovery after a collapse, i. e. industrialization (presumably - before reinventing cheap renewables, fission, fusion, or AGI).</p><p>Lastly, the UN has recently&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/our-use-sand-brings-us-against-wall-says-unep-report\"><u>warned</u></a> about the depletion of <strong>river sand</strong> used for concrete, however, there seems to be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2214785323013792\"><u>plenty</u></a> of alternatives and the UN\u2019s report&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/our-use-sand-brings-us-against-wall-says-unep-report\"><u>mentions</u></a> there are viable ways to recycle construction material. For instance, the EU&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/422628-artificial-sand-provides-green-solutions-for-the-construction-sector\"><u>has funded</u></a> a research project which claims to have managed to develop artificial sand from fly ash which is \u201csuperior and cost-effective alternative to natural sand\u201d.</p><h3><strong>Overpopulation</strong></h3><p>Another potentially important consideration in this area is the threat of increased resource scarcity due to overpopulation. Population growth in the developing world has been slowing down since the 50\u2019s due to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition\"><u>demographic transition</u></a>.

For water, there are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/dispensers-for-safe-water\"><u>Dispensers for Safe Water</u></a>.

The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/\"><u>80,000 Hours review</u></a> of climate change suggests an existential risk from ecosystem collapse is extremely unlikely. However, I\u2019m afraid&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328717301726?casa_token=6p3t0TtCsQkAAAAA:RtCefiaj4QGbGcxgeen41FVCXoXUJ0i0DlIQf0dr2sZBIBqUOC_CxDGdhsGllXJ-QLP57TeNOwo#sec0025\"><u>the CSER study</u></a> they link in support doesn\u2019t lay grounds for any firm conclusions.</p><p>The study provides the following argument: Yes, the data suggest global biodiversity is in decline. Yes, small-scale experiments have shown local biodiversity decline to reduce plant productivity. However, local biodiversity seems to be mostly staying the same, because when one species dies out, species from other regions take over its former niche. Therefore, e.g. as much as 50 % of species could die out without significant damage to human civilization. The authors consider such loss of biodiversity to be plausible, but state they don\u2019t see how this could lead to human extinction. They admit a 90 % biodiversity loss already could pose an existential risk but claim no one predicts such a loss. Lastly, referencing D. Meier\u2019s&nbsp;<i>What\u2019s So Good About Biodiversity?</i>, the study mentions there\u2019s a \u201cgrowing skepticism regarding the strength of evidence linking trends in biodiversity loss to an existential risk for humans\u201d but also that \u201cthe majority of conservation scientists are likely to flinch at this conclusion\u201d. I\u2019ve read Meier\u2019s chapter on \u201cBiodiversity as (Human) Life Sustainer\u201d but didn\u2019t stumble on any relevant arguments there, as it only attacks very straw-man versions of the concern<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref717ztg4m6on\"><sup><a href=\"#fn717ztg4m6on\">[2]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>Although I\u2019m inclined to agree with the general case, I don\u2019t think these arguments are sufficient for the stated level of confidence. Both good counter arguments and a better case against ecosystem collapse as a cause area can again be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://whatweowethefuture.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Climate-Change-Longtermism.pdf\"><u>Halstead\u2019s review</u></a> (Chapter 5.7).&nbsp;</p><p>It's true that if we only look at existing anthropogenic biodiversity loss (1% of species since 1500), ecosystem collapse looks quite unlikely. However, to assess the problem, we should be focusing on future extinction rates, which are expected to be <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-009-9761-9\">mainly driven</a> by climate change. A 2019 report by the UN consensus (<a href=\"https://www.ipbes.net/global-assessment\"><u>IPBES</u></a>) estimates \u201cthe fraction of species at risk of extinction due to climate change is 5% at 2\u00b0C warming, rising to 16% at 4.3\u00b0C warming\u201d. Halstead implicitly assumes substantial problems start after 75 % of species go extinct (6th mass extinction), which would only happen after 18,000 years at the current pace. Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016953471500138X\">Thomas (2015)</a> estimates that the selective pressures posed by humans accelerate the natural creation of new species 100 - 10,000 times, while we only speed up natural extinction rates 100 - 1,000 times.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/TXjg9HavsJWFXMhGN/mstyqqn2r7dfho82fa98\"></p><p>However, these estimates are riddled with substantial uncertainty. Firstly, a look at population losses tells a much more pessimistic story. Since 1970, wildlife populations have decreased by 68 % on average (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/living-planet-index-decline\">this figure is a little tricky</a>). And this loss is likely even higher for \"unsexy\" species, such as insects and fungi, where 99 % of species <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-species-evaluated-iucn\">haven't</a> been evaluated for extinction - a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03638-9\">2022 study</a> in Nature estimated that 28 % of well-studied species and 56 % of data-deficient species are \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threatened_species\">threatened by extinction</a>\u201d.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqtzk1ccx3m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqtzk1ccx3m\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Thirdly, some conservationists are concerned about ecological cascades caused by extinction of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_species\">keystone species</a>.</p><p>Nonetheless, an estimate published in 2022 in Nature by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-23369-5\"><u>Kaiho</u></a> suggests that if we continue to reduce our GHG emissions (leading to a 3\u00b0C warming by 2100), the average animal species loss will reach 10-15 % between the years 2060-2080 or a maximum of 33 % in the worst case. The author suggests this would be sufficient to avert an ecosystem collapse with catastrophic impacts, that could happen if we continued burning fossil fuels or engaged in a nuclear war. However, \"ecosystem collapse\" is only operationalized as the extinction of 20-50 % of animal species. Although it's a common meme that e.g. keeping the biodiversity loss under 10 % is necessary for civilization, the aforementioned reviews haven't found evidence such a tipping point exists.</p><p>Halstead expresses optimism, highlighting the literature that suggests that the relationship between the habitat area and the number of species is logarithmic, meaning that while habitat loss may manifest in significant population losses, we would have to significantly increase our land use to cause the extinction of these species (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species%E2%80%93area_relationship\">the species-area relationship</a>).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/global-deforestation-peak\"><u>Additionally</u></a>, while tropical deforestation continues, it has significantly slowed down since the 1980\u2019s and forest cover has been rising in the temperate forests.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/TXjg9HavsJWFXMhGN/vlmotomyzuijkc8gesbr\"></p><p>Secondly, Halstead investigates the claim that a loss in biodiversity could lead to resource scarcity because of lower crop yields. He remarks there hasn\u2019t been a marked decrease in crop yields throughout Europe\u2019s history despite its loss of 88 % of forest cover between 1,000 BC and 1850 AD - nor a nonlinear ecological collapse. Similarly, he points out that many of the currently richest regions have the Biodiversity Intactness Index below 30 %.</p><p>These correlations are somewhat confounded: They don't actually capture a decrease in biodiversity, but forest cover; and rich regions are largely dependent on imports. Nevertheless, the fact that European crop yields have not been affected by the loss of 88 % of forest land, does provide some evidence against the <a href=\"https://www.nhm.ac.uk/our-science/data/biodiversity-indicators/what-is-the-biodiversity-intactness-index.html\">idea </a>that a decrease below 90 or 30 % of biodiversity intactness triggers tipping points that make agriculture problematic. Particularly so, if we combine the findings regarding the non-linear species-area relationship with the fact that forest cover is mainly decreasing in regions with biodiversity intactness &gt; 90 %.</p><p>Additionally, I think there are good reasons to expect that in the event of a 6th mass extinction, humans wouldn't be one of the 75+ % of species that would disappear, as we aren't dependent on one habitat or one source of food, and have the unique ability to transform nature into whatever nutrients we need&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmzhufxg2dr8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmzhufxg2dr8\">[4]</a></sup></span>. Since a mass extinction caused by an ecological cascade would likely take at least decades to unravel, it seems likely that at least 80,000 people would survive (which is the upper bar for the minimum number of people to restore civilization estimated by Rodriguez's <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GsjmufaebreiaivF7/what-is-the-likelihood-that-civilizational-collapse-would\">report</a>), as decreases of human population would increase biodiversity in a self-regulating fashion. Our ability to adapt may be the reason we're the most <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/list/abundant-animals-the-most-numerous-organisms-in-the-world\">populous </a>mammals.</p><p>In summary, I think Halstead presents good reasons to be optimistic regarding the threat of an ecosystem collapse in this century, although the evidence in this area seems somewhat uncertain. Hannah Ritchie, who has collected much data on the topic,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/yields-habitat-loss\"><u>suggests</u></a> increasing crop yields (particularly in sub-saharan Africa) could again be an effective way to reduce the problem of species loss, as it allows us to use less forest land to grow crops. Further study may be devoted to the impact of keystone species and second-order effects of climate change on agriculture.</p><h3><strong>Waste pollution</strong></h3><p>Rob Wiblin has written a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190801005033/https://medium.com/@robertwiblin/what-you-think-about-landfill-and-recycling-is-probably-totally-wrong-3a6cf57049ce\"><u>post</u></a> suggesting landfills don't cause significant pollution in rich countries, where they tend to be well managed. He also suggests burning waste can be good for the environment in rich countries, as it also generates energy. As he notes, this certainly isn\u2019t the case in poorer countries, where open trash burning is common (e.g. in Delhi, it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ceew.in/sites/default/files/ceew-study-on-controlling-delhi-air-pollution-2021.pdf\"><u>accounts&nbsp;</u></a>to 10-30 % of air pollution). However, all sources I could find suggest recycling is still more energy efficient than burning trash &amp; using it as an energy source (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)EE.1943-7870.0000206\"><u>1</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43615-022-00192-8\"><u>2</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1065/lca2004.09.180.10\"><u>3</u></a>). The worst claims of the articles with an anti-recycling overtone were \u201cit isn\u2019t as great as it seems\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.inka.world/blogs/the-lunch-club/why-recycling-isnt-the-answer-part-3-carbon-footprint\"><u>1</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/01/recycling-wont-solve-climate-change/617851/\"><u>2</u></a>).</p><p>Waste makes up 3 % of global greenhouse gas emissions and the overwhelming source of waste emissions seems to be methane from organic matter (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/emissions-by-sector\"><u>1</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213343721019072#bib6\"><u>2</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://environment.govt.nz/facts-and-science/waste/reducing-emissions-from-waste/\"><u>3</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dcceew.gov.au/environment/protection/waste/food-waste/recovering-organic-waste\"><u>4</u></a>). Good news is that these kinds of emissions&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960852408010572#bib20\"><u>can be</u></a> eliminated and used to create electricity with an efficiency ranging from 25-100 %. In areas where the efficiency is &gt; 50 %, the global warming potential is net negative, because of the energy generated. I take this as an indication that introducing biogas plants in LMI countries could potentially be quite an effective \u201cimpact entrepreneurship\u201d project, as it also might be increasing wellbeing via less air pollution and cheaper electricity. Speculatively, reducing the volume of waste lying around could also reduce the risk of pandemics, as trash can form a breeding ground for some diseases-carrying species.</p><p>A Tearfund&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.tearfund.org/-/media/learn/resources/reports/2019-tearfund-consortium-no-time-to-waste-en.pdf\"><u>report</u></a> from 2019 suggests 400,000 to 1 million premature deaths per year are caused by waste mismanagement. The authors have considered 3 causes:</p><ol><li><strong>Air pollution</strong> caused by open burning of waste (270-920 thousand deaths)</li><li><strong>Diarrhoeal disease</strong> (67-141 thousand deaths) caused by blocked drains, flooding, and other insanitary conditions arising from dumped waste</li><li><strong>Mosquito-borne disease</strong> (27-48 thousand deaths) including dengue and malaria caused by increased mosquito breeding grounds arising from dumped waste and flooding.</li></ol><p>When it comes to waste harmful to animals and the environment, plastic waste comes up the most often.

From the point of view of the ecosystem, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.tearfund.org/-/media/learn/resources/reports/2019-tearfund-consortium-no-time-to-waste-en.pdf\"><u>particular</u></a> problem comes from plastic waste which facilitates the proliferation of pathogens to coral reefs. <s>However, these are widely discussed problems that don\u2019t seem to have an easy fix.</s></p><p><strong>Edit (02/24):</strong> In <i>Not the End of the World,</i> Hannah Ritchie suggests plastic pollution is actually the most tractable environmental problem, that could be solved tomorrow, if the Western leaders decided to finance waste infrastructure in developing countries. Most of ocean plastic pollution comes from a handful of rivers in Asia. Since we have this kind of infrastructure in Europe and North America, our waste is only responsible for ~5 % of the ocean plastic (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/ocean-plastics\">Our World in Data</a>). Presumably, such infrastructure would also lay ground for reducing the harms coming from other waste.</p><p><strong>E-waste</strong></p><p>Another way to find priority paths within waste pollution might be to track particularly dangerous waste mismanagement in LMICs. One area of concern here, suggested in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TnpkPHztXwh96AvRH/cause-exploration-prizes-effective-e-waste-management-in\"><u>post by Sahron Nyaga</u></a>, is e-waste. Most electronic components contain lead, cadmium or mercury, which are strongly neurotoxic. The rise of leaded gas in the US in the 60\u2019s and 70\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://today.duke.edu/2022/03/lead-exposure-last-century-shrunk-iq-scores-half-americans\"><u>caused</u></a> an average drop in IQ of ~5 points and significantly increased crime, perhaps&nbsp;<a href=\"https://news.northeastern.edu/2023/04/26/serial-killer-decline/\"><u>including</u></a> an 8 times increase in the number of serial killers.</p><p>The closest thing to an estimate of the health impact of e-waste I could find came from a recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240023901\"><u>report by the WHO</u></a>. The report estimates the number of people exposed to e-waste as the simple number of informal waste workers,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/programs/geh/geh_newsletter/2021/8/geh-at-niehs/who_report_explores_the_effects_of_ewaste_on_childrens_health.cfm\"><u>which is</u></a> ~15-20 million people. As various sources note, informal waste workers are often rural migrants with low qualification, who don\u2019t have an alternative, so rather than banning such work, some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/reveh-2018-0014/html\"><u>experts</u></a> push for a wider usage of personal protective equipment. Such interventions, rather than outright bans, also don\u2019t incentivize illegal dumpsites from forming and don\u2019t require governments.</p><p>I haven\u2019t been able to find sources which would attempt to quantify the number of people affected by e-waste indirectly (e.g. by diffusion into drinking water), which makes me guess these effects are relatively small, i.e. commensurate with the attention the problem is getting by NGOs and governments.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as Sahron mentions, 60-90% of e-waste is imported or dumped&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/press-release/illegally-traded-and-dumped-e-waste-worth-19-billion-annually-poses\"><u>illegally</u></a>, which suggests improving the monitoring of electronics transport could be one way to mitigate it. I suppose there's a tiny chance this could also improve AI governance, in case some of the materials became a limited resource.</p><h2><strong>Long-term resource depletion will be solved by AI</strong></h2><p>In 1968, Paul Ehrlich&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/galton-ehrlich-buck\"><u>attracted the attention</u></a> of global leaders by his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20180808140711/http://amirrorclear.net/files/overpopulation-or-underpopulation.pdf\"><u>predictions</u></a> that in the next two decades, hundreds of millions would starve to death due to overpopulation. Despite this widespread pessimism, the crop yields in Africa have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug\"><u>doubled</u></a> around the same period (1965-1970), thanks to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution\">green revolution</a>. Perhaps we should expect technological progress to surprise us again.</p><p>We can expect that a lot of the engineering that comes into making new materials or food sources will take a while to be automated but also, if AI soon automates most mental work, significant manpower may shift to doing the physical experiments necessary to advance material science. Since there are market incentives in making resources abundant, we should expect the kind of work we might make on this problem will get radically accelerated with the advent of AGI. We have at least one theory how a resulting radical abundance might be possible,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/oqBJk2Ae3RBegtFfn/my-thoughts-on-nanotechnology-strategy-research-as-an-ea\"><u>nanotechnology</u></a>.
