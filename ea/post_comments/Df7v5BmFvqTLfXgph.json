I have not read the entire article but from engaging with it for less than five minutes it's clear that your simplified summary is inadequate.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-025941#dl1\">Degrowth</a> is a new term that signifies radical political and economic reorganization leading to drastically reduced resource and energy <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-025941#dl1\">throughput</a>. Related scholarship critiques the ideology behind the dogma of <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-025941#dl1\">economic growth</a>; contributes to documentation of negative material, social, and ecological effects of growth; and assesses alternatives to growth-based development (<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-environ-102017-025941#\">1</a>). Put simply, the degrowth hypothesis is that it is possible to organize a transition and live well under a different political-economic system that has a radically smaller resource throughput.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Thus, the point the degrowth movement is concerned with is reducing resource and energy throughput and not stopping all forms of (technological) development. On the opposite, it is about being more mindful of what technologies we develop and how we put them into practice with the goal of needing a smaller resource throughput as a result. Or do you expect degrowth proponents to advocate against investing more into R&amp;D of better solar panels and wind turbines? No, the whole point of degrowth is not to be against <i>development</i> but to change our conception of development so as to lead to an overall reduction (or at least stabilization) of resource and energy throughput. Lofty goals but same can be said for the whole AGI and existential risk shebang.&nbsp;</p><p>And I mean their point seems to be worthy of discussion as there <i>are </i>limits to growth as you acknowledge, and it seems not outlandish and to many people probably very reasonable to argue that we are approaching these limits as we have a created an economic system that has pushed us into the dangerous territory of our planetary boundaries.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe you disagree about the degree to which we are in state of emergency or you are a techno-optimist who believes AGI will easily solve all \"resource flow hiccups\" we may be experiencing right now but this does NOT absolve you from doing a minimum of critical engagement with a case being made if you are to actively advocate against it. If the topic is not for you, fine. Stay out of it. But do not misrepresent the claims and case of people just because they have a different opinion from you.</p><p>P.S. sorry if this is a little bit harsh but this situation really captures a lot of what I am worried about with the EA forum. Stuff sometimes gets downvoted for specious reasons that are not grounded in any significant engagement with the topic but simply a \"hot-take\" that's formed based on a different (often uninformed) starting point. This creates potentially specious filter bubbles similar to other social media.

The hypothesis - the one I'm saying is not supported by any evidence, and which has been falsified in the past - is that you can do degrowth without the downsides.

Doubling down on stereotyping and mischaracterizing people... great job! (sorry for the sarcasm but I am STILL surprised when I encounter this type of behavior in the EA forum, probably a sign of my naivety...). Nevertheless, for the benefit of the people who are intimidated by this type of behavior, I will try to give a short outline on where you, at least in my opinion, go wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>First, you seem to be upset that some people believe the hypothesis that \"it is possible to organize a transition and live well under a different political-economic system that has a radically smaller resource throughput\" because there is no <strong>evidence</strong> for it. I get that this may be not something you want... from your perspective it may not be \"desirable\" at the moment but what is <strong>your evidence</strong> that this is \"impossible\" to realize or even \"undesirable\" for people in general? Do you have more than specious historical analogies that actually <strong>proof your point</strong>? No, you don't because you can't. This is a complex and nuanced question that requires critical engagement and empirical inquiry to be resolved. Nobody is forcing you to contribute to this project but advocating against resolving the issue through critical engagement actually requires critical engagement. <strong>Pick your poison</strong>.</p><p>Second, why on earth do you continue to make broad stereotypical and misrepresenting claims after you have been made aware of the fact that you are doing it? Do you believe that is conducive to a productive and good conversation or are there other reasons in play that I simply fail to apprehend in my naivety and ignorance? Just to illustrate my point, a couple of quotes and replies from my side:</p><blockquote><p>they are opposed to mining more minerals, regardless of environmental damage, because they want less resource usage</p></blockquote><p>You make it sound like people are against mining of minerals in general. This is not the case. Even people advocating for degrowth have understood that civilization requires mining and use of minerals. They just advocate for being mindful of how much minerals we actually need to mine and encourage reconsideration of how we approach resource extraction in general, from all else being equal \"more is better\" to \"less is better\". Mind you that for most people this is also not a dogmatic position but a strategic position that is being taken on the margin in response to a (perceived) overweight of the \"more is better\" position. In the end, most people who advocate for degrowth now, would settle for a middle ground in the long run, where humanity is simply more mindful with regards to what it is doing. My circumstantial evidence for this is talking to people at academic sustainability conferences.</p><blockquote><p>Yes, there are limits to growth, but they aren't relevant. They are busy telling people energy is finite, so we should use less - ignoring the fact that energy can be plentiful with solar and other renewable sources.</p></blockquote><p>When people are pointing to limits to growth as a problem, they tend to have a reason for doing so even if one disagrees with them. Figuring out who is right tends to involve debate and empirical inquiry but you again opt for the easy way out and strawman \"their\" position to prematurely close discussion. What people are pointing to when they say \"energy is finite\" is not that we could not create \"Dyson spheres\" sometime in the future but that in our current situation we are still very much dependent on fossil fuels, transitioning to renewables is itself energy and resource intensive, and we don't want to burst our carbon budget while still enabling the Global South to continue its development. These are real issues that must be dealt with in the here and now. What is so wrong with thinking that encouraging Western countries (and their citizens; some degrowth advocates favor bottom-up approaches) to reconsider some of their basic assumptions about growth and prosperity and reduce their material footprint and consumption to help this process along could be part of the solution?</p><blockquote><p>These are the same people - literally the same, in some cases - as the \"limits to growth\" folks from decades ago, and the fact that they were wrong hasn't deterred them in the least. They are STILL telling people that we will run out of minerals, ignoring the fact that discoverable reserves are orders of magnitude larger than we need in the foreseeable future, and in most cases reserves have been getting larger over time.</p></blockquote><p>You make it sound like it is a consensus that the \"limits to growth\" people have been wrong. I can tell you there are quite a few people who would beg to differ. If you would engage with the discourse and look at the data, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378008000435?casa_token=Gp-ISoLPEeUAAAAA:dlt7qCf1HGhhNjpRbd62947jxZ5XVsWTB0JBHhMl7bCXKNiIPLSjGaCOZuOCwLqWX4lnaKdq5A\">it's actually surprising how well the original study held up</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But don't let this evidence fool you, your entire hypothesis that we <strong>theoretically</strong> have enough resource reserves that we can continue to plunder in our ongoing mindless quest for economic growth, (almost) proofs we have nothing to worry or just discuss about. Don't let the fact that we are in an unprecedented situation where we are transitioning entire economies with enormous efforts that are going to take resource, energy, and time disturb you in your certainty and let's simply not use this crisis situation as an opportunity to engage in deep reflection about the values and goals of the economic systems that we want to create as a result. Discussing about how we want to work together as humanity is overrated and not at all consequential for the long-run development of our species. That's explicitly not what EA is supposed to be about. (Sorry, couldn't resist the sarcasm, again)</p><p>If you are looking for some materials to further engage with these debates, I can recommend engaging with the academic literature but also other sources like <a href=\"https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/\">Nate Hagens podcast</a>. There are many people on there who talk about the very practical issues the degrowth people are concerned about and want to address. There is definitely more of value there than what you give it credit for and this is basically the whole reason that I am complaining so heavily about your style and behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>Please don't just go around and attack and dunk on \"niche\" topics you haven't taken the time to properly engage with. It's fine to have (strong) opinions but be mindful of the effects the way you talk about things can have on other people and the community around you. The EA forum needs a diversity of voices and people should feel empowered to raise their (constructive, honest, etc.) points even if not everyone automatically gets their relevance. Constructive criticism and questions are fine and desired but misrepresentations are not.

The EROI (Energy Return On energy Investment) of solar and wind are not great (wind better than solar), they are very resource-intensive, they need storage (effectively making their EROI lower and their resource-intensivity larger) and there needs to be over-capacity of production. In addition, they use space, a lot of it if we want to produce most of the energy demand with them -AFAIK, eg. UK basically do not have enough land to produce the energy they'd need (yes, there is off-shore wind as well, it is a comment to illustrate the magnitude), and the only way we have to transport it, batteries, have low energy-density and is again very resource-intensive.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Note: low EROI basically means that a bigger share of the energy produced needs to be reinvested to produce energy (a larger share of the economy is dedicated to produce energy). It is very useful to plot \"Energy available for consumption\" vs \"EROI\". It shows that energy sources with too low EROI are basically useless for society. I don't go into numbers here because EROI calculations are very difficult to be made consistent between different energy sources and are difficult to calculate for the whole system. But the concept is clear and a system run with renewables is, at least, much closer to the energy cliff than we would like.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/a65EwiSphvMCeFcR8/d7yos0liuhfcergebitw\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/a65EwiSphvMCeFcR8/brngfwej4kqxz3bi7w49 80w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/a65EwiSphvMCeFcR8/asguea8qy0bldhy3y58a 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/a65EwiSphvMCeFcR8/jxnovdwenna7b3xanmpu 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/a65EwiSphvMCeFcR8/bxcoapxwwmgfnkahhz7n 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/a65EwiSphvMCeFcR8/dy0zwftquqgqi0wqumcw 400w\"></figure>", "parentCommentId": "t2RRdyWzuBpf9ELk8", "user": {"username": "mikbp"}}, {"_id": "nbRgP6cG9cKaStZGX", "postedAt": "2023-09-25T11:08:55.745Z", "postId": "Df7v5BmFvqTLfXgph", "htmlBody": "<p>I explicitly said that I do not have the time to write a good post and that I rather post this so that people discuss.</p><p>Incidentally, I read the Vox article long ago when it came out but I did not know that the writer is EA.
