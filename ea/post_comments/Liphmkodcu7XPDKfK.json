I would also be quite keen to hear about what RP has tried and didn't go so well.

I know you had to re-hire for this recently as the last executive director left, so I was wondering if you could share some learnings from that? For example:</p><ul><li>How come it's taken longer than anticipated for the Insect Welfare Project to launch and start running programs?</li><li>What mistakes do you think you made in this process?</li><li>How will this change the approach to which you incubate new organisations?&nbsp;</li></ul><p>etc. This list is non-exhaustive so would be keen to hear other useful lessons from this experience! Sorry if this comes across as critical, as it's not my intention, but I'm genuinely curious on what's been happening re Insect Welfare Project as it's a much needed endeavour.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "JamesOz"}}]
