Seeing this article as a dishonest or one-sided take:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The article devotes an entire appendix to the most popular arguments against Bitcoin. &nbsp;<br><br>Nevertheless, the purpose of this essay is not to compare the pros and cons of Bitcoin with those of the fiat system, and to declare a \"winner\" on the basis of intellectual analysis.&nbsp;<br><br>Rather, it is to point out that, whatever form the global monetary system takes 50 years from now, it should reflect the preferences of individuals who are free to choose what is best for them. Unfortunately, today's monetary system has major drawbacks from which many people around the world wish to escape - but, because money is currently a government monopoly, <i>these people have no alternative</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>If you prefer using fiat money, then nobody should stop you. But if you need a form of money that can't be inflated away, that doesn't depend on the good behaviour of the authorities, and that you can receive directly without having it channelled through third parties (and if those requirements are more important than any drawbacks you might associate with such a system), then that option ought to be available to you too. &nbsp;That potential is what Bitcoin offers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Regarding the benefit of having a central actor intervene with QE/interest rates, I've added:</strong></p><blockquote><p>debt accumulates in a vicious cycle: as the amount of societal debt outgrows the amount of money that exists (Figure 1), the only solution is to print and lend even more money \u2013 thereby creating more debt.</p><p>In other words, while the current system gives governments more freedom to print money and inject economic stimulus in the short term, most of this stimulus is required simply to pay down debt that was accumulated in previous rounds of spending. This is inherently unsustainable in the long run.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;The Fed had to print trillions of dollars during the pandemic so that we wouldn't see mass insolvency. But the situation was only that dire in the first place because they'd allowed so much money (and therefore debt) to be created in the past. And by adding more money/debt to the system on this occasion, they've ensured that it will be even more vulnerable next time. &nbsp;The anonymous author of the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Kg7KixqEHWBctJ4az/cause-exploration-prizes-fix-the-money-fix-the-world\">\"Fix the money\" essay</a> goes into more detail on this point.</p><p><strong>3. How Bitcoin addresses corruption:</strong> if a small group of people have control over the money source in your society, some of them will inevitably abuse that power for their own ends. &nbsp;Furthermore, if you have corrupt officials in charge of handling aid money from abroad, then some of them will steal that money for themselves. &nbsp;</p><p>Bitcoin avoids these specific problems by having no centralised authority over its money supply, and by allowing people to receive money (e.g. aid) directly instead of having to rely on middlemen. &nbsp;It doesn't purport to solve all corruption per se.<br><br><strong>4. Regarding how Bitcoin addresses privacy, I've added:</strong></p><blockquote><p>While the Bitcoin blockchain (the ledger containing all Bitcoin transactions) is public, payments are pseudonymous, and do not require the sort of personal information (e.g. name, bank account, or address) that governments, corporations, and merchants sell or leak on a regular basis. &nbsp;Further developments to Bitcoin (such as the Lightning Network, Taproot, Graftroot, and Schnorr Signatures) are already making it cheaper and easier to send bitcoins privately.</p></blockquote><p><strong>5. &nbsp;Bitcoin versus government accountability:</strong> &nbsp;if Bitcoin ruled the world, then governments wouldn't be able to simply print money in order to fund their unpopular ventures (as opposed to taxing their people and having to justify their expenditure). &nbsp; On an individual level, it's another reason why you can trust that your bitcoins won't be susceptible to inflation.<br><br><strong>6. Losing your Bitcoin-wallet key:&nbsp;</strong> if you choose to take sole custody of your bitcoins (and it is a choice), then, yes, you are responsible for storing your key safely. The reason that your local bank can recover your account, on the other hand, is that they (not you) have custody of your savings. &nbsp;<br><br>That said, there is no reason why you couldn't make use of equivalent services in a Bitcoin economy. Bitcoin may not necessarily be user-friendly right now, but such relatively minor issues are unlikely to persist as the network undergoes development over the next few years \u2013 and it is this work that I encourage EA and other groups to support.</p><p><strong>7. Whether Bitcoin can solve global issues better than fiat money:</strong> Bitcoin is just another form of money, so in theory, you can spend it on the same things that you would with fiat. &nbsp;The difference is that it appears to meet the fundamental requirements of sound money better than fiat does - in which case, the downstream benefits for issues such as poverty, climate change etc. would be huge.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>8. \"Could many of the issues you're highlighting be solved just by better functioning government?\":</strong> I'm suggesting that Bitcoin <i>is</i> a way to achieve better-functioning government.
