Whenever people mention Emsam, I want to mention that it is an important and sadly underutilized weapon in the arsenal against treatment-resistant depression. People should not be hesitant to use it when prescribed by their doctor, just because people at FTX may have abused it along with some controlled substances. The same is true of ADD meds, but many people don't know what Emsam is due to the astronomical cost, limited marketing, and psychiatrist hesitance to use MAOIs.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "mCxbpADejsQGPEYqb", "postedAt": "2022-11-22T20:52:11.049Z", "postId": "bbBZ7E2FG6KMp7kvz", "htmlBody": "<p>This was one of the best writeups I have seen on the topic.
