While reeling from the harm of the situation, the person experiencing the harm might engage in a process that hurts them in an effort to ensure their safety, protect other potential victims, educate the perpetrator, or signal that the perpetrator\u2019s actions were harmful.\"</p><p>I spent the weeks following the incident going over the facts in my head, considering his point of view, minimising the experience, &nbsp;wondering if I should have been more direct (anyone who has met me in person will know that's not something I usually have a problem with), discussing with friends who were disgusted by the story, then finally organising a meeting with him to outline why his actions were unacceptable, the next steps he needed to take and to make clear that he was not to contact me again.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm lucky that I have an incredible support system, had read enough on consent to feel able to stand up for myself and that he was immediately full of regret and shame.

But I am forever changed by it and would unfortunately rank that short event as one of my clearest memories.&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully, readers of this comment can see that this is not a reasonable process. I would be horrified if someone I loved told me that this had happened to them and that they were planning to mediate the aftermath like I had done.&nbsp;</p><p>Harms can be caused by poor judgement and selfishness in the moment. Actions that the individual might regret or feel shame over and potentially learn and grow from. However, the responsibility to protect other people, educate the perpetrator and repair the damage should be distributed.&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of this comment was to give an additional piece of anecdotal evidence of the problem.

I'm really sorry to hear what you've been through.&nbsp;</p><p>This passage resonated with me:</p><blockquote><p>Last week at EAG, I received a Swapcard message that proposed a non-platonic interaction under the guise of professional interaction. I went to an afterparty where someone I had just met\u2014literally introduced to me moments before\u2014put their hand on the small of my back and grabbed and held onto my arm multiple times. These might seem like minor annoyances, but I have heard and experienced that these kinds of small moments happen often to women in EA. These kinds of experiences undermine my own feelings of comfort and value in the community.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This kind of stuff has happened to me too. Each incident has felt too minor to do anything about, primarily because if I did, I'd then have to think about it as a Bad Thing That Happened, rather than an awkward interaction; something to forget. So there is a death-by-a-thousand-cuts element to all of this, where no individual interaction has risen to the level of wanting to make a fuss, but in combination, these things change how I perceive myself in EA spaces (more male gaze-y) and how I act (a bit more guarded).&nbsp;</p><p>And then I felt sad reading what followed:</p><blockquote><p>This might be anecdata, as some people say, and I know obtaining robust data on these issues has its own challenges<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\".\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"margin-top: -0.144em;

So I just want to say: I think that in the context of an issue that is notoriously hard to study (as you note), our experiences\u2014and the experiences of the many other women who have shared their stories\u2014do provide strong evidence of an important, systemic issue. Thanks again for speaking up.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "hobbes"}}, {"_id": "hpTc7yjKEzBA7FLgm", "postedAt": "2023-03-11T07:25:49.882Z", "postId": "WgziByhhKGDfuEgyy", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you so much for the time and energy put into this post! I have lots more to take in, but I wanted to highlight some points I took away on my first read through</p><blockquote><p>In allocating collective effort to this issue, I hope we can create protective norms, practices, or processes that take care of those affected and encourage the kind of behaviors we want in the future.</p></blockquote><p>One thing that seems especially noteworthy about the general framing of this post, and this statement in particular, is that it's describing a healthier community that only needs a little extra effort from each individual. This reminded me of what I see as norms around welcoming new people to EA groups. At least in my experience, most people see the importance of tailoring conversations with new people toward their interests and avoiding unnecessary jargon. Since many people are both capable of having this type of conversation and recognize its importance, &nbsp;there are many people that feel license to make this person more comfortable, and &nbsp;no individual has to be the one to do it on a given day. &nbsp;There are also tons of people that developed introductory curricula to be even more welcoming to new people, and train group leaders to do a better job of this in their individual groups. It seems like applying a similar level of care to sexual misconduct reinforces your concrete points of how we could get to this healthier community: treating each individual with compassion and putting in the time to think about how to do this better.&nbsp;</p><p>Another example of norms that feels in the right direction is how the &nbsp;EA community addresses burnout. EA seems to stigmatize driving people to burnout a lot more than other groups I've been apart of. This also gives me hope that EAs could realistically handle situations like the ones described in this post better than other communities. This feeling especially resonated with the final line in the post</p><blockquote><p>We\u2019re a community based in altruism, in being generous and caring about the well-being of all people. We should take responsibility for the harm people experience in this community and take responsibility for preventing it when we can. Especially where we can do more, we shouldn\u2019t let the survivors of misconduct among us shoulder the burden of improving things.</p></blockquote>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Toph"}}, {"_id": "sTer3XeExfaP7rd2E", "postedAt": "2023-03-11T07:46:16.745Z", "postId": "WgziByhhKGDfuEgyy", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for the post and vulnerability! &nbsp;I wanted to add one piece.&nbsp;<br>I'm speaking from my own experience here. For me, a difference between a \"correct\" and \"incorrect\" reaction to a misconduct is a person whose emotions and needs you focus on. Long story short - under no circumstances, when you are speaking to a victim you should be the most important person in the room. &nbsp;If, for whatever reason, you cannot do that (and it's totally ok to feel that way), I'd suggest stepping out from the conversation.&nbsp;<br>Some people may want to give away control and ask others to react - absolutely, you should then react. But because <i>they </i>need it and it's right for them, not because <i>you </i>want to.<br>So, listening to a person who reports misconduct, the actions you take and the words you say should not be about your shock and stress, your values, your need for action, your need for justice, your &nbsp;relationship with anybody or something similar. I'm not saying \"don't have those\" or \"don't set boundaries\". Obviously, you are going to have those, and if for whatever reason the situation crosses your boundary, step out of it. For me personally, angry, aggressive reactions, when I feel I totally loose control on what happens next are as problematic, as disbelief. And - here, it is very personal - disbelief is sometimes easier, as at least I know why I feel violated.&nbsp;<br>In my opinion, after a situation when somebody crosses your boundaries, you may need <i>empowerment </i>(again, you <i>may </i>need it, I'm not speaking for everybody). So taking your agency from you is bad, doesn't matter what form it takes. For me, each time I healed from sexual abuse or misconduct, was the moment when I felt in a position of power over my perpetrator. And some of my abusers were actually quite powerful people for me at the time, not only physically, but also &nbsp;when it comes to a position in the society. It may be personal, but I feel it's important to mention that some people may feel that way as well.&nbsp; If I feel that I'm in a place where - when I speak up - people may start trying to forcefully take care of me, I won't speak up. Which is not ideal.<br>(That being said, if the majority of victims decide they want a system which reacts for them, please set up such a system, I'm just not going to use it)<br>It is similar case as patriarchy, you know? The core of patriarchy is a man trying to decide what is good for a woman. The solution is <i>listen to her</i>. &nbsp;Forced protection without respect is only slightly better than ignoring.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Liv"}}, {"_id": "SnLf7ieHPLDfZgzEA", "postedAt": "2023-03-11T13:43:59.914Z", "postId": "WgziByhhKGDfuEgyy", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for writing this.

I feel like there's a big culture of secrecy or confidentiality around both questions of sexual misconduct, and other issues in the community, and I wonder whether we might be a healthier community if there was just more open, specific, name-attached discussion of bad things that people in the community have done. The problem, of course, is that calling for survivors to make open accusations plays into the same dynamic you are criticizing here - of placing most of the burden of getting justice on survivors.&nbsp;<br><br>For example: I personally know of someone in the community who has done some bad stuff. Not 'calling-the-police' bad, but 'I kinda wanna hang a red flag on him' bad. And part of me wants to just, idk, make a public post about this, or tell everyone I know: not because I want to ruin his life, or because I'm angry/vengeful, but because I want to protect others, and I think others might want to change their interactions with him, if they knew. And part of what prevents me from doing that is that it's not my story to tell; but part of it, I think, is a feeling that 'call-outs' of that kind are too big and dramatic and overkill-y, if the harm hasn't crossed over a certain threshold. But is that right? Do people have the right to be protected from people's reactions to their actions?<br><br>Similarly, I notice that when you described two (!) instances of sexual harassment you experienced at the recent EAG, you didn't say who it was. And it's <i>completely</i> your right not to reveal that and I really don't intend to pressure you to do so, but I have to confess part of me is like 'what the FUCK, after ALL that's happened and all the discussions we've been having, people had the audacity to behave like that?! Name and shame!'&nbsp;<br><br>And I have similar questions in my mind about stuff NOT related to sexual misconduct. For example, I've heard some bad stories about people's experiences working for EA organisations, and I wonder whether we might be a healthier community if more of these conversations were openly had.<br><br>Anyway, this makes me think that something the community could do is ensure to survivors (and others who've suffered bad behaviour) that telling people what happened, with their own and the perpetrator's name attached, won't harm their career. I'm not sure how to do this. One part is probably just expressing support for survivors and believing reports of misconduct by default (rather than having scepticism as a default). This might be another reason to distribute power more equitably within the community - if more people run organisations, control money, and have social power, then it might feel less costly to piss off one powerful person. Another part is perhaps for powerful people to make convincing signals that they <i>won't</i> punish people who criticize them and call them out for bad behaviour.&nbsp;<br><br>Anyway, very confused about all this.

It's his Facebook wall, and people are also allowed to have occasional bad days in person too.

I have noticed that in moral debates he will almost always stand up for the little guy/minority. It took me a little while to notice because I haven't met him in person much, but he also has some moral crusades that are very commendable and way ahead of their time. That's in addition to being a good educator that has helped many people in and out of EA/rationality community via his writings. Its also important to note I've never seen him use underhanded debate tactics or demeaning language, and he frequently updates through these debates of a certain style (that he and his FB friends consensually engage in) that he is wrong about something and takes the time to correct or better explain. Like, he takes painstaking care to take people's ideas as they meant them etc. Even when heated he still clearly tries very hard to be present with the person and bridge the gap via crux-finding.</p>\n<p>(it sounds cheesy and tryhard to write so much but I know that once somebody says \"abusive\" you have to say a lot more in response. It's totally valid if people didn't believe me jumping in til I'd said a bunch of cheesy stuff. You don't even have to believe me now but at least you won't assume one way or the other I hope)</p>\n<p>Do you <em>want</em> to start witchhunts? Who exactly are you expecting to protect by saying somebody can be mean and highstrung on Facebook? What is the heroic moment here? Except that <em>isn't</em> what was said, because then it would be clear that was not related enough to bring up. So instead you posted on a thread having to do with <em>sexual  abuse</em> that he is <em>abusive</em>. Please sit with that for a second. There might have been a time and a place but this ain't it.</p>\n<p><em>I can just picture it:</em> A few months from now, he and his loving husband are tending to their new baby. A friend texts them to check some news article: it's some new piece about abuse in EA. But this time it says \"allegations have also been made that a rationalist DS is also abusive\". Please picture how that would be for the mental health and wellbeing of their family. No one on this forum should have to ask you to picture the outcome since you apparently follow him on Facebook, and because you are supposed to be thinking about the <em>effects</em> of things, but here we are.</p>\n<p>I have reported your comments. Ideally mods will encrypt his name to reduce SEO for the benefit of him and his family.</p>\n<p>Please think more carefully next time. This is not a drill. Games of telephone are real. Information cascades are real. Rumor mills are real. And People's lives, their spouse's lives, and their children's lives potentially effected by these things are real. And  whether you like someone or not, you don't get to say people you think are rude sometimes are \"abusive\". I agree with you he is rude sometimes. So have we all been sometimes, especially the neurodivergent among us. I'm sure you have been rude too, but I won't call you abusive. Especially here on <em>This</em> thread which is about actual abusers and such, who could harm the community members through their actions, especially sexual actions. That term \"abusive\" comes with a particular, very serious attractor well of assumed meaning, and that meaning is not what DS is.</p>\n<p>I wonder if I'm the only one who has seen a game of real-life telephone go wrong. Very wrong.

It also happened to be one of the most central places where the EA and rationality community hashed things out, resulting in Brent's ouster and everyone converging on \"yeah okay this was EXTREMELY bad;\" it's super plausible that without my hosting of the conversation (including with my FB norms, that sapphire sneers at) the communities would have <i>not</i> had a single room where everybody said their piece and came to the correct conclusion.)</p><p>Also, for the (reasonable) tone objection, I note that there was, less than 36h later and while the first conversation was extremely active and ongoing, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/duncan.sabien/posts/pfbid02EEkbs75H8dPXMFaMHWe7tEcijXrhMPuHdB7x1yAPjqCidr4Bj2SrBJAQvthMk3rAl\">this followup</a>, which sapphire would like to pretend is ... immaterial?</p><blockquote><p>If I had it to do all over again, I would post these questions first, and yesterday's post an hour or two later. I think yesterday's post was crucial, but looking at how reasonable everyone was when engaging with it, I may have overestimated its *urgency.* And I think I underestimated the degree to which I would tug the conversation in one direction, and that's caused at least me and possibly others to spin their wheels on questions of guilt or malice while meanwhile an expression of hurt has NOT been adequately answered.</p></blockquote><p>My crime re: Brent is, basically, being skeptical enough to not IMMEDIATELY jump on the bandwagon, and instead taking an extra couple of days to wait for evidence to appear (which it did, thanks to my FB norms being such that people felt safe sharing their reactions, and which I then updated on). By \"literally one of the last rationalists defending Brent,\" sapphire means \"stopped defending him on ~Sep 22 instead of ~Sep 19.\" <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/duncan.sabien/posts/pfbid02CDngt3kerBsSSXGzUQVoas33Wqx579kLxD2HAPgJnM21KG2fjbrTSN9AEz7HWLw4l\">More on my processing of what went wrong there</a>, presented in metaphor.</p><p>For calibration, I scrolled back through my own past week of FB posts, looking for anything that might be representative of my stance on things like abuse and abusers, and the two most relevant ones from just the past week are <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/duncan.sabien/posts/pfbid02Bj4oCkFvgiGFVTnTqTiqbeCLkuPwj6cruJcKDsTmnKoo6VUp18DZrnGbztbYDxTMl\">this</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/duncan.sabien/posts/pfbid039cdzpLfPqsVeL21uP9p28cqVJDamS5f3anXgBBqSDknfRkxcu5c5SwUWDBhtMupl\">this</a>; decently representative reads for people who don't know me. The first is me giving people a heads-up about extreme language from a possible mutual, and the second is me strenuously objecting to someone saying that it's right to deceive others for their own benefit.</p><p>(Also, findable in the comments under the post sapphire is cherrypicking are things like the following:</p><blockquote><p>In this case, for instance\u2014if reasonably convinced that either:</p><p>a) safewords were ignored in cases where there was no prenegotiated agreement, or</p><p>b) deliberate lies were in fact told to third parties with the intent to decrease scrutiny or increase space for abusive behavior</p><p>... I would stop interacting with Brent in person and rescind his invitation to my house. I would probably not make a broad-spectrum public statement to that effect, but I would not keep this fact a secret, either.</p></blockquote><p>... which in fact happened.)</p><p>I don't expect I'll engage much beyond this; I think my posts (99.99% of which are public) stand for themselves, and my stance is basically \"the best conversations are the consensual ones,\" and I generally don't consent to being in conversation with sapphire; only showed up here in self-defense. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2eotFCxvFjXH7zNNw/?commentId=4etnnePDPBeRGgorA\">Parting note</a>.</p>", "parentCommentId": "TzjSp8SutFvvsus4Q", "user": {"username": "Duncan Sabien"}}, {"_id": "pJtS9BFMuoXkocX8s", "postedAt": "2023-03-12T19:55:36.595Z", "postId": "WgziByhhKGDfuEgyy", "htmlBody": "<p>[This comment has been edited cuz it was long and rambly trying to be gentle and nuanced before, but now idk, maybe it just sounded more aggressive before because it was longer idk]<br><br>I'm sighing at your response of digging your heels in.

I am all about 100% transparency, particularly when done in great detail as a primary document (it looks like your document missed a lot of detail but you can always edit it to be more honest if you think it still matters. That's your right.). But discretion and being careful about where and how we say things are also important because of the very real risks that people get <i>not-true</i> stories out of the vague-things-we-think-sound-true that all of us people (myself included) can be prone to say if we don't catch ourselves. This is an outcome you should care about if you care about getting the truth out there.&nbsp;<br><br>Sooo, I had gone to your Twitter yesterday to check that there weren't real substantiated claims of abuse made against [Qhapna]. I thought to myself \"maybe she knows something I don't\" (I take abuse claims seriously, so checked at least one of your social medias before defending him out of the blue). Anyway, nothing about [Qhapna]. \"All cool\", I thought. But yeah scrolling down a bit, I believe you participated in a game of telephone just a couple days before.<br><br>I was very much hoping you would be reasonable and either apologize or stay silent, because people make mistakes and I am not trying to shame you. But since you dug your heels in that naming DS on such a delicate thread was actually the right thing to do (potential misinformation be damned, I guess?), I will share this screenshot becasue you really ought to take seriously the suggestion that you should be more careful:&nbsp;[edit: I deleted the screenshot cuz I guess it was flashy and I didn't think to just quote it.

(</strong></i>The right guy was Jacy I think). Please realize how predictable an outcome this was. Like, I'm not shaming you because I find the outcome so incredibly predictable, and I think the conversation was relevant in that case, like worth discussing even though discussing is hard. But as long as that outcome is predictable, it is not right to namedrop people on any post that <i>is <strong>not</strong> actually related to them</i> quite <i>as casually as you did here</i>. I'm trying to help you realize that even people you respect can get stories wrong and the truth that <i>you want</i> to get out there might not even get that far before transforming into something you never meant.&nbsp;Mistakes happen but like, false gossip is really really hard to stop once it gets started.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>You <i>should care</i> about risk of misinformation <i>if you care about truth and helping people make the right decisions</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>My primary point is that games of telephones are real and their leading to misinformation is predictable. So real and predictable you yourself have already participated in one pulled from this very forum post. We should care and minimize the risk by only discussing relevant things.&nbsp;<br><br>One last epistemic note: Lauren Maria asked for names <i>if</i> the major figure was within EA. I don't think [Qhapna] counts tbh. I think you jumped the gun on finding him relevant even in that case. [Qhapna] has written elsewhere that he does not consider himself an EA. Some people consider themselves rationalists and EAs simultaneously. I admit there is Venn-style overlap. But [Qhapna] is not one of those. He is a rationalist through and through. [Even if naming him had made sense here, that caveat should have been included due to her request.]<br><br>Also, sure I'll say it since I'm here. This type of claim \"[he] has truly horrible opinions on what is a reasonable way to treat people\" and the rest goes against competing claims that he has very high integrity and strict moral compass when it comes to the treatment of others. He has written many long pieces about this.

(Understand that your side of the story won\u2019t capture all relevant details!)</li>\n<li>Solicit anonymous feedback on your behavior from anyone who is happy to give it (not just people who were harmed by you).</li>\n<li>Spend more energy paying attention to how people are feeling. (Read facial expressions and nonverbal cues. Verbally check in, but know that\u2019s not foolproof.)</li>\n<li>Become comfortable with rejection. Make people feel safe turning you down at any point.</li>\n<li>Read books or online materials on consent, power dynamics, and how to avoid making people uncomfortable.</li>\n<li>Exercise great caution with romantic/sexual advances (or halt them entirely) until you\u2019re certain that these advances can be made without harm.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These ideas could also be helpful for people who are concerned they\u2019ve caused harm but aren\u2019t sure of it. Or for people who are concerned they <em>might</em> cause harm.</p>\n<h2>For EA event organizers</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Contact CEA\u2019s community health team for info on any local people they've received reports about.</li>\n<li>Pay attention to people's behavior (and pay attention to gossip about their behavior). Seek out additional information on anyone who seems to be behaving poorly.</li>\n<li>Explicitly state that you are happy to receive reports of harmful behavior regarding local EAs. (Even if the bad behavior is minor! Minor bad behavior should not result in a ban, but it can form a serious pattern.)</li>\n<li>Consider talking to attendees about their behavior if they\u2019ve made others uncomfortable, even if their behavior is far from ban-worthy. (But protect the privacy of reporters.)</li>\n<li>Have a woman on your organizing team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here\u2019s an anecdote: I\u2019m female and I used to organize local EA events. One time, one of my attendees made a weird flirty comment towards me, and it seemed suspicious, but not that bad on its own. But it inspired me to contact CEA about this attendee. I heard other (worse!) reports about him. So I banned him.</p>\n<p>Oftentimes, when I\u2019ve gotten sketchy vibes from a guy, later info has revealed that he treats women poorly. Sketchy vibes aren\u2019t sufficient for a ban, but they are a good indication that you should pay attention and ask around.</p>\n<h2>For non-perpetrators and non-organizers</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>If you see someone in the community behave inappropriately towards someone else, consider talking to them about it or reporting it.</li>\n<li>Be a supportive friend and a good listener to others in the community. Show that you can be a trustworthy confidant; keep sensitive information private unless you are told you can share it.</li>\n<li>Offer to help people report information to local event organizers and/or CEA and/or police. You can help them stay anonymous, if that\u2019s what they wish. Or you can just help them explain the situation to others and field questions. Or they might just need validation that what happened is worth reporting! (I think that even relatively minor things are worth reporting \u2014 as I said earlier, minor incidents can form a pattern.)</li>\n<li>Report incidents of people behaving inappropriately towards you \u2014 even if it\u2019s not bad enough that you\u2019d call yourself a \u201csurvivor.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "ao"}}, {"_id": "FSF9CBW7FFLDtZ85w", "postedAt": "2023-03-13T01:05:25.115Z", "postId": "WgziByhhKGDfuEgyy", "htmlBody": "<p>For those who have caused, may have caused, or feel they may cause harm, I'd add:</p><p>Critically examine your use of alcohol and certain drugs, and whether you should reduce or stop any use of them. <i>To be clear, the use of alcohol or drugs is not in any way an excuse for misconduct. </i>But you should consider whether your use of alcohol or drugs may have an adverse effect on your agression, impulse control, judgment, or other factors that increases the likelihood of future harm.</p>", "parentCommentId": "YzkahZ7dMcnyCY2zu", "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "vhwwygayg8RWAC9Ma", "postedAt": "2023-03-13T03:56:20.098Z", "postId": "WgziByhhKGDfuEgyy", "htmlBody": "<p>(separate reply to allow separate [dis]agreevoting)</p><p>I think I'd like to see a system where community members who have caused, may have caused, or feel they may cause harm could anonymously self-refer themselves for services from an appropriate professional (with community financial support to the extent necessary).

As for me, I experience some anxiety that I might mess up posts or comments on this topic even though there are several factors that should make me less anxious than the average reader (e.g., I am mostly psuedonymous, I am not a career EA, my ideas are pretty mainstream-for-the-wider-culture, and I'm a professional writer). So I suspect that what you're experiencing is pretty common and is valuable to share with others in the community.</p><p>I think it's important for men of good faith to have a safe sandbox to think through some of these issues and learn how to be a better ally. In the area of sexual assault prevention, men who do not engage in problematic behaviors play an important part in many mitigations, like <a href=\"https://www.rainn.org/articles/practicing-active-bystander-intervention\">bystander intervention</a> and combatting <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-says-toxic-masculinity-more-than-alcohol-leads-to-sexual-assault/\">toxic masculinity</a>. So, to the extent practicable, I think it is really important to avoid creating disincentives for men to engage on these issues -- like fear of being seen as insensitive or worse due to a good-faith mistake.</p><p>But in the course of developing in this area, men will sometimes phrase things awkwardly and will sometimes say incorrect things. Maybe the Forum isn't the best sandbox; I think I like the idea of a men's group of sorts -- I would favor having a trained facilitator involved in that. That way, the inevitable moments of awkard phrasing or error can be gently addressed without expecting women or non-binary people in the community to take on the emotional labor of addressing them.</p>", "parentCommentId": "ggQ8skJjfCuAgqHnC", "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "rPHDzobkr7sdCafPt", "postedAt": "2023-03-13T17:03:06.106Z", "postId": "WgziByhhKGDfuEgyy", "htmlBody": "<p>I mean <i>I'm</i> not sure I take women's sadness seriously enough.
