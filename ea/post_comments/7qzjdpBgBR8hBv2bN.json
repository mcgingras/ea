It sounds like you know these orgs better than I do.

So what I'm asking is: has there been something digestible that would articulate their similarities and differences? Has there been any effort to think about whether this is too man orgs or too few? &nbsp;</p><p>(Edited to put the Effective Altruism Foundation into the funder category which I think is a better fit)</p>", "parentCommentId": "PBoayhmosYcLN4ACX", "user": {"username": "setgree"}}]
