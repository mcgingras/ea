Such programs will be limited to charities that operate in areas that allow for high effectiveness, and the charity has to be willing to do it of course.</p>\n<p>My first charitable interpretation of the situation was that if a charity has the potential to be highly effective given its cause area and is willing to optimize its effectiveness but still fails to be on par with a top charity in the same area, they must be lacking in something that is hard to obtain, namely specialized knowledge they can get from the top charity. A cooperation between the charities would furthermore serve to thwart wasteful competition between the charities.</p>\n<p>Tara\u2019s experience with nonprofit counseling with Toyota, however, has been that what such charities lacked was not so much this specialized knowledge but general skills in accounting, controlling, and I don\u2019t fully remember what else she mentioned. If the most salient problems of these charities are in such general areas, then a general EA consultancy firm would make sense.</p>\n<p>The services of such a consultancy firm may be highly subsidized from donations, but I think the charity will be more likely to implement advice that it has paid for, and that should also make it easier for the consultancy firm to pay its bills. I haven\u2019t done any calculations, but it feels to me like it will be very hard to keep this sort of operation afloat financially.</p>\n<p>An alternative might be to find an existing, established consultancy firm with knowledge in the area of nonprofits that is ready to advise charities as to how they can maximize impact rather than just fundraising success. An EA funder, a charity, and this company could then agree on prices and a cofunding plan. This will usually involve lots of money, though, since this sort of optimization will be most cost-effective with charities that move a lot of non-EA donations, and those charities will be large and complex.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Telofy"}}, {"_id": "WtWGcpG99wZmPNpsk", "postedAt": "2015-06-24T17:18:29.651Z", "postId": "Ce4pHskhve8XKua7P", "htmlBody": "<p>At the end of the day, the metric will always be the same.

I think it's a plausible hypothesis.</p>\n<p>I'm doubtful that one can make GiveWell charities substantially more effective. Those charities are already using the EA lens.

I think you've summed up my initial idea quite well.</p>\n<p>My assumption is that trying to improve a very effective charity is potentially a lot of work and research, while trying to improve an ineffective but well funded charity, even a little, could require less intense research and have a very large pay-off. Particularly given that there are very few highly effective charities but LOTS of semi-effective, or ineffective ones, meaning there is a larger opportunity. Even if only 10% of non EA charities agree to improve their programs by 1% I believe the potential for overall decrease in suffering is greater.</p>\n<p>There is also the added benefit of signalling. Having an organization that is working to improve effectiveness (despite of funding problems [see Telofy's comment]) shows organizations that donors and community members really care about measuring and improving outcomes. It plants the idea that effectiveness and an EA framework are valuable and worth considering. Even if they don't use the service initially.</p>\n<p>My thought here is this is another way (possibly a very fast one) to spread EA values through the charity world.
