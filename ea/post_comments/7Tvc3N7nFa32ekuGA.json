I'm especially excited about being able to search for posts by chronology. Two notes:<br><br>1. I would like to be able to search for a phrase, rather than just one word, using quotation marks like you can on Google. E.g. When I search \"united nations\" and look by time posted, I get a number of results with just the word \"nations\" and for \"New York City\" I get results for \"new\" and \"city.\" Being able to search with quotation marks around the full phrase would be very useful.<br><br>2. If you do add personalized recommendations to the front page, please only make it a small part of the page and very clear that it is user-specific.
