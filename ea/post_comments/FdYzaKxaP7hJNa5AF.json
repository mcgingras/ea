One of the most frustrating aspects of writing the paper was trying to find <i><strong>externally-credible</strong></i> sources for claims with which I was broadly familiar, rather than links to e.g., EA Forum posts. I think it's good to see the conceptual explainers, but in the future I would very much hope that a <i><strong>heavily time-constrained but AI-safety-conscious staffer</strong></i> can more easily find credible sources for details and arguments such as the analogy to human evolution, historical examples and analyses of discontinuities in technological progress, the scaling hypothesis and forecasts based heavily on compute trends (<i><strong>please, Open Phil, something other than a Google Doc! Like, can't we at least get an Arxiv link?</strong></i>), why alignment may be hard, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>I guess my concern is that as the explainer guides proliferate, it can be harder to find the guides that actually emphasize/provide credible sources... This concern <i>probably</i> doesn't make new guides net negative, but think it could potentially be mitigated, maybe by having clear, up-front links to other explainers which do provide better sources. (Or if there were some spreadsheet/list of \"here are credible sources for X claim, with multiple variant phrasings of X claim,\" that might also be nice...)</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Harrison D"}}, {"_id": "WyEz4jFjyA5nxMqYh", "postedAt": "2023-03-25T19:18:42.520Z", "postId": "FdYzaKxaP7hJNa5AF", "htmlBody": "<p>+1, I would like things like that too.
