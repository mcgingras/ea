I pretty much have the opposite intuition on the extinction vs party example from you, but I think the use of a party may confound people with intuitions against frivolousness or hedonism and is relatively low stakes for existing people. We can imagine cases where what's at stake for existing people seems much more serious: dreams or important life goals, suffering, freedom, spending time with loved ones, their lives (including <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0020174X.2019.1658631\">replacement arguments</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replaceability_argument\">the logic of the larder</a>), and so on. The views you defend here allow all of these to be outweighed by the addition of new people. Furthermore, while there may still be strong instrumental reasons for respecting reproductive freedom regardless (which you've discussed elsewhere), neutrality seems to give a stronger <i>principled</i> reason, since the welfare of a new child wouldn't make up for a parent's overall loss in welfare on its own under any circumstance. Getting the right answer for more principled reasons is more satisfying and on firmer ground.</li><li>In intrapersonal tradeoffs on theories where preferences matter terminally, it fits liberal, pluralistic and anti-paternalistic intuitions better. Under preference views that allow the addition of new contingent preferences to outweigh the lesser satisfaction of necessary preferences (and so violate neutrality with respect to adding satisfied preferences, but in a specific way), and ignoring indirect and instrumental reasons (which of course matter substantially in practice), it would in principle be good <i>for the individual</i> for you to violate any or all of their own existing preferences in order to induce/create and satisfy sufficiently strong new preferences in them. Preference-affecting views \u2014 basically person-affecting views, but treating individual preferences like persons* \u2014 can avoid this problem, and some can avoid \"symmetric\" problems at the same time, e.g. violating preferences to eliminate or prevent frustrated preferences (at least in the cases where it seems worst to do so).</li></ol><p>* although there are more fundamental distinctions we could make if we wanted, e.g. between intrapersonal and interpersonal tradeoffs.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "MichaelStJules"}}, {"_id": "xuDzf8oixSmvmW98L", "postedAt": "2022-09-11T00:04:29.660Z", "postId": "AgQx44vtw5bi4LmBh", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Michael! &nbsp;Thanks for your comments.</p><ol><li>I think my dialectical strategy works similarly against appealing to the Very Repugnant Conclusion to support neutrality. &nbsp;To avoid the intra-personal VRC (compatibly with other commonsense commitments about the harm of death), we'd need a theory that assigns suitably more weight to quality than quantity.

In this way, people with the neutrality intuition may see existence as a person-specific attribute that only people who have that attribute can meaningfully feel grateful about.

In general, I just don't see any person's existence as good, per se. Experiences can be good, and experiences of existent things are usually better than experiences of illusory things. Likewise, actions of people can be good, and actions with good consequences are usually better than actions with merely good intentions. So, decided in terms of experiences or actions, a person can \"be\" good, but that form of \"being\" is really a linguistic shorthand for the person's experiences or actions.</p><p>I wrote:</p><blockquote><p>I cannot do the same calculations in their absence from existence.</p></blockquote><p>and you replied:</p><blockquote><p>Then you would give me a lollipop even at the cost of bringing many miserable new lives into existence. &nbsp;That would clearly be wrong.</p></blockquote><p>I was hoping to get some clarification of the thinking behind some of these thought experiments, and I guess I got some.

There's also a question of whether this has broken (psychological) continuity enough that we shouldn't consider this the same person at all: this case could be more like someone dying and either being replaced by a new person with a happy, flourishing future or just dying and not being replaced at all. Either way, the child has already died.</p><p>If they'd have the same desires/preferences in the future as they had before temporarily losing them, then we can ask if this is due to a causal connection from the child before the temporary loss.

Furthermore, if we think it's better for them to stay alive even if they're indifferent overall, then this still seems paternalistic in a sense, but less objectionably so, and if we're making continuous tradeoffs, too, then there would be cases where we would keep them alive involuntary for their sake and against their wishes.</p><p>There's also the possibility that a preference still continues to count terminally even after it's no longer held, so even after a person dies or their preferences change, but I lean towards rejecting that view.</p>", "parentCommentId": "xuDzf8oixSmvmW98L", "user": {"username": "MichaelStJules"}}, {"_id": "hwyNGgHK8LcyLDYKY", "postedAt": "2022-09-13T13:03:41.967Z", "postId": "AgQx44vtw5bi4LmBh", "htmlBody": "<p>The connection to personal identity is interesting, thanks for flagging that! &nbsp;I'd emphasize two main points in reply:</p><p>(i) While preference continuity is a <i>component</i> of person identity, it isn't clear that it's essential.

By \"intrinsic value\" I do not mean a value that is a property of a person's identity (e.g., a friend) or type (e.g., human).&nbsp;</p><p>Rather, intrinsic value is value that I assign to someone that is value not contingent on whether they serve my interests by the manifestation of that value. For example, some person X might go have a romance with someone else even though I'm also interested in X romantically. That might upset me, but that person X has intrinsic value, so they get to go be romantic with whomever they want instead of me and I still factor them into my moral calculations.&nbsp;</p><p>EDIT: as far as what it means to factor someone into my moral calculations, I mean that I consider the consequences of my actions for them not just in terms of selfish criteria, but also in terms of &nbsp;altruistic or moral criteria.
