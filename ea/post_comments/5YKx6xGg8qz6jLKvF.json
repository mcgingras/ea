That piece is frickin nuts just by virtue of the amount of info they fit into a mere 5 paragraphs. Here's one quote to inspire a read:</p><blockquote><p>The suit alleges that some of world\u2019s largest venture capital firms, including Sequoia Capital, SoftBank Group, and Thoma Bravo, learned through due diligence that FTX was a fraudulent scheme, but nevertheless incited the Fraud with billions in necessary capital, provided guidance and other support critical to the Fraud, and publicly promoted Bankman-Fried and FTX to keep the Fraud concealed until FTX could go public or cash out in a private sale</p></blockquote><p><strong>And of course there was </strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/28/technology/ftx-guilty-plea-fraud.html\"><strong>internal assistance</strong></a>. I'd bet there were both (1) employees who knew what they were doing and (2) employees just following direction without realizing they were committing crimes or aiding in them.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>When it comes to improving models of how the world works</strong>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/f9rFsbsd4rGLQfpQg/sadly-ftx\">Zvi's piece</a> had some good discussion of this (and much more!). It's long, but very worth reading even months later. Here's a section on VC:</p><blockquote><p>If you are a VC investor or taking VC money, the optimal amount of fraud, from your perspective, <i>is not zero. </i>You are <i>more excited </i>to invest if you <i>suspect </i>a fraud, those kinds of founders make good and make dreams real for you. So what if sometimes it all blows up? This is a game of hits for you, and you are much more worried about being asked why you <i>didn\u2019t </i>invest in FTX than you should worry about people asking why you <i>were. </i>This goes double for crypto.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/diviacaroline/status/1592648452240216065\">Notice this VC <i>ready to invest in SBF again if he asked</i></a><i>. </i>Which, from a pure EV perspective, sure why not, same as they invested in Adam Neumann.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, I do not view \u2018the VCs didn\u2019t catch this\u2019 as much of a justification. They are not supposed to catch it. It is not their job to catch it. I mean, they are supposed to do <i>some </i>things to catch <i>this level </i>of fraud, demanding voting shares and a company board in which they have a seat and doing proper audits, <strong>but they got </strong><i><strong>none </strong></i><strong>of that, because [SBF] needed to not allow it and the pitch was so good otherwise they went along (or, they took this to mean \u2018this is a fraud\u2019 and invested anyway thinking </strong><i><strong>they</strong></i><strong> were not the sucker, also plausible). [If] SBF said \u2018you can\u2019t check for fraud, invest or don\u2019t\u2019 then they are doing what they do, as much as we might hate that.</strong> <strong>Better to make that common knowledge. </strong>[emphasis mine]</p><p>The institutional traders are different. They face a different risk profile. If the exchange blows up in 10% of years that is a real drag on returns, whereas a VC expects 80% or more of their investments to go to zero, fraud or otherwise. Why did they trade?</p><p>Some of them Did Not Do the Research, no doubt. Others likely decided it was worth the risk. If FTX is an easy place to make money, because trading is very good against Alameda and generally they treat customers great, and they pay interest on USD and BTC, it is not difficult to imagine a decision that the blowup risk is worth taking, at least for some portion of one\u2019s bankroll. Or one can say that if FTX goes down everything is terrible anyway, it\u2019s already systemic risk, so assume it won\u2019t fail.&nbsp;</p><p>Another play is to hedge the risk with a short position elsewhere, and put your leveraged longs at FTX since if FTX goes broke you would have gotten liquidated at Binance anyway.</p></blockquote><p>[Note: <strong>There could also be a section about lack of regulation here</strong>. As commented on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5YKx6xGg8qz6jLKvF/some-comments-on-the-recent-ftx-time-article?commentId=EuxFYwKqZjGoQ8skf\">here. </a>From a \"how the world works\" POV, it is the mother of all permissiveness that allowed the rest, especially the useless audits. Global heuristic = Pretty nuts how much can go wrong with a regulation gap. But FTX also maybe would have found &nbsp;away around/already did break regulations so idk]&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, just thought that all might interest you. Thank you for sharing your insights. Really useful stuff.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnx8h7zio3j5f\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefx8h7zio3j5f\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Interestingly, now the company has <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilymason/2022/12/15/ftx-accounting-firm-armanino-ends-crypto-audit-practice/?sh=6ba84dea362f\">stopped offering</a> crypto audits due to \"changing market conditions\". And I was going to say \"good of them to notice that the bare legal minimum is not enough for one of the most volatile, least regulated assets the world has ever seen, <i>eyeroll.</i>\" But actually that auditor firm is starting up crypto audits <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/03/01/former-accounting-team-of-ftx-us-auditor-armanino-sets-up-shop-as-the-network-firm/\">again under a different name</a>, sigh. It appears that they only stopped offering crypto audits because some non-crypto clients of the audit firm put pressure on them to do so. Those non-crypto clients felt that the auditor being known to audit crypto, might reduce the trust their potential clients/users end up having in their own commissioned audits. So it appears that, to make sure they can catch the most non-crypto and crypto audit contracts without one segment compromising the other, the auditors are just splitting them under two companies. I didn't see any mention of raising the crypto audit standards.</p><p>Additionally, through this process. I found mention a couple times that there are other auditing firms who do a much better job, \"The big 4\", and it is sort-of business wisdom to downgrade trust in audits that aren't from them. I was very surprised at this! There are auditors that business-people know to trust less? Then why do they exist? I guess because most consumers don't know enough to downgrade trust? One has to wonder if the big 4 would have put their stamp of approval on FTX or even many of this audit firm's non-FTX-clients. Probably not, right? And it makes you wonder why companies would go to these known-worse-auditors, especially if they can afford the best auditing like FTX should have been able to, if they <i>don't </i>have something to hide. If the goal is consumer trust, and a company doesn't have something to hide, that company should go to the best auditors, those that in-the-know-consumers trust the most, right? And surely a \"worse\" audit firm like this one would realize that is how the selection effect cookie crumbles. So lesser-known auditors should <i>expect</i> they will likely get a slew of clients who are nowhere near as reputable as those who hire the big 4 audit firms.&nbsp;</p><p>Sooo I think it's easy to argue that the minor audit firm(s) are negligent or intentionally turning a blind eye somewhere in their business model. But it's more a problem of incentives of corporate America and <i>low federal standards for private corporations allowing those incentives to play out in auditing contracts</i>, than it is a problem of a single actor. Even though the single actor/auditor might know damn well that they <i>will</i> end up giving a scammer cover eventually, maybe even frequently among their really wealthy clients like FTX who could have afforded better-known services. It appears to be part of the business model, chronic not acute. And as long as the private corporation and auditor are following the law in reviewing the bare minimum, oh well?</p></div></li></ol>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Ivy_Mazzola"}}, {"_id": "uAjhCvnA9iWyh7nys", "postedAt": "2023-03-21T01:21:31.052Z", "postId": "5YKx6xGg8qz6jLKvF", "htmlBody": "<p>Eh, I still agree with Ben here.
