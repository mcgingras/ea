I assume there are plenty of people like me and plenty of people like Chris, though I don\u2019t know the distribution.</p>\n<p>Because EA includes people with a variety of values, uniformity of trust in just 2-3  individuals should not to be expected. That said, if someone could hire Ben to be a more trusted CH rep to the people who do trust him more, I\u2019m sure they would. If we could do that for all the sub-communities in EA, we likely would.

Some of this ambiguity is intrinsic to our work, but some is not, and I would like people to have a better sense of what to expect from us, especially as our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CAC8zn292C9T5aopw/community-health-and-special-projects-updates-and-contacting-1\"><u>strategy develops</u></a>. I'd like to give some thoughts here that hopefully give some clarity, and we might communicate more about how we see our role in the future.</p><p>For a high level description of our work: We aim to address problems that could prevent the effective altruism community from fulfilling its potential for impact. That looks like: taking seriously problems with the culture, and problems from individuals or organizations; hearing and addressing concerns about interpersonal or organizational issues (primarily done by our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/community-health/contact-us\"><u>community liaisons</u></a>); thinking about community-wide problems and gaps and occasionally trying to fill those; and advising various actors in the EA space based on the information and expertise we have. This work allows us to address specific problems, be aware of concerning actors, and give advice to help the community do its best work.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Context on our responses</i></p><p>Sometimes we have significant constraints on what we can do and say that result in us being unable to share our complete perspective (or any perspective at all). Sometimes that is because people have requested that we keep some or all information about them confidential, including what actions our team has taken. Sometimes it is because us weighing in will increase public discussion that could be harmful to some or all of the people involved. This information asymmetry can be particularly tricky when someone else in the community shares some information about a situation that we think is inaccurate or is only a small part of the picture, but we\u2019re not in a position to correct it. I\u2019m sorry for how frustrating this can be.<br><br>I imagine this might end up being relevant to responses to this comment (and which and how and when we respond to them), so I think it\u2019s useful to highlight.&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019ll also flag that many of our staff are at events for the next two weeks, so it might be an especially slow time for Community Health responses.</p><p><i>About what to expect</i></p><ol><li>I think some of the disagreements here come from different understanding of what the Community Health team\u2019s mission is or should be. We want to hear and (where possible) address problems in the community, at the interpersonal, organizational, and community levels. But we often won\u2019t resolve a situation to the satisfaction of everyone involved, or do everything that would be helpful for individuals who were harmed. Ben mentions people \u201choping that it [Community Health] will pursue justice for them.\u201d I want to be totally upfront that we don\u2019t see pursuing justice as our mission (and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve claimed to). In the same vein, protecting people from bullies is sometimes a part of our work, and something we\u2019d always like to be able to do, but it\u2019s not our primary goal and sadly, we won\u2019t always be able to do it.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We don\u2019t want people to have a false impression of what they can expect from talking to us.<ul><li>Sometimes people come to us with a picture of what they\u2019d like to happen, but we won\u2019t always take the steps they hope we\u2019ll take, either because 1) we don\u2019t agree that those steps are the right call, 2) we\u2019re not willing to take the steps based on the information we have (for example if we don\u2019t have their permission to ask for the other person\u2019s side of the story), or 3) the costs (time, legal risk etc) are too great. We generally explain our considerations to the people involved, but could probably communicate better about this publicly, and as we continue thinking about strategic changes, we\u2019ll want to give people an accurate picture of what to expect.&nbsp;</li><li>(At other times people come to us without specific steps they\u2019d like us to take. Sometimes they think something should be done, but don\u2019t know what is feasible, other times they share information as \u201cI don\u2019t think this is very bad and don\u2019t want much to be done, but I thought you should know and be able to look for patterns\u201d, which can be quite helpful.)</li><li>We talk about confidentiality and what actions we might be able to take by default in calls. Typically this results in people deciding to go forward with working with us, but some people might decide that what we\u2019re likely to be able to provide isn\u2019t a good match for their situation.</li></ul></li><li>I don't think the downside of a false sense of security people might get from our team's existence is strong enough to counteract the benefits.</li><li>It\u2019s true that we rarely write up our findings publicly. I don\u2019t take that as damning since I don\u2019t think that is or should be the default expectation. I think public writeups can be a valuable tool in some cases, but often there are good reasons to use other tools instead.&nbsp;<ul><li>One main reason is the large amount of time they take \u2014 Ben pointed out that he didn\u2019t necessarily endorse how much time this project took him, but that it was really hard to do less.</li></ul></li><li>I agree with Ben that we aren\u2019t the EA police. We have some levers we can pull related to advising on a number of decisions, and we do our best to use these to address problems and concerns. I think describing occasions that we use the information we have as \u201crare\u201d is very much not reflective of the reality of our day-to-day work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>I\u2019m sad to read in some comments that we didn\u2019t satisfy people\u2019s needs or wants in those situations. I\u2019m very open to receiving feedback, concerns or complaints in my capacity as a manager on the team - feel free to message me on the forum or email&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:chana.messinger@centreforeffectivealtruism.org\"><u>me</u></a> (including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLnp5LVp0WwCOVKDHEZwh-5NPHz-ZwJEqsMe_Z38MPO8tUEg/viewform\"><u>anonymously</u></a>). I recognize someone not wanting to talk to the Community Health team might not want to share feedback with that same team, but I want the offer available for anyone who might. You can also send feedback to CEA interim CEO Ben West&nbsp;<a href=\"https://admonymous.co/xodarap\"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp;<ul><li>I also think not feeling satisfied with our actions is plausibly a normal outcome even if everything is going well - sometimes the best available choice won\u2019t make everyone (or anyone) happy. I definitely want people to come in expecting that they might not end up happy with our choices (though I think in many cases they are).&nbsp;</li><li>Again, if people think we\u2019re making wrong calls, I\u2019m interested to hear about it. Under some circumstances we can also re-review cases.</li></ul></li></ol><p><i>Regarding trust</i></p><ol><li>We're aware that some people might feel hesitant to talk to us (and of course, it\u2019s entirely up to them). There are many understandable reasons for this (even if our team was flawless). Our team isn\u2019t flawless, though, which means there are likely additional cases where people don\u2019t want to talk to us, which I\u2019m sad about. I don\u2019t know how much of a problem this is.</li><li>In particular, we are worried to hear that some people didn\u2019t feel that they\u2019d be treated with respect (I can\u2019t tell if they mean by our team or the general institutional network we\u2019re a part of, or something else). In this case, it sounds like potentially they aren\u2019t confident we\u2019d handle their information well or treat them respectfully. If that is what they meant, that sounds like a bad (and potentially stressful) situation and I\u2019m really sorry to hear about it. I could imagine there being a concerning pattern around this that we should prioritize learning about and working on. If at any point people wanted to share information on the reasons they wouldn\u2019t talk to us, I\u2019m interested (including anonymously -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/community-health/contact-us\"><u>here for the community liaisons</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdLnp5LVp0WwCOVKDHEZwh-5NPHz-ZwJEqsMe_Z38MPO8tUEg/viewform\"><u>here</u></a> for me personally and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://admonymous.co/xodarap%20Away\"><u>here</u></a> for Ben West, interim CEO of CEA).</li><li>People might also worry that we\u2019d negatively update our perception of them if they were implicated in something. (This is one of the reasons people might not want to speak to us that might be implied by this post, though I am not at all sure this is what was meant). I don\u2019t currently think we should have a strict policy of amnesty for any concerning information people provide about themselves, though we in fact try hard to not make people regret talking to us. (Strict amnesty of that kind would probably result in less of us doing things about issues we hear about and make Ben\u2019s concerns worse rather than better, though I haven\u2019t gone and researched this question.)</li><li>In general, we care a lot about not making people regret speaking to us and not pressuring people to do or share more than they're comfortable with. These are big elements of why we sometimes do less than we\u2019d like, since we don\u2019t want to take actions they\u2019re not comfortable with, or push them to stay involved in a situation they\u2019d like to be done with, or to do anything that would cause them to be worried we might inadvertently deanonymize them.</li><li>My general sense (though of course there are selection effects here) is that people who talk to our team in person or on calls about our decision making often end up happier and finding us largely reasonable. I haven\u2019t figured out how to do that at scale e.g. in public writing.<br>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Thanks all for your thoughts and feedback.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "ChanaMessinger"}}, {"_id": "Jzvwj8ibH364NW7Rd", "postedAt": "2023-09-20T20:08:27.747Z", "postId": "5dW9p5EahtfhdiSKF", "htmlBody": "<p>In case you missed it, and you're interested.

We haven't talked about this post, but that's going to be affecting my thinking.</li><li>She's also, in my view (which you can discount if you like), unusually capable of deep thinking about difficult tradeoffs, which made the comment expressing skepticism about CH's depth particularly grating.</li><li>More generally, I've seen several people I consider friends recently put substantial effort into publicly communicating their reasoning about difficult decisions, and be rewarded for this effort with unhelpful criticism.</li><li>All that is to say that I'm probably not best placed to impartially evaluate comments like this, but at the end of the day I re-read it and it still feels like what happened is someone responded to Chana saying \"our top priority is X\" with \"it seems possible that Y might be good\", and I called that uncharitable because I'm really, <i>really</i> sure that that possibility has not escaped her notice.</li></ul><p><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "2NLGqBsWDMaxdQTd2", "user": {"username": "alexrjl"}}, {"_id": "aPWyi6JXrXa5nryoH", "postedAt": "2023-09-22T22:47:17.312Z", "postId": "5dW9p5EahtfhdiSKF", "htmlBody": "<p>Your reply contains a very strong and in my view, highly incorrect read, and says I am far too judgemental and critical.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>rhetorical move of criticising someone who says their top priority is X for not caring at all about Y.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Please review my comment again.</p><ol><li>I'm simply pointing to a practice or principle common in many orgs, companies, startups &nbsp;and teams to have principles and flow from them, in addition to \"maximizing EV\" or \"maximizing profits\".
