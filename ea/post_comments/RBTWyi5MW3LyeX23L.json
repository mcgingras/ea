Two comments.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Could you explain your Impact-Adjusted Significant Plan Changes to those of us who don't understand the system? E.g What does an &quot;rated-1000&quot; plan change look like and how does that compare to a &quot;rated-1&quot;? I imagine the former is something like a top maths bod going from working on nothing to working on AI safety but that's just my assumption. I really don't know what these mean in practice, so some illustrative examples would be nice.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Following comments made by others about CEA's somewhat self-flagellatory review, it seems a bit odd and unnecessarily self-critical to describe something as a challenge if you've conscious chosen to de-prioritise it.
