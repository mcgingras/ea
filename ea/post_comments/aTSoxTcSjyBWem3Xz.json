The engagement measure refers to <i>attending</i> EA Global, but not whether EA Global was <i>important for getting involved</i>. So, in theory, it's possible for people to attend EAG but not select it as important for getting them involved. If people who attended EAG didn't report it being important for them getting involved, increasing the association between engagement and attending EAG would not help the association between engagement and reporting EAG being important.</li><li>Although EAG is mentioned as an example in the scale, it's possible to be highly engaged but not attend EAG (around just over 45% of highly engaged respondents had not attended EAG, or to attend EAG but not be highly engaged (around 31.6% of EAG attendees). This is using 2020 data, since we did not ask about EAG attendance this year.</li><li>You mention \"being a member of a group\", but \"regularly attending events at a local group\" is given as an example of Moderate engagement, which would fall below High engagement in the binary categorisation we use in these analyses.</li><li>Similarly, engaging with \"articles, videos, podcasts, discussions, or events on effective altruism\" and \"subscribing to the 80,000 Hours podcast\" are mentioned as examples in the same level of the engagement scale, but we do not observe comparably large bumps for these factors. [Edit] However, we <i>do</i> observe large effects for other factors which aren't mentioned in the definition of the scales (e.g. personal contacts).</li><li>I'd also add that many more EAs (both highly engaged and less engaged, though more among the highly engaged than the less engaged) have undertaken activities such as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/z73rJbz8PNi7aFfsW/ea-survey-2019-series-engagement-levels#Activities_and_engagement\">read an EA book</a> (2019 data) than have attended EAG or attended a local group. So, one might expect that even greater numbers in both of these groups would report that a book was important for getting them involved. But we don't observe this, EA groups are still cited as important considerably more frequently than EA books, despite fewer EAs having encountered them.</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": "JKSKuJmsjhZAeinxT", "user": {"username": "David_Moss"}}, {"_id": "rmKwiPmrPejEpF4uM", "postedAt": "2023-07-22T00:36:21.090Z", "postId": "aTSoxTcSjyBWem3Xz", "htmlBody": "<p>What was the recruitment method for this study?

In particular, we recruit many more people who are moderately-highly engaged (levels 3-5), and very few with lower engagement (e.g. have read EA materials for a few hours). I think this makes perfect sense, since we would expect people who are more engaged with the community to be more likely to take the survey.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvi5uv5n5im\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvi5uv5n5im\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Given this, you would likely want to consult the analyses we provide on differences between low/high engagement respondents to get a sense of the differences. Unfortunately, there's no way to simply weight the results to get around this (as we could if we were doing a representative survey of the US public, for example), due to the simple fact that no-one knows what the real composition is of the full EA population including those with low engagement with EA.</p><p>The other area where recruitment methods are particularly significant is where the referrers to the survey are also categories of interest in the survey questions. For example, as we have discussed before, 80,000 Hours is a large referrer to the survey, which may influence responses to questions which mention 80K. In last year's post, we therefore conducted an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tzFcqGmCA6ePeD5wm/ea-survey-2020-how-people-get-involved-in-ea#Sampling_Referrer_Adjustment\">additional analysis</a>, where we found that removing 80K-referred people, lowered the proportion of people selecting 80,000 Hours, though still let them among the most important sources (moving them from 50.7% to 45% of respondents). As we noted in that post though, simply looking at the proportion who were <i>not </i>referred to the survey from 80K (or other factor) is likely to be a wild over-correction for the fact that people influenced by that factor were more likely to be referred to the survey from that factor.</p><p>If there's sufficient demand we could potentially produce another post looking at similar analyses, though my impression is that when we did so for last year's EAS there wasn't significant interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnvi5uv5n5im\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefvi5uv5n5im\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Though, as we note in the linked post, in practice, people may be primarily interested in the responses of those who are at least moderately engaged.
