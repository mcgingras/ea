The report provides an overview of different types of GUV and outlines crucial considerations for grantmakers and policymakers. Additionally, we suggest potential \u201cimpact multipliers,\u201d or features of the world that can guide effective giving under uncertainty about the cost-effectiveness of different interventions. Note that this report is scoped to focus specifically on GUV; for a comparison of other indoor air quality interventions, we recommend the recent report <i>Air Safety to Combat Global Catastrophic Biorisk</i>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz41b1z1ifs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz41b1z1ifs\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Our report is a cross-worldview investigation \u2014 Rosie Bettle\u2019s research usually focuses on current generations and global health interventions, while Christian Ruhl\u2019s research usually focuses on global catastrophic risks. <strong>GUV could have benefits both for a near-term reduction in the global burden of disease and for the prevention and mitigation of future catastrophic pandemics</strong>.</p><p>UV light has long been used for its germicidal effects,&nbsp;for instance for water treatment.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefixn1lymfin\"><sup><a href=\"#fnixn1lymfin\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A less well-known application of UV light, until recently, is for airborne disease transmission reduction; UV light (of the appropriate wavelengths) can inactivate pathogens, rendering them unable to replicate and cause infection. However, some wavelengths of UV light are damaging to skin and eyes\u2014meaning that these UV sanitization systems need to either avoid direct contact with people, or must be of a sufficiently short wavelength such that the UV cannot penetrate the outer surface of people\u2019s skin and eyes. We review different types of GUV systems and wavelengths to determine whether funding this space could be impactful. On installation types:</p><ul><li><strong>Full-room UV systems</strong>, where light is shone throughout the room. Far-UVC full room systems take advantage of recent developments in our understanding of which wavelengths can be safely used in occupied settings to inactivate pathogens.</li><li><strong>Upper-room UV systems</strong>, which have been used for decades and rely on air flow in the room to circulate air upwards, where viral particles within the air are inactivated by the UV light.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref400lshd5rd\"><sup><a href=\"#fn400lshd5rd\">[3]</a></sup></span></li><li><strong>In-duct UV systems</strong>, where the air is sanitized by UV light as it passes through an HVAC system, as well as <strong>portable GUV systems</strong>, which function similarly to in-duct systems.</li></ul><p>On wavelengths:</p><ul><li><strong>Conventional UVC</strong>&nbsp;of 254 nm light, which has a long history of (upper room) deployment, but is damaging to human eyes and skin.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhwkbcv1bxjh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhwkbcv1bxjh\">[4]</a></sup></span></li><li>\u201c<strong>Far-UVC\u201d</strong>&nbsp;between 200-235 nm, which has some advantages and a potentially high upside as well as remaining uncertainties around safety.</li></ul><p>We find evidence that GUV is a potentially impactful intervention towards improving indoor air quality that could reduce the transmission of pathogens and consequent pandemic risk (including for bioengineered pathogens); one recent analysis suggested that outfitting US public buildings with these systems could reduce overall population transmission of respiratory viruses between 30% and 75% (N.B., more research is needed on real-world estimates of transmission reduction, as discussed below, and there are large uncertainties surrounding such estimates).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7huvixv2jjv\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7huvixv2jjv\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; In turn, air quality improvement appears to have been relatively neglected by mainstream funders such as government bodies and science funders, perhaps due to a historical belief that airborne transmission was not a key transmission route of respiratory disease.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft0vh84zyex\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt0vh84zyex\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Hence, we believe this cause area is promising for effective philanthropy.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnt0yek3l85h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnt0yek3l85h\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><p>We then compare the different GUV systems (full-room, upper room, and in-duct systems) and wavelengths (far-UVC and conventional GUV), focusing on&nbsp;safety and efficacy. We are optimistic about the potential of far-UVC technology and its large upside especially for extreme pandemic events, and find that existing evidence suggests that this technology may have advantages for a wide range of applications. Nonetheless, we believe that more safety studies are needed both to reduce real uncertainties (especially with regards to eye damage, long-term exposure effects, effects on vulnerable populations, and uncovering unknown risks) and to bolster public confidence. In addition, a key uncertainty of far-UVC technology is its potential to <i>increase</i>&nbsp;indoor air pollution\u2014these externalities and the necessary measures to mitigate them may push against future cost-effectiveness of far-UVC technology. Moreover, although GUV technology is highly effective at reducing the amount of airborne pathogens, it remains unknown how well such reduction translates into disease transmission reduction, and how far-UVC differs from 254 nm GUV in different contexts (e.g. there are some theoretical reasons to believe that far-UVC may be especially useful for certain extreme events).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8sox6rsnjr4\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8sox6rsnjr4\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<strong>We are therefore wary of over-hyping far-UVC technology over other indoor air quality interventions</strong>, especially existing GUV technology. Bearing in mind that existing GUV technology (such as 254 nm upper room systems) are already fairly effective, we argue that philanthropists should favor \u201cwavelength-agnostic\u201d advocacy rather than advocating for a specific UV system&nbsp;or wavelength\u2014we don\u2019t think the evidence for superiority of far-UVC is sufficiently strong as of late 2023 as to outweigh the risks of focusing specifically upon this technology, and potentially locking in inferior technology or turning the public against <i>all</i>&nbsp;GUV&nbsp;by rushing far-UVC deployment. Either way, we emphasize that \u2014 contrary to some public portrayals \u2014 <strong>GUV of any kind will not be a silver bullet for pandemics, but should be thought of as one potentially powerful tool in the health security toolbox</strong>, as part of a varied and layered defense.</p><p>We then identify specific impact multipliers within this space, with the aim of identifying promising funding opportunities. These include (1) leveraging societal resources via advocacy, since very large resources will be needed to roll out GUV technology (and we think it is possible that government funding bodies might move to produce more funding here), (2) focusing on high-income countries first, where there are already resources to potentially develop and use these technologies, (3) shaping research and design incentives (since there is a commercial interest here, we think it might be possible to promote private sector investment and therefore minimize the amount of philanthropic money needed), and (4) focusing on public perception over rapid deployment. With regards to the last point, we think there is a risk that (if GUV is rolled out poorly) public backlash might prevent the deployment of GUV for a very long time, perhaps when pandemic risk is higher than at present. With these impact multipliers in mind, we identify several potential funding opportunities; funding journalists to write about GUV (thereby potentially influencing fund managers and policy makers, and increasing public acceptance of GUV)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9p3onojja0u\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9p3onojja0u\">[9]</a></sup></span>, funding public advocacy groups, shaping market incentives to promote private sector research, and directly funding safety and efficacy studies. Our top recommendation is <strong>advocacy to leverage societal funds for large-scale research programs on real-world GUV pathogen transmission reduction.</strong></p><p>Overall, we think this is a promising area and recommend proceeding to investigate potential funding opportunities within this space.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Disclaimers and Acknowledgments</strong></i></p><p><i>The report was informed by semi-structured interviews of experts in UV germicidal irradiation.

As air circulates to the top of the room, airborne pathogens are continuously inactivated by the GUV light.

Interventions that seek to reduce the transmission of dangerous pathogens could therefore have high expected value from multiple worldviews.

Indoor air quality is typically measured in air changes per hour (ACH); a calculation of how many times per hour the entire volume of air in a given space is replaced with supply or recirculated air. With a higher number of air changes per hour, the number of pathogens in the air decreases (as the pathogens are circulated out of the room); in a well-mixed room, each air change represents a reduction of around 63% in this pathogen load (whether the well-mixed assumption holds true in various scenarios is unclear).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefetnf7oxl7yl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnetnf7oxl7yl\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The relationship between pathogen load and infection rate is complex, but we can also expect infection rate to decrease with pathogen load; we explore this relationship further in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTOgiSlrUvvnMM7XJStk3ZK9VBbfqNTCKFsVU9liM3ZcAfvADlx77c9lm3hKQSuWSNVInEOz06im6me/pub#h.8sfklgwnnfy5\"><u>efficacy section</u></a>.</p><p>In this report, we focus on air quality in high income countries.

An unoccupied room (like a surgery room after the patient and surgeons have left) can be easily irradiated in this way. In an occupied room, however, constant exposure to some wavelengths of UVC light&nbsp;can damage human skin and eyes, as explained in greater detail below. This makes occupied full-room irradiation with 254 nm&nbsp;UVC light&nbsp;unsafe, and unlikely to be adopted even if the pandemic-prevention benefits outweighed the skin damage.

As illustrated in the figure below, however, this means that only a fraction of the room is directly irradiated. The human-occupied zone, however, is also the zone where transmission occurs. Therefore, upper-room irradiation alone is not enough; some air movement towards the irradiated zone is required (e.g. by good air flow design, fans, air purifiers, and HVAC \u2014 and potentially from the radiant heat of human bodies and other human activity).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo8gce16043\"><sup><a href=\"#fno8gce16043\">[41]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The complexities of this are discussed in greater detail below.</p><h2>In-Duct GUV</h2><p>A third&nbsp;kind of GUV is known as \u201cin-duct GUV,\u201d and sometimes HVAC irradiation (although portable systems can also serve this function). In-duct GUV has the advantage of being able to use higher intensities of UV light, because humans are not exposed to the light.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp4x5o1mh3m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp4x5o1mh3m\">[42]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As with upper-room irradiation, this form of GUV requires good airflow.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref09pwmqnfif6i\"><sup><a href=\"#fn09pwmqnfif6i\">[43]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Most importantly, in-duct GUV is rate-limited and often further away from the site of infection. Experts we spoke with therefore believe that <strong>in-duct GUV is likely in a class far below full-room and upper-room GUV in terms of effectiveness</strong>.&nbsp;For this reason, most of this report does not discuss HVAC systems.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In general, in-duct GUV performs a different function from the other types of GUV, however, and may therefore be useful in <i>some </i>situations. For example, in situations where recirculation occurs, where transmission between rooms occurs via HVAC systems (e.g. in&nbsp;hotels), or where pathogens enter from the outside (as mold and fungi might).

GUV does not require this, and therefore intervenes more asymmetrically on pandemic risk.</li><li><strong>GUV does not require individual behavior changes</strong>&nbsp;\u2014 many biosecurity interventions require changing the behavior of individuals (convincing people to wear masks, to get vaccinated, etc.). As a \u201cpassive defense\u201d GUV does not require this, as it simply disinfects a space as people go about their everyday lives.</li><li><strong>GUV can be a set-it-and-forget-it</strong> <strong>intervention</strong>&nbsp;\u2014 Pandemic preparedness follows cycles of attention and neglect, and societal responses to a newly identified pathogen can be sluggish. &nbsp;This suggests prioritizing interventions that do not require continued societal investment. Requiring GUV in building codes now could beneficially \u201clock in\u201d improved biosecurity in a way that reliance on social distancing measures or continued vaccine uptake does not.</li><li>Notably, there are also scenarios where additional GUV capacity could be installed in times of crisis, e.g. where the public tolerates the risk-benefit calculus of higher doses in order to respond to especially dangerous outbreaks. For these cases, stockpiling may be a useful intervention.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefblyo95wguoj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnblyo95wguoj\">[48]</a></sup></span></li></ol><p>What does GUV do that existing indoor air quality interventions (ventilation and filtration) do not?

Note that it is harder to &nbsp;test for impacts upon the eye ex-vivo, since the eye is an integrated and moving system that is difficult to replicate (e.g. with tear film, blinking, etc).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefysoj9ri8vxq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnysoj9ri8vxq\">[62]</a></sup></span></li></ol></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Of relevance to both skin and eye safety, there is now one ongoing real-world study in Nova Scotia.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3v7jnhrk34s\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3v7jnhrk34s\">[63]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Residents of two elderly care homes will be cluster-randomized to be in either a neighborhood with newly installed far-UVC lighting, versus a neighborhood with placebo lights that do not have any far-UVC capacity.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqiu267f6g2i\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqiu267f6g2i\">[64]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1sja9mqg8kg\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1sja9mqg8kg\">[65]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; While this study is primarily aimed at effectiveness (the primary outcome is whether diagnoses of respiratory viruses decline in communities that use far-UVC light), the researchers will also examine the health of the residents. Note that since the residents are elderly, the relative importance of carcinogenic exposure is presumably lessened (since these effects would take many years to appear). Consequently, we think this study is an important part of research into real-world effects, but believe much more work is needed, and note that the data will not be able to answer the question of whether long-term exposure to far-UVC increases the risk of conditions such as cataracts.</p><p><strong>NB: </strong>Ultimately, the usefulness of this particular study will depend greatly on study design (e.g. whether it accounts for the movement of workers, whether it is powered appropriately, etc.). We understand that there have been recent modifications to the study design, and parts of the description above may be outdated. More on this study can be found in Dr. Rockwood\u2019s presentation <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dybvj9lKLxmQ\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><h2>Additional Safety&nbsp;Concerns</h2><h3><strong>Ozone Production</strong></h3><p>We also briefly considered whether UV light sources could pose health risks through production of ozone. We found that the lamps used to produce 254nm light (used for upper room GUV and in-duct irradiation) are typically low-pressure mercury lamps, which do not produce ozone.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmvkruz5jqvc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmvkruz5jqvc\">[66]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In comparison, the current lamps that are used to produce far-UVC light (KrCl lamps) can produce ozone. Moreover, although the amount of ozone that low power KrCl lamps produce appears to be fairly small, far from recommended limits for ozone concentrations in rooms, these limits are somewhat arbitrary and depending on the shape of the curve of ozone concentration to harms, even low concentrations may present health risks.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvbrqkyp71xa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvbrqkyp71xa\">[67]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It is possible that certain high-power KrCl lamps will produce an amount of ozone that is a risk to health. Research and design advancements may reduce this problem (i.e. through advancements in far-UVC lamp technology that are already required due to various engineering problems; see section below). On balance, even with technological improvements, however, we remain concerned about the ozone generation problem.</p><h3><strong>Indoor Air Pollution</strong></h3><p>One concern sometimes raised about GUV is that UV lamps could create indoor air pollution by breaking down compounds in the air into secondary chemicals that have negative effects on human health. We consider this a <strong>potential crucial consideration</strong>&nbsp;when evaluating GUV as an intervention, given the large negative effects of air pollution, as outlined in Founders Pledge\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/air-pollution%23:~:text%3DWe%2520recommend%2520that%2520individuals%2520and,most%2520affectable%2520sources%2520of%2520PM2.\"><u>report on air pollution</u></a>.</p><p>One study suggests that both 222nm and 254nm light can create such pollutants but that \u201cthese products do not necessarily have significant negative effects on human health because of their relatively low concentrations.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoe1x1e8hey\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoe1x1e8hey\">[68]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This study caused a stir&nbsp;in December 2022 (and continues to), however, as it was accompanied by a Twitter thread and Substack post by one of the co-authors (Jimenez) that suggested that the particulate matter health effects (like increasing lung cancer rates) might be of a similar magnitude as the COVID-death-reduction effects.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhb2gyp7863\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhb2gyp7863\">[69]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>The BOTEC in the Substack post&nbsp;only focused on deaths avoided from COVID and flu, not on the potential total benefit to reducing airborne pathogen transmission in general (the full paper was <a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.estlett.3c00314\"><u>recently published</u></a>). Moreover, Jimenez assumes a linear reduction in deaths without justifying this assumption: \u201cLet\u2019s assume that GUV was installed in 1% of indoor spaces in the US, potentially avoiding 1% of those deaths, or about 1300 deaths per year.\u201d It is not obvious that this assumption holds. If we believe, for example, that airborne transmission happens in part through \u201csuperspreader\u201d events, for example, then installing GUV in 1% of indoor spaces, <i>with a focus on high-transmission areas</i>&nbsp;(schools, airports, etc.) could have a much greater impact than 1% reduction in deaths when counting the knock-on effects of preventing further infections. Viruses are contagious; air pollution is not. In a deeper investigation, we could attempt to calculate this and gain a better understanding of the potential trade-offs.</p><p>Moreover, the study simply used an open-source chemical simulator to run a computer model of these effects.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjljnsferu6f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjljnsferu6f\">[70]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We are therefore uncertain about whether the inputs and assumptions of the model have \u201creal world\u201d external validity; in particular, we wonder whether many places where far-UVC light could be used might already have air ventilation measures in places, and how much the input assumptions about the composition of indoor air drive the results.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzuffgtzfm2\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzuffgtzfm2\">[71]</a></sup></span></p><p>Interestingly, insofar as we believe the results of the study, they suggest that air pollution is a greater factor in low-ventilation environments for far-UVC 222 nm light than for 254 nm light.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyo25fd93rbg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyo25fd93rbg\">[72]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This is due to the specific photochemistry of 222 nm light; photons in the 222 nm light are more able to photolyze (break down) oxygen in the air to create ozone, relative to the 254 nm light.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefic22j69sy9s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnic22j69sy9s\">[73]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd7ar6twagnd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd7ar6twagnd\">[74]</a></sup></span></p><p>This suggests that <strong>smog-creation may be much more of a factor for far-UVC than for upper-room GUV</strong>, further increasing our uncertainty about far-UVC\u2019s safety.&nbsp;The extent to which this affects real-world applications remains an open question. Some potential use cases for far-UVC technology \u2014 such as airports and other public spaces \u2014 already have existing mechanical air purification and ventilation technology, for example, such that we are uncertain on how much of a problem indoor air pollution will ultimately be. Moreover, not all spaces have the same amount of volatile organic compounds that figure into these issues. This may be important as some compounds related to cleaning products may be higher in spaces where air disinfection would be particularly useful (e.g. hospitals).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9n37o62fdyc\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9n37o62fdyc\">[75]</a></sup></span></p><h3><strong>Skin Microbiome</strong></h3><p>The skin\u2019s microbiome contains millions of bacteria, fungi and viruses, which play a role in the protection against invading pathogens, the education of our immune system and the breakdown of natural products.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdxmfbyigsf5\"><sup><a href=\"#fndxmfbyigsf5\">[76]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Some authors have suggested that far-UVC light might disrupt the skin\u2019s microbiota.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefynaacurbwhd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnynaacurbwhd\">[77]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;While we think that further data examining this would be helpful, there are several reasons that we expect that this is unlikely to be a significant problem. First, far-UVC cannot reach within pores or other areas where light cannot reach (such as wrinkles). Given that the pores contain much of the skin\u2019s microbiome, we think this limits the impact of far-UVC upon the skin\u2019s microbiome\u2014affected areas of skin can be recolonised from microbes within these areas. Perhaps more obviously, much of the human body is covered in clothing when humans occupy public spaces. Secondly, existing research examining the effect of handwashing and antimicrobial hand gels on the hand\u2019s microbiomes have generally found small effects.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyvjpye6p86i\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyvjpye6p86i\">[78]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><h2>Overall view on safety</h2><p>Overall, we estimate a ~85% chance&nbsp;that there are no health risks from far-UVC which, once uncovered, will be severe enough to prevent or halt the scale-up of this technology. We update on the mechanistic evidence\u2014although we think there is a possibility of unknown unknowns\u2014and the existing experimental evidence. One of the primary reasons that we are not 100% confident is that we think it is possible that subgroups of people (such as old people with fragile skin/ eyes, or those who are prone to sunburn) might experience harm from far-UVC, whose reaction might not have been captured from the existing work with skin cells. In addition, it is possible that there are health effects from long-term exposure to far-UVC (such as risk of cataracts). Further, we note that there will need to be a series of safety trials prior to large-scale&nbsp;societal acceptance of this technology in Europe/ UK/ US. We think this technology is therefore at least a few years away from this kind of societal acceptance, which may make it more difficult to find current funding opportunities (with the possible exception of funding or incentivizing safety work).</p><p>Certain kinds of use cases could reduce safety concerns. For example, Max G\u00f6rlitz has suggested that UVC systems could be outfitted with two possible \u201cmodes:\u201d business-as-usual and emergency.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1mwfwgz8xjq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1mwfwgz8xjq\">[79]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Emergency mode could be activated when the benefits of suppressing an ongoing severe respiratory pandemic clearly outweigh potential safety costs. In addition to the problems that G\u00f6rlitz mentions (e.g. that businesses have no incentives to build expensive rarely-used capabilities into their units) we have two concerns with this proposal. First, business-as-usual mode might forego many of the passive defense benefits against \u201cstealthy\u201d pathogens mentioned throughout this report. Second, there may be strong public backlash against the use of \u201cemergency mode\u201d if that mode is specifically framed as having unknown safety effects.</p><h2>Additional Risks</h2><h3><strong>Public Reaction Considerations</strong></h3><p>Nearly everyone we spoke to about GUV raised the problem of public reaction to UVC technology. For decades, the public has been told that UV radiation is dangerous and must be avoided to avoid cancer \u2014 how do we tell them now that \u201cactually, this specific kind of UV light is safe, and we want to install it in public spaces?\u201d The apparent vaccine hesitancy and resistance to other pandemic prevention measures (masks, social distancing) during the COVID-19 pandemic also suggests that public communication about risk reduction measures is difficult. &nbsp;In one case, accidental exposure to 254 nm UVC light in a Northern African health system caused public outcry such that recently-installed lights were immediately shut off again.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkckvws7mwqp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkckvws7mwqp\">[80]</a></sup></span></p><p>Some preliminary survey evidence from late 2022 suggests:<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref378qriwhqwi\"><sup><a href=\"#fn378qriwhqwi\">[81]</a></sup></span></p><ul><li>There is generally low awareness of GUV, and specifically of far-UVC light;</li><li>Survey respondents had generally favorable attitudes towards GUV;</li><li>There was \u201cno statistically significant difference in support when using terms that mention UV vs don\u2019t mention UV\u201d</li></ul><p>Moreover, contrary to belief that the direct contact of full-room far-UVC light with human skin would make people more likely to support upper-room GUV, the survey found that \u201crespondents consistently showed slightly greater support for far-UVC over upper-room UVC.\u201d As the investigators note, however, these responses were likely biased by the framing of the survey, which describes UVC in terms that understate remaining uncertainties (control framing):</p><p>\u201cSome types of germicidal UV light can be harmful to the eyes or skin if people are directly exposed to them. If this kind of light were used in buildings, it would need to be set up in ways that did not directly expose humans to the light, but would still clean germs in the air (e.g., through installing the lights in air ducts, or in the upper part of a room (called upper room UVC), where they clean circulating air). Another type of germicidal UV light (called low-wavelength light or far-UVC), may be safer. It has little to no effects on the skin or eyes, while still killing germs.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7b1luaqakx2\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7b1luaqakx2\">[82]</a></sup></span></p><p>Overall, we do not update much on this survey evidence, other than to note that public attitudes about GUV do not seem to have clearly crystallized yet. \u201cElite\u201d attitudes (e.g. healthcare professionals, hospital administrators, policymakers) will also matter, both directly (in shaping policies) and indirectly (in providing \u201celite cues\u201d).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefko9luwf9pa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnko9luwf9pa\">[83]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We do not view the slight preference for far-UVC light to reflect anything other than the framing of the survey itself. Future surveys may probe whether there are partisan or demographic differences, to better understand whether this issue is likely to be politicized the way that e.g. vaccines have been. From a philanthropic perspective, greater funder diversity could be useful to help ensure that GUV interventions are not politicized or seen as pet projects of certain kinds of funders. Public science funding could be especially helpful here, as discussed later.</p><h3><strong>Dual-Use Potential and Security Risks</strong></h3><p>As with all potential biosecurity interventions, it is important to consider the possible dual-use applications of GUV. There are several potential sources of concern. First, it is possible that more research on GUV will facilitate work on dangerous pathogens. For example, if one factor keeping scientists and militaries from pursuing more of the most dangerous gain-of-function or biodefense experiments is the potential for accidental infection and laboratory leaks, then if GUV reduces the perceived risk, there may be more of this research. It is unclear whether this is a real risk pathway, or whether the benefits to biosafety simply outweigh any such effects. We therefore believe this concern is minor compared to the concern outlined in the following paragraph.</p><p>One potential concern is that GUV may become a victim of its own (perceived) success. Imagine a near future in which GUV becomes humanity\u2019s primary protection against pandemics, with decreased emphasis on social measures, vaccine development, and therapeutics (e.g. because these are perceived to be redundant). This need not be because GUV is <i>actually</i>&nbsp;good enough to serve as a single defensive layer (we believe this is highly unlikely), but because it is <i>perceived</i>&nbsp;as a \u201csilver bullet\u201d solution.&nbsp;In such a world with single-layered biosecurity, bad actors could focus on engineering&nbsp;UV-resistant pathogens&nbsp;in order to cause a massive pandemic.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftmqfd4qs4od\"><sup><a href=\"#fntmqfd4qs4od\">[84]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Importantly, however, while such risk-shifting is theoretically possible, <strong>wide-scale application of GUV would still restrict malevolent actors so heavily that the benefits may well outweigh the costs of a new vulnerability</strong>.</p><p>Moreover, while it is possible to think of dual-use applications of GUV, there are feedback loops that would allow us to assess whether these concerns are real. For example, if it really were the case that the world moved to a single-layered biodefense, philanthropists and policymakers could notice this trend and work to correct it. Moreover, GUV does not seem to directly enable bioweapons development or deployment in the way that other technology does.</p><p>As a counterpoint to these security concerns and worries about risk-shifting, however, it is important to note that <strong>robust defenses can have a deterrence-by-denial effect</strong>. In security studies, deterrence by denial refers to the idea that strong defenses can convince an adversary that an attack will not achieve its objective.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrtptqpwp02\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrtptqpwp02\">[85]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In the case of biodefense, deterrence-by-denial via widespread GUV technologies in a country could have the following effects:</p><ol><li>Convincing malicious actors with existing bioweapons capabilities that biological attack on the relevant country would be futile;</li><li>Convincing malicious actors <i>without</i>&nbsp;existing bioweapons capabilities that the pursuit of such capabilities has low payoff (because of point 1).</li></ol><p>In summary, we believe that the security concerns accompanying GUV technology are manageable and likely outweighed by their security benefits via both defense and deterrence.</p><h3><strong>Resistance risks</strong></h3><p>Viruses in particular are notorious for their ability to rapidly evolve in response to new challenges, such as drugs and host immunity.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm3edd61dtp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm3edd61dtp\">[86]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Analogously to antibiotic resistance, we think that there is some risk posed by the possibility of UV-resistant pathogens in the future (if this technology was widely adopted)\u2014but we think the risk is less severe than that posed by drug resistance. UV light deactivates pathogens by passing through their cell wall/ viral envelope, and breaking molecular bonds that bind the pathogen\u2019s DNA or RNA together. Consequently, the adaptations necessary for a pathogen to become resistant to UV light would inherently affect fundamental properties of the pathogen (such as the make-up of the cell wall, or structure of DNA molecular bonds), which experience competing selection pressures to stay constant.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2j3of9bp4xv\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2j3of9bp4xv\">[87]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa6l8ep5lhq\"><sup><a href=\"#fna6l8ep5lhq\">[88]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Note, however, that scientists do not have a full understanding of the mechanism of inactivation of far-UVC light, increasing our uncertainty about potential resistance risks.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdsp2hc9u76q\"><sup><a href=\"#fndsp2hc9u76q\">[89]</a></sup></span></p><p>Nonetheless, we note that there are some naturally-occuring bacteria which appear to be resistant to&nbsp;UVC light.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdqcauow4nwj\"><sup><a href=\"#fndqcauow4nwj\">[90]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As far as we are aware, UVC-resistance has not become a major issue in medical spaces where GUV has been in use for nearly a century.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft5lizjhz67\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt5lizjhz67\">[91]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Whether UV-resistant&nbsp;potential pandemic pathogens could be engineered in the future and released deliberately (by malevolent actors) or accidentally (i.e. via a laboratory leak) is unclear. The mere existence of such pathogens created by natural selection, however, underscores the importance of \u201cdefense-in-depth\u201d or \u201clayered defense\u201d \u2014 GUV could be an important tool in our pandemic preparedness and response toolkit, but cannot on its own eliminate the threat of pandemics.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcxsnnnlck7u\"><sup><a href=\"#fncxsnnnlck7u\">[92]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Damage to Plastics and Other Materials</strong></h3><p>Ultraviolet light in the UVC spectrum is known to cause significant degradation in many types of plastics.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqaau9n4lw7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqaau9n4lw7\">[93]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The damage depends on the type of plastic, the duration and intensity of exposure, the presence of UV stabilizers or protective coatings, and the presence of environmental factors like temperature and humidity.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1y5eq2s4tbuj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1y5eq2s4tbuj\">[94]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Because \u201csensitivity of plastics decreases exponentially with wavelength,\u201d far-UVC irradiation may be more damaging than other kinds of UV exposure.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsoe1kkmfpmr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsoe1kkmfpmr\">[95]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>In a recent report on indoor air quality and GUV, the authors argue that \u201cthe rate of degradation may overall be negligible compared with the standard lifetime of consumer products.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6qe3ajw2i1g\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6qe3ajw2i1g\">[96]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We remain highly uncertain about this, in part because many UV-resistant plastics are targeted mainly at UVA and UVB spectrum light from the sun, and not at intense long-term exposure to far-UVC light. In spaces housing expensive equipment with exposed plastics, we believe this may become a serious issue that can affect both the actual cost-effectiveness and the perceived cost-effectiveness (and therefore public openness to adoption). A 2023 study on materials used in public bus interiors found significant damage and discoloration, with serious increases in brittleness for some materials (up to 26% decrease in \u201celongation at break,\u201d with low elongation at break indicating brittleness).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefiumhfw0bftr\"><sup><a href=\"#fniumhfw0bftr\">[97]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Indeed, the study claims to have studied the equivalent exposure of \u201c6.2 years of city bus disinfection,\u201d but this is assuming only intermittent disinfection (10-15 minutes after 1 hour of driving for 16 hours a day); for effective indoor air quality applications, exposure would be longer, such that we may assume even worse degradation of materials.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn3kjc9rr8m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn3kjc9rr8m\">[98]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We believe that this could be an important consideration for adoption in spaces with many susceptible materials on critical (and expensive) systems, such as healthcare spaces.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflo63qn1f04b\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlo63qn1f04b\">[99]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to non-living materials like plastics, there are also additional concerns about the unknown effects of UV light on other forms of life, such as houseplants, which may be important for adoption.</p><p>This is mainly an issue for full-room irradiation with far-UVC light; upper-room conventional UV would not come into contact with any plastics in the lower parts of a room.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Questions for Further Investigation</strong></p><ul><li>How safe is far-UVC light to human eyes?

Far-UVC has some theoretical advantages, as discussed below. Nonetheless, we are concerned that the biosecurity funding community may have a bias towards exciting new technology of far-UVC lights, when 254nm UVC lights are a proven technology with a century of use.&nbsp;Of course, it is possible that \u201cnew\u201d technology may be able to find widespread application more easily than the more conventional technology that has languished without much adoption for decades Within the Effective Altruism community specifically, we note that far-UVC light has received significant attention (e.g. brought up by Will MacAskill in <i>The Guardian</i> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/21/william-macaskill-what-we-owe-the-future-philosopher-interview\"><u>here</u></a><u>,</u>&nbsp;and&nbsp;referenced on the EA forum<u>&nbsp;</u><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pgSKdPwDbG5EppRFC/ubiquitous-far-ultraviolet-light-could-control-the-spread-of\"><u>here</u></a><u>),</u>&nbsp;yet we are not aware of a similar focus upon upper-room systems.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref91g86nkydin\"><sup><a href=\"#fn91g86nkydin\">[106]</a></sup></span></p><p>It is possible that this difference is justified (for instance, if far-UVC is significantly more effective than upper-room systems), but we have several key uncertainties about far-UVC lights:</p><ul><li>What are the potential safety hazards of far-UVC lights, especially for less-studied issues like eye damage, and in sub groups of the population&nbsp;that might be especially vulnerable&nbsp;to far-UVC light? What can we know about the <i>long-term</i>&nbsp;effects of constant UVC irradiation?</li><li>In real-world applications, how much more effective is full-room far-UVC light at reducing not just pathogen load, but also at reducing disease transmission?</li><li>Which wavelength (far-UVC or conventional GUV)&nbsp;can be installed across a wider range of buildings (e.g. because of aesthetics, ceiling height, plastic degradation, indoor air quality, etc.)?</li><li>What are the costs of reducing uncertainty about these questions (study costs, opportunity costs, public perception costs) when potential \u201cgood enough\u201d technology exists?</li><li>What are the market obstacles that currently keep far-UVC lights relatively expensive?&nbsp;What market interventions can help decrease cost and thereby catalyze greater demand?</li></ul><p>Depending on the answers to these questions, we believe it is possible that the recent focus on far-UVC technology has been misplaced. Below, we attempt to answer some of these questions.</p><p>We divide our analysis into three sections: efficacy, safety, and cost. On efficacy, there are several reasons to believe that full-room 222 nm (far-UVC) irradiation will be more effective in reducing transmission than other types of GUV, though the magnitude of the difference remains uncertain. On safety, full-room far-UVC irradiation ranks below upper-room and in-duct irradiation; although far-UVC light is <i>probably</i>&nbsp;safe, and accidents occur even with upper-room UVC, upper-room and in-duct GUV simply does not come in contact with humans, and therefore poses a much lower safety risk in expectation. On cost, our uncertainties are high; 222 nm lights remain expensive, but costs may decline, and full-room irradiation may have some cost-advantages in retrofitting \u2014 many rooms have overhead lights, but not all rooms are suitable for upper-room or in-duct GUV. We also suggest that public perception of safety may be just as important as actual safety.</p><p>We conclude that <u>our uncertainty is high-enough to warrant a wavelength-agnostic&nbsp;approach</u>&nbsp;to funding UVC GUV interventions, as described under \u201c<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTOgiSlrUvvnMM7XJStk3ZK9VBbfqNTCKFsVU9liM3ZcAfvADlx77c9lm3hKQSuWSNVInEOz06im6me/pub#h.xqys2szbuogz\"><u>What Could a Philanthropist Do?</u></a>\u201d</p><h2>The Complexity of Comparing Different GUV Systems and Wavelengths</h2><p>Before the discussions that follow, it is important to note that comparing different GUV systems and wavelengths is a deeply complex endeavor. <strong>It is not strictly possible to say that one wavelength is \u201cbetter\u201d than another (safer, more efficacious, etc.) without discussing that wavelength in its deployment context.</strong></p><p>For example, conventional 254nm light could not be deployed in full-room systems (for occupied rooms) without causing significant damage to skin and eyes, whereas far-UVC light can be. On the other hand, both far-UVC systems and conventional GUV can be deployed in upper-room systems, but historically such systems have used only conventional 254nm UV light. Even upper-room systems have accidents and leaks, can be installed incorrectly, and people may simply enter the irradiation zone (e.g. when using a ladder to access the ceiling). Thus, the safest deployment combination would appear to be far-UVC light deployed in upper-room systems, and we believe that this is a promising approach for more widespread adoption <i>if concerns about indoor air pollution are resolved</i>.</p><p>Safety is not, however, the only relevant consideration. Comparing different systems and wavelengths on efficacy, too, turns out to be deeply complicated. For example, when we began our investigation, we believed that full-room irradiation was strictly better than upper-room irradiation \u2014 after all, we reasoned, shining germicidal light on a greater fraction of the air surely eliminates a greater fraction of the threat. Thus, because only far-UVC light is suitable for full-room deployment, we expected to recommend targeted investment into far-UVC light, as many other funders have also focused on the exciting new far-UVC technology. This turns out to be more complicated than we expected, and highly context-dependent.</p><p>Part of the complexity is the result of the <strong>inverse square law</strong>, which applies to various physical phenomena, including light, which dictates that the intensity of the light decreases with the square of the distance from the source of the light.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8l6uii0xj9b\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8l6uii0xj9b\">[107]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In other words, doubling the distance from the source decreases the intensity by a factor of 4. Our original drawings ought to therefore be modified thus:</p><p><strong>Assuming constant intensity </strong>vs.<strong>&nbsp;Reality: the Inverse Square Law</strong></p><p><img style=\"width:234.74px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/gkbjqzk5qzhyndl9bxpq\" alt=\"\"><img style=\"width:231.5px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/tf42idxiovyzxcgj15oq\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, the efficacy of full-room vs. upper-room systems ultimately will depend on the dimensions of the room, the air movement, and where in the room the threshold limit values are reached.&nbsp;For certain high-ceilinged spaces, it is possible that full-room systems deployed from the ceiling may be significantly less effective than upper-room systems deployed in great numbers and high power just above the inhabited zone (though this remains highly uncertain).&nbsp;This depends ultimately on the specific deployment of the lights \u2014 for high ceilinged spaces, the flux of the lamps may be increased such that the threshold limit values are reached at the occupied zones; for other spaces, wall-mounted far-UVC lights could also be useful.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefddidv4kj3e\"><sup><a href=\"#fnddidv4kj3e\">[108]</a></sup></span></p><p>This could be an effective intervention for some high-transmission public spaces, but we remain highly uncertain about the importance of irradiation in the breathing zone \u2014 again, more work to understand real-world effectiveness is needed.</p><p>Imaginative deployment techniques using mixed wavelengths could help to cover different parts of the room in different ways:</p><p><strong>Mixed-Wavelength Deployment with Upper-Room and Chandelier-Type Systems</strong></p><p><img style=\"width:335.28px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/ew6xcnrw11fuu8ldnrtm\" alt=\"\"></p><p>(<i>NB</i>: The far-UVC lamps could also be deployed at the ceiling at high flux, such that the irradiation of the occupied zone is similar, but there is additional inactivation above the occupied zone. Far-UVC lamps could also be deployed as wall-mounted lights.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkqnw7huvjng\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkqnw7huvjng\">[109]</a></sup></span>)</p><p>Indeed, given uncertainty around the characteristics&nbsp;of potential threats \u2014 and the sensitivity of different pathogens at different wavelengths \u2014 a mixed approach may provide more threat-agnostic protection.</p><p>In summary, although the following sections attempt to compare different types of GUV, their ultimate comparison will depend on a variety of factors, including the dimensions of the relevant rooms. In addition to further investments in far-UVC research because of its safety benefits, more research is needed to map the different indoor spaces, their importance in transmission events, and their dimensions in order to fully understand which system is likely to be most promising in the long run. In other words, we cannot claim confidently that one wavelength or deployment method is <i>universally</i>&nbsp;better than another; this will depend entirely on deployment context. Ultimately, we expect that mixed deployment systems will dominate in large public spaces and that <strong>different users with different cultures, spaces, transmission-suppression priorities, and risk tolerances will adopt different systems</strong>&nbsp;(consider, for example, the differences between a neonatal ICU in a hospital and a tech company office). This is partly why we recommend <strong>real world studies</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>wavelength-agnostic funding</strong>.</p><h2>Efficacy</h2><p>All forms of GUV work to inactivate pathogens, in order to decrease infection rate; all systems also require some form of ventilation, and as discussed in the previous section, different use cases, different room sizes, and different priorities will likely determine which systems are most useful.</p><p>All else equal, is full-room far-UVC more effective than upper-room GUV in reducing infection risk? There are some mechanistic reasons to expect this to be the case; full-room far-UVC can cover a broader area than upper-room systems, and &nbsp;far-UVC can &nbsp;directly target the air between humans (e.g. when speaking, singing, etc.) However, this issue is more complex than we initially realized (outlined above under <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTOgiSlrUvvnMM7XJStk3ZK9VBbfqNTCKFsVU9liM3ZcAfvADlx77c9lm3hKQSuWSNVInEOz06im6me/pub#h.kgfq5clbc1mq\"><u>The Complexity of Comparing Different GUV Systems and Wavelengths</u></a>). The researchers we interviewed for this project, Dr. Kenneth Wood and Dr. Ewan Eadie, expressed skepticism about the ability of full-room far-UVC lights to stop short-range transmission, although it may help with so-called \u201csuperspreader\u201d events (notably, however, upper-room GUV could also help with these events).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd3rfi1sli89\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd3rfi1sli89\">[110]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Our best understanding is that far-UVC would only be able to significantly reduce short range transmission if deployed at a far higher power than is likely to be permitted.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx9akqu6p4jf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx9akqu6p4jf\">[111]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;There is some reason to believe that far-UVC full-room UV may have some advantages for tackling so-called <a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/research/global-catastrophic-biological-risks-a-guide-for-philanthropists\"><u>global catastrophic biological risks</u></a>, therefore. One additional reason for this is the \u201ctunability\u201d of full-room far-UVC. As mentioned elsewhere in this report, it may be possible in extreme circumstances to increase full-room far-UVC exposure dramatically (and above recommended levels during non-crisis situations), whereas upper-room systems have a ceiling on effectiveness determined by air flow.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefaafzhdpus6w\"><sup><a href=\"#fnaafzhdpus6w\">[112]</a></sup></span></p><p>While our belief is that full room far-UVC is probably more effective than upper-room systems, we think that <strong>this question is difficult or impossible to answer (with a reasonable degree of certainty) without more work to understand real-world transmission and the relative effectiveness of different kinds of GUV, including 222 nm light</strong>, and without specifying the deployment context.&nbsp;So far, although there have been transmission studies conducted with 254 nm upper-room GUV\u2014and even these studies are quite different from real-world usage \u2014 there is only one ongoing real-world transmission study with full-room 222 nm light, which we discussed with the lead investigator, Kenneth Rockwood. This means that we simply do not have good information on how big the effect size difference really is. It also means that catalyzing <strong>a research program around real world GUV effectiveness could be among the most important things that philanthropists can fund</strong>.

In particular, one eACH removes about 63% of contaminants, but a second ACH removes 63% <i>of</i> <i>what is left</i>&nbsp;(i.e. a total of 86%) \u2014 in a situation where infectious agents are constantly being emitted, the calculation of how much of the contagion is actually removed <i>on net</i>&nbsp;thus becomes more complicated.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo2k73wfiqon\"><sup><a href=\"#fno2k73wfiqon\">[116]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>The Wells-Riley equation gives the probability of infection in a well-mixed room as:<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/gt8yfev5mppa5zxh29tl\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/weetbhen8ctvzve1libe 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/mkqxng1mqjljrehcs3z5 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/cjqwkrpzpmwhvpdqu5b5 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/hewx6ac06ksthzrhihtq 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/awspfrhlnbpdrsgtff14 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/yw5fdqnzafgbezp7326h 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/sgqndtqronar0cmf31bf 1050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/mg8u4xqsgayuuefqcxtz 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/caatwi5heke5lgj8odaa 1350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/nckqinfi49cdtnu239td 1442w\"></p><p>Q is measured in cubic meters per hour, such that we can represent eACH as&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\" Q/(room &nbsp;volume)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em;

In short, the effectiveness of different wavelengths is once again highly complicated, and will once again ultimately depend on context, including the pathogen in question.</p><p>What other evidence exists?&nbsp;Another avenue to explore differences in efficacy comes from looking at &nbsp;existing data from infection rates and pathogen inactivation. Starting with upper room GUV, &nbsp;existing data suggests a ~70-80% reduction in infection transmission rates for TB as a result of this technology. For example, Escombe et al. showed a 77% reduction in human to guinea pig transmission in a hospital setting.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxfhrrgjabo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxfhrrgjabo\">[118]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In a conceptually similar experiment, Mphaphlele and colleagues also found ~80% protection from upper room GUV,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg18espzm1jd\"><sup><a href=\"#fng18espzm1jd\">[119]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;despite considerable methodological differences between the two experiments.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv9lodjfg0dl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv9lodjfg0dl\">[120]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Modeling studies (using rates of pathogen inactivation) have found broadly similar results, albeit with larger bounds; for example, Xu et al.

These figures may seem high, but note that upper room GUV can decontaminate large volumes of room air at one time; for example, the upper two feet (22% of room volume) of a room with a nine-foot ceiling.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbznkrbyklh9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbznkrbyklh9\">[122]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, Kowalski (2009)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdohij84nph9\"><sup><a href=\"#fndohij84nph9\">[123]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;tabulated real-world upper-room GUV studies and found a lower median infection reduction rate of 39%; our best understanding is that this variation&nbsp;is because Kowalski considered a wider range of more challenging scenarios (the GUV performed close to 100%&nbsp;in ideal scenarios, but relatively poorly in high-challenge scenarios).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3y5dexqukdb\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3y5dexqukdb\">[124]</a></sup></span></p><p>Overall, we expect that the modeling&nbsp;studies may overestimate the efficacy of upper room GUV somewhat, due to (1) the effect of direct transmission through speaking and coughing, which are not explicitly modeled&nbsp;out/possible to examine within the experimental data here, and (2) a general assumption that real-world set-ups will be less efficient than experimental set-ups. This implies that upper-room setups might lower infection rates by (very roughly) ~35-80% dependent upon the pathogen and situation at hand.

At the same time, we have significant uncertainty here, and highlight that upper-room systems nonetheless appear to be an effective method of improving biological air safety. Given the importance of air safety and remaining uncertainty around far-UVCsystems, we don\u2019t think that these efficacy considerations imply that funders should neglect upper-room GUV systems\u2014for example, funding upper-room systems might be a critical \u201chedge\u201d if usable full-room or far-UVCsystems fail to materialize.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Safety</h2><p>We&nbsp;divide our discussion into two parts: skin/eye safety and indoor air pollution.</p><h3><strong>Skin/Eye Effects</strong></h3><p>Upper room GUV and in-duct GUV have some theoretical safety advantages over full-room GUV; when installed and used properly, human contact with the UV light is minimized (although leakage and accidents occur). &nbsp;Upper-room GUV with 254 nm light has been used for nearly 100 years (e.g. in hospital settings), with no apparent major health implications, but importantly, this is not necessarily representative of the use cases for pandemic prevention. Safety risk comes from leakage, incorrect installation, and accidental exposure to upper-room 254 nm UVC light, which can cause temporary but painful photokeratitis (akin to \u201csnow blindness\u201d) of the eye, and temporary but painful erythema (reddening) of the skin.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1mifdoi0a3p\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1mifdoi0a3p\">[129]</a></sup></span></p><p>As discussed <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTOgiSlrUvvnMM7XJStk3ZK9VBbfqNTCKFsVU9liM3ZcAfvADlx77c9lm3hKQSuWSNVInEOz06im6me/pub#h.jk6c53ec4pnn\"><u>above</u></a>, we think the available evidence suggests that far-UVC light is safe\u2014but there is a small chance of health risks that cannot yet be ruled out, due to the lack of population-based studies or longterm studies. In particular, we think it is possible that there may be certain groups within the population that are especially vulnerable to far-UVC light. For example, we think it is currently unclear whether people who are especially prone to skin reactions from UV light, or those who have unusual eye physiology (i.e. suffer from dry eye), might suffer health problems as a result of its use\u2014we are not sure whether the mechanistic evidence holds for these groups of the population, and we are not aware of any experimental evidence that speaks to this possibility. Second, we think that there have thus far been very few studies on the effects of far-UVC light upon eyes in general.</p><h3><strong>Indoor Air Pollution</strong></h3><p>As discussed in detail above, researchers have recently&nbsp;raised the prospect that UVC light may have adverse effects on indoor air quality by producing pollution, and that this is more concerning for far-UVC light. So far, the indoor air pollution concerns are based on computer models&nbsp;alongside some mechanistic evidence, but we do not have high confidence in the validity of these models \u2014 more real-world studies may be needed.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefu6w781p22mm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnu6w781p22mm\">[130]</a></sup></span></p><h2>Cost</h2><p>One unpublished study by a Russian academic and a CDC researcher allegedly estimated that the cost of 1 ACH by ventilation is about $135.91 USD and by GUV is about $14.44 USD.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk7ho9b7wwep\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk7ho9b7wwep\">[131]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;1DaySooner and Rethink Priorities have estimates that \"The price of current systems is currently too high for at-scale deployment, though there are reasons to think the price can be lowered significantly;\" they estimate that the cost of upgrading all U.S. buildings for improved indoor air quality would be about $120 billion - $420 billion.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs57h5bkeg9\"><sup><a href=\"#fns57h5bkeg9\">[132]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Our best understanding is that far-UVC light cost is&nbsp;dropping quickly, can fall further, and may become cheaper than 254 nm upper-room light when total installation costs are included.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkanjsbanzep\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkanjsbanzep\">[133]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;There are, however, countervailing factors that may increase the cost of widespread installation of far-UVC lights even if&nbsp;market factors were more favorable.

We note one important caveat for far-UVC (noted within this report), which is that rooms outfitted with far-UVC may also need appropriate ventilation or filtration to limit harm from pollutants (see \u2018Indoor Air Pollution\u2019 section <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTOgiSlrUvvnMM7XJStk3ZK9VBbfqNTCKFsVU9liM3ZcAfvADlx77c9lm3hKQSuWSNVInEOz06im6me/pub#h.a0jukk8sex9l\"><u>above</u></a>). Our best understanding is that a small amount of ventilation (&gt;1ACH) or filtration is needed for the effectiveness of most GUV systems (potentially limiting their applications to commercial and public buildings rather than lower-ventilation private homes).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv7i3g91wfpn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv7i3g91wfpn\">[136]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Again, the same graphic as above:</p><p><img style=\"width:525.5px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/rijsvflfiyulqx1cnvpf\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Source: </strong>1DaySooner, shared by Vivian Belenky. Notably, these effects depend on a variety of factors, including the pathogen in question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Limits to real-world use</strong></h3><p>There are a number of real-world factors that will limit where far-UVC versus upper-room GUV can be successfully implemented, which could be important. For example, if it is the case that far-UVC light can be successfully installed in twice as many places as upper-room GUV, this would make it more likely\u2014all else equal\u2014that far-UVC would be more impactful.</p><ul><li>Room height: upper-room UVC requires that the room is high enough that the machines can be installed such that there is no risk that the beams will come into contact with people. This appears to be a critical consideration;&nbsp;researchers wanted to test different kinds of UVC lights in school systems in Bradford, England, and had originally planned to install upper-room GUV in ten schools, but were ultimately only able to install them in two schools, because the other rooms were unsuitable for upper-room GUV.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefduys546u03\"><sup><a href=\"#fnduys546u03\">[137]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</li><li>Ventilation: upper-room UVC requires sufficient ventilation that air travels to the upper levels of the room. It is common to install a fan to ensure this<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxhh0c4rywvc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxhh0c4rywvc\">[138]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;but there may be rooms where it is impossible to ensure adequate ventilation.</li><li>Shadows: far-UVClight will not hit areas that (from the perspective of the far-UVClamps) are in shadow. This is likely to be mostly an issue with surface disinfection (rather than airborne transmission, the focus of this report) which could itself be managed by ensuring that lamps shine from different directions, but nonetheless might be a problem in some rooms.</li><li>Humidity: a common finding in the literature is that there are decreases in the UV-inactivation rate with increasing humidity, at least for upper-room UV.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrkn919qx2s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrkn919qx2s\">[139]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As far as I am aware, there is no data examining the effect of humidity upon UV-inactivation from full-room irradiation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9jhtdn2m47\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9jhtdn2m47\">[140]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;While the effects of humidity upon UV-inactivation are relatively poorly understood, humidity in the air can affect the absorption and scattering of far-UVC light in the air, potentially diminishing its effect.</li></ul><h3><strong>Additional benefits</strong></h3><p>Skin-safe GUV (such as far-UV) could additionally be used during hospital procedures, for example to &nbsp;combat the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This is because it is possible to use far-UVC light during procedures without damaging skin (e.g. via handheld devices), to &nbsp;disinfect the air during procedures and prevent re-aerosolized bacteria entering the wound. While the focus of this investigation is the potential role of GUV for pandemic prevention, this may be an additional benefit of far-UVC compared to other GUV systems.</p><h2>Overall View</h2><p>To summarize key points from above, our overall view of this comparison is:</p><ul><li>There are mechanistic reasons and some experimental evidence to believe that far-UVC is safe, but more safety studies are needed both to reduce real uncertainties (eyes, long-term exposure, vulnerable populations) and to bolster public confidence.</li><li>There are mechanistic reasons to believe that full-room far-UVC irradiation would be more effective at reducing transmission, but the magnitude of the effect at different exposure limits remains highly uncertain. More research on real-world effectiveness are needed.</li><li>Far-UVC remains much less cost-effective today, but it could become competitive with conventional UVC technology.</li><li>Key uncertainties remain about far-UVC technology, including its potential to <i>increase</i>&nbsp;indoor air pollution. These externalities and the necessary measures to mitigate them may push against future cost-effectiveness of far-UVC technology.</li><li>Widespread adoption of conventional upper-room GUV may significantly reduce the global burden of airborne disease and may provide significant pandemic-preparedness benefits against all but the most virulent engineered pandemics.</li></ul><p>In short, we are optimistic about the promise of far-UVC technology, but believe that uncertainty remains too high to pick winners.

This section turns to the question of what philanthropists can do to support progress on GUV.</p><p>The section is divided into two sub-sections. The first, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTOgiSlrUvvnMM7XJStk3ZK9VBbfqNTCKFsVU9liM3ZcAfvADlx77c9lm3hKQSuWSNVInEOz06im6me/pub#h.64fkomlumjjk\"><u>Grantmaking under Uncertainty: Impact Multipliers for GUV</u></a>, outlines possible features of the world and attributes of interventions that may make some funding opportunities relatively more cost-effective than others.

For example, in global health and development, one impact multiplier is simply focusing on the world\u2019s poorest people; because of the large wealth and income inequalities and the decreasing marginal utility of money, a dollar spent in the poorest areas of the Global South can do much more good than a dollar spent in the richest areas of the Global North. Identifying multiple impact multipliers and multiplying them together can point philanthropists towards funding opportunities that are orders of magnitude more effective than others.</p><p>Other Founders Pledge research has used impact multipliers to narrow the field of funding opportunities. In nuclear security, we have identified \u201cright-of-boom\u201d interventions as funding opportunities that simultaneously are unduly neglected and are critical for targeting the most high-consequence types of nuclear war.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefslou7mijxnh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnslou7mijxnh\">[151]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In climate change, too, considerations about the non-linearity of climate damage, the leverage of policy advocacy, and the neglectedness of some unpopular types of interventions inform Founders Pledge\u2019s grantmaking strategy.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0sqd9xns4r4\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0sqd9xns4r4\">[152]</a></sup></span></p><p>Here, we outline several possible impact multipliers for philanthropists interested in GUV. We do not believe that these are exhaustive, but rather that they are sufficient for separating the wheat from the chaff of funding opportunities and thus narrowing the option space to increase the probability of having a high impact per dollar spent.</p><p>Potential impact multipliers include:</p><ul><li><strong>Placing wavelength-agnostic bets</strong>&nbsp;\u2014 Uncertainty on the relative cost-effectiveness of different wavelengths&nbsp;of GUV remains high; philanthropists ought not focus on one wavelength to the detriment of another (at least until there is stronger evidence that a particular technology is more likely than the other to reduce pandemic risk\u2014a region that we don\u2019t believe we yet reached);</li><li><strong>Leveraging societal resources via advocacy</strong>&nbsp;\u2014 As in many areas, the vast resources of governments (money, talent, and regulatory power) can multiply the impact of private funds. Moreover, the large amounts of philanthropic money spent on health research is also an attractive target for advocacy;</li><li><strong>Prioritizing shaping R&amp;D incentives over funding specific R&amp;D</strong>&nbsp;\u2014 Attempting to \u201cpick winners\u201d and directly fund technological R&amp;D is likely less efficient than shaping incentives for increased R&amp;D, and perhaps for&nbsp;incentives aimed at better coordinating R&amp;D;</li><li><strong>Focusing on high-income countries first </strong>\u2014 Geographically, we believe that the highest impact is likely to be found via philanthropic investment in high-income countries like the United States;</li><li><strong>Focusing on public perception over rapid deployment</strong>&nbsp;\u2014 Because there is a risk that negative public perception will permanently curtail future adoption of promising UVC technology, and because catastrophic biological risks are relatively rare, small accelerations in adoption speed are likely not worth sacrificing public perception.</li></ul><p>Currently, we do not have sufficient information to quantify these multipliers, a task for further research. Thus, they serve mostly as guidelines for philanthropists to navigate the uncertainties surrounding GUV.</p><h3><strong>Placing Wavelength-Agnostic Bets</strong></h3><p>As described above, there remain key uncertainties about the differences between 254 nm UVC light (as upper-room fixtures) and 222 nm far-UVC light (as full-room irradiation). These uncertainties may be large enough to affect the relative cost-effectiveness of each wavelength. As described above, some funders appear to have gone \u201call in\u201d on far-UVC light. We believe that this approach is misguided and that&nbsp;far-UVC may be an over-hyped technology; we don\u2019t think the evidence for superiority of far-UVC (relative to other GUV systems) is overwhelmingly strong as to outweigh the risks of focusing specifically upon this technology. Nonetheless, far-UV\u2019s novelty and uncertainty also gives it a potentially higher ceiling than conventional GUV, and may allow it to avoid some of the obstacles that have prevented widespread adoption of conventional GUV.</p><p>Hence, we think that philanthropists ought to not \u201cpick winners\u201d prematurely, but instead fund interventions that:</p><ol><li><strong>Reduce uncertainty</strong>&nbsp;about absolute and relative cost-effectiveness of different GUV interventions;<ol><li>For example, see our recommendation for <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTOgiSlrUvvnMM7XJStk3ZK9VBbfqNTCKFsVU9liM3ZcAfvADlx77c9lm3hKQSuWSNVInEOz06im6me/pub#h.yh8z0epqfwfw\"><u>policy advocacy for more research on real-world effectiveness, below</u></a>.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Preserve option value </strong>by not focusing on the exciting new technology when the proven 254 nm light may be a valuable intervention, and;</li><li><strong>Leave options open </strong>by not committing to one option to the potential detriment of the other. For example, one potential \u2018failure mode\u2019 would be if far-UVCwas rolled out too early, resulting in a public backlash against GUV systems more broadly.</li></ol><p>Note that the importance of leaving options open runs both ways: there may be a risk that investments in 254 nm light either \u201clock in\u201d an inferior technology or \u201cpoison the well\u201d for the entire class of GUV.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgs6cab8bjym\"><sup><a href=\"#fngs6cab8bjym\">[153]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;That is, it is possible that:</p><ol><li>Widespread adoption of 254 nm light goes well, but is \u201clocked in\u201d (as other inferior technologies have been locked in before) even if far-UVC light turns out to be better.</li><li>Attempted adoption of 254 nm light results in accidents (e.g. due to incorrect installment or use) that lead to a public backlash against <i>all</i>&nbsp;kind of GUV.</li></ol><p>We therefore generally advocate against rushed deployment of <i>any</i>&nbsp;wavelength of GUV, towards a truly wavelength-agnostic approach. As we write below, small accelerations in adoption timelines are unlikely to be worth the risk of lock-in or backlash, given the infrequency of catastrophic pandemics.</p><p>If we believe, for example, that it is 60% likely that far-UVC technology is meaningfully more cost-effective than 254 nm upper-room GUV, but 40% likely 254 nm technology is equal or superior, we would want to identify interventions that don\u2019t close the door to this 40% of impact.</p><p>Such interventions might include:</p><ul><li>Studies around real-world effectiveness that study the absolute and relative effectiveness of different wavelengths of UVC light (potentially funded via policy advocacy to fund a large group of such studies using public funds);</li><li>Safety studies that seek to better understand the air pollution concerns, and how much they apply to different wavelengths of UVC light;</li><li>General GUV policy advocacy, without reference to far-UVC light;</li><li>Public perception work, about GUV technology broadly (not focused on a particular wavelength).</li></ul><p>Wavelength-agnostic interventions would likely exclude:</p><ul><li>Attempts to accelerate far-UVC technology only (e.g. private investments in solid-state far-UVC sources);</li><li>Policy advocacy that focuses on pushing far-UVC technology to the exclusion of other GUV, without further evidence on transmission reduction and safety.</li></ul><p>We do note that there are areas where research funding is needed to \u2018bring one wavelength up to speed\u2019 with the other; for example, we are far more uncertain about the safety of far-UVC relative to upper-room GUV systems. We don\u2019t think that this is against a wavelength agnostic approach, since this work would entail reducing uncertainty about the impact and cost-effectiveness of different US systems rather than advocating for one over the other. However, we suspect that philanthropists are likely to be more impactful by operating at the meta-level (i.e. advocating for more funding for researchers to examine this) rather than by attempting to fund these safety studies directly\u2014see below.</p><h3><strong>Leveraging Societal Resources Via Advocacy</strong></h3><p>The second impact multiplier is leveraging government resources via policy advocacy. One recent analysis estimates that the cost of upgrading indoor air quality technology in U.S. public buildings is between $120 and $420 billion; far beyond the capabilities of even the largest philanthropists.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvkrprh5la8n\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvkrprh5la8n\">[154]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Our current understanding is that\u2014while the UK and US governments have made some investments into GUV research, via the NIH and programs such as UKRI\u2014air quality interventions receive a small quantity of funding relative to their potential to reduce disease/pandemic risk, potentially reflecting historical assumptions that airborne transmission is of negligible importance to the transmission of major respiratory diseases.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzmkp24wzhq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzmkp24wzhq\">[155]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>As in climate change, therefore, philanthropists ought to use the leverage that vast government resources can provide via policy advocacy \u2014 redirecting defense spending and public health spending towards promising causes like UVC safety research. Moreover, some of the largest philanthropic funders in the world \u2014 like the Wellcome Trust and the Gates Foundation \u2014 focus on health; advocacy can also help to leverage these funds.</p><h3><strong>Prioritizing shaping R&amp;D incentives over funding specific R&amp;D</strong></h3><p>Third, philanthropists ought to prioritize <i>shaping incentives</i>&nbsp;for research and development (R&amp;D) in GUV over funding specific R&amp;D and technical projects. Specific technical projects may be appealing to grantmakers because they have \u201ctangible\u201d outcomes. In our research, we learned about several specific technical projects \u2014 like funding particular more efficient far-UVC technology projects. However, we are skeptical about whether philanthropists have the technical expertise to \u201cpick winners\u201d among different R&amp;D projects, and think they ought to cast their net wider; we think that it may be possible to increase the quality and quantity of this research by shifting incentive systems, and that this approach could be very high impact. For example, it may be possible to use market-shaping incentives to increase private R&amp;D (i.e. by underwriting commitments from companies to buy these technologies if they become cost-effective, as suggested to us by 1DaySooner-thus providing enhanced incentives for developers). Other ideas include incentivising companies to use far-UVC and share their data, and to promote/ incentivise efficient coordination of research&nbsp;across different research groups.</p><p>Overall, we believe that stimulating private R&amp;D via regulatory levers, public funding, using funding incentives for well-coordinated research, and innovative market-shaping incentives is likely to be far more effective than trying to fund specific technologies.</p><h3><strong>Focusing on high-income countries first</strong></h3><p>Fourth, to narrow down funding options geographically, we believe philanthropists ought to target interventions in high-income countries like the United States first \u2014 at least for full-room far-UVC(we are less sure whether this holds for upper-room systems) . The reasons for this are outlined in the recent Indoor Air Quality report by Rethink Priorities and 1DaySooner, which provides reasons for scoping to the United States. We reproduce these reasons verbatim below:<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpqmhlutm5x\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpqmhlutm5x\">[156]</a></sup></span></p><ol><li>\u201cAmerican standards tend to influence other countries (e.g. car emissions standards).\u201d</li><li>\u201cGlobally, 1.2 billion people live in high-income countries, for which deployment should be roughly similar to the US.\u201d</li><li>\u201cWe expect building changes to be implemented first in richer countries because of their greater resources and institutional capacity.\u201d</li><li>\u201cPeople in high-income countries fly more often on average, so blocking or reducing pathogen transmission in these countries, including the US, would do more to reduce air travel spread\u201d</li><li>\u201cTechnological investments by wealthy countries will reduce costs, which would facilitate later deployment in developing countries.\u201d</li></ol><p>Notably, however, conventional upper-room GUV may be deployed easily in other countries, potentially helping to stimulate the global market for GUV generally.</p><h3><strong>Focusing on good information over rapid deployment</strong></h3><p>As discussed throughout this report, we believe that there is a risk that negative public perception will permanently curtail future adoption of promising UVC technology&nbsp;\u2014 including conventional GUV, where occasional accidents can cause major public backlash. <strong>Because catastrophic biological risks are relatively rare, small accelerations in adoption speed are likely not worth sacrificing public perception</strong>. Far-UVC GUV is a relatively new technology. While it may have a larger upside than 254 nm upper-room GUV, many unknowns \u2014 both known unknowns and unknown unknowns \u2014 remain about this technology.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9t8gjnce9jd\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9t8gjnce9jd\">[157]</a></sup></span></p><p>Other work on this issue has been explicitly framed around <i>accelerating deployment</i>&nbsp;of GUV. The recent 1DaySooner and Rethink Priorities report on indoor air quality explicitly mentions this risk: \u201cDoing a poor job with the rollout of IAQ interventions or attempts at altering standards and regulations might \u2018poison the well\u2019 for better attempts later, e.g. due to a very small number of high-profile failures.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefowae6lyumsi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnowae6lyumsi\">[158]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Global catastrophic biological risk is an urgent problem, but the difference between deploying GUV in 5 years or 25 years is not as large as it may seem. In one public forecasting tournament, crowdsourced predictions currently give the following probabilities:</p><ol><li><strong>38% chance</strong>&nbsp;of a 10% decline in the human population by 2100;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsrmx2aa9mkc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsrmx2aa9mkc\">[159]</a></sup></span></li><li><strong>14% chance </strong>that such a decline will be due to naturally-occuring pandemics;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuumjd3uov2f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuumjd3uov2f\">[160]</a></sup></span></li><li><strong>28% chance</strong>&nbsp;that such a decline will be due to \u201cbiotechnology or bioengineered organisms\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn48lg3rihfm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn48lg3rihfm\">[161]</a></sup></span></li></ol><p>Assuming that (2) and (3) are independent, we can estimate the chance of a catastrophic biological event at about 0.38*(0.14+0.28) = 0.1596, or a <strong>~16% chance of a catastrophic biological event</strong>&nbsp;by the end of the century.</p><p>This is not, however, distributed uniformly across the next 77 years. As the forecasts above imply, experts believe that the majority of the risk\u2019s mass is from biotechnology and bioengineered organisms rather than from naturally-occuring pandemics. As explained in a fourth forecasting question, \u201cSince biotechnology is becoming more advanced and cheaper as time goes on, potentially faster than humanity's abilities to prevent pandemics, it is plausible that the time of greatest risk from bioengineering will be in the future.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftqwi3qoyhs\"><sup><a href=\"#fntqwi3qoyhs\">[162]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Moreover, as outlined in a recent policy report on catastrophic pandemics, \u201cWe don't yet know of any credible viruses that could cause new pandemics, but ongoing research projects aim to publicly identify them.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd938lwscr2u\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd938lwscr2u\">[163]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;All of this implies that risk is increasing; barring a shift in the offense-defense balance, we ought to be disproportionately more concerned about pandemics 20 years from now than pandemics 10 years from now than we would be assuming a uniformly-compounding risk every year. Experts we have interviewed on global catastrophic biological risk also expressed the belief that risk is increasing.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6zbybqmym5j\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6zbybqmym5j\">[164]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This suggests that we may wish to sacrifice a few years of accelerated deployment in favor of stable deployment (because there is no public backlash) over the rest of the century; see hypothetical graph below.</p><p>Note that we do have significant uncertainty here. We think that public acceptance is likely to increase with time, since (1) it is more likely that scientists will uncover any significant health risks prior to roll-out (e.g. therefore switching to upper room systems rather than far-UVC), and (2) there is more time for public acceptance measures to be run, via the media and other information sources. However, an argument going the other way is that people might be unusually accepting of such measures now, in the immediate aftermath of COVID. We also assume that pandemic risk will increase with time due to advancements in the accessibility of technology that enable the development of bioengineered pathogens, but it is also possible that this risk is higher in the immediate future (for example, if AI technology takes off quickly and regulations/ other measures to prevent the use of this technology for bioengineering pathogens come in later).</p><h2><img style=\"width:412.52px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/ng2k7mgkhgxnytdh6eco\" alt=\"\"></h2><p>This graph shows our mental model of the potential risk of pushing rapid roll-out of GUV technology, prior to achieving public acceptance.

Notably, as pointed out in the \u201cChallenges to Studying Real World Effectiveness\u201d box, above, understanding real-world transmission is a complex problem, and may require government resources and a multi-pronged approach that seeks to validate existing models of airborne transmission.<ol><li>Safety studies, too, could follow this model. We suspect that high-quality transmission studies could catalyze interest in more safety studies in a way that high-quality safety studies would not necessarily stimulate more investment in transmission studies, due to excitement about the intervention. We are highly uncertain about this.</li></ol></li><li>Rather than fund single studies directly, we recommend advocating for public funding of a larger group of studies. This not only provides <strong>leverage</strong>&nbsp;(by using much larger government funding pots), but also <strong>institutional credibility</strong>&nbsp;(and public relations benefits of showing that GUV is not just the purview of funders with certain worldviews).</li><li>This could be done by funding think tanks and advocacy groups with credibility and track record on health security and pandemic preparedness.</li><li>There are government-affiliated spaces that are well-suited for some trials, including but not limited to:<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrop8ysl94ab\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrop8ysl94ab\">[166]</a></sup></span><ol><li>Military barracks (and bases generally), submarines, aircraft carriers, missile silos, and other military spaces;</li><li>Space exploration-related environments, which already have a long-standing interest in rigorous disinfection protocols;</li><li>Government-funded or -run hospitals (e.g., Veterans Affairs hospitals in the United States);</li><li>Other spaces that allow for well-controlled experiments. Note that we strongly object to the use of experimental technologies in spaces where (often innocent) people are held against their will (prisons) and cannot meaningfully consent to being a participant in a trial.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Shape market incentives, with the aim of promoting private sector investment (and consequent R&amp;D by companies developing GUV technology). One potential example of this comes from 1DaySooner\u2019s plan to try and reduce the risk to companies seeking to invest in far-UVC (by underwriting commitments in the case that the technology does not become cost-effective)\u2014they believe this is a key lever to enable the development of far-UVC technology. Other ideas are to use prize challenges for breakthroughs&nbsp;in GUV technology, or matching funds for corporate investment in GUV research.</li><li>Fund media interventions, such as funding journalists to write&nbsp;about GUV work. We think this could be very cost-effective (especially given the previous success of the GCR grant to Vox for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23700801/bioweapons-biological-weapons-convention-united-nations-covid-coronavirus-russia-biology\"><u>bioweapons reporting</u></a>) but also note some risk for a negative impact if this work is poorly received by the public: it would be important that this work is of high quality.&nbsp;Nonetheless, we&nbsp;think the potential benefits of this would be twofold; increasing awareness among policymakers and funders (hence making policy change slightly more likely), and increasing public acceptance of these technologies. We could specifically focus on media outlets that we believe are likely to increase awareness of GUV among policymakers (i.e. by surveying experts on the U.S. Congress, Executive Branch, etc, to identity these outlets), and/ or that we think are most likely to increase the public\u2019s acceptance of these technologies. We think there is some crossover here to Matt\u2019s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/19yfmQKCrIJZZpc9P7YQHexHltWP-GSY_EM-VlqA0NlE/edit%23heading%3Dh.csgtxb1p5nia\"><u>Information Ecology</u></a>&nbsp;report, in terms of understanding how to best spread accurate information and encourage attitude change.<ol><li>Crucially, such an intervention ought to ensure that GUV not become a politicized partisan issue, which we believe may do more harm than good. Thus, a well-balanced portfolio of reporting that includes work from mainstream outlets perceived as center and center-right may be an important part of this advocacy.</li></ol></li><li>Directly fund safety and efficacy studies (including eye safety). We think this option is reasonable, but probably the one of the least impactful on this list; given that <strong>philanthropists are unlikely to have the technical expertise to effectively judge different research protocols</strong>, and that it appears to be possible to shape research incentives at the level above this kind of direct funding.</li></ol><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p><strong>Questions for Further Investigation</strong></p><ul><li>What U.S. government entities \u2014 such as BARDA \u2014 would view transmission-blocking interventions as falling most squarely within their purview?</li><li>What other countries&nbsp;are promising targets for targeted policy advocacy?</li><li>What other tools exist for market-shaping and incentive-shaping around the development and testing of GUV interventions?</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Conclusions and Next Steps</h1><p>GUV technology appears to be potentially highly impactful, yet indoor air quality interventions in general seems to have attracted relatively little interest from mainstream funders. This is despite the potential of these technologies to reduce pandemic risk (in the case of both natural and bioengineered pathogens). We therefore think that the GUV space as a whole is a promising area for philanthropic investment, and recommend proceeding to work to find specific FOs.</p><p>Within GUV, we do not think that far-UVC systems are clearly superior to other systems\u2014we think they are likely to be more effective and may have a higher upside, but there are other factors that could limit their use (such as health impacts, whether they are real or merely perceived by the public, cost, and indoor air pollution risk). Consequently, we think there is benefit from ensuring a range of future options (such as potential roll-out of upper-room systems). We therefore suggest interventions that are \u2018wavelength-agnostic\u2019 rather than funding the promotion of one system in particular.</p><p>In particular, we highlight the potential impact of supporting journalistic work that provides awareness into GUV work, policy advocacy, and of shaping R&amp;D incentives.</p><p><img style=\"width:711.2px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EZZveBtxoZJjSighP/gbnrboeedhb3lqqwajyx\" alt=\"\"></p><h1>About Founders Pledge</h1><p>Founders Pledge is a global nonprofit empowering entrepreneurs to do the most good possible with their charitable giving.

However, the kinds of adaptations necessary to make a virus immune to UV light would require significant changes to fundamental properties of the virus- such as RNA/ DNA structure, and make-up of the cell wall. Altering these properties would have a host of other \u2018unintentional\u2019 effects, since these components of the virus carry out a multitude of basic functions. For instance, altering RNA/ DNA structure could mean that protein synthesis (from the RNA/ DNA) &nbsp;becomes impaired or impossible. In this way, there are competing selective pressures to keep these fundamental properties of the virus constant. In comparison, antibiotics tend to work by blocking specific biochemical processes in bacteria (e.g. targeting a particular step in a metabolic pathway, or in the synthesis of a cell wall protein), where bacteria can more easily evolve adaptations to \u2018get around\u2019 this blockage without otherwise affecting the basic functioning of the cell. &nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fndsp2hc9u76q\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefdsp2hc9u76q\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Thanks to Vivian Belenky for this point.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fndqcauow4nwj\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefdqcauow4nwj\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Marizcurrena, J.J., Morel, M.A., Bra\u00f1a, V. et al, \u201cSearching for novel photolyases in UVC-resistant Antarctic bacteria,\u201d Extremophiles 21, 409\u2013418 (2017), <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00792-016-0914-y\"><u>https://doi.org/10.1007/s00792-016-0914-y</u></a>&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnt5lizjhz67\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreft5lizjhz67\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;David Brenner made this same point around minute 44 of his introductory presentation at the first international far-UVC congress in the summer of 2023.

When the mass balance approach is used, with good estimates of the rate of infectious particle generation, even 6 to 12 ACH may be inadequate to prevent transmission, depending on the duration of exposure\u201d Edward A.

I'm not an expert on this (the basis for writing this is as a medical doctor studying a public health degree). <i>I'm uncertain whether this is worthwhile, I am mostly looking for <strong>people with more experience /research capacity </strong>to tell me whether or not this might be useful.&nbsp;</i></li><li><strong>My inclination is that further research into this area could be really useful as an option for some of increasingly untreatable \"superbugs\", or as a short-term treatment option for novel epi-/pandemics while other responses are mounted.</strong></li><li>Extracorporeal photopheresis, or irradiation of small amounts of blood outside of&nbsp;<i> </i>the body, is a potential treatment modality for infection. Similar methods are used to treat immune system overactivation. Perhaps surprisingly, the over-activation of the immune system is very important to treat in severe infections. Sepsis and SARS are referring to the immune response to pathogens, not to the pathogen itself. &nbsp;In this report I focus on influenza, but this could be simply replaced with almost any virus or bacterial infection. (see sections on <i>Claimed benefits of the technology</i>, <i>ECP safety</i>, <i>Dose and duration)</i></li><li>ECP has limited, yet promising, evidence. It was mostly investigated before antibiotics dominated the field (then forgotten it seems). Existing data describes 151 cases of acute bacterial infection in the blood (bacteraemia), with a 100% non-progression rate to septicaemia in the treatment group (Miley, 1942). A further study demonstrated 56% of presently septic patients recovered uneventfully following UV therapy (Miley, 1944). (See <i>ECP effectiveness</i>)</li><li>My areas of <strong>greatest uncertainty </strong>here are the <strong><u>clinical benefit</u> </strong>(as the studies are from the 1940s and don't seem to have been picked up again since) and the <strong>costings (</strong>this is the first time I've attempted something like this and I just used a poor proxy of hospital days instead of a more robust measure like DALYs).&nbsp;</li><li>The incremental cost effectiveness ratio is thus limited due to few studies and my limited understanding of costing complex things like disease. As it stands, for influenza the ICER I have calculated is 5.67 for the first year in Australia. Obviously this would vary enormously based on other settings and pathogens. (See <i>Economic evaluation)</i></li><li><i>Everything below here is included for &nbsp;further information, I've tried to summarise my queries to readers in the Key Points section.</i><br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h1><strong>1. PICO</strong></h1><h2>Population</h2><p>The proposed patient population is:&nbsp;</p><p>Patients with laboratory confirmed influenza infection (of any strain) of any age AND any of those who:</p><ul><li>Have established complications</li><li>need to be admitted to hospital for management of influenza&nbsp;</li><li>Have moderate-severity or high-severity community-acquired pneumonia, during the influenza season&nbsp;</li><li>Are at high risk of severe influenza, defined as<ul><li>adults aged 65 years or older</li><li>pregnant women</li><li>people with the following conditions:<ul><li>heart disease</li><li>Down syndrome</li><li>obesity (body mass index [BMI] 30 kg/m2 or more)</li><li>chronic respiratory conditions</li><li>severe neurological conditions</li><li>immune compromise</li><li>other chronic illnesses</li></ul></li><li>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of any age</li><li>children aged 5 years or younger</li><li>residents of aged-care facilities or long-term residential facilities</li><li>homeless people (Therapeutic Guidelines, 2022)</li></ul></li></ul><p>This proposed patient population is based on the combination of recommendations made within guidelines on antiviral use for influenza treatment and evidence from the literature regarding morbidity and mortality.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Intervention</h2><p>Immunophototherapy, or UV irradiation treatment of the person\u2019s blood to increase immune response to influenza infection.</p><p>This involves a three step process: sourcing 5% of a patient\u2019s blood volume (3.5mL/kg) via intravenous cannulation, and separation of cells via apheresis. A photosensitising agent methoxsalen is added and the cells are exposed to ultraviolet A light through the PIT machine. The treated cells are then returned to the patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a form of autologous blood transfusion, where the donor and recipient are the same person.</p><p>This process has previously been approved for another indication by both the Medical Services Advisory Committee and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee.</p><h2>Comparator</h2><p>If influenza infection is contracted,&nbsp; people may be offered a course of Tamiflu (oseltamivir), a neuraminidase inhibitor.&nbsp; This is generally 75 mg twice daily, for 5 days as an oral tablet. It is most effective if taken within the first 48 hours (Robson C, Baskar SR, Booy R, Ferguson PE, Gilroy N, Kok J, et al., 2022).&nbsp;</p><p>Oseltamivir is mentioned in the guidelines as an option for people with established complications. It is \u201cto be considered\u201d in people at high risk of severe influenza. It is not recommended at all for healthy adults. It is not funded by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</p><p>In serious cases requiring hospitalisation,&nbsp; supportive care is the mainstay of current treatment, with escalation to ventilator and/or intensive care with haemodynamic support in severe cases. Oseltamivir is often given, however its efficacy is decreased the later it is given. Increased doses or prolonged durations are not recommended (Therapeutic Guidelines, 2022).</p><p>While vaccination is the principal way to prevent severe infection, it must be given before infection occurs. Influenza vaccination coverage in Australia is low, meaning a majority of people are not protected in this way (Sullivan, 2020). Therefore, it is not a suitable comparator in this case.</p><h2>Outcomes</h2><p>Primary outcomes will be the number of severe cases of influenza requiring hospitalisations, duration of hospital treatment, mortality rate, side effects and long term effects including decreased Quality Adjusted Life Years.</p><p>Secondary outcome of interest is the effect on resistance via virological surveillance of mutating strains. This may be demonstrated by reducing the actual versus expected number of Influenza pandemic/ epidemics in Australia. This is of interest as epidemics are more severe if they are strains resistant to neuraminidase inhibitors, and resistance has developed in patients treated with neuraminidase inhibitors.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>2. The proposed technology or service and its proposed place in clinical practice</strong></h1><h2>Clinical issue&nbsp;</h2><ol><li>Influenza (HxNx) is a common form of viral infection which predominantly affects the respiratory system. Influenza affects people of any age, but is particularly severe in the very young, those over 65 and those living with immunocompromised. It was the most common cause of infectious disease notification in Australia every year until 2019 (since COVID-19 has increased) (Sullivan, 2020). It is a notifiable disease which is highly variable in incidence from year to year; from 10 to 125 to hospitalisations per 1,000 people, and mortality rate; from 346 to 1776 people (1.63 to 7.22 per 100,000 people) since 2000 (AIHW, 2023).</li><li>Some forms of influenza, including swine flu (H1N1) and bird flu (H7N9), may be recognisable due to their pandemic potential pathogen status. There are common types of Influenza, known as A, B, and C, representing different combinations of glycoproteins hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). The seasonal nature of the flu virus derives from the tendency for antigenic shift and drift in these glycoproteins (McKimm-Breschkin, 2013). This frequent adaptation of the surface proteins of the virus means that it can evade the immune system in those who have had previous infection.&nbsp;</li><li>Due to its ability to evolve, yearly vaccination is the main measure to prevent infection. This is provided free to many high-risk people through the National Immunisation program (Sullivan et al, 2020).</li><li>Influenza infection is most commonly treated with supportive care, including rest and antipyretic therapy. Vulnerable subpopulations may be offered antiviral therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir). Despite its inclusion on the TGA, the PBAC refused to list oseltamivir on the PBS (PBS, 2008). It remains on the eTG, with a disclaimer \u201cdespite limited evidence of benefit.\u201d There is not currently an evidence-based post exposure influenza treatment which has government funding (Robson C et al., 2022). ETG recommends this for people:&nbsp;<ol><li>With established complications</li><li>With moderate to severe community acquired pneumonia during flu season</li><li>requiring hospitalisation&nbsp;</li><li>Who are pregnant or otherwise at high risk of severe infection</li></ol></li><li>The proposed patient population that would benefit most from irradiation therapy are patients with high risk of severe outcomes from influenza, particularly those in areas where the potential for epidemic spread is high, such as cities (Sullivan et al, 2020, eTG, 2019). There is an unmet clinical need to address serious, common viral infections in Australia, now and into the future.</li></ol><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Clinical management</h2><p>Current clinical management pathway is as below&nbsp;</p><p><br><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cek5PPoQ2YtMSeDsj/u0qymphngo32idpfxmbz\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cek5PPoQ2YtMSeDsj/asrjxruaeokvtgryvafg 130w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cek5PPoQ2YtMSeDsj/iownn9ax3dekakuply0h 260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cek5PPoQ2YtMSeDsj/f9k3inkfcdtntbnrribz 390w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cek5PPoQ2YtMSeDsj/sscgiyhr1qloyufwhlnl 520w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cek5PPoQ2YtMSeDsj/hau3gy1vgshp4lqngq0f 650w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cek5PPoQ2YtMSeDsj/ur5i8lwdxtrgjv4oil74 780w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cek5PPoQ2YtMSeDsj/bfqbyyonjflwitdlrrqz 910w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cek5PPoQ2YtMSeDsj/kpwhyjao7ivsvvtyhrzu 1040w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cek5PPoQ2YtMSeDsj/qecp8wa2dpvcpnyaanto 1170w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cek5PPoQ2YtMSeDsj/gih1iz0z3vmeaf9wkxyr 1280w\"></p><p><i>Source: author-made, based on eTG, 2019.</i></p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Regulatory process&nbsp;</h2><p>An<i> in vitro ultraviolet blood irradiator</i> by PIT Medical Systems GmbH is currently approved by the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA #355414) which could be used for this purpose as well. The approval indicates the UVA PIT System can be used for Photo Immune Therapy on autologous blood, using UVA irradiation (in the presence of the photoactive substance 8-MOP) on extracorporeal circulating leukocyte enriched blood.</p><p>This submission is seeking to expand the use of the UV irradiation system in the existing MSAC 1651 \u2013<i> Integrated, closed-system, extracorporeal photopheresis systems for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease</i>, such that the technology may be used to treat influenza infections with government funding for this indication, to be considered as MSAC 1651.2.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Claimed benefits of the technology</h2><p>While the majority of people who contract influenza have a mild disease process, a minority experience severe disease. Given the high incidence and seasonal nature of influenza infection, this minority with severe disease have a large public health impact. The mean annual number of confirmed cases of influenza between 2011-2018 was 95,624 (DOH, 2022). The latest hospital surveillance program estimated 10,000 admissions nationally per year with influenza (Cheng et al, 2013). Mortality varies by year, trending closely with vaccination rates and how well the vaccination matches circulating strains.&nbsp;</p><p>Severe disease is most commonly characterised&nbsp; by the development of viral pneumonia, but may additionally have gastrointestinal and neurological sequelae. Secondary bacterial infection may take advantage of depleted immune systems (Miethke et al, 2021).</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Extracorporeal photopheresis has been used to date to bioengineer skin substitutes, aid wound healing, counteract chronic inflammation, treat burns and pressure ulcers, and improve postoperative healing (Kasmi et al., 2009, 234-42). Its safety is well documented, but the extent of its possible effective uses is yet underdeveloped.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>In this utilisation, white blood cells are extracted via leukapheresis and treated with a photosensitizers before being irradiated with UVA light. The process can lead to activation of the parts of the immune system while moderating the pro-inflammatory cytokine storm which is implicated in the systemic inflammatory response (PIT Medical Systems 2018).</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, UVA irradiation for influenza treatment will fill a clinical need for an effective post-infection treatment for patients with influenza who are at risk of severe disease, or who already have severe disease requiring hospitalisation. It will provide a second line of protection when influenza vaccination doesn\u2019t match circulating strains.<br>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>3. Evidence to support proposal for public funding</strong></h1><h2>Oseltamivir: safety</h2><p>Side effects of oseltamivir include nausea, vomiting, headache and pain and rarely, serious allergic reaction. The use in pregnancy, the elderly and those under 1 year of age hasn\u2019t been well studied in terms of safety and efficacy. Oseltamivir has interactions with some immunosuppressant medications, and may be contraindicated (<i>Product and Consumer Medicine Information Licence</i>, 2022).</p><p>Antiviral resistance to Oseltamivir has been demonstrated, with particularly high risk of resistance in the immunocompromised, in children and when there is mixing of strains (antigenic shift) in outbreaks (Robson C et al., 2022).</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Oseltamivir: efficacy</h2><p>Oseltamivir shortens the duration of symptoms in uncomplicated influenza by approximately one day. There is evidence from low-level evidence trials to suggest oseltamivir reduces rates of pneumonia complications. No effect was found on the rate of hospital admissions&nbsp; (Robson C et al., 2022).</p><p>Effectiveness of the current treatment paradigm (vaccination +/- Oseltamivir) is monitored through the National Influenza Surveillance Scheme Reports. This graph demonstrates the wide range and seasonality of median hospital admission rate for laboratory confirmed influenza between 2015-2019.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cek5PPoQ2YtMSeDsj/zdmnpky3f0ktabdfizkn\"></p><p>Figure 1.Surveillance data on (C) total influenza admissions per week at national sentinel hospitals, Australia, as at 30 September 2020. (Sullivan et al, 2020)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>ECP safety</h2><p>The main risk of blood transfusion as a treatment category is patient misidentification leading to ABO incompatibility and immune reactions (Lifeblood, n.d.). The currently approved ECP system automates this process, to ensure that separation processing with methoxsalen and UV light and reinfusion are done without the potential for patient identification error to be introduced.&nbsp;</p><p>Blood transfusion requires haemodynamic stability, in order to tolerate the small volume loss, so unwell patients must be stabilised first with fluid resuscitation if they are hypotensive or have sepsis. Patients with severe heart failure are unlikely to tolerate the small volume shifts required for treatment, so will need to be assessed by a cardiologist on a case by case basis if their left ventricle ejection fraction is less than 25% (partial contraindication). ECP may be contraindicated in patients with severe coagulopathies, specialist advice is recommended (Mallinckrodt, 2016).&nbsp;</p><p>The system requires anticoagulation, typically with heparinized saline. People with adverse reactions to heparin, such as Heparin Induced Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia, will need specialist advice or close follow up .</p><p>The photosensitising agent methoxsalen is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to psoralens, those with a history of light-sensitive disease (such as patients with systemic lupus erythematosus with photosensitive disease, or those with aphakia). Severe hepatic or renal disease can affect the drug\u2019s metabolism. It is not teratogenic, but shouldn\u2019t be used in breastfeeding mothers (DermNet, 2007).</p><p>Systemic immune reaction (overactivation) may be minimised by the small volume of blood which is photosensitised (Hamblin, 2018, Kasmi et al., 2009, 234-42).&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><h3>ECP effectiveness</h3><p>Ultraviolet irradiation has demonstrated effectiveness to treat viral infection in a number of studies. The exact reduction in hospitalisations needs to be equated to present day hospitalisation rates.</p><p>Existing data describes 151 cases of acute bacterial infection in the blood (bacteraemia), with a 100% non-progression rate to septicaemia (Miley, 1942). A further study demonstrated 56% of presently septic patients recovered uneventfully following UV therapy (Miley, 1944). This limited data suggests this is an efficacious treatment for preventing the extreme inflammatory reactions which confer morbidity in systemic infection. This process has been validated by other studies (Miley, Seidel, Christensen, 1943, Barrett, 1940, Rebbeck 1942).</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Surveillance presently includes sentinel general practice consultations for influenza-like illness, laboratory reports of influenza and absenteeism rates from a national employer, which is proposed to continue as monitoring for efficacy of treatment (DOH, 2022).</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Dose and duration</h2><p>The exact amount of UV A light applied to the blood product is adjusted depending on individual patient variables, particularly body weight. The dose of methoxsalen is standardised for adults and reduced in children (PBS, 2022).</p><p>As influenza does not remain in the body like many other viruses, a course of ECP on two consecutive days is usually sufficient to induce remission. In cases where symptoms are persisting after two weeks, another two consecutive days of ECP may be offered.

It is documented that severe influenza, sepsis and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome all affect quality of life (Chen et al, 2017, Granja, C, 2004, Shah et al, 2021). The severity of each escalates in effect on QoL. Further analysis could be performed to identify ICER for hospitalised versus ICU patients.</p><p>Given oseltamivir reduces duration of symptoms by &lt;24 hours and has no effect on hospitalisation, its effectiveness at preventing hospitalisation, or treating influenza, is close to zero.</p><p>Within the limitations of the underpowered studies demonstrating the use of ECP against infectious disease, estimations of ECP effectiveness at preventing hospitalisation in those at risk would be close to 100% given the favourable non-progression rate to severe disease. However, assuming the most conservative estimate of 56% (successfully treated in already already advanced disease given in Miles, 1942), the below ICER is produced for Year 1/&nbsp;</p><p>Year 1 ICER&nbsp;</p><p>= (Cost of technology 1/effectiveness of technology 1) / (cost of technology 2/effectiveness of technology 2)</p><p>= (141\u2009709\u2009046/ 0.1) / (139\u2009938\u2009107/ 0.56)</p><p>= 5.67</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Budget Impact</h2><p>This budget analysis excludes indirect benefits such as reducing secondary complications, reducing the number of antiviral resistant strains and increasing our responsiveness to epidemics and novel viruses.</p><p>Cost of treatment with oseltamivir can be estimated by present inpatient, outpatient use, plus the cost of hospitalisation via rate, length of stay and average cost of hospital stay.</p><p>Cost = 10 000 x 5 x 2820.75</p><p>= 141,037,500</p><p>Projected inpatient use of the technology would be those currently hospitalised with influenza (10,000 patients per annum).

This will include the Drug Utilisation Sub-Committee monitoring&nbsp; methoxsalen usage, and the MBS Review Taskforce to monitor Australia-specific studies which will emerge in response to this addition to the management algorithm.</p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>5. Relevant ethical, legal, social and implementation issues</strong></h1><h2>Technological resources</h2><p>Initial limitation of machines in large population centres is unlikely to significantly hinder implementation, as studies of viral transmission across Australia have consistently demonstrated major cities are the epicentres of previous influenza epidemics, thus they are the priority locations for antiviral measures to be expanded (Sullivan, 2020).</p><h2>Equity</h2><p>The disease does not affect people equally, leading to disproportionate burdens on the elderly (who may have inadequate seroconversion of vaccination), pregnant women and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Surveillance suggests influenza rates were between 1.9 and 3.7 times higher among those identifying as Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander (DOH, 2022).</p><h2>Health system</h2><p>It is important, also, to consider those 10,000 admissions in the context of a healthcare system which is often at capacity outside of influenza season, and doesn\u2019t have surge capacity for this seasonal change. Improved treatment of Influenza will have flow on benefits to the healthcare system capacity.</p><h2>Human resources</h2><p>ECP requires trained nursing staff who are able to perform cannulation and supervising senior medical staff to confirm eligibility for treatment, lack of contraindications and to be on hand if adverse effects arise.</p><h2>Potential future use&nbsp;</h2><p>Influenza is the starting point, as it is the highest incidence notifiable disease in Australia, However, multiple diseases and pathogens can be addressed with this therapy, notably viruses which are likely to cause future epidemics and pandemics.</p><h1><br><strong>6.

GCRs are defined as those with the potential to harm human well-being on a global scale. Although various risks that meet this definition have been identified, this work focuses on the risks associated with artificial intelligence (AI), biological risks, and abrupt sunlight reduction scenarios (ASRS).</p><p>These risks represent global challenges that require international cooperation and adequate management. Various stakeholders have shared their growing concern around GCRs. Among them is the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) (Appendix 1 - UNDRR interview), the World Economic Forum (WEF), as well as civil society organizations and research centers. To prevent them, countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, and Norway have articulated their own local efforts, such as legislation and national plans.</p><p>For its part, Latin America has had to strengthen its institutions and coordination mechanisms at the national and regional levels due to its high exposure to these risks. Although a minority of Latin American countries have implemented some strategies to prevent, mitigate, or respond directly or indirectly to GCRs, efforts are limited. Despite this, we highlight that, in the past, the region has demonstrated its capacity to contribute to initiatives related to nuclear disarmament and the elimination of biological weapons.</p><p>In this context, we recommend that Latin America stay informed to face other emerging threats. Lack of preparation jeopardizes its stability and progress, significantly impacting key areas such as the economy and public health. Based on the three risks of interest, a series of measures are proposed for the countries of the region:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6KZApAHng6yAcXTTd/l25cd4qgnd7rwqi6sdza\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6KZApAHng6yAcXTTd/gjdfug4wcfj5icaufpwc 90w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6KZApAHng6yAcXTTd/rpmqh66qmdg9wh6dv3wv 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6KZApAHng6yAcXTTd/ybuel3nhrl3ab9ezfyaj 270w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6KZApAHng6yAcXTTd/sekrqnagpbvukfr8wskr 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6KZApAHng6yAcXTTd/gxg9eg9gvbjzrn0h3hmr 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6KZApAHng6yAcXTTd/kshhptkjnutgwkgcttrh 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6KZApAHng6yAcXTTd/sehhrxymfv7hmsalimr9 630w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6KZApAHng6yAcXTTd/ahmbmxu9rgvpmfaotwdf 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6KZApAHng6yAcXTTd/e6t7yfmcprbgc9gqajae 810w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6KZApAHng6yAcXTTd/rqvqv9cadlcsw1xh3alx 824w\"></figure><p>Based on the work we have carried out, we conclude that Latin America will benefit from adopting a wider perspective and a proactive attitude in adequately managing catastrophic risks. This implies recognizing biases, strengthening institutions, and promoting anticipatory governance that addresses regional vulnerabilities. Once this \u201crisk knowledge\u201d has been accumulated, we recommend that the region strengthen its prevention and mitigation capabilities.</p><h3><strong>Infographics</strong></h3><p><strong>Download &nbsp;</strong><a

You can also find all financial and investment information there.<br><br>Peter invests in BOAS because we are both driven by the moral ambition to save lives, and because I believe he understands the impact multiplier and potential of BOAS and its profit for good model.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is BOAS?</strong></p><p>BOAS is on a mission to Save Jeans and Save Lives, but there\u2019s a problem: vintage shopping is slow. Poor photos, vague sizing and endless back-and-forth with sellers you don\u2019t know. So you buy new, fuelling the extreme pollution of the fast fashion industry (10% of global emissions, 93 trillion liters of water used yearly), leaving vintage jeans to be burnt or ending in up in toxic landfill. And that's where BOAS comes in.</p><p>BOAS makes vintage fashion buying 10 times faster. We\u2019re fast <strong>vintage</strong> fashion. How? With our unique 'take the price or take the risk\u2019 model - you either buy the jeans at the current price or take the risk and wait for the price to drop.<br><br>We also buy in bulk (with an 80% gross margin), ensuring unmatched quality, trendy finds, clear photos, accurate descriptions and fast shipping and returns. With BOAS, everyone can embrace vintage fashion in minutes, so busy people like you can now buy vintage fashion in minutes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Results</strong></p><p>We launched in march and have quickly grown revenue to \u20ac8K per month. Our product return rate is at 10% (fast fashion online retailers are at 40%+) and 16% of our customers have already bought again. Our last 10 verified reviews were 4.8/5. We have also recently opened up a store to combine online with offline. The company is valued at \u20ac1.62 million. We require significant funding to build the fastest vintage fashion platform. We are raising \u20ac584K to invest in the technology, working capital, operating expenses, marketing and personnel.</p><p>This market is more than \u20ac200 billion annually and grows at 25% per year. European legislation and the demand for sustainable and affordable (i.e. second hand) is likely to sustain this large growth %.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why you should invest too</strong><br>By far the easiest and fastest way to understand why we believe we should accelerate the Profit for Good systems change is Brad West's <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL6gcZAdiHI\">TED talk</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Businesses are money multipliers for investors. Their aim is to generate the maximum possible return for investors. They are the source of almost all the wealth and philanthropy in the world. BOAS is a money multiplier for investors too, but the recipients (for 90% of profits) are effective charities like The Against Malaria Foundation. This might make BOAS an efficient and sustainable money multiplier for effective charities. We believe initiating and accelerating the Profit for Good systems change might have even larger effects than the direct impact of our business and the profits it donates.&nbsp;</p><p>Without philanthropic investors this is not going to take off. Regular investors require maximum returns and impact investors invest in business that generate impact, but still generate returns for the investor. If you currently donate to effective charities, investing in a money multiplier like BOAS that returns profits to these effective charities could generate more impact in the future, and you would be investing in the Profit for Good systems change.&nbsp;</p><p>You can email me directly at vin at boas.co with questions (e.g. legal, fiscal) about investing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why you shouldn't invest&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>EA's point out that global health in their opinion isn't as effective as other areas</li><li>EA's point out that our team, idea, market or team could not be the best.

We argue that Profit for Good companies are more effective money multipliers because all stakeholders except investors seem to prefer business that work for a better world. The <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mq97ho2PMBbphDJzK/why-guided-consumption-can-work\">data</a> suggests that foundation owned businesses live longer and are at least as profitable.

We point out that FTX was not a profit for good business (SBF was a philanthropist and part of a system we'd like to change) and BOAS operates a circular fashion platform, not a ponzi scheme. Our business is sustainable and affordable for our users and has a positive impact on its own that's multiplied by donating profits effectively.

The weights of a frontier model are a high value target for attackers because once an attacker has access to the models\u2019 weight, the safety restraints can then be fine-tuned out cheaply and quickly (See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20624\"><u>Lermen et al (2023)</u></a> for a demonstration with Llama 2). As model capabilities increase in the next few years (think GPT-6) the theft of a frontier AI model could therefore carry significant risks.</p><p>Establishing and maintaining strong security is difficult and expensive, however, and may come at the cost of advances in capabilities. Companies that prioritise capabilities over security and disregard the wider risks of a potential breach could therefore gain a competitive advantage over companies that invest in security, creating an incentive to defect against weak agreements. We therefore have to ensure all leading companies have security that can withstand attacks from persistent, well-resourced attackers in order to effectively reduce the risks, even when it may conflict with their competitive self-interest.</p><p>Last summer I focused on how to improve on the status quo as part of the Non-Trivial Fellowship with Beck Peterson and Ludwig Illies. We came first in both the main prize and AI Governance Grand Challenge, winning $17,000 total for our policy proposals on improving the AI industry\u2019s information security. Our approach involves applying proven security practices from other high-stakes industries, building on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/frontier-model-security\"><u>Anthropic\u2019s proposals back in June</u></a>. The rest of this post is the document we submitted along with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45i4Gj9eumE\"><u>video</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/17VCUeEQXNnObl95Vh1U_b5idbiBBDI-rZAD-oruT8pY/edit?usp=drive_link\"><u>a list of relevant security practices</u></a>.</p><p>A lot of the specifics on companies and governments are now out of date as AI governance has developed very quickly in past months. In particular, it does not include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy\"><u>Anthopic\u2019s Responsible Scaling Policies</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/safety/preparedness\"><u>OpenAI\u2019s Preparedness framework</u></a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/openai-the-battle-of-the-board\"><u>the recent events at OpenAI</u></a>, and I\u2019m still unclear on how these change the recommendations.</p><p>Some of the dates and plans in the document have also been revised. We haven\u2019t been able to follow through on the security survey and report due to lack of free time and don\u2019t plan to in the next year. The targets of self-regulation by 2027 and government regulation by 2030 are still useful though, and might even be too conservative given the recent enthusiasm from governments.</p><p>This is a long post, so I\u2019d recommend skipping to the most important sections: the Theory of Change and Status Quo make the case for why we need security regulation, Key Design Parameters goes into the details of implementation, and Updating the Policy gives a structure for improving the policy with time.</p><h1>Executive Summary</h1><p>Frontier AI models are \u2018highly capable foundation models that could possess dangerous capabilities sufficient to pose severe risks to public safety\u2019 (<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/frontier-ai-regulation\"><u>Anderljung et al., 2023</u></a>).</p><p>Frontier model security is strong for the software industry, but not strong enough to defend against persistent, skilled, well-resourced attackers on the scale of nation-states. As frontier AI models become more capable, we expect attacks against them to scale too.</p><p>The theft or unauthorized release of a frontier AI model could threaten national security, destabilize the economy and society, and accelerate race dynamics by erasing existing competitive advantages.</p><p>In particular, if a frontier AI model is misaligned or has dangerous capabilities, then release could pose global catastrophic or existential risk, both directly and as a risk factor for other risks. We are on the precipice of such potential existential threats.</p><p>We propose the implementation of advanced security practices to raise the security baseline and to bring these risks to the forefront of the AI industry. With this preparation, we can accelerate responses when attacks become more capable, thus reducing the associated risks.</p><p>To achieve this, we argue for the development of a set of standard practices for frontier AI model security. For high-security practices, we propose the implementation of relevant security practices from high-consequence industries, such as aviation. Practices developed in these industries have been effective at protecting against hostile attacks, and much of the work in developing these practices has already been done.</p><p>Alongside this, we underscore the difficulty in communicating the need for increased security and ensuring secure implementation.</p><h3>Key takeaways</h3><ul><li>Frontier AI models are compact, easily transmitted and incredibly valuable, making them a key target for attackers.</li><li>Frontier AI models are fundamentally software, making them difficult to defend.</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fbw9phtyyDnJjbuRS/non-trivial-winner-setting-a-high-standard-for-frontier#Risks_being_addressed\"><u>The breach and proliferation of an advanced frontier AI model, such as an AGI, carries significant risks</u></a>.

There is consistent compliance with compulsory and voluntary standards for both data protection and information security (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-home\"><u>Microsoft</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/\"><u>Amazon</u></a>), e.g., GDPR, CCPA, and ISO/IEC 27001, and many companies have responsible disclosure and \u2018bug bounty\u2019 systems in place for reporting of security vulnerabilities (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bugcrowd.com/openai\"><u>OpenAI</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://huntr.mlsecops.com/\"><u>Protect AI\u2019s Huntr</u></a>). Adversarial testing, or \u2018red teaming\u2019, of models and security systems is also widely used.</p><p>Frontier AI model development has high risk of attack from well-resourced, persistent, malicious actors, as well as security failures leading to similar risks to national and international security and stability. For example, a frontier model could design novel biological and chemical weapons (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/frontier-threats-red-teaming-for-ai-safety\"><u>Anthropic\u2019s biological weapons red-teaming</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00465-9.epdf?sharing_token=2oQ1NVJJiX6BFW4UuywoTdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0M6VuGuVWKcBJFL5U5ocXOA5zcnGmZOUPQzouuai7vI0XuOG1hxcfSUpHakkMxyD1NjtXRFBgFxUa9ZQI7okPtQc-7YkJa4BSKUXZqV75Cr1BQONFfkK_B6nn67L7Rh7c_Rcj4HuT9ttD0uL2oOh-fC9VeBzPDFKHSOCp9wkWjS8x9useGbDZcjSokuMYPSdIk%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.theverge.com\"><u>Repurposing a drug discovery model for chemical weapons development</u></a> (Urbina et al., 2022)). However the security standard is much weaker than similarly high-stakes industries. Industries such as aviation and nuclear power have strict regulations to ensure their security, but no such expectation, regulatory or social, exists for leading AI companies.</p><p>To secure frontier AI models, all aspects of their development must be addressed, from data collection and model training to parameter protection and access monitoring. Two main considerations&nbsp; are the training data and the model itself. Data protection involves ensuring the integrity and security of training data by verifying the sources and contents of the data, removing any potentially dangerous data, and securely encrypting the data during transmission and storage. The model\u2019s parameters must then be protected during training and deployment. This is particularly difficult as parameters are both incredibly valuable and condensed, but also easily duplicated and transmitted.</p><p>Applying proven security practices from other high-risk industries such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/frontier-model-security\"><u>two-party control</u></a> used in nuclear security is a first step. We argue this approach of identifying and implementing proven practices should be applied to frontier model security across the industry.</p><h2>Risks being addressed</h2><p>The breach of a capable frontier model could occur in a wide range of ways and have huge negative impacts.</p><p>We break the information security risks during frontier model development and deployment down into four types: accident, system, insider, and attack risks.</p><ul><li>Accident risk - any unintentional leak of information through an error, malfunction, or mistake</li><li>System risk - a persistent information leak due to flaws in system design</li><li>Insider risk - an intentional security breach by someone with authorized access to the information</li><li>Attack risk - A security breach by external, unauthorized actors. This includes stealing or accessing the model, or compromising the data or algorithms used to train or run the model</li></ul><p>Note that this list is likely not comprehensive.</p><p>With access to the parameters, an attacker would be able to retrain the model for malicious purposes and potentially publish it online.</p><p>The successful destruction, theft, or publication of a frontier AI model then carries the following risks, among others:</p><h3><strong>Threats to national security</strong></h3><p><strong>Political interference</strong></p><p>Targeted political advertising and misinformation has already been seen in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal\"><u>Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections\"><u>Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections</u></a>. Access to a frontier model would exacerbate the problem.</p><p><strong>Terrorism</strong></p><p>It has been shown that models can be used in the biological and chemical weapons design and implementation process. Parameter access to frontier models could therefore facilitate terrorism on an unprecedented scale. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/frontier-threats-red-teaming-for-ai-safety\"><u>Anthropic\u2019s biological weapons red-teaming</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-022-00465-9.epdf?sharing_token=2oQ1NVJJiX6BFW4UuywoTdRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0M6VuGuVWKcBJFL5U5ocXOA5zcnGmZOUPQzouuai7vI0XuOG1hxcfSUpHakkMxyD1NjtXRFBgFxUa9ZQI7okPtQc-7YkJa4BSKUXZqV75Cr1BQONFfkK_B6nn67L7Rh7c_Rcj4HuT9ttD0uL2oOh-fC9VeBzPDFKHSOCp9wkWjS8x9useGbDZcjSokuMYPSdIk%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.theverge.com\"><u>Repurposing a drug discovery model for chemical weapons development</u></a> (Urbina et al., 2022).</p><h3><strong>Geopolitical implications</strong></h3><p>International access to the most advanced frontier AI models would lose the USA its competitive advantage, destabilizing international politics and trade.</p><p>Frontier model theft could also come from hostile state actors, raising tensions, deepening divisions, and increasing the risk of great power conflict, even if the source of the breach was uncertain.</p><h3><strong>Rapid economic instability and societal disruption</strong></h3><p>Mass proliferation of an advanced frontier model could allow for simultaneous replacement of human labor and huge economic growth. If done too quickly, this could destabilize the economy and markets. This would lead to huge disruption to the status quo, with possibilities of rioting or revolt and dangerous concentration of profits among select corporations that exploited the shift.</p><h3><strong>Intensified race dynamics</strong></h3><p>Universal access to a private, advanced frontier model would eliminate any competitive advantage through intellectual property. Companies would push to progress more rapidly, likely at the expense of safety and security precautions. This would accelerate capabilities timelines and increase competition:</p><p>a) Between companies, and</p><p>b) Between countries.</p><p><strong>a) Between companies</strong></p><p>The uncontrolled proliferation of a cutting-edge frontier model would erase existing competitive advantages based on intellectual property. This loses industry leaders their advantage and gives less successful companies the opportunity to get ahead. Advantages in talent and compute would remain, but the open-source community would make the breached model available for free.&nbsp;</p><p>All AI companies would be incentivised to rapidly develop the capabilities of their models in order to maintain profits and stay competitive. This could come at the expense of AI safety and security, particularly from companies without a talent or compute advantage, increasing the risk of further breaches and potentially catastrophic misalignment.</p><p><strong>b) Between countries</strong></p><p>The same dynamic applies internationally. Trailing countries would be incentivised to invest in their model development programs, accelerating timelines, endangering international cooperation, and hindering safety efforts.</p><h2>How will policymakers measure efficacy?</h2><p>The security industry already has a strong precedent of monitoring and reporting attacks and vulnerabilities;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bsigroup.com/globalassets/localfiles/en-gb/iso-27001/pdf/v2.0_27001_implementation_guide.pdf\"><u>ISO/IEC 27001:2022</u></a>, the main international information security standard, contains \u2018Section 9 - performance evaluation\u2019 (see page 4).</p><p>The policy can be assessed through these existing systems, with measurement of efficacy through both attack reports and general incident and issue reporting.</p><p>Specifically, we believe confidential sharing of attacks on frontier AI models with policymakers would help evaluate the efficacy of the policy. Sharing would include detailed information on attacks that were fully stopped, partially stopped, and not stopped to give a full understanding to policymakers.</p><h1>Key Design Parameters</h1><p>Who the policy applies to</p><p><strong>The policy applies to any company developing frontier AI models</strong>, under the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/frontier-ai-regulation\"><u>Anderljung et al. (2023) definition</u></a> of \u2018highly capable foundation models that could possess dangerous capabilities sufficient to pose severe risks to public safety\u2019.</p><p>Currently, this consists of six groups: Amazon, Anthropic, Google (including Google DeepMind), Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI. These companies have the most well-known and capable models and are key targets for well-resourced malicious attackers. Except for Google DeepMind in London, UK, the current group is concentrated in only two states of the USA, California and Washington, making full coverage by the policy easier. We suggest focusing on establishing US regulation first, and then expanding to other countries.</p><p>As more resources are allocated to frontier model development,&nbsp;<strong>we expect the number of companies within the policy\u2019s scope to increase</strong>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/revisiting-algorithmic-progress\"><u>Improvements in training algorithms</u></a> will lower the cost of training models with today\u2019s cutting-edge capabilities, e.g., GPT-4, Claude, DALL-E. We predict this will be balanced by continued compute scaling and the cost of frontier model training will continue to increase over the next 5 years. However, this will likely be outpaced by increased investment, leading to more companies joining frontier model development in the next 5 years and coming within the policy\u2019s scope.</p><p>In which situations the policy applies</p><p>Within a given company,&nbsp;<strong>we suggest only applying the policy to systems and people involved in frontier model development and deployment</strong>. This limits the costs and inconvenience of new security practices and concentrates the security benefits to where they are most needed.</p><p>Included systems and personnel would include:</p><ul><li>Compute clusters for training the models</li><li>Training data for the models</li><li>Frontier model parameters</li><li>Technical employees working on frontier AI models</li><li>Non-technical employees connected to frontier AI models</li></ul><p>How the policy will be enforced</p><p>Following our two-stage implementation, enforcement will come from two groups:</p><ol><li><strong>In the first stage, we propose companies enforce the policies internally</strong>, as we aim to ride the current push for collaboration and safety. The downside of this is that companies will self-regulate any commitments, likely leading to partial or ineffective adoption from some. This compromise forms a placeholder solution for accelerated adoption.</li><li><strong>In the second stage, the policy will be government-regulated</strong> by either a new US regulatory body for AI, if one is created, or a state department such as the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) who already have experience conducting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/resilience-services\"><u>security assessments</u></a>.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;Enforcement is covered in more depth in the next section,&nbsp;<i>Comparing Implementations</i>.</p><h2><strong>Who will verify the policy\u2019s implementation</strong></h2><p>Different groups will verify effective implementation as regulation transfers from self-regulation to governmental regulation through the hybrid transition period.</p><p><strong>Initially, companies will verify implementation through existing internal auditing and reporting systems, and regular third-party compliance reviews</strong>. Both methods are already in use in large software companies to review information security management systems, so any security practices implemented under the policy would likely be automatically included.</p><p><strong>After initial industry adoption, we recommend incorporating frontier model security evaluations into existing state systems</strong>, such as the CISA\u2019s review system, as they already have the experience and knowledge to make accurate assessments of high-security sectors. This is from a shallow investigation, however; we have not investigated the efficacy of these assessments, and there are likely better solutions.</p><h2><strong>Timescales</strong></h2><p>Frontier model capabilities are rapidly improving along with investment in the sector. This makes them very high value targets, as outlined in \u2018<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fbw9phtyyDnJjbuRS/non-trivial-winner-setting-a-high-standard-for-frontier#Theory_of_Change\"><u>Theory of Change</u></a>\u2019, and a rapid, unforeseen improvement in capabilities could lead to a rapid increase in attacks while security systems are still unprepared.</p><p>Therefore, we have to pre-empt these potential disjoints through quick, effective implementation.&nbsp;<strong>We aim for adoption of advanced security practices in three companies by the end of 2025, unanimous frontier model industry commitment by 2027, and government regulation and accountability by 2030. We recognise that this timeline is uncertain</strong>. There would be significant overlap between these goals, but these markers will be updated as we learn more about the object-level state of AI governance.</p><h2><strong>How often the policy will be updated</strong></h2><p>Considering how rapidly the frontier model industry moves,&nbsp;<strong>we recommend updating the policy and set of standard security practices twice-yearly</strong>. The policy aims to pre-empt future advances in attacker capabilities, which will likely move with the frontier model industry, so a regular, short review cycle to add, remove and update the standard is essential.</p><p>Reviewing the proposal is covered in more depth in \u2018Updating the Policy\u2019</p><p>How long the policy will last for</p><p>We expect our involvement in this policy to last for less than five years (80% certainty as a ballpark), and likely less than two years (60%), as we either fail to get it implemented or it gets taken over by the industry or government.</p><p>That being said, there is no end date for high security unless there is a fundamental change in the ongoing offense-defence arms race. This policy could continue to be updated for decades, as it provides a general system for improvements.</p><h1>Comparing Implementations</h1><p>Security can be improved through suggestions, commitments, and standards, with each meeting varying levels of precision. These can either be trust-based, relying on cooperation, or enforced by a regulatory body, either private or public.</p><p>A standard is best for securing frontier model development as it can enforce specific security strategies, such as zero-trust architecture, and provides a clear security requirement. The recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/\"><u>White House Voluntary Commitments</u></a> include undetailed but high-level security assurances, so a concrete, actionable standard to implement these commitments is the next step.</p><h2>Enforcement</h2><p><strong>The standard could be enforced by the government, a private third-party, or the companies themselves</strong>. Based on our theory of change, we will approach companies first, as that seems to be the fastest path to impact.</p><p>Government enforcement is most effective as penalties can be used to ensure cooperation, but may face bureaucratic and political obstacles and take longer to implement.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/about-nist\"><u>NIST</u>&nbsp;</a>is the key public standards development organization (SDO) in the United States, and groups such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nrc.gov/security/faq-security-assess-nuc-pwr-plants.html\"><u>Nuclear Regulatory Commission</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/resilience-services\"><u>Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency</u></a> (CISA)&nbsp; conduct assessments of high-security facilities.</p><p>Private organizations, either for-profit or non-profit, circumvent these difficulties and can adapt faster, making them better suited for quick implementation. The incentives of these groups, however, can be misaligned with securing frontier AI models, e.g. if a non-profit organization relies on donations from the companies it is regulating.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ietf.org/about/introduction/\"><u>The IETF</u></a> is a good example of an effective non-profit SDO that establishes standards for the Internet.</p><p>Self-enforcement by companies, or mutual enforcement between them, do not require a regulatory body and are therefore faster to implement and adapt. One existing method is a self-reporting system, which relies on company reputation and industry expectations of cautious openness. However, the companies are not impartial here and may have conflicting interests, leading to weak enforcement. Existing groups, such as the Frontier Model Forum, are yet to produce results as of August 2023, but effective industry-led groups are possible: the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/about_us/\"><u>PCI Security Standards Council</u></a> is a strong example of standard creation and self-enforced adoption from the payments industry.</p><h2>Coordination</h2><p>The security standard must be widely adopted long-term. There are several leading companies in model development and a breach in any advanced system is dangerous, so all frontier systems must be secured.</p><p>Self-regulation is not sufficient long-term, as companies can act unilaterally and invest less money into security in order to gain a competitive advantage. On the other hand, it requires less coordination to implement practices, so it is still a strong first step.</p><p>For practical implementation, we plan for adoption from one company at a time to ease the process and make improvements. However, this policy could be adopted by all 7 leading companies at once under \u2018<i>3 - Invest in cybersecurity and insider threat safeguards to protect proprietary and unreleased model weights</i>\u2019 from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Ensuring-Safe-Secure-and-Trustworthy-AI.pdf\"><u>Voluntary Commitments</u></a>.</p><h2>Our Recommendation</h2><p>A high-precision standard that is externally enforced would best ensure consistent security across the industry. However, this would require a regulatory organization, either public or private, increasing time to implementation.</p><p>Considering the urgency of securing frontier AI models, we suggest a four-stage implementation:</p><ol><li><strong>By 2025</strong>: a&nbsp;<strong>security survey and report for AI companies&nbsp;</strong>detailing the need for greater security and making suggestions for highly beneficial practices</li><li><strong>By 2026</strong>: internally verified&nbsp;<strong>voluntary implementation of specific advanced security practices in three companies</strong></li><li><strong>By 2027</strong>: industry-wide&nbsp;<strong>voluntary commitment to a specific set of security practices</strong> (examples outlined in the Appendix). Companies will self-regulate initially.</li><li><strong>By 2030</strong>: an industry transition to&nbsp;<strong>government-enforced frontier model information security requirements</strong>, once the necessary regulatory bodies have been established. The transition period between these may involve increasing government enforcement through groups such as the CISA.</li></ol><h1>Technical Features of AI&nbsp;</h1><h2>Computation metrics</h2><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/the-ai-triad-and-what-it-means-for-national-security-strategy/\"><u>AI Triad</u></a> of compute, algorithms, and training data, combined with model size measured in number of parameters, provides the key technical metrics for evaluating the resources used to train a frontier model.</p><p>The two points relevant to our policy are:</p><ol><li>Language model capabilities scale with model size, dataset size, and compute used in training (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361\"><u>Kaplan et al., 2020</u></a>).</li><li>\u201cevery 9 months, the introduction of better algorithms [to computer vision models] contribute the equivalent of a doubling of compute budgets\u201d, (\u2018<a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/revisiting-algorithmic-progress\"><u>Revisiting Algorithmic Progress</u></a>\u2019; see Figure 1)</li></ol><p>Figure 1: a breakdown of computer vision model improvements over time according to the AI Triad.

(2023) definition</u></a> of frontier AI models:</p><p>\u2018highly capable foundation models that could possess dangerous capabilities sufficient to pose severe risks to public safety.\u2019</p><p>And the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/resource/foundation-models-explainer/\"><u>Ada Lovelace Institute\u2019s definition</u></a> of foundation models:</p><p>\u2018Foundation models are AI models designed to produce a wide and general variety of outputs. They are capable of a range of possible tasks and applications, such as text, image or audio generation. They can be standalone systems or can be used as a \u2018base\u2019 for many other applications.\u2019</p><p>We define Narrow AI as:</p><p>\u2018Any model trained to perform a specific task with few, or no, wider applications\u2019.</p><p><strong>Our policy would cover only frontier model security to reduce costs and inconvenience while still securing the most potentially dangerous models</strong>. Narrow AI, such as Inflection\u2019s Pi, are considered out of scope and would not be included at this stage.</p><p>Capability evaluations will be key in determining the potential risk of a frontier model if breached, with groups like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://metr.org/\"><u>METR</u></a><u> </u>already doing promising work on self-replication in this area. We anticipate the development of more extensive evaluation systems in the next few years, and will use these as they are created to judge the risk of a given frontier model.</p><p>Within frontier AI models, we suggest using company valuation for comparisons of model value. Company valuation represents the value the company provides to the public, and, as a proxy, the value of their model. Companies with higher valuations have higher-value models, and will thus be the targets of more attacks of higher sophistication. Public valuation and investment will be most useful when comparing between frontier model companies as there may be narrow AI companies, such as Inflection, which have capital from investment but whose models do not pose a significant threat if breached.</p><h1>Relevant policymakers</h1><p>We think the most relevant policymakers differ for the two phases of the policy, with decision-makers in companies most important for bottom-up governance, and Congress most important for top-down regulation.</p><h2>Individual Companies</h2><p>Our policy can be implemented on a company-by-company basis. This is more targeted and eliminates coordination problems, but full coverage is slower than multilateral industry adoption.</p><p>The speed and precision of individual adoption is well-suited to our first stage of adoption of advanced practices by the end of 2025. With this, we\u2019re aiming to expand the Overton window for which security practices are standard or reasonable to make later industry adoption easier.</p><h2>Industry Bodies</h2><h3>Frontier Model Forum</h3><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/frontier-model-forum\"><u>Frontier Model Forum</u></a>, currently Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, is \u201c<i>an industry body focused on ensuring safe and responsible development of frontier AI models</i>\u201d. Two of its four core objectives are relevant to frontier model security:</p><ol><li>\u201c<i>Advancing AI safety research to promote responsible development of frontier AI models, minimize risks, and enable independent, standardized evaluations of capabilities and safety.</i></li><li><i><strong>Identifying best practices for the responsible development and deployment of frontier AI models</strong></i>\u201d</li></ol><p>Our proposal turns the second objective into a concrete, actionable policy that can be adopted by the Frontier Model Forum and, in turn, four of the major companies in frontier model development</p><h2>National government</h2><h3>The United States</h3><p>The White House has shown support for responsible private AI development with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/\"><u>White House Voluntary AI Commitments</u></a>, and also for improving cybersecurity in federal systems and critical infrastructure with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/28/national-security-memorandum-on-improving-cybersecurity-for-critical-infrastructure-control-systems/\"><u>National Security Memorandum on cybersecurity in critical infrastructure</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/\"><u>Executive Order 14028: Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity</u></a>. These concrete outputs are promising, but the Voluntary Commitments already cover frontier model security in vague terms, and the White House is likely most relevant for publicity and gaining support for regulation, not for specific, detailed legislation.</p><p>Congress also holds significant power and has already expressed interest in AI governance. The United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law has already had two hearings from CEOs, academics, and think tank leaders (<a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/oversight-of-ai-rules-for-artificial-intelligence\"><u>May</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/oversight-of-ai-rules-for-artificial-intelligence\"><u>quotes</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/committee-activity/hearings/oversight-of-ai-principles-for-regulation\"><u>July</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/67zFQT4GeJdgvdFuk/partial-transcript-of-recent-senate-hearing-discussing-ai-x\"><u>partial transcript</u></a>) with a focus on the risks from AI and potential regulation. These hearings have not produced any concrete initiatives yet, but they demonstrate Congress\u2019 current bipartisan recognition of the risks posed by AI. As a result,&nbsp;<strong>we see Congress as a promising policymaker long-term for implementing fundamental legislation on responsible AI development and deployment</strong>.</p><h3>The United Kingdom</h3><p>Although most frontier AI models are currently located in the US, Britain developed a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-ai-strategy\"><u>national AI strategy</u></a> in December 2022. These efforts by Britain to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/artificial-intelligence-sector-deal/ai-sector-deal\"><u>increase its influence within the AI sector</u></a> and set \u201can example in the safe and ethical deployment of AI\u201d makes them worthy of consideration.</p><p>The Foundation Models Taskforce, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmawoollacott/2023/08/17/uk-announces-ai-safety-summit-says-it-hopes-to-lead-the-world/?sh=35a605db7528\"><u>global AI summit at Bletchley Park in November</u></a> are the two most promising outputs of this strategy to date.</p><p>Our policy could complement the statement, \u201cThe UK public sector will lead the way by setting an example for the safe and ethical deployment of AI through how it governs its own use of the technology\u201d, by providing a framework for company self-regulation.&nbsp;The UK also created the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aistandardshub.org/\"><u>AI standards hub</u></a> in 2022, although its output is limited so far.</p><h1>Existing Governance Structures</h1><h2>Other industries with a similar policy</h2><p>Frontier model security is unprecedented in its difficulty, but not its class of attackers. Both public and private industries have been the target of well-resourced, persistent, and knowledgeable malicious actors: nuclear power and weapons, aviation, and finance are three key examples.</p><p>The security systems around weapons of mass destruction and nuclear power are particularly relevant as they include concrete information security, physical security, personnel security, and cybersecurity practices that are applicable to frontier model security.</p><p>These include:</p><ul><li>Two-party control</li><li>Insider threat programs</li><li>Air-gapping</li><li>Safety and security by design</li><li>Building a security culture</li></ul><h3>Why can these policies be applied to AI?</h3><p>The theft of a highly capable frontier model carries destabilization and disruption risks through escalation of race dynamics and misuse risk in a similar way to weapons of mass destruction or nuclear fuel. These risks must be mitigated, so similar approaches are called for.</p><h2>Expanding on existing laws and regulations</h2><p><strong>We aim to build off the precedent of the&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/\"><strong><u>White House Voluntary Commitments</u></strong></a><strong>, signed by seven leading AI companies. All major companies developing frontier AI models have signed these Voluntary Commitments.&nbsp;</strong>They include:</p><ul><li>\u201cInvest in cybersecurity and insider threat safeguards to protect proprietary and unreleased model weights\u201d</li></ul><p>Our policy is a concrete way to fulfill this commitment, which may make it more appealing to these companies. The White House is also drafting an Executive Order to follow up on the Voluntary Commitments.</p><h2>Mandates of existing departments / public offices</h2><p>Standards development organizations (SDOs) and US federal agencies are both relevant for the top-down phase of regulation.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</strong> and the<strong> International Organization for Standardisation (ISO)</strong> are the most relevant SDOs. These two groups develop key information security and cybersecurity standards, such as the Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 and SP-800 Series from NIST, and ISO/IEC 27001:2022 from the ISO and International Electrotechnical Commission.</p><p>While these groups are not well-suited to quick development and implementation, they may, however, be useful for formalizing the standard practices long-term.</p><p>The Department of Homeland Security, Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and the National Security Agency are the most relevant federal agencies for our policy, since they already have experience with securing critical systems. Within these,&nbsp;<strong>we see getting machine learning models classified as critical infrastructure as part of the Information Technology Sector as an important long-term goal&nbsp;</strong>to ensure public funding of security measures and safety research<strong>.&nbsp;</strong><u>This may have downside risk, and we have not done a deep investigation into the potential implications of classing AI as critical infrastructure.</u></p><h1>Updating the Policy</h1><p>Updating the policy while maintaining security is the key difficulty here. A precautionary approach here is needed as trial and error is not an option with such high stakes. We suggest pre-emptively implementing high-security practices, and removing any that have been shown to be ineffective through a bi-annual review system.</p><p>We expect containment of frontier AI models to become much more difficult as models become more powerful for several reasons:</p><ol><li>Attackers will spend more resources on trying to steal, destroy, or disrupt frontier AI models as their capabilities and value increase.</li><li>Publicly available and privately developed AI models will likely become better at offensive cyber attacks, reducing the costs of an effective attack and reducing barriers to entry for attackers.</li><li>Models may not be fully aligned and attempt to break out of the system and self-replicate through the Internet.</li></ol><p>These will all require more stringent security measures. Examples include:</p><ul><li>Air-gapping: full isolation of any system involved in frontier model development. This could potentially apply to deployment too, though further research is needed to determine whether this is necessary.</li><li>Escalating insider threat programs: moving from basic personnel screening to rigorous, regular review systems, e.g., the US military\u2019s Nuclear Weapons Personnel Reliability Program<ul><li>\u201c<i>Only those individuals who demonstrate the highest levels of integrity and dependability will be chosen for PRP duties.</i>\u201d - from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodm/521042m.pdf?ver=Lz33lec_zNZpLZFrNyl2zw%3d%3d\"><u>PRP manual</u></a></li></ul></li></ul><p>We suggest a regular twice-yearly review system to implement these additions, on top of the option to make emergency updates if unknown vulnerabilities are exploited by attackers.&nbsp;<strong>These changes may not be publicly published; this gives companies time to implement policies without publicizing existing vulnerabilities</strong>.</p><p>These reviews would also include improving on or removing practices that have been shown to be ineffective, either through a successful attack through or around the practice, or a demonstrated technical vulnerability that has not yet been exploited, e.g., a known zero-day vulnerability.</p><p>Some relevant areas for evaluating a practice include: coverage; security benefits; usability; time to implement; cost to implement; running costs / reliability; compatibility with existing systems; scalability; relevant metrics / transparency; adaptability and resilience; and any historical attacks against the practice, both failed and successful.</p>", "user": {"username": "XaviCF"}}, {"_id": "rWRSvRxAco2bLoXKr", "title": "[Podcast + Transcript] AMA: Founder and CEO of AMF, Rob Mather", "postedAt": "2024-01-08T16:39:32.986Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This is a <strong>transcript </strong>for the AMA with Rob Mather, CEO of AMF, which I recorded live on the 19th of December.

I'm Toby Tremlett, the EA Forum's content manager. If you're interested in effective altruism, you've probably heard of Rob's charity, the Against Malaria Foundation. For almost two decades, they've been doing crucial work to protect people, especially children, from malaria.&nbsp;</p><p>To date, around 450 million people have been protected with malaria bed nets from this charity. Once all of their currently funded nets have been distributed, AMF estimates it would have prevented 185,000 deaths. And it's not just AMF saying this, they've been a GiveWell Top Charity since 2009.&nbsp;</p><p>So to get straight into the AMA, we're going to keep the answers pretty short and snappy. I think Rob said he's going to stick to two minutes per answer. And yeah, Rob, thank you for making the time for coming along for this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rob Mather:</strong> Pleasure.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp;</strong>On the theme of making the time, <strong>somebody said that they've organized two small fundraisers with AMF, and in both cases, you were incredibly proactive and helpful, taking time to immediately respond to emails and hop onto calls. They say many thanks, but a question remains, where do you find the time and which time management strategies do you use?</strong> You have two minutes of time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rob Mather:</strong> I don't use any particular strategies, I'm afraid. I think what I would say is we certainly leverage technology here, so that a lot of the things that I perhaps would normally do as a CEO of a charity I don't do because technology takes over. And perhaps I can give a couple of examples.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the things that we have to do as a charity is we have to file our accounts. We have to do that, in our case, in 14 countries and there are typically between 10 and 15 documents we have to prepare for each country. Lots of documents, lots of information that would normally take months of a number of people probably putting that together. And we broadly have that content all available to us within nine hours of the end of our financial year because at the end of the day, finances are just ones and zeros so we can automate the living daylights out of it. And therefore a whole series of effort that would otherwise go into admin that would take my time effectively is struck down to just a sliver of time. I think that's one element [that] allows me to put my time in [another] direction.&nbsp;</p><p>The second thing I would say is that the structure of AMF is very streamlined. We're very focused on what we do. There is a lot of complexity in many ways around distributing nets, particularly around the operations. That's the bit that really requires an awful lot of very careful attention to make sure nets get to people. And because we have a very simple series of steps, if you like, that we go through when we're carrying out our work, we're not a complicated organization. So strategically, certainly AMF has been designed to be operationally simple. I would say that that simplicity plus technology allows me to have more time in certain areas than perhaps other people might have&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp;</strong>Fantastic! That was almost bang on two minutes. Another question: <strong>what did you do before AMF? Did it lead naturally into this role or did it feel like a major career change?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rob Mather:</strong>&nbsp;Major career change, really, because I certainly wasn't planning to be in this role. Did it lead into this role? In some ways, yes, because I guess the experiences that I've had and the things that I've learned over my career, I\u2019ll go through it in 30 seconds, in a moment, I think allowed me to not be brilliant at anything, but allowed me to have experiences and some degree of capability across a whole series of areas. Therefore I could cover a lot of bases, particularly in an organization that just had two of us for the first 10 years. We grew to 50 million in revenue with just two of us because of some of those strategic choices about how we were organizing what we did.&nbsp;</p><p>When I left university, I studied chemical engineering at university. I went to join a strategy consulting firm. I went to live in Italy, work for a big American company and learned a lot in those four years about strategy, about business, and about getting things done. I then went to business school, learned a huge amount of business school over two years, went to the States. When I came back from the US, moved back to the UK and worked in an exhibitions business, a trade shows business, a very small company, so highly entrepreneurial. And I was effectively a commercial director - I was in charge of one aspect of the organization's business, bringing in revenue with several others, not just me alone. That taught me all sorts of things about how to secure funding if you like. Then I worked in one of the world's largest financial publishers, and I set up a business within a PLC that taught me an awful lot about operations and making things happen and persuading people to do things. And that was the last step before I then effectively set up AMF.</p><p>A whole series of different experiences that meant that I felt it was worth giving a go to what I want to do with malaria.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp;</strong>Fantastic. So, <strong>would you mind briefly telling the story of how you went from organizing a swimming fundraiser for a horrifically burned child to running one of the most&nbsp; effective global health charities in the world</strong>, in two minutes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rob Mather:</strong>&nbsp;Well, I suppose when we first set up AMF, there was a very simple aim: raise funds, purchase nets, distribute them so that they ended up over heads and beds, and make sure we had the data to prove it. In essence, that very simple approach is the approach we take today. If you layer on top of that very high levels of accountability being at the heart of what we do, we don't accept sort of trust and we don't accept, \u201cwell, it probably happened\u201d. We're ruthless about making sure we have the data to prove that what we say we will do happens. That is a very important or very helpful thing to be able to then be transparent about in talking to people about what you're doing. In being accountable, you tend also to embrace efficiency. That combination of accountability at the heart of what we do, being really transparent, always aiming to be&nbsp; highly efficient in the way we go about our work means that in the causal area that is malaria that clearly independent of us, arguably, you know, is&nbsp; a strongly a highly impactful area to be operating in - that combination, I guess, has led us to be independently judged by others to be, you know, pretty efficient and impactful at what we do.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp;</strong>Fantastic. Yeah, I mean, it's interesting, it often comes up in thinking around effective altruism, that it can be surprising that people don't focus on this kind of accountability and measurement when they're making charities. But it does seem to be the case that it's not the thing that most people are thinking about when they're starting charities.</p><p>Why was that something that mattered to you? Yeah, I feel like <strong>when you had the popularity of this swimming fundraiser which like led into AMF it could naturally, you could have started a charity on something that was salient to you or something that was nearby. Why was it that malaria appealed?</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:</strong>&nbsp;The reason that malaria was the focus was because when we organized a swim for a burns victim, a small child called Terry who was very badly burnt when she was two that led to 10,000 people swimming from a plan of having three people swimming. That was very surprising. I learned a number of interesting things from that. Most importantly, how terrific people can be in saying, \u201cYep, we'll help.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>When the notion crossed my brain of trying to get a million people to do something the next year or in a couple of years time, when you think about where you want to direct the funds we might raise from that, it was very clearly low-income countries was was going to be of interest rather than high-income countries - not heart disease and cancer, but HIV&nbsp; AIDS, TB, malaria, landmines, freshwater diarrhea, you know these sorts of issues whereas we all know there is a significant, the larger impact per dollar than in in the high-income countries.&nbsp;</p><p>When I discovered that, when I went through each of the six or seven things that I was considering and scratched beneath the surface, there were reasons to dismiss all the others, but seven jumbo jets full of children under five, or the equivalent thereof, dying every day from malaria, and it being the single largest disease killer of pregnant women in the world, yet the most effective thing we could do was have people sleep under a bed net was something that was pretty engaging. And I like the idea of raising money for nets rather than for drugs. You know, big bad pharmaceutical companies might come to mind for some people. So malaria was the obvious target and 5 million nets were going out at that time and the need was 205 million. And so there is a gap. Let's see if I can do something to try and help that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, I mean, it's fantastic. It makes total sense in retrospect as well. <strong>I was just wondering at the time, had you been thinking about global health before that, or was it just the size of the amount of money you thought I might be able to raise that made you think about it in this way? Like what prompted that?</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:</strong>&nbsp;Well, actually, it was more random, perhaps in some ways than that. I wanted to try and get a million people to do something. I was inspired by somebody I met in the US a number of years ago, who when she was 18 raised a million dollars for a cancer charity. And I thought, wow, a million dollars. That's a very large amount of money. And here we're going back to the 80s. So we're going back a long time ago when she raised that money. I heard about it a little bit a few years after that. So the idea with World Swim, you mentioned that when we started Toby, was to try and get a million people to do something. My aim was actually to do that for two years: spend a year planning it and then year organizing it. And then I was going to go back and get a proper job. So no, there was no intention of me, there's no forethought about how much money can be raised. It's just let's do you know one thing.&nbsp;</p><p>It's very difficult. If I asked you what you're going to do in the next year, you probably got a good answer for me. The next three years, next five years, it becomes more challenging. I certainly had no vision that far in advance. And so I guess my aims were just, I want to try and get a million people to swim. I think we can raise some money. It will raise some awareness because wow, a lot of people don't know about this thing called malaria as far as I could tell from talking to a lot of people and doing some reading and so on. The idea was let's see if we can do something. I'm really up for doing it and I've got some plans as to how I'd like to do it. But this will be a one off. But it attracted a lot of support and interest. And a number of individuals said you can't stop now nor did I want to because I thought, Hey, there's something here. Then we sharpened our focus and our operational elements over the years sort of became much more refined. But broadly, the strategy we started out within those first two years, I guess, has remained the case for the next 17.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp;</strong>Fantastic. Thank you. Yeah, a little bit of a different question here: <strong>what is your top advice for new charity entrepreneurs?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:</strong>&nbsp; Wow, that's a really broad question. And I guess a really good one, because I've been asked it before. I guess the first thing I would say, and I'm echoing some words, or stealing some words from Dustin Moskowitz. He gave a talk at Berkeley, I think, a number of years ago, where his advice to people in setting up a charity, if that's what you're referring to with charity entrepreneurs, is there's only one reason for you to do it, and that is because you can't not do it. And I guess that talks to, you know, a very, very high level of interest and a passion in doing something. You don't do it for reasons of, you know, money or control or title or whatever else it is. You do it because you feel really strongly about it because that strength of feeling and commitment will take you through the inevitable tough times that most people experience where something doesn't go right for some reason. So, I think that's the first thing: does it sort of come from here, you know, this bit of you in terms of saying I want to do it.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there's some practical advice I give people when they're setting up and, and in the early stages of charities, and I work with quite a lot of charities now in that capacity. The first thing I would say, and it's not as though one size fits all, but I think I've yet to come across a charity who wouldn't have found this helpful for them. Firstly is to raise three years money up front so that you don't find you've raised a year's money six months in you're thinking, \u201cOh, I'm going to run out of money in six months time. I need to start focusing on fundraising.\u201d It also acts as a really good acid test as to whether or not you've got support out there from people. I mean, the other two pieces of advice I often find I give is don't write a business plan. Just sit down with your voice in front of somebody who's going to fund you, that's your start and just tell them what it is you're going to do. And if you can't do it in a minute, then something is probably wrong. And bring a software engineer in house. That's the other thing I would say, which maybe most people do these days, but it's key.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp;</strong>Great. Yeah, thank you. You mentioned earlier that it has been important from the start that you're going to be collecting information from the people who are distributing the bed nets. <strong>How do you collect information from those people and then collect feedback from the end recipients of bed nets if you do, and how does that feedback inform the program?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>We do collect a lot of information from the recipient of bed nets primarily through post distribution monitoring programs. So we distribute nets, but it doesn't stop there. Millions of nets go out to millions of households. We then fund at AMF what we call PDMs (Post Distribution Monitoring) where we go back on a nine monthly basis to one and a half percent of the households that receive nets, randomly selected, to establish net presence, use, and condition. During that process, there is a lot of exchange of information captured within a series of questions, all of which are pretty much focused on can we take actions on the basis of the answers, because yes, you can get sort of anecdotal information that can sort of make you think, but really you want to gather information that is usable in some way.&nbsp;</p><p>The post distribution monitoring survey or questionnaire that we ask allows us to understand aspects of use of nets and other household relevant parameters, if you like, but we're not generally adjusting course dramatically because there is a simple truth that&nbsp; malaria is transmitted by malaria carrying mosquitoes. They generally bite between these hours - 10 o'clock at night and 2 in the morning. If you cover people with a net at that time and even if it has holes and rips and tears, because it's a long lasting insecticidal net, and mosquitoes don't do an aerobatics maneuver through a hole, they land on the net, pick up insecticide, and that causes knockdown, kills them. That's what works. So&nbsp; It's sort of refining information that we gather more than anything else, rather than any sort of fundamental,&nbsp; direction change we might want to embark upon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp;</strong>Awesome. Thank you.<strong> If you were starting AMF today, is there anything that you would be doing differently?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>I've thought about that a lot because I find it's unsatisfactory that my answer to that question is no. I sort of think surely there's something I would have done differently. But when I think about the main things that happened when I started AMF, I think I\u2019d do them all again in that order. You know, thinking about what it is I want to do and why and how I'm going to do it. And how can I get the financial backing so that I've got a number of years\u2019 money in the bank, even though I've literally done nothing. So there's somebody else that sort of shares the belief and the vision, if you like, and then who are the right people I put in place to execute on that and make it happen. I guess it gives evidence to the simplicity of what we did at AMF at the start. And I guess what we still do today. It was just Andrew and I, my colleague Andrew and I for the first 10 years. Andrew and I had worked together in a previous life. He was my head of technology in a previous life, so we knew each other well. We know each other very well now, because we worked together for more than 20 years. Andrew is very, very talented as a software engineer effectively. And so I had a very clear view of what we needed to do. And also through discussions with the previous Swim For Terri -&nbsp; I'd seen how terrific people were both in the corporate environment and as individual volunteers. I felt there was the possibility of putting significant support in place pro bono that would give us access to supporters because they put their hand up and said, \u201cHey, I'm going to help.\u201d&nbsp; And additionally, we wouldn't have to spend money that many other charities have to, and your percentage admin rates look really bad. Those key things that we did at the start, I'd do again.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp;</strong>Great, thank you. I like this one: <strong>can you talk us through, as transparently as you can, the costs and benefits of being so transparent?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>Good question. It might be more than two minutes for this one. I think the first thing I'd say is that you need to come up with the right ideas and sort of processes first of all. That's a sort of starting point. The vision and plan of what you want to do, but you're going to be transparent about. That's thinking time. There's no cost to that. Then you need to deploy the relevant technology. There's not a lot of cost involved in that. It's more of a sort of mindset of how you're using technology that allows you to gather data, echo out data, [and] share data.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, the process here about what you're gonna be doing and how you're going to execute on being transparent, there's not much cost in that. I think when you are transparent, you tend to keep things simple because you're communicating to people so you need to keep things simple. And that allies very closely with efficiency, you tend to become really quite efficient.&nbsp;</p><p>The cost, I think, is sort of relatively low in being transparent. Maybe somebody will come up with a cost I haven't thought about but can't think of one big one. What does transparency do in terms of its benefits? Wow, lots. I mean, in some ways I'm going to echo some of the words I mentioned before it facilitates accountability. No question. It helps you become more efficient because you're being transparent. I think it drives the use of technology throughout the organization because you're wanting to share things. You've got to use technology to get it quickly and echo it out. I think that ultimately leads when you're transparent to high levels of confidence in the organization. We never didn't trust, but we don't ask for people's trust. But we do want to develop people's confidence in us, partners, others. And I think, I guess extending, that it encourages support from donors. And all of that allows us to have more impact. So, you know, you can see the key words there in the benefits, cost\u2019s pretty low.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp;</strong>Nice. Yeah. I mean, I think that's a good answer to a pretty broad question. So, thank you for that. <strong>How does the availability of malaria vaccines change AMF\u2019s strategy going forward, if at all?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>It doesn't for the moment [Note that this AMA was recorded on the 19th of December, 2023]. And that's because the malaria vaccines that we have at the moment, whilst they are fantastic additions to the toolbox, the tools that we use to fight malaria, I think it is reasonable to say that they're relatively modest tools, unbelievably fantastic scientific breakthrough and the scientists that have achieved that are to be congratulated hugely because this is the first time we've had a vaccine for a parasite. You know, COVID et al is a virus, as we all know. So that's been a major breakthrough. I think the comparison I would use when it comes to how useful a vaccine will be so RTSS and M21 are the two vaccines, and they have broadly a 35 to 65 percent efficacy. I may be wrong, but my understanding is that the second vaccine is, may well be heading towards a similar 35 to 50% efficacy and I do apologize to the vaccine scientists if I'm explaining that incorrectly.&nbsp;</p><p>I think it's useful to look at polio for parameters you want to look at what percentage of the population benefit from the vaccine? Polio 100%. How effective is the vaccine? Polio 100%. How many administrative events with polio? One - on a sugar cube or an injection. Are there any cold chain logistics? Polio vaccine? None. If you have to refrigerate, obviously, it's more expensive. With the malaria vaccines, we're looking at 35 to 50-ish percent efficacy. We're looking at a subset of the population, albeit an important one under fives, but only a subset of that. Three administrative events one month apart, another one a year later and cold chain logistics. So it's not quite there yet. We hope the scientists, you know, the same scientists or others will build on those success and maybe in the next, I'm led to believe 7 to 10 years, we'll be talking about a vaccine in slightly different terms. We hope so.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp;</strong>Awesome. I mean, I guess I wonder, how would it change your strategy? Like how closely are you following it? <strong>If it [a malaria vaccine] gets rolled out in a specific country, would this make a difference to how you prioritize where your bed nets are distributed?</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>We are following it very closely and potentially it would and I think what we have to look at is what is the most effective means of preventing malaria. There are certain things that I think we could do in a vaccine environment that would leverage the capabilities and strengths that we have. I could see there being a future in which AMF might say to donors, we've done some work over the last year or 18 months or two years where we've explored operationally how we could contribute to vaccine rollout or distribution and we think we have a role to play. So if people would like to contribute to us, this is what we're going to do. I could see that happening potentially in the future because I think some of the strengths and experiences that we've had over the years might put us in a position where we could assist, but we would look at that very closely to see whether or not AMF was the right organization. It might be that there are other organizations that are better placed than us. We'd have to evaluate that.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp;</strong>Thank you. Another question on your distributions: A forum user called JBentham asks: <strong>\u201cI noticed that on your distribution page, you have distributions penciled in for the Democratic Republic of Congo up to 2025. Are these distributions contingent on additional funding? If not, which countries would you be most likely to expand your distributions to in 2024 and 2025 if your funding cap was closed?\u201d</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>So anything that we publish is funded. We don't announce a country or a region in a country publicly unless it's funded because we need to sign a legal agreement with the government and it would not be the right order if we were to make public that we were going to fund nets for a particular area if we hadn't had all the very important operational and data-related elements of a legal agreement fully signed up to. So they are funded.&nbsp;</p><p>There are still huge gaps in DRC in the 2024, 2025, and 2026 period. In fact, $145 million worth of gaps, which means that currently the Global Fund, ourselves, and the American government who are all contributing funding to the DRC three-year campaign, because we're looking at a three-year campaign, it's not done year by year, you're talking about a country that is two-thirds the size of Western Europe and it has some very challenging logistics. The lead times are really, really the two or more years in a sense of minimum. So we've got roughly 62 percent of the population able to be covered and 38 percent not able to be covered and none of the three funding partners have any idea where more funds are going to come from yet.&nbsp;</p><p>So we're very, very worried. And I'm afraid the numbers will translate into\u2026 unless we close that gap, and as I say, we have no idea where the funding is going to come from, It already includes some projection of how many, how much will come in over the next sort of couple of years\u2026 we're looking at about 30,000 people dying.&nbsp;</p><p>So it's a really critical situation. Other countries where we've got gaps in funding are Nigeria, Mozambique, Cameroon, Uganda, Chad, South Sudan, Zambia, Guinea and there are others. So we've got more than a $300 million gap right now that we could allocate, so significant opportunities.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, I mean, just a follow up on that. <strong>It's really intense to be working on something where there's 30,000 people kind of in the balance on this on just this particular aspect how do you keep the right level of motivation to work on this so that it's obviously urgent, but it doesn't feel overwhelming?</strong> I mean it\u2019s gotten so big, there\u2019s a lot of people involved in this now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>Yeah, it got so big, but there are only 13 of us. I mean, it's still a small team. I guess none of us need any more motivation than I guess those numbers in that one country. And there are at least 10 countries that are like that, that people die and people fall really sick because they don't have something as simple as a bed net. I guess no extra motivation needed.&nbsp;</p><p>And, you know, I guess I'd say two things about myself. One is that I am the world's greatest cynic when it comes to charity, I'm afraid. If I thought I was cynical 19 years ago when I set up AMF, boy, am I cynical now, given what I've seen in international aid. There are some really, really good organizations out there. But there are some things that happen that are led by others that are not very good at all, which is why we do what we do in the way we do it. We focus on data. We're not perfect. We don't have all the answers. We learn all the time, but we're very driven by a particular approach that we stick to. I think it's a very honest one and it's focused on data. I suppose when you are thinking about hundreds of millions of dollars, it's natural for all of us to think, well, what, what difference can I make? I mean these numbers are huge. Every $2 matters. You know, people who know AMF will know that refrain. Every $2 broadly buys a net and that net protects two people. And I can tell you that the net is pretty important for the two people who sleep under it. So there's no amount that is too small, so to speak, or inconsequential. And we do the best we can. We work as hard as we can within limits. You know, we don't work 20 hours a day, that wouldn't be productive anyway, in the long run. We just try and work efficiently and smart. So I'm constantly trying to think how we can do things better to, you know, close funding gaps. We get people giving us a hundred dollars and a thousand dollars, and then some people give us much more. Whenever a donation comes in, it's thrilling because we know what we can do with it.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp;</strong>Thank you and you're doing great on sticking to the two minutes. It's almost exact. So, here\u2019s a question kind of related to this. <strong>Now that you have a bigger team, have you found that comes with more overhead in people management, internal communications and stuff like that? What have been the difficulties of growing the team out from a two-person team for a decade to a massive team of thirteen?</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>Bottom line is not much of a difficulty because we've only gone from two to 13. So we're still a family in that sense, you know where we [have] strong communication between the vast majority of people most of the time. I mean, not everybody speaks to everybody every day, but we're remote, we don't have offices, which means that we have the benefit of then being able to choose a talent pool that is all over the world in many cases. Although there are limits because we need time zones to coincide broadly to be efficient. Clearly, there have been [costs] when you grow from 2 to 5 to 7 to 10 to 13, you're spending more time on recruiting, you're spending more time on developing people. But those are all pretty pleasurable things - you come across some great people. And what we're always trying to do is sort of square peg in square hole is finding people who've got the background, the characteristics, desire, talents that fit what we try and do. And it's really rewarding when a number of people have been with AMF for a long time now. Their level of knowledge is very, very high. Their abilities are really strong and we're bringing on others in the same way who are doing a really good job. So, you know, modest, you know, it's been a great run over the last five or six years when we've added people to the team.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp; </strong>Brilliant. Yeah, another question, I guess, about how you run this organization: <strong>AMF fundraises separately for its operational costs and for the direct costs of its interventions, as far as I understand. How important has this been for AMF's growth and its popularity?</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>Going back to the points I made about putting three years' money in place, I didn't want to have to worry about raising money and take my eye off the sort of operational ball, if you like. We've been very fortunate in having a small group of donors, three effectively, who've said, you know, we'll fund the central cost sort of in perpetuity, pretty much. I don't want to take their generosity for granted going forwards because for the money we might need in three years time, we haven't received yet, but you know, that seems to be the way that they view us. I think it's been very helpful that our overheads as an organization are low. The average of the last five years is our overheads as a percentage of revenue have been about 6 or 7%. Obviously that's really quite low partly that's because we don't pay for anything other than 11 salaries of the 13 staff, 11 draw salary. We have some expenses when people fly to Africa for obvious reasons. But banking, accounting, legal website, offices, translation, you name it, we don't have it. It's zero because we have a lot of pro bono support. We put that in place and that's covered. And there are a number of large donors that provide funding that covers the monitoring costs, which are significant. For every 100 million we spend on nets. We spend about seven or eight million on monitoring because we monitor the living daylights out of things we do in the countries in which we operate. They're also covered effectively. Which means that we can say honestly to donors and potential donors, if you give us 10 dollars, we will spend 10 dollars buying nets because everything else is covered. It is incremental. We will buy another 10 dollars worth of nets. And that's a really simple message to be able to share with people.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp; </strong>Yeah, that's great. I mean, <strong>this is another really interesting part of AMF - the amount of pro bono support that you get. And I mean, presumably volunteer support in your distributions because people obviously have to give out these nets. How does that happen? And how did you arrive at that way of doing things?</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:</strong> So we fund the nets, and other co-funding partners cover the non-net costs of the distributions. The non-net costs include shipping, in-country transport of nets, registration across millions of households&nbsp; there a lot of health workers visiting households and gathering data), and then the distribution of the nets. These are typically the next step. We fund the nets at roughly $2 a net. The Global Fund or the American government fund the non-net costs, roughly $2 a net. So if we're putting 20 million worth of nets into Uganda, as we've just done and are closing out the distribution there, the non-net costs would have been funded by or were funded by the Global Fund. We partner with them. There's no volunteering going on there. There are some volunteer activities that go on in-country, but the work that's done in-country is done by people who are paid for PDMs and are on salaries. It's just that we don't pay for that.&nbsp;</p><p>When there's a funding gap\u2026 Uganda had a $140 million worth of funding needed for the campaign, I think the Global Fund put in $80 million, if I'm not mistaken, the American government put in $20 million, and there was a gap of $40 million. So we said, we'll come in with $40 million to buy the nets because the case was made in terms of malaria genuine funding gap. In fact, it was $20 million we put in, I beg your pardon. And we bought roughly 10 or 11 million nets, and the non-net costs were funded by others. So that part is a partnership, not volunteer helping in-country. That wouldn't work for a nationwide logistical campaign.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp; </strong>Thanks. I mean, that makes a lot of sense. I was wondering how that part of things works. That's very interesting. <strong>Another thing that potentially could change the way you think about this going forward is the rise in insecticide resistance. How has this changed your estimations of the impact of bed nets?</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>The impact has not gone down very much. I mean, it's gone down by, you know, a number of percentage points, perhaps. We haven't done any particular work to say, is it three? Is it five? Is it eight? Is it perhaps as much as 10? What has happened is that new products have been developed. So rather than having, let's call it a standard net that's got a pyrethroid on it, then we've got nets that have got other active ingredients on it. In one case, a chemical called PBO, piperonyl butoxide, which is a chemical that's safe for humans, but it switches off in the mosquito, the mechanism that causes resistance. So, aha! We're back in the game when it comes to lower levels of knocking out mosquitoes, not zero, but lower levels because they've developed some resistance.</p><p>And there are other types of nets that are being developed. When I say types of nets, there are other active ingredients being added to nets. We have a chemical called pyriproxyfen and one called chlorfenapyr. There will not be a test at the end of this hour. But these are chemicals that are added to nets because they act on mosquitoes in a different way and deal with the resistance. Some of these products are showing really promising results. AMF a number of years ago put eight and a half million dollars effectively into a randomized controlled trial to gather the data that would allow us to say whether or not these PBO nets I mentioned worked and if they did in what circumstances and to what degree. That was a very important RCT because it gave us the data, gave all of us the data that said this is how these nets work. And now there are tens of millions of these nets being deployed annually because we all needed the data to support what products we distribute to deal with insecticide resistance.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp; </strong>Awesome. Yeah, thank you. A few of these are questions from Habiba who's starting a charity called Spiro to work on TB. I had a few questions, some of the ones about starting the charity are from her. She asks <strong>in what situations does it seem like a good idea to start a new initially small charity rather than supporting existing efforts? </strong>So, for example, looking from the outside of malaria work in 2005 when you started your charity, one might have felt like this was a huge area with a lot of attention from big global health organizations, and it'd be surprising if a new small organization could be able to bring something different and useful that existing organizations couldn't. So yeah, how did you think about this and how do you think about this question?</p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>Sometimes there are lots of tankers on the sea and there aren't enough speedboats. And I guess the smaller organizations can do things slightly differently. They're more agile, can do things in a very different way. Maybe a tanker doesn't focus on data, but a speedboat does. I don't want to take the analogy further because I'll probably drown. But no pun intended. But I suppose it's whether, in reflecting in the field you're looking at, is there a need for some activity or intervention or some way of doing things that doesn't currently exist? It is not the case that incumbents have got it right. Often times have moved on and they haven't moved on and it's really time for a change. And it's assessing whether there is an organization that's really well placed to pivot or whether a new organization is needed. And I guess a new organization often comes with people with that passion I mentioned earlier, desire, and commitment. Maybe they bring in new funding, which can be helpful for the particular causal area. So I think if you assess and there's a need for newness, then, hey, go for it. Try it. Because the worst that can happen is you can fail (dot, dot, dot) and learn a huge amount from doing so. That's not really failure. I guess there'll be pros and cons of any individual situation. But I guess that would be my high-level take.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp; </strong>Great. Thank you. <strong>On what frequency do you think about organizational goals and strategy internally? Do you set quarterly goals? Think about big picture strategy annually? How do you think about strategy? When do you course-correct?</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>I guess all the time. I think strategy is a fancy word for choices. And you know, I don't think choices are made on a quarterly basis. Choices are made on a daily basis, multiple times a day. And often somebody might look at you, you know, three months on and say, oh, you've sort of adjusted your strategy a bit here. And you may have done because you're making slightly different choices, but it's probably made up of, in most cases, the fact that you're doing 50 things slightly differently and better. So often it's not about a major strategic change. I guess you could say that those choices lead to improvements. But we're constantly thinking about, are we doing this in a way that is maximizing or optimizing our impact? Are we collecting data in the right way? Can we do it without spending so much money? Should we be doing things we're not doing to give us greater confidence in some of the data in this particular circumstance? Should we be deploying technology in a new way, because now we can scan barcodes of nets or whatever it might be? And, you know, I'm constantly thinking about that.</p><p>At the same time, the flip side of these sorts of thinking and these sorts of choices is risk. And a lot of what I do each day is thinking about risk, de-risking certain situations so things don't happen all the way from people you want in the organization not leaving, people in the organization developing so we maximize their enjoyment and their productivity, to maximizing the percentage of nets that are overheads and beds. So I guess the answer to your question is all the time.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:</strong> So you've mentioned the work of the Global Fund. <strong>What's your opinion of the other kinds of work that the Global Fund funds for malaria prevention other than, other than bed nets? And would you mind outlining briefly in your answer what else they fund?</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>Sure. So I think when it comes to most things in life, the portfolio approach is pretty good. And when it comes to malaria control, there are a portfolio of things that we need to do. I mean, the jigsaw puzzle that is the solution to malaria has probably got about 12 pieces in it: Nets, rapid diagnostic testing kits (RDTKs), indoor residual spraying, ACTs (Artemisinin Controlled Therapy: it's the drug you take three days of it flushes malaria parasite from your system. Very, very effective), health system strengthening (that runs from making sure that malaria data is recorded accurately, because if it's not, then we don't know what we're dealing with, and we don't know if we're improving, to the training of staff in health centers to deal with blood slide analysis of potentially with malaria.) The Global Fund effectively puts money into all of the aforementioned and more things and it's really important it does. RDTKs, ACTs, health system strengthening, or HSS as we refer to it, are all really important. You can't not do any of these things. Sometimes in a country, you get to the point where health system strengthening has really suffered because there's just not been enough money and there have been other priorities and urgencies, if you like, and it gets to the point where you sort of got to go, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, time out. We've got to put money into health system strengthening because unless we do that, things are going to start to fall apart and undermine aspects of these fundamental programs.\"</p><p>I\u2019m a big fan of money going into all of these things. I know that there are evaluators that look at AMF and others and look at the net program, but you can't just do a net program. It's really important that it's funded well. But you can't do that and have other things at really low levels. You need the engine in the car, funding nets, but you also need the wheels and a steering wheel and some other things. Probably a bad analogy, but there we go.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:</strong> No, I think that makes sense. And that's good to hear because I think often when you hear about AMF as an example in effective altruism, it's not as part of an integrated picture of how we're tackling malaria. It's as an example of exactly what AMF does. I've mostly heard about bed nets, so it's great to hear that there's so much else going on.</p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>And much of that jigsaw puzzle, Toby, sorry to interrupt, is that SMC, Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention, is now a really important part of the toolbox that we have. But again, if we had 12 pieces to the jigsaw puzzle before, that is the solution to malaria, it's now 13.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:</strong> Yeah, that makes sense. So, <strong>someone mentioned that AMF has leveraged corporate support and partnerships, perhaps more than other charities do. Does that seem true to you? And if so, is it something that you think lean nonprofits should be doing more?</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>I think the simple answer is yes, that we do leverage it more than others. And I guess the second answer to your second question is yes. I think we're within our two minutes, so I should probably expand on that. It's been really humbling over the years to go to people to phone people up and say, \"Who do I speak to in your industry who'd be willing to do this thing pro bono for free because I don't think you need a $5 more than a couple of kids in Africa need a bed net?\" I can honestly say that in 19 years, when I've asked that question, I've obviously chosen the person I've spoken to with intent and carefully, I know my ground and, and so on. So there's some preparation involved. But in 19 years, I've never, ever had any other answer to that question in any other, in any area in which I've asked it than the one word answer I get, and that is \"me.\" And I go, \"Really?\" And they say, \"Yeah, we'll help you.\" And I think what that shows is that there are lots of people out there who are willing to help. Obviously, there is a strategy behind asking and what you ask for and how you ask for it, which I probably don't have time in two minutes to go into. But, it's not particularly rocket science. It's largely rooted in common sense. Certainly, we've experienced terrific support. I know other charities have, some of whom I now work with, but I think there are very few charities, I would argue, that probably don't have a number of areas in which they could reduce costs and improve, through collaboration, some of the things they do by engaging pro bono support, because there are lots of people that are willing to help.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:</strong> Yeah, that's great to hear that it's been so successful. <strong>I know that it might take a lot longer to express this, but do you have any tips for that [getting pro bono help as a charity]? Why do you think that's been the case? Is it based on how you pick these people? Like, is it networking? What's going into that success?</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>It's not networking, actually. I chose not to network in any stage of setting up AMF. I mean, I probably had a Rolodex that I could have dipped into, but I really didn't want to because I didn't want people to say, \"Oh, what's Rob up to now? Yes, we'll support him.\" I wanted it to be a somebody who, you know, did not know me and looked at the, you know, the merits of what I was suggesting. And if they were to say, \"Yeah, look, this is really interesting. We're happy to back this,\" then I think you have a better indication, you're onto something. I think it's picking areas of support where the ask you're going to make of the people you're going to approach is not such that they're going to go, \"Wow, that's a lot.\" It's a relatively modest contribution, and it might be interesting in year one, but then because of that contribution and the work and the heavy lifting that's done, the support you're effectively going to ask of them is going to be much reduced in future years. It doesn't hit that screen of people saying, \"Wow, we're really spending a lot of money effectively or foregoing a lot of revenue in providing this support.\" I think you develop some experience of who to ask and sometimes when to ask them at what stage in your progress is right to ask them. Those factors have all been part of when I have approached people. In the first couple of years of establishing AMF, there was a lot of thought that went into that. But what I described to people was just a genuine situation and said, \"Would you be in a position to help?\" There was no cleverness. It was really just going to somebody and saying, \"This is where we need help. Will you?\" And we had terrific responses.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:</strong> Right. Yeah. Thank you.<strong> Finally, what does the relationship between AMF and the effective altruism community look like from your side?</strong></p><p><strong>Rob Mather:&nbsp;</strong>It's a pretty warm one. I mean, certainly my sentiment towards the EA community is pretty warm because significant funds have flowed to us from effective altruists. They've also flowed to us from many others, some of whom have not heard of EA, or what it's about. But when I first spoke with Peter Singer many years ago and with Toby Ord and with Will MacAskill and others, there was clearly a sort of alignment of thinking, of how we saw the world in some ways, which I guess in a very uncomplicated way is, there are a lot of opportunities to help people in a pretty fundamental way.</p><p>And so personally, I have that view. And I think a lot of people within the EA Movement have a fundamental generosity because it is still remarkable to me the money that is donated to us by some people in terms of a percentage of what they earn. So what we try and do from our side is to be as communicative as possible, both in terms of being really open and transparent with our work and data that surrounds it. And when people approach us from within the EA community and say, \"Hey, we've got some questions, or could you appear here and could you tell us about how you do something because we want to find out more?\" So it's a pretty warm one for which we're very grateful.</p><p><strong>Toby Tremlett:&nbsp;</strong>Great. Well, this has been great. I feel like I've learned a lot. It's just some really interesting questions on the AMA. And thank you so much again for your time.</p><p><strong>Rob Mather:</strong> Pleasure. Thanks a lot, Toby.</p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "tobytrem"}}, {"_id": "9copPAEnfCBZd88jE", "title": "Reflections on my first year of AI safety research", "postedAt": "2024-01-08T07:49:07.323Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Last year, I wrote a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DnMg5q4Wyuuf99kkX/reflections-on-my-5-month-ai-alignment-upskilling-grant\"><u>post about my upskilling in AI alignment</u></a>. To this day, I still get people occasionally reaching out to me because of this article, to ask questions about getting into the field themselves. I\u2019ve also had several occasions to link people to the article who asked me about getting into the field from other means, like my local AI Safety group.<br><br>Essentially, what this means is that people clearly found this useful (credit to the EA Forum for managing to let the article be findable to those who need it, a year after its publication!) and therefore people would likely find a sequel useful too! This post is that sequel, but reading the first post is not necessary to read this one.</p><p>The major lesson of this post is this:&nbsp;<strong>I made a ton of mistakes, but those mistakes taught me things. By being open to that feedback and keeping my eye on the ball, I managed to find work that suited me in the field eventually.</strong> Just like the previous post, I\u2019m happy to answer more questions via PM or in the comments.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting, this isn\u2019t a bold story of me getting a ton of stuff done. Most of the story, by word count, is me flailing around unsure of what to do and making a lot of mistakes along the way. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll learn a lot about how to be a good researcher from this post, but I hope you might learn some tips to avoid being a bad one.</p><h2>Summary</h2><ul><li>I was a software engineer for 3-4 years with little to no ML experience before I was accepted for my initial upskilling grant. (More details are in my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DnMg5q4Wyuuf99kkX/reflections-on-my-5-month-ai-alignment-upskilling-grant\"><u>initial post</u></a>)</li><li>I attended&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.matsprogram.org/\"><u>SERI MATS</u></a>, working on aligning language models under Owain Evans. Due to a combination of factors, some my fault and some not, I don\u2019t feel like I got a great deal of stuff done.</li><li>I decided to pivot away from evals towards mechanistic interpretability since I didn\u2019t see a good theory of change for evals - this was two weeks before GPT-4 came out and the whole world sat up and took notice. Doh!</li><li>After upskilling in mechanistic interpretability, I struggled quite a bit with the research. I eventually concluded that it wasn\u2019t for me, but was already funded to work on it. Fortunately I had a collaborator, and eventually I wound up using my engineering skills to accelerate his research instead of trying to contribute to the analysis directly.</li><li>After noticing my theory of change for evals had changed now that governments and labs were committing to red-teaming, I applied for some jobs in the space. I received an offer to work in the UK\u2019s task force, which I accepted.</li></ul><h2>List of Lessons</h2><ul><li>It\u2019s important to keep in mind two things - your theory of change for how your work helps reduce existential risk, and your comparative advantage in the field. These two things determined what I should work on, and keeping them updated was crucial for me finding a good path in the end.</li><li>Poor productivity is more likely to be situational than you might think, especially if you\u2019re finding yourself having unusual difficulty compared to past projects or jobs. It\u2019s worth considering how your situation might be tweaked before blaming yourself.</li><li>Trying out different subfields is useful, but don\u2019t be afraid to admit when one isn\u2019t working out as well as you\u2019d like. See the first lesson.</li><li>If you\u2019re going to go to a program like SERI MATS, do so because you have a good idea of what you want, not just because it\u2019s the thing to do or it seems generically helpful. I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t do such a program for that reason, but it is worth thinking twice about it.</li><li>It is entirely possible to make mistakes, even several of them, and still wind up finding work in the field. &nbsp;There is no proper roadmap, everyone needs to figure things out as they go. While it's worth having a point <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/waqC6FihC2ryAZuAq/just-lose-hope-already\">at which you're willing to give up</a>, the first obstacle or failure probably isn't the right point for that.</li></ul><h2>SERI MATS</h2><p>SERI MATS was a great place to be, but I definitely feel like I miscalculated in several ways here. Let\u2019s start with the good. SERI MATS had a great deal of useful events to help me learn more and get to know people in alignment. (In fact, my next project would not have happened without meeting my collaborator in the Lightcone offices, which SERI MATS encouraged people to do) I\u2019d definitely recommend it to people who have a clear idea what they\u2019d like to do in alignment and are ready to move to the next level.</p><p>Unfortunately, I was not one of those people. My goal was to \u201cget into SERIMATS\u201d, when my goal should have been something like \u201cDo good research in this particular subfield\u201d. Getting into SERIMATS could be a solid step towards that goal. Because my goal was vaguely just getting into SERI MATS, I applied for a wide variety of mentors, applying to those who I expected might take me and whose work seemed at least somewhat relevant to my skills and/or interests. I don't actually think this is the best approach, and would recommend a more focused plan from people in most cases.</p><p>I ended up being accepted by Owain Evans and Beth Barnes. At the time, my reasoning was like this.</p><ul><li>Beth is working on evaluations.&nbsp;</li><li>The theory of change behind evaluations to me seems poor. You could make a scary demo of a system doing something bad, but who will pay attention? Governments don\u2019t seem to care, and I\u2019m not sure labs will care enough to actually act. Without that, any number of scary demos won\u2019t help.</li><li>Owain is working on language model alignment. This doesn\u2019t seem to be focused on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3pinFH3jerMzAvmza/on-how-various-plans-miss-the-hard-bits-of-the-alignment\"><u>hard parts of the alignment problem</u></a>, so I don\u2019t know if this will help me solve the alignment problem, but it could be useful in worlds where LLM\u2019s scale up towards AGI.&nbsp;</li><li>Thus, I\u2019ll go with Owain.</li></ul><p>I didn\u2019t know at the time that ARC Evals (now METR, where Beth works) was working on GPT-4 evaluations, and I <strong>definitely</strong> didn\u2019t realise how GPT-4 would shift the Overton window. I can forgive myself the second, but if I\u2019d done some more research (i.e, reached out to Beth and Owain to discuss things) I might have gotten some information that would have changed my mind about the first. If I had known that at least one lab was taking evaluations very seriously, that could have changed my calculus considerably.</p><p>At SERI MATS, I feel like I had conflicting ideas in my head. I wanted to \u201csolve the alignment problem\u201d. This was a framework that seemed encouraged by people around me over there - SERI MATS is full of very ambitious people after all, and I like that there are people trying to solve the entire problem, including what they see as the hard bits. However, what I hadn\u2019t realized yet (or rather, I had realised it, but didn\u2019t want to seriously grapple with the implications) was that <i>the ambitious worst-case alignment theorising was simply not my comparative advantage</i>. I was spending a lot of time trying to improve my mathematics skills, for instance. I\u2019m a software engineer, not a mathematician, and I\u2019m never going to reach the level of the people who have pure maths degrees and competed internationally in the Maths Olympiad. If it turns out that those are the only skills that matter for solving alignment,&nbsp;<i>I\u2019m still not the right person to do them.&nbsp;</i>I should be focused on my strengths, as long as I can see my strengths having a realistic path to helping at all.</p><p>It also took us a while to get projects assigned. Owain was a lot more hands-on than I expected, which in the fullness of time I recognise as a good thing. He had a series of projects he wanted done, and we would set ourselves up into teams to work on them under his supervision, but they unfortunately weren\u2019t quite shovel-ready when we arrived. During the time we were waiting on projects, another scholar and I had an idea around testing whether chain-of-thought prompting improved GPT-3\u2019s ability to be deceptive. We found that it did, and quickly wrote it up in the course of 1-2 days. I found this to be an extremely exciting thing, a very fast feedback loop that created something interesting very quickly. I imagine this must be what it\u2019s like to work at a startup, which I haven\u2019t actually done. Owain asked us not to publish this for fear of capabilities improvements. (It\u2019s now safe to share this idea a year later, because Apollo Research created an improved version to demo at the AI Safety Summit.)<br><br>While I disagreed with the danger here, Owain was our mentor and I agreed to this decision. This did have the unfortunate side-effect of curbing my agency at SERI MATS a bit. In Owain\u2019s defense, I should have been more resilient here - ideas don\u2019t always work out, and if this idea simply hadn\u2019t improved the model\u2019s deceptive ability, the result would have been the same.</p><p>Thus, due to a combination of not having a project early, not wanting to push things independently, and spending some of my time doing counterproductive things (trying to improve my weakness in math, rather than shore up my strengths in engineering) I didn\u2019t get a lot done in SERI MATS. Because of my earlier decision to apply for whomever I could, I also wasn\u2019t super excited about the work itself. During my time there I became interested in mechanistic interpretability. It was the only agenda that seemed to be both tractable for me to get into, and robustly useful even if alignment was relatively hard. I decided to get into this upon returning home after SERI MATS.<br><br>While this didn't end up going that well in practice, I do endorse the decision-making process I went through back then, with the information I actually had at the time.</p><h2>Mechanistic Interpretability</h2><p>Upon my return, I began to follow&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/quickstart\"><u>Neel\u2019s excellent resources</u></a> to get into mechanistic interpretability. Things went well for a while, as a lot of the skills required were engineering-based, and the linear algebra I had been learning was actually useful! I had been studying&nbsp;<a href=\"https://linear.axler.net/\"><u>Linear Algebra Done Right</u></a> - this was far more rigorous and time-consuming than I feel I actually needed in retrospect, but to its credit it did help me understand important concepts very well, like what a basis really is, that are important in mech interp. There were probably more <i>efficient</i> ways to learn this knowledge, but I did learn it well.</p><p>I decided to apply for SERI MATS again, this time only under Neel. I did check with him about applying a second time, and he said that he would teach pretty different things and I likely hadn\u2019t saturated the value of mentorship yet. The research sprint (two weeks of research with a teammate) is where things started to go south.</p><p>The teammate I ended up with was much younger than myself, quite brilliant, and already had a project idea in mind which I went along with. During the first week, I struggled quite a lot to keep up with him. He\u2019d been thinking about the project for longer, and because of the nature of our timezones, our day would start with him working, then us meeting in the middle, then me working until the end. That meant he was always a day ahead of me.&nbsp;</p><p>After the first week, it was obvious that he was doing most of the work while I was plodding along behind. He ended up deciding we should each take the work that had been done and build on it independently, each of us submitting that as our final submission. To his credit, when he told Neel this, he did so anonymously, so that in theory Neel wouldn\u2019t know which of us felt they were doing most of the work for the first week.</p><p>Without this partner however, I had no clue what I was doing. After a couple of days of struggling, I ended up giving up on the sprint. In retrospect, this team split was the best thing that could have happened to me. My teammate did end up getting accepted into SERI MATS. If he had carried the project and gotten it accepted as a team effort, I would have gone with him. I then would have spent two months dealing with the same problem, likely making me unproductive and miserable. The problem, I realised, was not with the project. <i>The problem was that I wasn\u2019t really suited for mechanistic interpretability research.</i></p><p>Unfortunately, I\u2019d already accepted funding to work on a mech interp project for the next six months. Oops.</p><h2>Project</h2><p>The project I was working on (which eventually led to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yuQJsRswS4hKv3tsL/features-and-adversaries-in-memorydt\"><u>this post with Joseph Bloom</u></a>) was around interpreting Decision Transformers, a transformer that was trained on sequences from a reinforcement learning agent that had learned to succeed at a task. The idea is that the transformer, as a predictor, learned to predict the correct moves as well. The Decision Transformer was also trained on a varying reward parameter so that it would also learn to lose when asked, The idea was to use transformer-based interpretability techniques to look for things like \u201cgoals\u201d that were more RL-flavored, that were more likely to appear in a model like this than GPT-2.</p><p>Originally, Joseph and I were going to work together in Australia - him in Melbourne, myself in Brisbane. He did end up moving to the UK instead, which complicated things. After Neel\u2019s SERI MATS training ended, I tried working with Joseph on this project, and we had some difficulties. On my end I had a few problems:</p><ul><li>I had a LOT of environment problems at first, before I eventually managed to solve them. Joseph had made a basic Docker container, but didn\u2019t use it himself - to Joseph\u2019s credit, it still worked without a ton of tweaking. This is rare for environments that aren\u2019t used often!</li><li>I struggled to put hours in, which I eventually realised was because I didn\u2019t know how to get started on the task. At the time I assumed the issue was a generic productivity issue, not a situational one.</li><li>Sometimes I needed more information to work on a task, but I tended to assume this was my fault. If I were smarter, I would be able to do it, so I didn\u2019t want to bother Joseph for more information. I now realise this is silly - whether the fault is mine or not, if I need more context to solve a problem, I need more context, and it helps nobody to delay asking about this too much.</li><li>And, as before, I just wasn\u2019t very well suited to MI research.</li></ul><p>It took a fair bit of time, but eventually Joseph and I hit upon a decent formula for my helping out. Joseph would come up with a bunch of engineering tasks as he worked that he would like to see done, but were on the back burner. I would then do those things, preventing him from having to do them later and thus speeding up his research.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, this is the concept of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_advantage\"><u>comparative advantage</u></a> from economics. Joseph is a far better mech interp researcher than I am. I even suspect he\u2019s a better software engineer than I am, at least on this particular project where he had more context. But if Joseph can produce 5x the research units that I can, and only 2x the engineering units than I can, if I spend my time producing engineering units, Joseph can spend more time producing research units, which is better for everyone. Even if I am worse than him at both tasks, I can still contribute meaningfully by letting him focus on his greatest relative strength, which is exactly what I did. By taking on smaller tasks in greater numbers, I ensured the overhead of him explaining them to me was low, and so I was able to be net useful to the project. Our final post reflects this - the analysis is basically entirely Joseph\u2019s, but many of the figures in the post have been either produced or improved by me at some point.</p><p>This was a valuable lesson - rather than trying to force myself to do something I\u2019m bad at, I should try and contribute where I\u2019m best at. Of course, there are limits to this - I still need to make sure the thing I\u2019m contributing is actually useful. But I suspect this is not a large problem with the specific fields of software engineering and AI alignment - there\u2019s plenty of work that can be done here with this skillset.</p><h2>Applications and Future Plans</h2><p>As the year neared its end, I needed to decide what I wanted to do next. I knew mech interp wasn\u2019t the field I wanted to be in. But as I re-evaluated my year, I thought about how I left evals because I lacked a solid theory of change for how that might help. Since then, GPT-4 came out, and the world began to take notice. AI labs committed to red-teaming, the UK government organised the AI Safety Summit, and they even committed&nbsp;\u00a3100m to a task force devoted to AI safety. Suddenly, the idea of a scary demo being noticed by the broader world, or evaluation results causing the main labs to take notice and slow down, seemed much more reasonable.</p><p>So I decided to leverage my experience with LLM\u2019s and my software engineering skills to apply for some evals positions. I got pretty deep in Apollo Research\u2019s process, much further than other jobs I\u2019d applied for earlier in the year. While I didn\u2019t get that position, I eventually got hired by the UK\u2019s task force. They weren\u2019t on my radar at first, but after information started coming in that they seemed to be working on the right problems for the right reasons, I sent in an application. These initial impressions were reinforced as I went through the process, and I now think I can do some good work there, with a theory of change for why this matters. I wouldn't say I've \"succeeded in the field\" yet, but I have put myself in the position to have a very good shot at doing so in 2024.</p><p>So, what were the lessons I learned, overall, throughout the year? Well, the main thing is - looking at my year overall, there were a lot of mistakes, some avoidable, some not. The thing that saved me was being willing to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/\"><u>look into the abyss</u></a> - to ask if my plans were wrong, or my previous decisions no longer applied. This allowed me to notice when my reasoning for leaving the field of evals was obsolete, and let me make the move back. I think this skill will be useful when I actually go to London, as well. I\u2019m giving up my apartment, getting rid of most of my stuff, and leaving my current life behind - there\u2019s a temptation to rationalise that choice, even if it turns out to be the wrong one.</p><p>I do need to keep in mind what my theory of change is, and ask myself whether there is a reasonable route at this job to actually helping to reduce existential risk. The number one risk for failing at this, in my opinion, is that the main goal of the task force is to provide information to use in policy. If people in policy ignore this and don\u2019t pay attention, the task force\u2019s impact on x-risk becomes much, much weaker. The main path to impact here is providing the information to help improve UK policy, which hopefully serves as a blueprint for other countries to follow. This can\u2019t happen if the task force\u2019s recommendations are ignored. I\u2019ll need to do my best to ensure this doesn\u2019t happen, and notice if it does, so I can pursue the best path I can. I\u2019ve begun referring to my \u201cjob\u201d and my \u201cmission\u201d, where the job is what I was hired to do and the mission is what I actually want to achieve. The two are correlated (if not, why do the job at all?) but they aren\u2019t quite the same thing.<br><br>In the end, what matters is reducing existential risk, not getting a job in the field. In 2024, I hope I\u2019m finally in the position to start doing just that.</p>", "user": {"username": "Jay Bailey"}}, {"_id": "FrH3gdFHxbuDgzftR", "title": "In Pursuit of Practical Ethics: Eudaimonic Utilitarianism with Kantian Priors", "postedAt": "2024-01-08T06:58:06.678Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Disclaimer: I am not a professional moral philosopher.

My ideas are just ideas, and I don\u2019t claim at all to have discovered any version of the One True Morality. I also assume moral realism and moral universalism for reasons that should become obvious in the next sections.</i></p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>While in recent years the CEA and the leadership of EA have emphasized that they do not endorse any particular moral philosophy over any other, the reality is that, as per the <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/eas2019-community-demographics-characteristics\"><u>last EA Survey that checked</u></a>, a large majority of EAs lean towards Utilitarianism as their guiding morality.</p><p>Between that and the recent concerns about issues with the \u201cna\u00efve\u201d Utilitarianism of SBF, I thought it might be worthwhile to offer some of my philosophical hacks or modifications to Utilitarianism that I think enable it to be more intuitive, practical, and less prone to many of the apparent problems people seem to have with the classical implementation.</p><p>This consists of two primary modifications: setting utility to be Eudaimonia, and using Kantian priors. Note that these modifications are essentially independent of each other, and so you can incorporate one or the other separately rather than taking them together.</p><p><strong>Eudaimonic Utilitarianism</strong></p><p>The notion of Eudaimonia is an old one that stems from the Greek philosophical tradition. In particular, it was popularized by Aristotle, who formulated it as a kind of \u201chuman flourishing\u201d (though I think it applies to animals as well) and associated it with happiness and the ultimate good (the \u201csummum bonum\u201d). It\u2019s also commonly thought of as objective well-being.</p><p>Compared with subjective happiness, Eudaimonia attempts to capture a more objective state of existence. I tend to think of it as the happiness you would feel about yourself if you had perfect information and knew what was actually going on in the world. It is similar to the concept of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/coherent-extrapolated-volition\"><u>Coherent Extrapolated Volition</u></a> that Eliezer Yudkowsky used to espouse a lot. The state of Eudaimonia is like reaching your full potential as a sentient being with agency, rather than a passive emotional experience like with happiness.</p><p>So, why Eudaimonia? The logic of using Eudaimonia rather than mere happiness as the utility to be optimized is that it connects more directly with the authentic truth, which can be desirable to avoid the following intuitively problematic scenarios:</p><ul><li>The Experience Machine \u2013 Plugging into a machine that causes you to experience the life you most desire, but it\u2019s all a simulation and you aren\u2019t actually doing anything meaningful.</li><li>Wireheading \u2013 Continuous direct electrical stimulation of the pleasure centres of the brain.</li><li>The Utilitronium Shockwave \u2013 Converting all matter in the universe into densely packed computational matter that simulates many, many sentient beings in unimaginable bliss.</li></ul><p>Essentially, these are all scenarios where happiness is seemingly maximized, but at the expense of something more than we also value, like truth or agency. Eudaimonia, by to an extent capturing this more complex value alongside happiness, allows us to escape these intellectual traps.</p><p>I\u2019ll further elaborate with an example. Imagine a mathematician who is brilliant, but also gets by far the most enjoyment out of life from counting blades of grass. But, by doing so, they are objectively wasting their potential as a mathematician to discover interesting things. A hedonistic or preference Utilitarian view would likely argue that their happiness from counting the blades of grass is what matters. A Eudaimonic Utilitarian on the other hand would see this as a waste of potential compared to the flourishing life that they could otherwise have lived.</p><p>Another example, again with our mathematician friend, is where there are two scenarios:</p><ul><li>They discover a great mathematical theorem, but do not ever realize this, such that it is only discovered by others after their death. They die sad, but in effect, a beautiful tragedy.</li><li>They believe they have discovered a great mathematical theorem, but in reality it is false, and they never learn the truth of the matter. They die happy, but in a state of delusion.</li></ul><p>Again, classical Utilitarianism would generally prefer the latter, while Eudaimonic Utilitarianism prefers the former.</p><p>Yet another example might be the case of Secret Adultery. A na\u00efve classical Utilitarian might argue that committing adultery in secret, assuming it can never be found out, adds more hedons to the world than doing nothing, and so is good. A Eudaimonic Utilitarian argues that what you don\u2019t know can still hurt your Eudaimonia, that if the partner had perfect information and knew about the adultery, they would feel greatly betrayed and so objectively, Eudaimonic utility is not maximized.</p><p>A final example is that of the Surprise Birthday Lie. Given Eudaimonic Utilitarianism seems very high on maintaining the truth, you might assume that it would be against lying to protect the surprise of a surprise birthday party. However, if the target of this surprise knew that people were lying so as to bring about a wonderful surprise for them, they would likely consent to these lies and prefer this to discovering the secret too soon and ruining the surprise. Thus, in this case Eudaimonic Utilitarianism implies that certain white lies can still be good.</p><p><strong>Kantian Priors</strong></p><p>This talk of truth and lies brings me to my other modification, Kantian Priors. Kant himself argued that truth telling was always right and lying was always wrong, so you might think that Kantianism would be completely incompatible with Utilitarianism. Even if you think Kant was wrong overall about morality, he did contribute some useful ideas that we can utilize. In particular, the categorical imperative in its form of doing only what can be universalized, is an interesting way to establish priors.</p><p>By priors, I refer to the Bayesian probabilistic notion of prior beliefs that are based on our previous experience and understanding of the world. When we make decisions with new information in a Bayesian framework, we update our priors with the new evidence to create our posterior beliefs, which we use to make the final decision with.</p><p>Kant argued that we don\u2019t know the consequences of our actions, so we should not bother to figure them out. This was admittedly rather simplistic, but the reality is that frequently there is grave uncertainty about the actual consequences of our actions, and predictions made even with the best knowledge are often wrong. In that sense, it is useful to try to adopt a Bayesian methodology to our moral practice, to help us deal with this practical uncertainty.</p><p>Thus, we establish priors for our moral policies, essentially default positions that we start from whenever we try to make moral decisions. For instance, in general, lying if universalized would lead to a total breakdown in trust and is thus contradictory. This implies a strong prior towards truth telling in most circumstances.</p><p>This truth telling prior is not an absolute rule. If there is strong enough evidence to suggest that it is not the best course of action, Kantian Priors allows us the flexibility to override the default. For instance, if we know the Nazis at our door asking if we are hiding Jews in our basement are up to no good, we can safely decide that lying to them is a justified exception.</p><p>Note that we do not have to necessarily base our priors on Kantian reasoning. We could also potentially choose some other roughly deontological system. Christian Priors, or Virtue Ethical Character Priors, are also possible if you are more partial to those systems of thought. The point is to have principled default positions as our baseline. I use Kantian Priors because I find the universalizability criterion to be an especially logical and consistent method for constructing sensible priors.</p><p>An interesting usefulness of having priors in our morality is that it causes us to have some of the advantages of deontology without the normal tradeoffs. Many people tend to trust those who have more deontological moralities because they are very reliably consistent with their rules and behaviour. Someone who never lies is quite trustworthy, while someone who frequently lies because they think the ends justifies the means, is not. Someone with deontic priors on the other hand isn\u2019t so rigid as to be blind to changing circumstances, but also isn\u2019t so slippery that you could worry if they\u2019re trying to manipulate you into doing what they think is good.</p><p>This idea of priors is similar to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-level_utilitarianism\"><u>Two-Level Utilitarianism</u></a>, but formulated differently. In Two-Level Utilitarianism, most of the time you follow rules, and sometimes, when the rules conflict or when there\u2019s a peculiar situation that suggests you shouldn\u2019t follow the rules, you calculate the actual consequences. With priors it\u2019s about if you receive strong evidence that can affect your posterior beliefs, and move you to temporarily break from your normal policies.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Classical Utilitarianism is a good system that captures a lot of valuable moral insights, but its practice by na\u00efve Utilitarians can leave something to be desired, due to perplexing edge cases, and a tendency to be able to justify just about anything with it. I offer two possible practical modifications that I hope allow for an integration of some of the insights of deontology and virtue ethics, and create a form of Utilitarianism that is more robust to the complexities of the real world.</p><p>I thus offer these ideas with the particular hope that such things as Kantian Priors can act as guardrails for your Utilitarianism against the temptations that appear to have been the ultimate downfall of people like SBF (assuming he was a Utilitarian in good faith of course).</p><p>Ultimately, it is up to you how you end up building your worldview and your moral centre. The challenge to behave morally in a world like ours is not easy, given vast uncertainties about what is right and the perverse incentives working against us. Nevertheless, I think it\u2019s commendable to want to do the right thing and be moral, and so I have suggested ways in which one might be able to pursue such practical ethics.</p>", "user": {"username": "Joseph_Chu"}}, {"_id": "KqTH5Yvxv3LbvcQz2", "title": "A model of research skill", "postedAt": "2024-01-08T00:13:18.073Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "LRudL"}}, {"_id": "5FFQRsGBcFxwjxtxe", "title": "Defending against hypothetical moon life during Apollo 11", "postedAt": "2024-01-07T23:59:23.278Z", "htmlBody": "<p>EA relevance: This is about a time 50 years ago when the US federal government went to a lot of effort to prevent a specific completely-hypothetical existential risk, and how that decision got made.</p><p><i>[Header image: </i><a href=\"https://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/kippsphotos/5961.jpg\"><i>Photo</i></a><i> of the lunar lander taken during Apollo 11.]</i></p><p>In 1969, after successfully bringing men back from landing on the moon, the astronauts, spacecraft, and all the samples from the moon surface were quarantined for 21 days. This was to account for the possibility that they were carrying hostile moon germs. Once the quarantine was up and the astronauts were not sick, and extensive biological testing on them and the samples showed no signs of infection or unexpected life, the astronauts were released.</p><p>We know now that the moon is sterile. We didn\u2019t always know this. That was one of the things we hoped to find out from the Apollo 11 program, which was the first time not only that people would visit another celestial body, but that material from another celestial body would be brought back in a relatively pristine fashion to earth. The possibilities were huge.</p><p>The possibilities included life, although nobody thought this was especially likely. But in that slim chance of life, there was a chance that life would be harmful to humans or the earth environment. Human history is full of organisms wrecking havoc when introduced to a new location \u2013 smallpox in the Americas, rats in Pacific Islands, <a href=\"https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/147198/a-global-water-hyacinth-invasion\">water hyacinth</a> outside of South America. What if there were microbes on the moon? Even if there was a tiny chance, wouldn\u2019t it be worth taking careful measures to avoid the risk of an unknown and irreversible change to the biosphere?</p><p>NASA, Congress, and various other federal agencies were apparently convinced to spend millions of dollars building an extensive new facility and take extensive other measures to address this possibility.</p><p>This is how a completely abstract argument about alien germs was taken seriously and mitigated at great effort and expense during the 1969 Apollo landing.</p><p>I've added my sources throughout, but a lot of this work draws from two very good pieces: Michael Meltzer's <i>When Biospheres Collide&nbsp;</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyecnc0bkz4p\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyecnc0bkz4p\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and Mangus and Larsen's <i>Lunar Receiving Laboratory Project History</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefghaae9k3c67\"><sup><a href=\"#fnghaae9k3c67\">[2]</a></sup></span><i>.</i></p><h2>Terms</h2><p><strong>Forward contamination:</strong> The risk that organisms from earth would be present on a spacecraft and would be carried onto a planet (or other celestial body).

Since we are now very certain that the moon is sterile, new samples coming back from the moon would be considered unrestricted.

By 1966, mitigation of back contamination risk had become a requirement for the entire moon landing mission. How did this happen?</p><h2>Forward contamination and the space race</h2><p>In 1957, Sputnik launched, and the USA became very aware that it was losing the space race.</p><p>Also in 1957, an American biology professor named Joshua Lederberg was talking with a British biologist, J. B. S. Haldane about the possibility of the USSR setting off a nuclear weapon on the moon as a show of force. While this would be bad for US morale, it would also be terrible for future research on the moon \u2013 would there be life up there? A nuke would disturb moon dust and scatter radioactive isotopes all over the moon. It would be impossible to study the moon in its untouched state and might interfere with finding <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.127.3313.1473\">delicate chemical structures</a> that could even relate to the origin of life.</p><p>Shortly after, Lederberg began pushing the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to avoid taking actions in space that would <a href=\"https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/spotlight/bb/catalog/nlm:nlmuid-101584906X13253-doc\">permanently close off aspects of research</a>.<sup>1</sup></p><p>In 1958, NASA was created by President Eisenhower. That same year, Lederberg received the Nobel Prize for his and Esther Lederberg\u2019s work discovering that asexual bacteria can exchange genetic material with each other through a process called conjugation. That year, he moved from Wisconsin to take a position at Stanford University. Among Lederberg\u2019s numerous interests were space and the prospect of finding life in space. He was interested in basic research and coined the word <a href=\"https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/about/history-of-astrobiology/\">\u201cexobiology\u201d</a> (more commonly today called astrobiology).</p><h2>Context: Biological science in the US</h2><p>This was a booming and breakneck period for biology.</p><p>A good benchmark for biological understanding is DNA \u2013 you can learn a great deal about the mechanics of inheritance without this (crop breeding, for instance, was a well-developed field), but a really good mechanistic understanding of genetics requires understanding DNA.</p><p>In 1951, Esther Lederberg isolated <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2007.03.006\">bacteriophage lambda</a> and began pinpointing the genetic roots of its reproductive cycle. Even though her husband got the Nobel Prize, Esther probably had the bigger impact on history - phage lambda and its life cycle switch went on to be used in the 50s and 60s as a critical model organism in discerning many fundamental aspects of genetics. The <i>lac</i> operon metabolic process in<i> Escherichia coli</i> bacteria was another key system discovered and understood in this time period. Between these two small seeds, most of molecular biology grew.</p><p>Shortly after, in 1953, Rosalind Franklin, Francis Crick, and James Watson elucidate the full double helix structure of DNA. In the 1950s through the 1960s, biologists were seeing the gears of life for the first time.</p><p>On the macro side, the environmental movement and conservation biology were also increasingly popular in this period. Rachel Carson\u2019s <i>Silent Spring </i>came out in 1962 and immediately shown a spotlight on pollution and environmental contamination (more on this later.)</p><p>Two specific fields of biology are especially relevant to our story.</p><h3>Exobiology and the origin of life</h3><p>Scientists debated various theories about how life first came to be. Had the first life emerged on earth, via abiogenesis - for instance, from the chemical soup of shallow ponds, or the chemical soup of deep-sea vents? In 1950, legendary biologist <a href=\"https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/112626\">Melvin Calvin</a> created simple organic molecules with basic predecessors and energetic sources; in 1952, Stanley Miller and Harold Urey refine his work and use a slightly different soup and manage to generate amino acids. It seemed like the right combination of chemicals and energy occurring naturally on the early earth could create the precursors of life, and then life itself.</p><p>Or had life come from space, in material transferred between planets or even between the stars in a process called panspermia?</p><p>An old theory, panspermia was seeing a resurgence of interest, driven partially by the finding \u2013 <a href=\"https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/112626\">again by Calvin</a> \u2013 that some meteorites had a molecule related to amino acid. Calvin thought this was even stronger evidence for panspermia than the chemical precursors stuff for earthly abiogenesis. While the meteor evidence was rudimentary, any meteorite found on earth has already been heralded through the destructive forces of atmospheric re-entry. But if life or even some lifelike material was found in rocks in space \u2013 for instance, on the moon \u2013 that would be strong evidence of panspermia, and not just a scarce unlikely panspermia but that the universe was <i>rich </i>with life.</p><h3>Biological Weapons</h3><p>At this point in time, the US had an unprecedented capacity to handle dangerous biological substances, including viruses, bacteria, and various organisms that might be ridiculously hardy, stable when dry, etc. This is because in the 1960s, the US <i>had an active biological weapons program.</i></p><p>The program started in the 40s, and throughout the 1960s, alongside the Vietnam War, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara expanded it. Facilities grew, weapons were stockpiled, and pathogens and pathogen-simulants were tested all over the US.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefku9kdaprx7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnku9kdaprx7\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I <i>bet </i>certain politically-savvy scientists or science (and national defense)-savvy politicians were worried about the possible dangers of strange microbes! They had them! They were making more of them!</p><p>Biosafety, bioweapons, and basic biological research were growing up at the same time. You might think that the eruption of knowledge in basic biology directly drove US innovation in biosafety, but I think it was actually largely due to the bioweapons program.</p><p>The presenters at the first biosafety meetings in America started in 1955 were all from the US Army Chemical Corps (<a href=\"https://armyhistory.org/the-u-s-army-chemical-corps-past-present-and-future/\">which made bioweapons</a>). The meetings were held at various biological weapon facilities. They assessed risk from anthrax, tularemia, and aersolization testing apparatuses to lab workers and to the surrounding natural environments.</p><p>These conferences grew in the late 1960s (the ones that eventually turned into the American Biological Safety Association (ABSA)) and had presenters from labs, hospitals, etc, but the meetings were <a href=\"https://absa.org/about/hist02/\">still held at</a> Fort Detrick, the US\u2019s largest biological weapons laboratory.</p><p>At the 1966 meeting, the <a href=\"https://absa.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NIH-Biohazard-The_Design_of_the_Symbol-April-2011.docx\">biological hazard symbol</a> (\u2623\ufe0f) was developed on government contract because there was no existing universal biohazard warning symbol \u2013 the studies that established the need to such a symbol focused especially on bioweapon laboratories.</p><p>Laboratory gloveboxes were originally developed for avoiding risk while working with radioactive material, but their usage for high-risk pathogens was pioneered in \u2013 yes \u2013 the US biological weapons program. They will make a later appearance in the lunar receiving laboratory. We will learn a lot more about the LRL soon.</p><p>Similarly, if NASA had not eventually been approved congressional funding for a lunar receiving laboratory that could contain biologically sensitive specimens, the next best candidate was Fort Detrick.<sup>1</sup></p><p>The US bioweapons program was formally ended by President Nixon in 1969/11, just a few months after the moon landing.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Back to establishing an early history of the idea</h2><p>Reports, <a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/18476/organic-matter-and-the-moon-by-carl-sagan\">for instance by Carl Sagan</a>, speculated that any life would be unlikely to last long on the harsh climate of the surface \u2013 but microbes (or evidence of past microbes) might be protected not far under the surface.</p><p>International interest in space was picking up. The UN created the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (UNCOPUOS) in 1958-12. For <a href=\"https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/206866\">the first</a> <a href=\"https://www.unoosa.org/oosa/oosadoc/data/documents/1963/a/a5549_0.html\">few years</a>, there was no apparent prioritization of forward <i>or</i> back contamination risk \u2013 they were more concerned with preventing space from being used as a new avenue for war. (They began to adopt official policies about this later, in 1964, and are <a href=\"https://www.ida.org/research-and-publications/publications/all/t/to/towards-the-development-of-a-national-planetary-protection-policy\">now considered an authority</a> in planetary protection, but they weren\u2019t to start out with. The US\u2019s efforts in the matter up through 1969 were largely homegrown, so this is the last you\u2019ll hear of them here.)</p><p>In February of 1958, the International Consortium on Space (ICSU) made an ad hoc Committee on Contamination by Extraterrestrial Exploration (CETEX) with representatives from different agencies. When CETEX met for the first time in May, they were mostly worried about forward contamination. They discussed back contamination but did not believe it was a serious danger.</p><p>A month later, with heavy influence from Lederberg, the NAS Space Science Board was created. One of its various committees was the Committee on Psychological and Biological Research, which included origin-of-life related questions.<sup>1</sup></p><p>Origin of life research was a third angle on the front contamination (danger to space life or the sanctity of space environments) vs. back contamination (danger to earth life) fronts \u2013 if earth life contaminated the samples, it could become extremely difficult to tell whether possible signs of life were from space or earth.</p><p>To put it another way, if we discovered moon life that was extremely similar to and chemically indistinguishable from earth life, this would be <i>enormous</i> news about our place in the universe \u2013 <i>if </i>we could be certain that we hadn\u2019t accidentally blasted that life out from our own space ships in the first place. Samples from the moon had a chance to answer cosmic questions. It was important not to ruin this.</p><h2>What about the other way?</h2><p>Forward contamination holds that earth contaminants including living organisms could disrupt delicate space chemicals, up to and including moon life. To understand and approach this concern, we have to seriously think through the implications of there being life on the moon.</p><p>One of these implications suggests another risk - is that moon life could also in turn disrupt earth life. This is a risk of a new kind \u2013 not of impeding research, but of theoretical human danger.</p><p>In 1959, SSB member Dr. Bruno Rossi set up WESTEX, a coalition of West Coast scientists discussing issues on basic research of biology in space \u2013 the kind of thing we\u2019d now call astrobiology. I believe Joshua Lederberg influenced it, though he didn\u2019t attend.</p><p>WESTEX met 4 times. In <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17226/12430\">their final 1959 report</a>, they mention forward contamination, as well as back contamination. Regarding the latter:</p><ul><li>They describe possible threat models.<ul><li>For instance, microbes that produce antibiotics (a popular strategy in earth microbes).</li><li>Or that could hypothetically produce carbon monoxide or nitrous oxide en masse as a byproduct (perhaps metabolically enabled by electron-transfer systems other than the earth go-to cytochrome.)</li><li>As well as more common examples like diseases (syphilis, smallpox) or invasive species (prickly pear &amp; rabbits in Australia, insect pests).</li></ul></li><li>Preventing forward contamination is important for evaluating back contamination (by reducing false positives).</li><li>The call to action is brief. Do more studies and plan to strictly monitor return trips.</li></ul><p>Perhaps as a result of this, in the 1959-1960 period, the Space Science Board recommended that NASA and ARPA start studying sterilization for the explicit goal of avoiding back contamination. As far as I can tell, this may be the first recommendation by a relatively official and permanent federal group that space exploration take back contamination risk seriously.</p><p>At this point, these concerns are about future approaches \u2013 there was interest in bringing material back from space, but no immediate plans to do so.</p><p>Sidenote on x-risk</p><p><a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/existential-risk/existential-risk/\">Existential risk</a>-minded readers may draw a distinction between the relative importance of forward contamination or sample contamination risk vs. back contamination risk. Given the (even at the time uncontroversial) statements that other planets were <i>unlikely</i> to have life, forward contamination had the small risk of harming or even destroying an off-planet ecosystem that probably had nothing more complex than microbes, and a higher chance of contaminating an interesting untouched natural environment.</p><p>If panspermia were correct, though, the moon would not be our <i>only chance </i>of finding this out \u2013 Mars, for instance, thought in the 1960s to be reachable within years and the obvious next target after the Moon \u2013 should also be rich with life. So should various asteroid-type bodies. There is some chance meanwhile that back contamination could, via wayward microbes, kill humanity entirely. This would permanently prevent the origins of life, or any human question ever, from being answered.</p><p>Was anyone thinking like this at the time? I haven\u2019t found any indications that people were concerned about true extinction-type risk from incoming bodies, but they weren\u2019t exactly bounding the risk either, and most of the communications I find were probably interested in seeming grounded and defensible by comparing to familiar biological events in human history like the introduction of smallpox, various invasive species, etc. I do wonder if some of the researchers involved thought about the possibility.</p><h2>Putting a man on the moon</h2><p>In April 1961, USSR cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became the first human to go to outer space, and then the first human to come back from outer space. A month later, May 1961, Kennedy announced the US\u2019s goal of putting a man on the moon before the decade was out.</p><p>Immediately, even absent any other details, this plan suggests the risk of back contamination:</p><ul><li>First, material from the moon (samples, a ship, etc) would returned to earth as a part of this. This is new.</li><li>Second, in addition to rocks, an entire biological system (a live human) would be going to the moon and coming back. This reduces the number of actions that can be taken to sterilize returning materials while keeping the person alive.</li></ul><p>Out of concern over back contamination risk, Lederberg worked with major US space contractor Lockheed Aircraft Corp to attempt to make a 1-way testing lab for detecting life in moon dust. This was never implemented but the efforts \u2013 and a summary of back contamination risk - were discussed <a href=\"https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,939340,00.html\">in Time Magazine</a>. Still, the concern was extremely niche.</p><p>In 1963 during a NASA budget hearing, Senator Margaret Chase Smith (R-ME), then the highest-ranking Republican on the Senate Space Committee, asked NASA what they planned to do about the risk of contamination from alien life. NASA said the risk was unlikely but that they did not have a plan;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbvor2uinlyi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbvor2uinlyi\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;they began to investigate precautionary measures more seriously.<sup>1</sup></p><p>Why was back contamination on Smith\u2019s mind? I\u2019m not sure. She had an extensive knowledge of space issues, scientific understanding of other planets, and generally the dream of exploring other planets \u2013 she wrote a newspaper editorial in her home state of Maine expounding on such things and talking about Maine's contribution to the budding telecom satellites and about the benefits space exploration offers to the US and to humanity.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvukrbyqddko\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvukrbyqddko\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Perhaps during the course of her space work in the Senate, she talked to someone like Joshua Lederberg or a worker at Lockheed Martin. Either way, her addressing it in this hearing seems to have prompted people at NASA to examine the idea seriously.</p><h2>A secret executive order</h2><p>On 1963/04/17, Kennedy issued <a href=\"https://www.jfklibrary.org/asset-viewer/archives/jfknsf-340-023\">National Security Action Memorandum No. 235</a> to the Federal Cabinet. It applied to:</p><blockquote><p>\u201clarge-scale scientific or technological experiments that might have significant or protracted effects on the physical or biological environment. Experiments which by their nature could result in domestic or foreign allegations that they might have such effects will be included in this category even though the sponsoring agency feels confident that such allegations would in fact prove to be unfounded.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>These experiments were to be reviewed before proceeding, by the Special Assistant to the President on Science and Technology (at the time, Jerome Wiesner.)</p><p>No similar action memorandum had been issued before. At face value, this memorandum applies directly to back contamination risks from newly-planned space research. But the directive is a strange mix of vague and specific. The language about \"feels confident that such allegations\" is <i>weird. </i>It feels to me like this had to have been made for a specific reason. Was that reason back contamination?</p><p>As it happens, it\u2019s hard to tell. The early 60s were an incredibly weird time. Here are some things this memo could potentially have applied to:</p><ul><li><strong>The moon / space exploration </strong>\u2013 The idea of inadvertently irreversibly changing space or earth was, as we\u2019ve established, around. By 1964, the next year, NASA began seriously committing to the idea of quarantine and avoiding back contamination risk. Maybe NSAM-235 was related to or inspired by Senator Smith\u2019s interest.</li><li><strong>Nuclear weapons</strong> \u2013 In the height of the cold war, the nuclear superpowers were all testing their nuclear innovations and flexing their nuclear muscles. In 1962, the US conducted <a href=\"https://nuke.fas.org/guide/usa/nuclear/usnuctests.htm\">96 nuclear tests</a>, the most it\u2019s ever done in a year. The US deployed bombs from planes, balloons, boats, submarines, and explodes them underground, on land, underwater, and high in the atmosphere (the latter of which was <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0096340212451574\">revealed to the public in the New York Times</a>.)</li><li>\u2003\u2003 Some US officials, made nervous by the USSR\u2019s rapid nuclear progress, were floating the idea of a ban on nuclear testing. The first international <a href=\"http://2009-2017.state.gov/t/avc/trty/199116.htm\">Limited [partial] Test Ban Treaty</a> was signed a few months later in August. Was NSAM-235 an earlier internal step in this direction?*</li><li>\u2003\u2003 I mentioned earlier that in 1958, Lederberg was worried that the USSR would detonate a nuclear bomb on the moon<strong> </strong>in a show of nuclear superiority. He didn\u2019t know that that year, <a href=\"http://www.svengrahn.pp.se/histind/E3/E3orig.htm\">the USSR was considering just that</a>.</li><li>\u2003\u2003 He also would not have known that, also at the same time, the US was considering <a href=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-07-17/moon-us-plans-cold-war-russia-sputnik/11220340\"><i>exactly the same thing</i></a><i>.</i></li><li><strong>Biological weapons </strong>\u2013 As mentioned, the US was in the process of expanding its biological weapons program. A few months after NSAM-235 was signed, the military began testing bioweapons and bioweapon-simulants (harmless strains) on the environment and soldiers at Fort Douglas (specifically the <a href=\"https://health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Health-Readiness/Environmental-Exposures/Project-112-SHAD\">Deseret Test Center</a>) in an unprecedented way.<sup>1</sup> Was NSAM-235 established to legitimize or create an approval process for expanded testing of bioweapons?</li><li><strong>General environmental threats</strong> - Was it not related to space or to military projects? Kennedy was an environmentalist who <a href=\"https://www.audubon.org/magazine/may-june-2012/rachel-carson-and-jfk-environmental-tag-team\">helped to spread the work of Rachel Carson</a> (anti-pollution advocate and author of \u201cSilent Spring\u201d.) Other controversial issues at the time included atmospheric pollution from the space program<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdg5jhyaddz\"><sup><a href=\"#fndg5jhyaddz\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0096340212451574\">weather control</a>.</li></ul><p>So ignore for a moment what it was <i>intended </i>to apply to. <i>Was </i>it applied to the moon landing? This is also difficult to say. NSAM-235 was only declassified to the public in 1993, and there are few publicly known details around it. A number of authors have drawn connections between it and other ongoing governmental activities, but I don\u2019t know if any of these were informed by anything other than timing.</p><p>NASA at the time did not necessarily consider the moon landing an inherently scientific enterprise \u2013 more on this later \u2013 so I don\u2019t think they necessarily would have seen NSAM-235 as applying to them. I do figure that if the memorandum was <i>intended </i>to enforce some specific kind of experiment, it might not have been applied in practice to other unrelated experiments. And I personally haven\u2019t seen an account or record from someone there in the 1960s saying \u201cwe at NASA did this to comply with NSAM-235.\u201d</p><p>In November of 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated. In the 1970s, NSAM-235 was superseded by the non-classified Presidential Directive/National Security Council Memorandum 25 (PD/NSC-25), which applies to experiments with possible large adverse environmental effects but also specifically calls out nuclear systems in space. (This also weakly suggests that testing nuclear weapons in space was perhaps the main interest of the original NSAM-235).</p><p>PD/NSC-15 remains in effect and <a href=\"https://www.ida.org/research-and-publications/publications/all/t/to/towards-the-development-of-a-national-planetary-protection-policy\">potentially still applies</a> to future space missions, like manned missions or sample-return missions from Mars, that entail back contamination risk.</p><h1>The idea through NASA and the federal government</h1><h2>NASA plans for the LRL</h2><p>At this point, relevant NASA branches included:</p><ul><li>The Office of Space Science and Applications (OSSA). More research-heavy and closer to NASA\u2019s headquarters.</li><li>The Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC), in Houston, the complex that would eventually direct the moon landing. More engineering-focused than research-focused.<sup>2</sup></li></ul><p>Around this time, two MSC geoscientists first promoted and planned an LRL. An external group, the SSB, hosted an important conference. Then OSSA ran two similar committees ran concurrently to establish priorities for the LRL.</p><h3>King and Flory plan for a receiving laboratory</h3><p>Elbert A. King and Donald A. Flory were MSC geoscientists who started planning for NASA to do sample containment. They made the first broad plans for an LRL in 1964, and various memos from throughout MSC and later OSSA expand on the idea from there. The motivations for a dedicated facility began solely as facilitating research, including sample protection (from, say, contamination or destruction).<sup>2</sup> Back contamination was incorporated into the MSC\u2019s plan later<sup>1</sup>, after more outside interest had accrued. The following committees and events helped establish that outside interest.</p><h3>The 1964 \u201cPotential Hazards of Back Contamination from the Planets\u201d Conference</h3><p>The SSB ran a conference from 1964/07/29-30. Its attendees were 30 representatives from numerous agencies \u2013 NIH, USDA, NASA, the NAS, the Army \u2013 and academia (including medical doctors, zoologists, public health experts, and more).<sup>2</sup> Conference attendees, as might be suggested by the fact that they were attending a conference with \u201cHazards of Back Contamination\u201d in the name, agreed unanimously that precautions must be taken.</p><p>This is potentially the step at which numerous <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2001/winter/nasa-lunar-lab\">outside agencies got invested in back contamination risk</a> and feel responsible for reducing it.</p><p>Additionally, at this conference, some early principles that will guide the rest of the project were established: attendees agreed on a strict quarantine program for returning astronauts, spacecrafts, and samples.<sup>2</sup> Astronauts were to be isolated for at least 3 weeks (if not more), and materials should be tested on plants and animals for any sign of biological activity.<sup>1</sup></p><h3>The Chao Committee</h3><p>The OSSA Ad Hoc Committee on the LRL was established in 1964-10 to guide LRL development. It was chaired by Edward Chao, a NASA geochemist on loan from the US Geological Survey. Other representatives came from NASA, the Department of Energy, the Army Biological Laboratories, and universities.</p><p>The Chao Committee\u2019s final report was delayed because they had reached out to the US Public Health Service (PHS) at some point, and the PHS became <i>very </i>interested. During this Committee\u2019s existence, a trend started - tensions between MSC (primarily interested in research and sample protection, probably thought they would have final control over the LRL) and NASA headquarters plus the PHS (both increasingly interested in back contamination prevention and wanted to exert more control over the LRL).<sup>2</sup> Despite this tension in implementation, this period seems to have been <strong>the start of a deep relationship between PHS and NASA</strong>.</p><p><strong>1965-04-08 Chao Committee report:</strong></p><ul><li>Stresses back contamination risk.</li><li>Says the goal of the LRL is to provide complete containment of possible biohazards until they can be ruled out.</li><li>The LRL should be ready to do any time-sensitive research tasks in quarantine.<ul><li>But noted that the scientific community would want to be involved in research and would reject more research concentrated at the LRL than necessary.</li></ul></li><li>Recommends, after considering multiple possible sites, that the LRL be built in Houston.<sup>1</sup></li></ul><h3>The Hess Committee</h3><p>AKA the Ad Hoc Committee on the Lunar Sample Handling Facility.</p><p>Homer Newell at OSSA wanted outside experts to determine what the LRL requires, and recruited NAS SSB chair Harry Hess for this purpose on 1965-01-14. Hess forms this 6-person committee.</p><p><strong>1965/02/02 Hess Committee report:</strong></p><ul><li>Prioritizes biosecurity, to a degree that surprised NASA Headquarters and MSC staff.</li><li>Determines that, research-wise, the LRL only needs to be ready to perform radioactivity counting studies (the only truly time-sensitive research task) \u2013 everything else could wait.</li><li>Testing for pathogens can occur in the mean time \u2013 at the LRL or at other public health/biowarfare labs.</li><li>Estimates LRL budget at $2,500,000 for a lab that could do radioactivity counting studies (an expensive part \u2013 this area needs to be buried to shield from background radiation) + quarantine and some biological testing.<sup>1</sup></li></ul><h3>The Interagency Committee on Back Contamination</h3><p>In late 1965, there were important exchanges between PHS (including CDC chief James L. Goddard and Surgeon General William H. Stewart), the USDA, MSC, and NASA headquarters. These helped get everyone (especially MSC) on the same page about moving ahead with the LRL.</p><p>There was some debate about whether NASA or PHS should take the lead on back contamination vis a vis the LRL. Surgeon General William H. Stewart (speaking for PHS) recommended the creation of what became known as the Interagency Committee on Back Contamination (ICBC). It was yet another committee with representatives from various agencies, but this one lasted throughout the moon landing.<sup>2</sup> They ended up making major decisions about quarantine efforts and the LRL, and were eventually responsible for certifying the LRL as meeting NASA\u2019s obligations to PHS and to the public about back contamination.</p><p>(The USDA gets folded in alongside PHS at this point and ahead - because PHS has jurisdiction over human diseases whereas the USDA is concerned with plant and animal diseases. Even if the greatest fear is a disease that would harm humans, diseases that affect livestock or wild ecosystems were also generally of concern and the USDA had jurisdiction and expertise here.)</p><h1>Convincing Congress to fund the Lunar Receiving Laboratory</h1><p>In 1966/03, NASA submitted its FY 1967 budget request, including $9.1 million for the LRL. In the House Subcommittee, this faced a lot of scrutiny. Congresspeople Donald Rumsfeld and James Fulton objected to the cost of the facility, and to the political ramifications of another expensive NASA facility based in Texas \u2013 Texas was enjoying a lot of expensive projects especially as a result of the push for the moon. If a facility was really necessary, why not let another state get in on the government funding? And if quarantine was necessary, was a whole new facility? The US had high-tech labs all around the country. Their objections do <i>not </i>seem to have been dismissing the idea of quarantine out of hand, just the need for a new facility.</p><p>When Congress issued their budget a week later, they had not been convinced. They did not include <strong>any </strong>money for a new facility. At this point, it would have been easy for NASA to drop the idea of quarantine entirely, or compromise substantially. But back contamination was already of great concern to researchers, and an LRL was basically required by the PHS and USDA for them to approve the release of the samples. Earlier efforts had turned the existence of a robust quarantine efforts into a necessity for the mission to proceed. NASA had tied itself to the mast.</p><p>A viable LRL needed:<sup>1</sup></p><ul><li>Two-way biological containment</li><li>Treatment of outbound liquid waste</li><li>Treatment of outbound gaseous waste</li><li>Ability of handle samples in a robust vacuum</li><li>Remote manipulation of samples/equipment (i.e. not directly by a person)</li><li>Clean pumping system</li><li>Low-level radiation measurement capacity</li></ul><p>NASA spent the next two weeks hurriedly reviewing other possible facilities around the US as LRL candidates. They assessed 27 other facilities that could function as both biological quarantine for materials and people and early research (both on biological activity of samples and on time-sensitive basic research studies of moon material.)</p><p>The once that came the closest, as previously mentioned, was Fort Detrick, which met every criteria and was basically perfect \u2013 except that using it would interfere with all of Fort Detrick\u2019s other work.<sup>1</sup> Any other facility would need expensive retrofits. NASA had the report to show that to meet PHS\u2019s and their own specifications, nowhere else would do. They needed their own facility. Drafts of the upcoming report were shared with Congress in time for the budget rehearing.</p><p>The rehearing, on 1966 March 31, was with the House Subcommittee and specifically about the LRL budget. NASA head of the Office of Manned Space Flight George Mueller defended NASA\u2019s objectivity and reliance on outside experts (for instance, their work with NAS and the many non-NASA personnel on the Chao Committee) in making the decision of where to put the LRL.</p><p>He explained the report\u2019s findings and that the proposed budget had already been streamlined from its first estimates (an early estimate of $23 million shrunk to $9.1 million.) He was asked why the LRL should not be on a ship or an island, and explained that a new ship would be more expensive to build than the entire LRL - and that a Texas facility would serve retrievals both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, while an oceanic island would require such long travel times that it might only usefully serve one (and so they\u2019d need to build two if they took that approach for future missions.)</p><p>Mueller\u2019s case to Congress was successful. On May 3<sup>rd</sup>, the House authorization bill passed and awarded $9.1 million for the LRL at an astonishing 349:10 vote. The bill still had to pass the Senate, which was expected to cut the funding slightly more. NASA internally prepared to build the facility for $8.1 million. This was in fact how much the House and Senate agreed to award the project by July 22<sup>nd</sup>, and indeed how much they were awarded in the compromise bill on August 18. (Michael Meltzer, whose history of planetary protection was invaluable in writing this entire piece, speculates that NASA\u2019s original LRL budget was perhaps padded by 11% on purpose \u2013 since they were expecting a generic budget reduction in the Senate.<sup>1</sup>)</p><p>The LRL was on \u2013 and by extension the less-directly-expensive but still effortful project to minimize back contamination risk from the moon landing. Construction began in August 1966, and the building officially opened in 1967.</p><h1>Establishing a strategy</h1><p>As mitigation efforts progressed, the details of the moon landing itself were also being developed at the MSC and at NASA. Back contamination reduction was choreographed in tandem with the mechanisms that would allow the moon landing to happen. For instance, the plan was previously to have the returning astronauts land in the sealed command module (CM \u2013 the part of the spaceship that comes back from the moon), which would be lifted from the sea entirely so that the astronauts, samples, and any air, dust, etc could be transferred swiftly and carefully from the CM into biological isolation. This ran into trouble.</p><p>First, in late 1966, MSC calculations showed that the air inside the CM could become dangerously hot unless it were allowed to vent into the earth\u2019s atmosphere upon splashdown. Second, around the same time, someone observed that the CM with astronauts inside would be too heavy for any ship crane to safely lift. The astronauts will have to be picked up separately in the ocean, relying on less comprehensive measures protecting the earth from these possible sources of contamination (for instance, air filters and a plastic suit called a \u2018biological isolation garment\u2019). The ICBC was dubious<sup>1</sup>, but NASA declared that these other measures would be adequate \u2013 it absolutely did not want to jeopardize astronaut safety.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflmpm6hwaeyt\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlmpm6hwaeyt\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><p>These details are interesting for a few reasons \u2013 first, they\u2019re examples of major BC mitigation effort which is weakened upon contact with reality (e.g. realizing that there is no crane rated for the job) and in favor of crew safety (e.g. the risk of using an un-rated crane, such as the one that ultimately lifts the module). In both cases, the MSC and NASA overruled ICBC concerns to take steps that posed less risk to the crew. Second, because this is plausibly the step that, had there truly been a threat, ultimately created the most potential for earth contamination.</p><p>In 1967/02, the ICBC decided that in evaluating harm from samples, the LRL\u2019s goal would be to check for pathogenicity or other harm to lifeforms \u2013 not necessarily to detect <i>any </i>signs of life. This made the LRL\u2019s job easier. They advised aerobic and anaerobic culturing\u2020 and exposing samples to various life forms (tissue, plants, animals, eggs, etc.)<sup>1</sup> Culturing does not <i>necessarily </i>indicate pathogenicity, but it does indicate life, and it\u2019s a simple and cheap test.</p><h2>The Baylor Protocol</h2><p>In 1867, Baylor University College of Medicine was contracted by NASA to produce a guidebook: the quarantine protocol for the Apollo missions. (Walter W. Kemmerer, the Assistant for Biomedical Operations at MSC\u2019s recently-created Science and Application\u2019s Directorate who worked on the project, was a Baylor alumni, which may have been why it was chosen.)<sup>1</sup> (I imagine the ICBC may have been responsible for getting the report commissioned, but I\u2019m not sure.)</p><p>In 1967/06/16, they published a report called \u201c<a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19680021536/downloads/19680021536.pdf\">Comprehensive Biological Protocol for the Lunar Sample Receiving Laboratory Manned Spacecraft Center</a>,\u201d also known as The Baylor Protocol. This is a set of laboratory procedures that ended up guiding the quarantine-related efforts. Its contributors included dozens of doctors from various universities and other institutions. They worked with the PHS as well. Like with the LRL, PHS was was in charge of certifying the procedures \u2013 if they did, and if NASA than followed the procedures, NASA had PHS\u2019s approval to go on with the moon landing.</p><p>The Baylor Protocol was more specific than previous plans and went on to inform the rest of the LRL and procedures.</p><p>It outlines specific possible threats considered plausible:</p><ol><li>Toxic materials<ol><li>\u2003\u2003 Radioactive material (which would be identified at the LRL during early material tests)</li><li>\u2003\u2003 Inorganic polymers</li><li>\u2003\u2003 Bioactive \u201cdeleterious low-molecular-weight compounds\u201d (for instance, a toxin)</li><li>\u2003\u2003 Metallo-organic compounds</li></ol></li><li>Replicative materials<ol><li>\u2003\u2003 Organisms <i>from earth</i> that are mutated under high radiation levels and return with new properties (declared unlikely)</li><li>\u2003\u2003 Lunar plants (which could grow on earth and \u201cproduce deleterious effects by contact or competition\u201d)</li><li>\u2003\u2003 Lunar extremophiles adapted for dry environments (which might infect and/or replicate in a human or other earth host)</li><li>\u2003\u2003 Lunar organisms more complex than tiny animals or plants (so unlikely as to be \u201cvirtually excluded from consideration\u201d)</li></ol></li></ol><p>The protocol writes: \u201cIn regard to the philosophy of the testing procedures, it is safe to say that never before has there existed a facility with such ambitious and demanding goals as those presented by the Lunar Receiving Laboratory.\u201d</p><p>The Baylor Protocols are relatively elaborate and specific. Some points of interest include:</p><ul><li>Characterizing crew microbiota, including possible infectious diseases or parasites (using the culture-based methods available at the time) <i>before </i>the mission, including animal and tissue culture tests, all with controls. (I believe animal tests were one of the more reliable ways to identify some viruses at the time.)</li><li>Keeping the crew relatively isolated before so that they would not acquire new diseases shortly before going up</li><li>A prioritization schema for various animal tests, etc, is sometimes indicated \u2013 I assume this was so that the final protocol could be prioritized depending on available resources, but also that had there been a positive result, the Protocol could have been referred to for guidance.</li><li>Upon return, samples were to be taken immediately including on the shipboard quarantine trailers back to the LRL (even though there weren\u2019t labs on the ship \u2013 they would be stored and tested at the LRL.)</li><li>A great deal of specific procedures for testing and observing the results of samples on dozens and dozens of potential hosts \u2013 growth media (perhaps a hundred kinds), tissue culture, live organisms from across the tree of life exposed via various means, etc.<ul><li>The recommended observations were very granular too \u2013 to the mass of snails, for instance, or the behavior of ants. Any of these could potentially indicate disease.</li><li>Samples were also exposed to virus-host systems (e.g. T4 on E. coli, polio on an animal host) to see if the altered the course of those infections.</li></ul></li><li>The single wildest experimental step I have ever seen:</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5FFQRsGBcFxwjxtxe/nnwtazmnfjr6avjzvhwv\" alt=\"&quot;a. Caimans or alligators shall be exposed to the lunar sample by the following routes: (1) Ingestion of food or drinking water [...]&quot;\"><figcaption>[Excerpt from the <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19680021536/downloads/19680021536.pdf\">Baylor Protocol</a>]</figcaption></figure><p><br>This raises an important question I hadn\u2019t expected, maybe the most important question of this project: did we really feed moon rocks to alligators? The Baylor Protocol was published a couple years before the moon landing, and while it was a pivotal guiding document, it was trimmed and reviewed by go time and not fully implemented. <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19760005580\">Numerous biological studies <i>were</i> conducted</a>, including on a shorter list of live animals. Alligators did <i>not </i>make the final cut. But mice, freshwater fish, clams, and shrimp did.</p><p>This actually ties into another point of contention \u2013 in addition to budget and time constraints, there wasn\u2019t going to be a lot of moon rock to go around. Alongside the Baylor Protocol, there was a running debate. Doing some kind of biological activity analysis would necessarily require using up (or otherwise contaminating) moon samples. But samples were extremely valuable and would be in short supply because of the storage and weight problems of rocketry. A lot of researchers wanted those rocks.</p><p>There had been back-and-forth about an appropriate sacrificial percentage \u2013 could 5% of the precious samples be used for safety testing? 10%? The Baylor Protocol helped Walter Kemmerer determine an actual number needed to carry out the basic tests recommended (presumably if any of them did turn up an indication of life or disease-causing activity, everyone would suddenly be happy to assign more sample to biological tests) \u2013 1.2 kilograms, about 5% of the estimated sample. This was the point that the ICBC held to down the line, although there was pushback closer to the launch date as well.<sup>1</sup></p><h2>Conflict points</h2><p>A quick overview of various \u201cfactions\u201d in play that affected decision-making throughout the program:</p><ul><li>Engineers (want to get rockets and people to space and back) vs. scientists (want to study space and moon material)</li><li>Scientists vs. engineers and politicians: get science included in missions at all (the moon landing was invaluable to astronomy, but the goal of the moon landing was not necessarily scientific!<sup>2</sup>)</li><li>Within scientists: Biological containment vs. unhindered studies (for instance, getting more usable samples versus using samples for biological testing. Or holding samples in quarantine before releasing them for research.)</li><li>Various power struggles within NASA<ul><li>\u2003 \u2003Office of Space Science and Applications (OSSA) has most of the research programs, but Office of Manned Space Flight (OMSF) does engineering. MSC reports to OMSF but is pretty independent.<ul><li>\u2003\u2003 There are also scientists at the MSC, but even they are mostly separated from engineers.<sup>2</sup><ul><li>NASA vs. other federal agencies claiming authority</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h1>Implementation</h1><p>Scientists recognized early on that the lunar samples might react with the atmosphere, and that studies about gases contained in moon rocks meant that the moon samples should be kept under vacuum. King and Flory recognized this at their time. This made the question of biological quarantine of samples relatively easy \u2013 being able to keep and manipulate samples stably under vacuum was already most of the way to biological isolation. You would just have to do this with <i>all</i> the samples, until they could be released from quarantine.</p><p>Quarantining people was harder. As a NASA representative reportedly put it in the first 1963 hearing where Senator Smith asked about reducing back contamination risk, complete isolation of astronauts from the moon could not be assured, and when considering returning from the moon, the human body \u201cis not in an a practical sense a sterilizable part of any system.\u201d<sup>4</sup> The goal would be to isolate the people from the environment until tests and a long monitoring period indicated no signs of life or illness.</p><h2>Sidenote on cost</h2><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><strong>At-the-time $</strong></td><td><strong>Adjusted to 2020 $</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Apollo program, 1960-1969\u2021</td><td>23,964,284,000</td><td>168,998,264,000</td></tr><tr><td>\u21b3LRL construction<sup>1</sup></td><td>8,100,000</td><td>~81,000,000</td></tr><tr><td>\u21b3Spacecraft + launch vehicles\u2021</td><td>15,476,128,000</td><td>109,139,032,000</td></tr><tr><td>Apollo through \u201869, avg per year</td><td>2,662,698,000</td><td>18,777,585,000</td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/the-costs-of-the-manhattan-project/\">Manhattan Project</a> (total)</td><td>1,889,604,000</td><td>27,169,531,999</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>There were, of course, more costs to the program than just building the LRL, but I believe this indicates that the amount spent on quarantine was rather small, even as a fraction of the Apollo budget.</p><h2>The LRL</h2><p>We\u2019ve established that modern biosafety was just beginning. Many aspects of the LRL were relatively new, at least for biological protection \u2013 gloveboxes and treatment of air were developments from the US bioweapon labs of Fort Detrick and similar. Today\u2019s laboratory biosafety levels (BSL) <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40506-016-0096-2\">weren\u2019t established even in an early sense</a> until 1984. While they didn\u2019t have this nomenclature, the LRL would today be identified as a BSL-4 lab.</p><h3>Problems</h3><p>The LRL was not, of course, the entirety of the solution to the problem of back contamination. There are other physical solutions. But it was the most expensive part.</p><p>Its organization saw challenges. It had a few different directors with somewhat different priorities.</p><p>Starting around 1968/11, various simulations were run in the LRL to prepare for the launch. Major back-contamination-related problems <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/what-can-we-learn-from-the-lunar-pandemic-that-never-was\">came up repeatedly</a> \u2013 broken gloveboxes, infections in animals, problems with the vacuum system, etcetera<sup>1</sup> In the lead-up to the launch, there were issues of whether PHS would certify the LRL \u2013 they were investigating using alternative sites. The LRL rallied and were eventually certified in 1969/05.<sup>2</sup></p><p>As an extra safety measure, MSC Director of Medical Research and Operations Charles Berry was authorized by the PHS and ICBC in 1969/07 to impose additional quarantine if he saw fit.<sup>1</sup></p><h1>Procedures</h1><p>What steps were actually taken to reduce back contamination?</p><h2>On the moon</h2><p>The astronauts were trained and prepared to assist with quarantine efforts. On the moon,astronauts try to brush dust off of suits after moonwalks, although the dust <a href=\"https://history.nasa.gov/afj/lrl/apollo-quarantine.html\">turned out to be</a> stickier and more pervasive than anticipated. They have vacuums to remove loose dust from the CM, and a high-powered air filter to clean out airborne particulates and ensure that almost no moon particulates would be in the CM air during the descent. They store samples and film for storage and transport.<sup>1</sup></p><h2>Katabasis</h2><p>It was assumed that, like asteroids, the exterior surface of the CM would be sterilized during atmospheric re-entry. In the earth\u2019s atmosphere, parachutes are deployed. A choreographed series of events kicks off:</p><ol><li>Columbia Command Module lands in the ocean, 13 miles from the USS Hornet (recovery vessel).</li><li>30 minutes later, recovery crews reach the CM. They:<ol><li>\u2003\u2003 Attach flotation collar to keep it upright.</li><li>\u2003\u2003 Pass packages of biological isolation garments (nylon suits with respirators) in for astronauts to wear.</li><li>\u2003\u2003 Spread Betadine (disinfectant) around landing vents.</li></ol></li><li>Astronauts put on isolation garments and leave from the CM into a recovery raft.</li><li>Swimming recovery crew members wipe Betadine around the CM hatch.</li><li>Astronauts + recovery crew decontaminate each other\u2019s suits with bleach solution.</li><li>Astronauts taken via helicopter to the Hornet<ol><li>\u2003\u2003 Helicopter crew wears oxygen masks</li></ol></li><li>Helicopter drops off astronauts<ol><li>\u2003\u2003 (Helicopter decontaminated with formalin later)</li></ol></li><li>Astronauts walk from landing pad to mobile quarantine facilities<ol><li>\u2003\u2003 Path is sprayed with gluteraldehyde (disinfectant)</li></ol></li><li>Astronauts enter mobile quarantine facilities<ol><li>\u2003\u2003 Change out of isolation garments, into flight suits</li><li>\u2003\u2003 Talk to press &amp; the president through windows</li></ol></li><li>CM hauled aboard the Hornet</li><li>CM connected via plastic tunnel to MQF</li><li>Recovery crew(?) carries samples/film from CM to MQF</li></ol><h2>At the LRL</h2><h3>People</h3><ol><li>The MQF also has a doctor and MQF expert + engineer in it.

However, contingencies did exist. A <a href=\"https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/19700023211\">report either written or made available in 1970</a> describes in more detail the plans and who would be given responsibility under what positive quarantine results. Generally, the ICBC would temporarily extend quarantine and make a judgment call if there had been a positive result. These did not only account for releasing the astronauts, but samples, film, etc, besides. Here is an example, the relevant diagram for assessing samples:</p><p><a href=\"https://eukaryotewritesblog.files.wordpress.com/2024/01/contingencyp09-1.png\"><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5FFQRsGBcFxwjxtxe/ahekokffxmzdhvtiooa6\" alt=\"\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://eukaryotewritesblog.files.wordpress.com/2024/01/contingencyp10.png\"><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5FFQRsGBcFxwjxtxe/mjk3mwtzfxdmonifndzp\" alt=\"\"></a></p><h1>Conclusions</h1><h2>Major takeaways</h2><ul><li>In its early stages, concern for back contamination risk grew out of a related but more-widely-accepted fear of forward contamination. There was also an ongoing debate about the origins of life and specifically the idea of finding life on the moon. Both of these had components of the back contamination argument in them.</li><li>The idea took hold among scientists first, especially at NASA and at the NAS Space Science Board. There were a couple early champions in scientists in those groups, like Joshua Lederberg and Carl Sagan who tried to rally people around it. (Both were primarily concerned about forward contamination first.)</li><li>Early interest from politicians is a little more mysterious. Senator Margaret Chase Smith brought up the concern in a budget hearing very early in Apollo Program planning \u2013 this probably drove NASA to take it more seriously.</li><li>The idea was tenuous even for NASA - or at least, it was not always agreed to be a priority among all sub-groups - for a long time (for instance, it was deprioritized by the engineers who were primarily concerned with getting people safely there and back). It probably helped that BC concerns had taken root in two separate agency groups that needed to work together (NAS SSB and NASA.) If both of those had stopped pushing the LRL at the same time, the LRL might have fallen through.</li><li>The US Public Health Service was asked for their opinion during the 1964 NASA Chao Committee and insisted on being involved. A few more interagency efforts came after that. PHS ended up taking an important role on being required to certify that releasing the samples and that the Lunar Receiving Laboratory would be safe. At times, this external pressure and threat of activities being declared unsafe forced NASA to prioritize BC risk as well.</li><li>This was the main means by which public health was involved in the Apollo Program - while early promoters of the idea were not public health experts and the idea always had scientific traction, one can imagine that public health experts or agencies who became folded in might continue to be eager to participate. Once, say, microbiologists or PHS was involved, if back contamination had been disregarded, they simply would not have been involved anymore. (This one is more speculative on my part than other takeaways here.)</li><li>Congress had to be convinced to fund the LRL. They were willing to accept that it was necessary because NASA and other agencies had agrees that it was. Other steps past that did not especially require, say, congressional or federal involvement \u2013 other showy but less-expensive steps, like quarantining the returning astronauts for a month, were set by NASA and PHS who had the final say it what was deemed necessary. (There was certainly debate <i>within, </i>say, NASA, about what was necessary.)</li><li>Specific back contamination mitigation efforts are developed alongside the plans for the moon landing - generally, with biosecurity following just slightly behind behind rocketry, crew needs, etc. Biosafety was a priority although it was lower than the absolute safety of the astronauts, or than going to the moon at all (the safest option as far as BC is concerned.)</li></ul><h2>If there had been a threat, would mitigation efforts have worked?</h2><p>Of course, it\u2019s impossible to know. But there are reasons to think the measures might have failed against something like an earth pathogen or hardy freeliving organism.</p><p>There are reasons that were known in advance:</p><ul><li>Air and material from the landing module was exposed to sea water and the atmosphere during landing.</li><li>Quarantine protocols couldn\u2019t rule out a very slow-acting human pathogen</li><li>If an emergency (medical crisis in an astronaut, fire, etc) happened during quarantine at the LRL, \u201cthe plan was to break quarantine\u201d to prioritize crew lives<sup>7</sup></li></ul><p>And then there are accidents and things learned in retrospect:</p><ul><li>The broken vacuum systems at the LRL<sup>7</sup></li><li>Multiple technicians are exposed to moon samples from burst gloves, contact with a sample, <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/what-can-we-learn-from-the-lunar-pandemic-that-never-was\">and more</a>. They enter quarantine in the LRL alongside the astronauts.<sup>1</sup></li><li>Space suits were even more leaky than thought, resulting in extra exposure of astronauts to the moon.</li><li>The biological isolation garments had saltwater inside, indicating that they leaked into the ocean.</li><li>Culture-based microbiological analyses are less comprehensive and sensitive than modern genetic assays. Lots of microbes cannot even be cultured.</li></ul><h2>What happened, and what about back contamination now?</h2><p>This report largely stops when the astronauts are released in August, 1969, healthy and with negative biological test results. No moon life is detected. After a couple more lunar missions with no results, the risk from the moon is dismissed:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cApril 28, 1971\u2013 After life-detection experiments on samples from three Apollo missions return negative results, NASA announces that ICBC will no longer require crew or sample quarantine.\u201d<sup>7</sup></p></blockquote><p>The fact that the moon is sterile discounted the panspermia hypothesis and suggested that a lot of the rest of space would likely be sterile as well. But the now extremely-widely-accepted earth-abiogenesis hypothesis doesn\u2019t require that every celestial body be sterile \u2013 what if the abiogenesis process happened there as well? This is especially true of more chemically active places \u2013 for instance, places with liquid water, like Mars or Jupiter\u2019s moons. The original chain of argument holds that they might have life, and this life might replicate on earth.</p><p>NASA\u2019s Planetary Protection Office deals with both forward contamination and backward contamination. For instance, the OSIRIS-Rex probe recently returned from the asteroid Bennu with sample materials. <a href=\"https://sma.nasa.gov/news/articles/newsitem/2023/09/08/osiris-rex-sample-return\">NASA determined</a> that the asteroid samples did not pose a back contamination risk \u2013 meanwhile, the retrieval of samples from Mars (planned for a decade or so from the time of this writing) <i>would </i>undergo a restricted earth entry.</p><p>A great deal of concern today is still put into preventing forward contamination. Sterilization techniques have improved, and we\u2019ve continued sending unmanned crafts to other bodies, so that risk is still there. NASA attempts to sterilize outbound crafts, especially ones due to land somewhere, with modern sterilization techniques.</p><h2>Notes</h2><p>* Strangely, I was able to find <a href=\"https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/frus/kennedyjf/vii/50955.htm\">a declassified memo</a> from meeting between various top officials including Jerome Wiesner (the official in charge of experiment requests under NSAM-235), discussing the political feasibility of a nuclear test ban, with no reference to a nuclear-test-related security order passing the same day of which Wisener was the focal point, <i>on the day NSAM-235 was signed.</i></p><p>\u2020 Culturing = placing samples on a nutrient-rich medium (in both oxygenated and de-oxygenated atmosphere) and seeing if anything grows \u2013 a common method for determining if there are bacteria or fungus in samples.</p><p>\u2021 Information obtained from the dataset of The Planetary Society. \u201cHow Much Did the Apollo Program Cost?\u201d Accessed December 29, 2023. <a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/cost-of-apollo\">https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/cost-of-apollo</a>.

The talk is mostly an attempt to gesture at this line of work through a series of examples, each of which generally highlights how a certain cryptographic primitive could be used to address one particular coordination problem.</p><p>The talk expands on the following pieces of infrastructure:</p><ol><li><strong>Hashmarking</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/xUCvGEZ30Uw?si=2a98hxaPHlc0N_xz&amp;t=130\">2:10</a>) is the only item on the list which we've already <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00645\">written a paper on </a>and which we're already <a href=\"https://straumli.ai/blog/console-launch\">using in practice</a>. This protocol helps developers, auditors, and domain experts coordinate on creating and administering QA-style benchmarks without having to share the reference solutions outright. We think it may be particularly helpful in the context of dual-use capabilities.</li><li><strong>Responsible Pioneer Protocol</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/xUCvGEZ30Uw?si=otKSzYpkZQtaEH5k&amp;t=356\">5:56</a>) targets the race dynamics that frontier labs may default to when trying not to fall behind their competitors. It builds on existing solutions to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_Millionaires%27_problem\">Yao's Millionaire's Problem</a> to help frontier labs learn if there exists a competitor that is more than e.g. 10% ahead on a particular metric, without requiring labs to disclose their actual progress, in the hope that labs may find it easier to be cautious knowing that no one is too far ahead.</li><li><strong>Neural Certificate Authorities</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/xUCvGEZ30Uw?si=lo478BIZGJq36bbr&amp;t=517\">8:37</a>) build on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority\">battle-tested practices</a> from traditional internet infrastructure to help auditors share tamper-evident certificates with evaluation results in a way that other parties could seamlessly build on.

If <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.09502\">prior work</a> explored ways of optimizing models so that fine-tuning is easier, we may be able to optimize a model such that any attempt to tamper with it would lead to (late) activations going to zero, making it difficult to fine-tune the guardrails away due to the technicalities of gradient descent.

In most of the comments to the question, most people said they would save the woman instead of the baby. Shouldn't saving the baby be morally right as it will live longer than the woman? Furthermore, some utilitarian ethicists believe that it is not that bad to kill babies because they aren't fully conscious like adults and so they aren't \"persons\". However, the problem with this logic is that these babies will eventually become \"persons\". If you think about it, saving the baby leads to greater total lifespan and higher average lifespan.

Indeed, that such a venue as LessWrong or the Alignment Blog exist to mitigate existential risk, it follows there is existential risk, and present venal systems permit that existence, or at least do not preclude it as would make LessWrong and the Alignment Blog redundant, as they are acknowledged by users not to be).</li><li>EA requires present venal systems to exist, to gain the resources from the free market that are supposed to increase human welfare, preserve human lives, and mitigate existential risk (by definition of EA; present venal systems, particularly economic, are necessary conditions for the denoting \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of EA).</li><li>The above-named present venal systems, increase the number of people who act contrarily to the ideals of EA (as they require, so promote unregulated economies, and self-interested people in order for such venal systems to exist, as noted in 2)); that is, as more lives are saved, they are statistically likely to join, thus increase the proliferation of, current venal systems which encourage existential risk. (Explication: adherents to EA are already a minority, in numbers and influence, as noted in 2), that contrary to their influence, existential risk still exists, which permits the conditions noted in 2); the likelihood of <i>disproportionate</i> influence decreases at such lower population levels.)&nbsp;</li></ol><p>(Proof of continued minority, by cases: assume that a fixed proportion of human lives saved by EA efforts, thus still a minority, become Effective Altruists; in which case as human lives are saved, the majority will participate in existing venal systems, so such systems and their existential risks will proliferate proportionately. Alternatively, that EA\u2019s will convince a majority of humans saved to be altruistic; but this is contrary to the observation above, and of 2), that EA\u2019s are a population- and influence-minority. By observation too there has yet to be an argument or effort by EA\u2019s that have made their philosophy an influence-majority over non-altruistic venal systems, which have not been supplanted<i>. Nor could there exist such an argument, in order for EA to exist, which relies on preponderance of venal systems for support</i>, by 3). Current venal systems win majorities without need for arguments \u2013 as there are none, any such argument being contradictory, the venal systems being self-contradictory in destruction of venality from existential risks. Consider the final case, in which of the lives saved by EA, a smaller proportion become EAs than already were so \u2013 but again there are fewer EAs, and more participants in venal, existentially risky, systems).</p><p>From 1)-4), EA\u2019s efforts increase population; increased population increases proliferation of non-altruistic venal systems; proliferating venal systems increases existential risk; by the hypothetical syllogism, EA\u2019s efforts increase existential risk, contrary to the definition of EA in 1).</p><p>Therefore EA is contradictory, and therefore ineffectual (as was to be demonstrated).&nbsp;</p><p>(Libertarianism likewise permits the free-market malfeasance and existential risk that will result in no one left for liberties).</p><p>That this argument can exist, it follows there can be no reasoning by EA that will engender majority support, because this argument precludes any support of EA (though this threatens circular reasoning; still, as noted in proof-by-cases, any successful argument for majority support of EA, destroys EA\u2019s economic supports).</p><p>Besides which, the consequentialist or utilitarian ethic underlying EA was subject to the Dread Conclusion, so was not of itself adequate. And, that human welfare is important, is a human bias. Nonhuman animals would not highly rank human welfare; only because their welfare is unconsidered, is human welfare well-regarded.</p><p>By the terms of the proposed ethic of \u201cGoing-On,\u201d described in this author\u2019s LessWrong article \u201cWorldwork for Ethics\u201d, EA is more morally right than the present existential-risk-inviting systems. However, the above-noted ethics upon which EA relies, entail a solution of the AI values-alignment problem, by an \u201canthropocentric-alignment\u201d approach which, as author\u2019s foregoing article demonstrates preliminarily (and a subsequent article, by vector space analysis, shall demonstrate conclusively) is impossible. To the \u201canthropocentric-alignment\u201d error does this author attribute the failure of all foregoing attempts to \u201csolve\u201d alignment; continued erroneous efforts would result in the destruction of the only as-yet known sentient species.</p><p>Regrettably, the ethic of \u201cGoing-On\u201d requires that eventuality to be forestalled (absent another entity capable of all possible effective procedures); and it requires those who know it, (and thus must act in obedience to it, that they act at all) to undertake ceaselessly to disseminate the ethic, and the pro-action possibilities that it enables and requires.&nbsp;</p><p>It is uncredible Going-On is inexplicable; one belatedly realizes that it is ignored, as most seeking alignment thought EA correct, thus other ethics redundant. Accordingly it was necessary to nullify EA, with regret tempered by the hope Going-On \u2013 or a more effective, subsequent ethic \u2013 will be adequate to preserve universal consistency and discovery (that is, per Going-On, in the on-going effort to find something more than survival).</p><p>Please do not vote without an explanatory comment (votes are convenient for moderators, but are poor intellectual etiquette, sans information that would permit the \u201cupdating\u201d of beliefs).</p>", "user": {"username": "Fuggazi Nominei"}}, {"_id": "M9MSe4KHNv4HNf44f", "title": "Survey of 2,778 AI authors: six parts in pictures", "postedAt": "2024-01-06T04:43:35.042Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Katja_Grace"}}, {"_id": "DQbSTo9ktvcGkGLyh", "title": "Howdy, I'm Elliot", "postedAt": "2024-01-06T03:17:30.210Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi EA community,</p><p>I'd like to formally introduce myself to this forum, where I've been lurking for a while but have been too timid to post until now, thanks to the encouragement of some.</p><p>I first heard about EA through the Tim Ferriss Podcast in 2016.

Unfortunately, people often don\u2019t do this (we tend to flinch away from uncomfortable ideas), and even when we do, we rarely discuss it publicly. [...] Anima International had been running a campaign against live fish sales in Poland. [...] Both the farming and transportation of the fish cause a lot of suffering \u2014 so progress seemed exciting. Unfortunately, it turned out that the campaign was causing unexpected harm; some people were switching from carp to salmon, and farming salmon requires farming more fish to feed the salmon (which are carnivorous).

Many farmers (who account for the majority of the region\u2019s poorest people) don\u2019t have extra time or resources to invest in productivity improvements like better irrigation systems. They also lack access to richer markets (in part due to the EU\u2019s agricultural policies). As a result, many are trapped in poverty.

In the case of sub-Saharan Africa, influencing policy and supporting things like irrigation systems and high-yield crops could help launch an agritech market that helps with these problems.&nbsp;</p><p>These interventions would also significantly mitigate the environmental impacts of farming by reducing the need for more farmland.

The plan was to collect potentially dangerous virus samples in the wild, analyze the samples in labs to identify the viruses capable of causing a pandemic, and publish a ranked list of dangerous viruses and their genomes. Some, like MIT biologist Kevin Esvelt, expressed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/imo/media/doc/Esvelt%20Testimony.pdf\"><u>concerns</u></a> that sharing a list like that could significantly lower the barrier for terrorists or others who might want to start a pandemic by providing them with instructions on which viruses to use; \u201cgene synthesis,\u201d which can print a virus\u2019s DNA given its genome, would help them do the rest. The program wound down this summer. (To lower the chances of human-made pandemics, governments could require that gene synthesis companies&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nti.org/events/benchtop-dna-synthesis-devices-capabilities-biosecurity-implications-and-governance/\"><u>screen orders and customers</u></a>.)</p><p>Related&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.governance.ai/post/sharing-powerful-ai-models\"><u>concerns have been raised about openly sharing powerful AI models</u></a>. \u201cOpen-sourcing\u201d is often presented in a positive light, but giving total access to an AI model is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23817060/meta-open-source-ai-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-llama2\"><u>risky</u></a> and irreversible choice; there\u2019s no way to take an open-sourced model down or set up protections if we later discover that the model is too dangerous.

And the problem is incredibly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/south-asian-air-quality/#3-who-else-is-working-on-this\"><u>neglected</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/santosh-harish-air-pollution/\"><u>recent podcast</u></a>, Santosh Harish discusses&nbsp;<strong>the main causes of air pollution and some potentially cost-effective interventions</strong>. Indoor pollution can result from people&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/indoor-air-pollution#indoor-air-pollution-results-from-poor-access-to-clean-cooking-fuels\"><u>burning solid fuels for cooking</u></a>. (Unfortunately, a lack of access to cleaner fuels like liquid petroleum gas or reliable electricity means many people have no choice except to use fuels like firewood.) Outdoor air pollution is caused by waste burning, illegal industrial gas dumping, vehicle emissions, and more. And policies meant to prevent air pollution are often outdated or left unenforced.</p><p>Research, policy outreach, and technical assistance to governments could be effective ways for philanthropy to support work on this problem. Anything that improves energy efficiency would also help, as have subsidies that help people switch from solid fuels.

Read on for a retrospective of the first set of projects, including our key learnings and takeaways.&nbsp;</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p><a href=\"https://oxfordbiosecuritygroup.com/\"><u>Oxford Biosecurity Group</u></a> (OBG) is a team of researchers dedicated to addressing issues related to biosecurity. OBG runs multiple 7-week, remote-first projects, and we partner with relevant organisations in the space to drive progress on pressing issues and to help individuals test their fit, grow their network, and upskill in biosecurity. Researchers work in small teams, led by a project lead, to conduct impactful research culminating in one or more final deliverables. A key way that these projects lead to real-world impact is through partnerships - outputs are shared with key stakeholders, and many projects are run in collaboration with an existing organisation.</p><p><br>The pilot cycle of projects ran between October and December 2023&nbsp;(see projects we ran in October -December 2023 section). The next cycle will run from 22nd January to 8th March 2024, and applications are open until 19th January.&nbsp;</p><h1>What is the theory of change for OBG?</h1><h2>Two main aims of OBG:&nbsp;</h2><ul><li>Directly tackle biosecurity issues that are not otherwise being worked on through research&nbsp;</li><li>Enable people to work in biosecurity in the future, by helping them gain skills and connections</li></ul><h2>Object-level work - or the \u2018somebody should work on this\u2019 gap</h2><p>There are a range of reasons that specific projects that are high-impact might currently not be worked on, and often this involves capacity or coordination constraints. For example:</p><ul><li>There are no organisations working on this due to resource limitations, or that resolving the uncertainties about whether something in particular should be invested in is not their highest priority</li><li>There is uncertainty about if this specific intervention is high impact, and somebody needs to do short term research to determine if it is</li><li>Experts or people more established in biosecurity having suggestions that \u2018somebody should work on\u2019 while not having time to do it themselves</li></ul><p>OBG aims to drive progress on these gaps. So far, projects have been selected based on:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;The prioritisation of the specific project lead (who has experience in biosecurity and ideas about where research gaps are)</li><li>Or in collaboration with specific organisations.</li></ul><p>Infohazard risks are mitigated by the careful scoping and selection of projects which have a low infohazard risk, including through liaising with organisations and biosecurity experts. Potential researchers also have to go through a selection process.</p><p>This arrangement benefits both:</p><ul><li>Project leads and/or organisations, who have the context to know which projects are high impact but may not have the capacity to work on them</li><li>Researchers who are able to gain direct experience working on a high impact project and build up a network of people who are already working in the field</li></ul><h2>Careers - or the \u2018on-ramps into biosecurity\u2019 gap</h2><p>Currently it is often&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/QeEgktwh2FQyot9Jw/on-ramps-for-biosecurity-a-model\"><u>difficult to bridge the gap between learning about biosecurity and doing full-time work in biosecurity.&nbsp;</u></a>In part, this is due to few opportunities being available for people to complete project work, gain required skills and build up a network within the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>OBG provides hands-on, concrete project experience for individuals with some background in biosecurity, or with skills relevant to biosecurity. This allows people to test their fit, upskill, and grow their network, and also attracts new people into the biosecurity space.</p><h2>Where OBG fits in</h2><p>To summarise the above, OBG\u2019s route to impact is demonstrated below through some examples of how specific people and organisations might benefit, and how this can lead to positive outcomes:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#51ce8c;border:1pt solid #265973;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Profile</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#51ce8c;border:1pt solid #265973;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>What OBG Does</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#51ce8c;border:1pt solid #265973;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Short term outcomes</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#51ce8c;border:1pt solid #265973;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Longer term outcomes</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#e8fff3;border:1pt solid #265973;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>A postgraduate student who wants to work in biosecurity&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#e8fff3;border:1pt solid #265973;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Provides projects for potential researchers to work on</td><td style=\"background-color:#e8fff3;border:1pt solid #265973;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Researcher gains experience and network in biosecurity</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Researcher submits a report to the organisation</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#e8fff3;border:1pt solid #265973;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Researcher increases relevant skills and eventually gains a job in biosecurity&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>The report ends up informing organisational strategy.

Evaluation of this will be used to determine the expected impact of the approach of OBG, and what this means for future strategy. A more detailed write-up is in progress, and this will be shared with experts in biosecurity and career advice for their input and then posted on the EA forum as a separate post.&nbsp;</p><h1>Projects we ran October - December 2023</h1><p>This section gives an overview of the projects run in the first round, and some examples of project outputs.

The project lead has a particular interest in getting engineering technologies that reduce the chance of future pandemics being implemented, with the aim of sharing the output with key stakeholders working on far-UVC research and/or advocacy, and potentially feeding into future advocacy work.</p><p>Main outcomes: Report output focusing specifically on material degradation from far-UVC. This area was prioritised due to its importance to whether far-UVC will be implemented large-scale, the background of the researchers (engineering and materials science) and the lack of summary research available for this. Some other higher level work was done, such as into regulatory aspects in the UK, but this researched to less depth in part due to some researchers dropping out and in part due to prioritisation and focus necessary within a short project period.&nbsp;</p><p>Link to publicly available output: N/A</p><h2>Antimicrobial Resistance Modeling</h2><p>Project lead: Sofya Lebedeva</p><p>Collaborations/rationale behind project: This project was run under the guidance of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/akhil-bansal-56064a207/?originalSubdomain=uk\"><u>Akhil Bansal</u></a>. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) occurs when a bacteria, virus, fungus or parasite develops the ability to survive exposure to a treatment (i.e., an antimicrobial agent) that was previously effective in treating the infection it causes. AMR is a significant and growing global public health issue; the most recent global reports estimate that 1.27 million deaths (95% CI 0.911-1.71 million) and 47 million DALYs (95% CI 35.0-63.4 million) can be attributed to AMR. The goal of this project was to make progress towards determining the contextual and geographical differences in the drivers of AMR.</p><p>Main outcomes: Deliverables were shared directly with Akhil Bansal &amp; this project is now continuing on in 2024 and looking for additional researchers.

The project leads were responsible for organising their own projects and setting their own deliverables.</p><p>Thoughts on what was done:</p><ul><li>Projects that had a clear week-by-week plan and defined goals going in tended to go better than those that were more open-ended. For example, while the projects were narrowed down during the project period, the \u2018Researching Bottlenecks to the Implementation of Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation\u2019 and the \u2018Researching Funding Mechanisms for Biosecurity Initiatives\u2019 project briefs should have been narrower to begin with.</li><li>For some projects people remained engaged all the way through, for others there were some dropouts. Some of this was due to people\u2019s personal circumstances changing (e.g. people dropping out after finding a full-time role), but we found that a clear output/path to impact and working with an org helped. Potential funding for one specific project did not make as much difference as expected. More projects would need to be done to evaluate this further.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Engagement with full-time biosecurity researchers (for example at the final presentation) seemed valuable</li><li>Not all projects worked towards a deliverable. Whilst this afforded more flexibility for researchers, this meant in some cases researchers within the same team had very little interaction with each other.</li></ul><p>What to change for next time:</p><ul><li>Week-by-week project plan: When scoping projects out, both a project brief and a more detailed project plan will be created. The project plan includes a week-by-week summary of what researchers should be working on in the project.</li><li>Specific projects: Projects will be defined in a more narrow way, so researchers can work on the problem at greater depth.&nbsp;</li><li>Clear deliverables: Projects will work towards a deliverable by default, such as a short report, article, or working paper.</li></ul><h2>Sourcing Projects</h2><p>The project leads, who all have experience in the biosecurity space, came up with their own projects based on their experiences and research areas, and what they thought would have a high impact based on this. Some of these projects were in collaboration with other organisations.&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts on what was done:</p><ul><li>Projects with other organisations seemed more valuable than project lead discretionary choice and may lead to more object-level progress on issues. This led us to strongly update that it was more effective to work with organisations in the space and run projects based on their needs</li><li>The projects were in high-impact areas, the project leads have experience in the space, and external biosecurity experts were happy to give input and feedback. However, there was no systematic evaluation of potential projects or comparison between potential projects for which one would be the highest impact.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>What to change for next time:</p><ul><li>Collaborations: There will be a greater focus on collaborations with existing organisations. All of the projects in January-March 2024 will be in collaboration with another organisation.</li><li>Projects for future cycles: Now that the pilot cycle of projects has successfully been completed, projects will be planned out further in advance. This includes building up relationships with existing organisations and speaking to experts about what high-impact projects they think should be done if there is more capacity. This could involve creating a longlist of projects and then evaluating them.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Operations</h2><p>The Project Leads had a lot of control over the recruitment, projects and final deliverables.&nbsp;</p><p>The main organisation and communication channels were a Slack workspace, with shared channels but also a private channel for each specific project; a Google Drive folder for project files; and a Notion page for task management, project planning and the website.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Thoughts on what was done:</p><ul><li>The projects being handled primarily and autonomously worked well with the cofounders being the three main project leads, however more standardisation is needed when there are additional project leads</li><li>Slack mostly worked well as the main communication tool, although sometimes people took a while to have the notifications settings set up correctly</li><li>Operations went well for what was needed for the initial projects, however when expanding more operations processes would be put in place.</li></ul><p>What to change for next time:</p><ul><li>Point person for operations: One person (Conrad) is taking on running operations for OBG, which will enable greater standardisation and efficiency improvements</li><li>Operational processes: Various operational processes have been updated and improved based on experiences last cohort, to make things easier and more efficient for new projects and project leads</li><li>Project Lead Guide: a project lead guide has been created for project leads, summarising key responsibilities including scoping and running projects, processing applications, and the operations systems.</li></ul><h2>Applications</h2><p>Project leads were responsible for assessing applications to their projects. The application process involved a short 15-30 minute form, followed by a 30-minute interview with the project lead to assess project fit. Applications were done via Google Forms, with the results of the form being input into a Google sheet, sorted and allocated.</p><p>Thoughts on what was done:</p><ul><li>Generally applications went well, and all of the projects were filled up with good applicants</li><li>Application periods were very short, and some of the later interviews meant a slight delay in the project start for some people.&nbsp;</li><li>Applications handled by the project lead of the applicant\u2019s preferred project may not be the best system if a project is consistently somebody\u2019s *second* preferred project. Some projects also had more interest than others.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>What to change for next time:</p><ul><li>Managing applications: Application form and management will be moved to Airtable as it is better suited to how we want to manage the applications</li><li>Application standardisation: More guidance given to project leads about processing applications, including a suggestion about how to structure the interview.&nbsp;</li><li>Potential longer-term changes: The application form and process will continue to be iterated, and potentially application forms will be tailored slightly for each project.</li></ul><h1>Projects for January - March 2024</h1><p>We will be running seven projects in January-March 2024.

It is a community of healthcare professionals who have taken a public Pledge to donate at least 1% of their income to the most effective global health charities.</p><p>Visitors to the website can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://give-health.org/learn/\"><u>Learn</u></a> about effective giving, their relative wealth on the global stage, how healthcare professionals can improve their impact, the activities of GiveWell and the highly effective nature of the charities recommended by GiveWell.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Healthcare professionals are invited to take a public&nbsp;<a href=\"https://give-health.org/pledge/\"><u>Pledge</u></a> to donate at least 1% of their income to GiveWell\u2019s top charities for the rest of their lives.&nbsp; They can use the Pledge Calculator to determine their monthly/annual donations based on their salary and desired donation percentage.&nbsp; Once they have taken the Pledge their name, profession and location will be displayed on the GiveHealth Community Board, and they can learn about the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://give-health.org/charities/\"><u>Charities</u></a> recommended by GiveWell and follow the links to the donation page of their chosen charities.&nbsp; Pledge takers will receive a survey on each anniversary of their Pledge to capture their donation activities over the previous year so GiveHealth can measure the value of donations it is influencing.&nbsp; Anybody can sign up to the GiveHealth monthly newsletter.</p><p>Healthcare professionals of all disciplines (nurses, physiotherapists, pharmacists, occupational therapists, doctors, etc) and kinds (clinicians, researchers, managers, policy-makers, students, retired professionals, etc) of any level of seniority, from any part of the world, are welcome to sign the GiveHealth Pledge.</p><p><strong>Why</strong></p><p>Healthcare professionals are a self-selected group of generally altruistic individuals who both care about improving the health of others and are motivated to do so.&nbsp; There is also a strong sense of community and camaraderie amongst healthcare professionals, while their awareness and understanding of EA and its principles is generally low.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Giving What We Can has shown the public Pledge model to be an effective vehicle for generating donations (by fostering commitment, community and culture), which GiveHealth has combined with a lower barrier to entry (at least 1% of income rather than 10%) that we feel is more appropriate for a group less familiar with EA.&nbsp; Pledge takers are still able to sign the Giving What We Can pledge, and their GiveHealth pledge can be included within, rather than in addition to, their GWWC pledge (since both pledges commit the individual to donating to effective charities) \u2013 for example, donating 10% of income can satisfy both a 10% GiveHealth Pledge and the 10% GWWC pledge.</p><p>We hope the existing strong sense of community between healthcare professionals, and the 1% low barrier to entry, can be harnessed to generate Pledge-taking momentum amongst these professionals, while increasing their awareness and understanding of EA.&nbsp; In this manner, GiveHealth could be regarded as the healthcare profession analogue of High Impact Athletes and Raising for Effective Giving, which are EA-inspired communities of effective giving relevant to specific professions (elite athletes and professional poker players, respectively).</p><p><strong>Where</strong></p><p>Healthcare professionals from anywhere in the world are welcome and encouraged to take the GiveHealth Pledge.</p><p><strong>Who</strong></p><p>The Co-Founders of GiveHealth are three UK-trained doctors \u2013 Richard Armitage (GP in UK), Alastair Yeoh (infectious diseases doctor in UK) and George Altman (intern in Australia).</p><p><strong>How</strong></p><p>GiveHealth is currently run on an entirely voluntary basis by the three Co-Founders alongside their full-time work as frontline healthcare professionals.&nbsp; No funds were raised from external sources.&nbsp; The Co-Founders used their own funds to build and maintain the GiveHealth website.&nbsp; Supporters can donate funds directly to the project (to cover website maintenance fees, administrative costs, etc) via the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://give-health.org/support/\"><u>Support</u></a> page.</p><p><strong>Our ask</strong></p><p>If you\u2019re a healthcare professional of any discipline \u2013 practicing, studying or retired \u2013 anywhere in the world, then please consider taking the GiveHealth Pledge.&nbsp; Please also tell the healthcare professionals in your network about GiveHealth and direct them to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://give-health.org/\"><u>website</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Call for healthcare volunteers</strong></p><p>We are also looking for volunteers to help the organisation grow.&nbsp; We would like to recruit Leads for each country and each healthcare profession.&nbsp; The main task for Leads will be to promote GiveHealth in their designated country and healthcare profession and to recruit Pledge-takers.&nbsp;

Receiving the ESIA Undergraduate Research Award gave me the opportunity to design, conduct, and present my independent study on migrant business incubators in Cape Town, South Africa to the Harvard Undergraduate Research Association over a 2 day conference. None of this would have been possible without the sincere dedication and resilience of the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/\"><strong>Scalabrini Centre of Cape Town</strong></a>'s amazing team. They pillared my outlook on what it takes to support refugee businesses' multidimensional needs and foster compassionate environments for success.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>February:</strong> Kicked off @OneForTheWorld GW's professional development workshop series on our role in ethical and impactful philanthropy. I designed interactive lectures covering topics related to equitable cost-effective evaluation criteria, minimization of dependency relationships, impact potential of localization, aid power structures, and the consumer role in development. My great team positioned the organization to provided a tangible way for youth to participate in global development solutions through its pledge system and engagement with controversial topics that underly development world's stagnation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>March:&nbsp;</strong>Hosted <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/\"><strong>One for the World</strong></a> GW's largest panel event on efforts to localize foreign aid in Africa which was streamed on @VoicesforAmerica.

This experience blew my mind because I met such a vast network of people who are combining resources from fields of tech, animal welfare, global development, and philanthropic fundraising to propel high impact projects contributing to effective positive change.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>September:</strong> I kept chasing the high of being surrounded my like-minded passionate individuals at the EAG conference in Berlin. Here, I got introduced to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/\"><strong>Team Spirit International</strong></a> and came full circle to transfer my knowledge on migrant entrepreneurship into an agribusiness incubator project in Uganda. The post-EAG Berlin rave also showed me that you can do good and have fun while doing it too! It sparked my interest in the music, arts, and festival capacity to drive social impact.</p><p><strong>October</strong>: Took a brief sabbatical to travel to Rome, reconnect with my family and precious grandmother, and finally get my wisdom teeth removed (which I had been dreading for far too many years). By the end of the month, I got back to it and attended my last EAG conference in Boston where I networked for job opportunities and sought out collaborators for my passion project to design a happiness impact measurement tool.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>November:&nbsp;</strong>Spent some time in Washington DC reminiscing over my recently concluded college days and finding a newfound appreciation for the city and its people. I took on the force of all the connections and projects I had gathered up over the year and executed numerous plans of action for the Ugandan agribusiness incubator and impact evaluation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>December</strong>: Took all my experiences back home to South Africa to embark on a new adventure in Cape Town as a digital nomad and happiness content creator for the Are You Happy community. I sought to upgrade my technical skills in AI to transcribe interviews that ask strangers if they are happy and what the source of their happiness is in hopes of identifying common markers to develop a happiness impact measurement tool.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, it's been an exciting year and based on all the intellectual fuel I geared up from 2023, I can only imagine that 2024 is going to be a powerhouse that founds my career.

(This is essentially questioning the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ROI6dRdKsNfXg5gIyBa1_7eYOjowfbw5n65zkrLnvc/edit#gid=1364064522&amp;range=A51:I51\"><u>\u201cRatio of the reduction in malaria mortality to the reduction in malaria incidence\u201d item</u></a> in GiveWell\u2019s CEA). Note that we largely want to avoid red-teaming GiveWell\u2019s analysis for this research, so this point may be de-scoped.</li></ul></li><li>Arguably the policy decision should be based not on today\u2019s cost-effectiveness, but on future cost-effectiveness.<ul><li>A deeper understanding of the cost structure \u2013 is there much scope for it to come down further?&nbsp;</li><li>How might vaccine efficacy evolve over time?</li><li>With any of these considerations about future cost effectiveness, it\u2019s useful to distinguish between future changes which will happen anyway, and those which will be accelerated/supported by rolling out the vaccines sooner.</li><li>Might some kind of forecasting help with this?</li><li>It might be appropriate to consider this comparatively \u2013 i.e. will the cost-effectiveness of bednets/SMC decline over time (e.g. because of diminishing marginal returns of some sort)? If so, might vaccine cost-effectiveness overtake it? If so, when would we expect vaccine cost-effectiveness to overtake bednet/SMC cost-effectiveness? How much sooner than that overtaking point should we start rolling out vaccines?&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Are there reasons to want to support the roll-out of the vaccine, even if R21\u2019s cost-effectiveness is somewhat behind that of the most cost-effective malaria interventions?<ul><li>For example, those bodies whom you are lobbying to fund the vaccine roll-out might otherwise have been expected to use funds on activities which are less cost-effective than the R21 vaccine. E.g. because they have different cost-effectiveness thresholds.</li><li>Is there a reason why including a mixture of cost-effective and somewhat less cost-effective interventions together could be a high-impact outcome? E.g. maybe there are reasons why full malaria elimination is particularly valuable, or, related to the previous point, perhaps funders who are being lobbied are keen to ensure that full malaria elimination is achieved.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><p><br>If anyone thinks this research plan is incomplete, we would be interested to hear further thoughts.</p><p>Similarly, if anyone has immediate answers to the questions, we would be happy to hear their thoughts.</p><p>We would be very happy if this analysis weren\u2019t needed, and the purpose of this post is to explore whether it\u2019s useful to conduct this work. If it seems like it\u2019s useful, and there\u2019s enough people who would value it, we may conduct it, especially since our past work on this topic leaves us well-positioned.

Developers of such a model are required to:</p><ul><li>Evaluate it for systemic risks</li><li>Conduct and document adversarial testing</li><li>Implement strong cybersecurity practices</li><li>Document and report its energy consumption</li></ul><p><strong>The agreement similarly regulates non-GPAI in three tiers.</strong> Some AI uses \u2014 such as social scoring, individual predictive policing, and untargeted scraping of data for facial recognition databases \u2014 are considered unacceptable, and are banned outright.&nbsp;</p><p>Systems outside of this list, but which otherwise have the potential to cause harm or undermine rights, are considered \u201chigh risk\u201d and are subject to the restrictions in the act. Examples of high risk systems include those that determine insurance pricing, generate credit scores, and evaluate educational outcomes. Finally, all other systems are considered \u201cminimal risk,\u201d and do not generate additional legal obligations beyond existing legislation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The agreement exempts research, national security, and some law enforcement use. </strong>The EU AI act will apply to private and public actors who deploy AI systems within the EU or whose systems affect EU residents. However, the provisional agreement carves out a few exceptions for uses of AI in cases of national interest. For example, EU member states are keen on fostering AI innovation within their borders, and so the act will not apply to educational and research use. It also exempts military and national security use of AI, as well as use by law enforcement in cases of serious crime.</p><p><strong>The act empowers the EU AI Board and establishes a new EU AI Office. </strong>The agreement distributes responsibility for enforcing the act to member states, which are to levy fines for infringements. In particular, fines can be set at up to 7% of annual revenue for \u201cunacceptable\u201d uses, and up to 3% for most other violations. Each national authority will represent its country in the EU AI Board, the role of which is to facilitate effective and standardized enforcement across member states.&nbsp;</p><p>The agreement also establishes an \u201cEU AI Office\u201d as the central authority on enforcing the acts rules on GPAI, which is empowered to supervise GPAI developers by requesting documentation, conducting model evaluations, and investigating alerts. It is also tasked with developing AI expertise and regulatory capability within the EU government.</p><p><strong>The agreement has been a long time in the making, and it\u2019s not over yet.</strong> The EU AI Act has been debated at length since it was first proposed in April of 2021. The current agreement is only provisional, and must be voted upon by the European Parliament and the European Commission. If it passes the vote, it wouldn\u2019t take effect immediately. Instead, AI developers will have between several months and two years to comply with its requirements. Still, this is a substantial milestone that marks the end of intensive negotiations to reach a widely agreed upon bill.&nbsp;</p><h2>Questions about Research Standards in AI Safety</h2><p>Bipartisan members of the House of Representatives Committee on Space, Science, and Technology recently wrote a <a href=\"https://democrats-science.house.gov/imo/media/doc/2023-12-14_AISI%20scientific%20merit_final-signed.pdf\">letter</a> to the National Institute of Science and Technology (NIST), the government agency which recently established the <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-safety-institute\">US AI Safety Institute</a>. They praised NIST as \u201ca leader in developing a robust, scientifically grounded framework for the field of AI trust and safety research.\u201d But they also raised a number of concerns about the field of AI safety:</p><blockquote><p><i>Unfortunately, the current state of the AI safety research field creates challenges for NIST as it navigates its leadership role on the issue. Findings within the community are often self-referential and lack the quality that comes from revision in response to critiques by subject matter experts. There is also significant disagreement within the AI safety field of scope, taxonomies, and definitions.&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>Many of these critiques will be familiar to AI safety researchers. It\u2019s true that safety researchers often disagree about what constitutes progress in the field. Lots of work appears in preprints and blog posts, without the scrutiny of peer review. Deference to perceived authorities has concentrated research efforts on a small number of problems and potential solutions at the expense of a broader sociotechnical safety effort. These are serious problems that damage the credibility of AI safety research in the eyes of the public, and reduce the quality of its research outputs.&nbsp;</p><p>The Center for AI Safety works to address many of these problems. By providing workshops, fellowships, and introductory resources, we hope to bring new voices into the conversation on AI safety. Further efforts will be needed to meet mainstream demands for scientific rigor, and help AI safety earn interest and support from researchers and policymakers around the world.&nbsp;</p><h2>The New York Times sues OpenAI and Microsoft for Copyright Infringement</h2><p>Data is a <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/the-ai-triad-and-what-it-means-for-national-security-strategy/\">fundamental input to AI development</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Crawl\">Billions of pages</a> of text are used to train large language models. Moreover, data is a scarce resource. Some experts believe the supply of high-quality text could <a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/will-we-run-out-of-ml-data-evidence-from-projecting-dataset\">soon run out</a>, making it more difficult for AI developers to continue scaling their models.&nbsp;</p><p>Against this backdrop, <a href=\"https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf\">a new lawsuit</a> threatens to further restrict the supply of AI training data. Filed by the New York Times against OpenAI and Microsoft, it notes that New York Times data was the largest proprietary data source in the most heavily weighted dataset used to train GPT-3. Despite OpenAI\u2019s reliance on New York Times data, they have not been granted permission by the Times to use it, nor paid any compensation to the Times for training on their data. Therefore, the Times has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft for copyright infringement.&nbsp;</p><p>The outcome of the case remains to be seen. Some argue on principle that, just as humans learn from books and newspapers, AI systems should be allowed to learn from copyrighted data. Others point to the potential consequences of restricting access to copyrighted data, such as raising costs for open source AI developers. Whichever arguments persuade the court in this case, they will be made by some of the most central stakeholders in this debate, and therefore will have lasting influence on how AI developers can access copyrighted data.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Copyrighted inputs and copyrighted outputs. </strong>Nobody disputes the basic fact that OpenAI trains on copyrighted data. But this lawsuit makes another critical allegation: that OpenAI and Microsoft\u2019s models output exact copies of New York Times articles.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9d84feba-3dfe-4607-93de-e5c00deddb42_1182x1264.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/jDQp9EYWZL9EizuH8/p3gwogsznj8jyevxodvs\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/jDQp9EYWZL9EizuH8/id5qdw8wbcs4wte7n13v 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/jDQp9EYWZL9EizuH8/btbki445xwaerpkcynn7 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/jDQp9EYWZL9EizuH8/lwy3da7rqs9tznvllnuw 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/jDQp9EYWZL9EizuH8/p3gwogsznj8jyevxodvs 1456w\"></a></p><p>Previous research has demonstrated that large language models are capable of <a href=\"https://not-just-memorization.github.io/extracting-training-data-from-chatgpt.html\">memorizing their training data</a>. Image generation models display a similar ability to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.04028.pdf\">imitate</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13188.pdf\">replicate</a> parts of their training data. Typically, these models do not output exact copies of their training data, but the fact that it\u2019s possible should not be surprising as they are deliberately trained to mimic their training data.&nbsp;</p><p>Solutions to some of these problems could be straightforward. For example, OpenAI could easily prevent their models from directly copying text from sources accessed via search. The lawsuit also requests more costly remedies, including that OpenAI should negotiate a price for access to the New York Times\u2019s copyrighted data, or else destroy the models said to contain copies of the Times\u2019s data.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Considering the consequences of the ruling. </strong>Courts typically care about the practical consequences of their decisions. One potential consequence, argued the lawsuit, is that by training on copyrighted data, OpenAI and Microsoft threaten the socially valuable industry of journalism.&nbsp;</p><p>Journalism is a public good, argues the lawsuit. We all benefit from journalism that uncovers corruption, proposes valuable new policies, and improves the quality of our society. It\u2019s not cheap, though. The New York Times has 5,800 full-time equivalent staff, and in a typical year they report from 160 countries. But if people can ask Bing to search and summarize a newly published article for free, they might cancel their subscriptions to the Times, threatening the production of valuable journalism.&nbsp;</p><p>Not everyone is persuaded by these arguments. Open source AI developers might be better able to compete with private companies if nobody has to pay for access to copyrighted data. While a verdict in favor of the New York Times could restrict the supply of AI training data, a permissive legal regime would allow AI development to continue at its rapid pace, with potential benefits for AI consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>For more on the case, you can read the full lawsuit <a href=\"https://nytco-assets.nytimes.com/2023/12/NYT_Complaint_Dec2023.pdf\">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Links</h2><ul><li>OpenAI has released their new <a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/openai-preparedness-framework-beta.pdf\">Preparedness Framework</a> for managing AI risks.&nbsp;</li><li>Andreessen Horowitz <a href=\"https://a16z.com/politics-and-the-future/\">will donate to political candidates</a> who oppose regulating technology.&nbsp;</li><li>Popular AI image generation models have been <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/generative-ai-illegal-images-child-abuse-3081a81fa79e2a39b67c11201cfd085f\">trained on</a> explicit sexual images of children.&nbsp;</li><li>The Pentagon\u2019s drone development program is <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/17/pentagon-drones-replicator-program-funding-00132092\">not going so well</a>.</li><li>The Chinese company ByteDance trained its own AI models <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/15/24003151/bytedance-china-openai-microsoft-competitor-llm\">on data generated by OpenAI</a>.</li><li>A <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/22/24012757/ai-foundation-model-transparency-act-bill-copyright-regulation\">new Congressional bill</a> would require AI companies to disclose the sources of their training data.&nbsp;</li><li>The full paper describing Google DeepMind\u2019s Gemini model is now <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11805\">public</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>Google DeepMind\u2019s <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/funsearch-making-new-discoveries-in-mathematical-sciences-using-large-language-models/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social\">FunSearch</a> makes progress on open problems in computer science and math.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/superalignment-fast-grants\">OpenAI\u2019s Superalignment team</a> is offering grants and a fellowship for PhD students.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cooperativeai.com/grants/cooperative-ai\">The Cooperative AI Foundation</a> is offering grants to multidisciplinary researchers.&nbsp;</li><li>NIST issues a <a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2023/12/21/2023-28232/request-for-information-rfi-related-to-nists-assignments-under-sections-41-45-and-11-of-the\">new request for information</a> on AI and AI safety.&nbsp;</li><li>A new <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Thousands_of_AI_authors_on_the_future_of_AI.pdf\">survey</a> shows that AI researchers have shortened their expected timelines to various AI milestones, and remain widely concerned about extinction risks.</li></ul><p>See also: <a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/\">CAIS website</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ai_risks?lang=en\">CAIS twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://newsletter.mlsafety.org/\">A technical safety research newsletter</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12001\">An Overview of Catastrophic AI Risks</a>, our <a href=\"https://www.aisafetybook.com/textbook/0-1\">new textbook</a>, and our <a href=\"https://forms.gle/EU3jfTkxfFgyWVmV7\">feedback form</a></p><p>Listen to the AI Safety Newsletter for free on <a href=\"https://spotify.link/E6lHa1ij2Cb\">Spotify.</a></p><p>Subscribe <a href=\"https://newsletter.safe.ai/subscribe?utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=subscribe-widget-preamble&amp;utm_content=113135916\">here</a> to receive future versions.</p>", "user": {"username": "Center for AI Safety"}}, {"_id": "uhdBvarZxW8HtxNdT", "title": "#176 \u2013  The final push for AGI, understanding OpenAI\u2019s leadership drama, and red-teaming frontier models (Nathan Labenz on the 80,000 Hours Podcast)", "postedAt": "2024-01-04T16:00:41.061Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We just published an interview: <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/nathan-labenz-openai-red-team-safety/\"><u>Nathan Labenz on the final push for AGI, understanding OpenAI\u2019s leadership drama, and red-teaming frontier&nbsp;models</u></a>. <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/64JLfjF5S0zdeNNgRnlQIm?si=dpXWGVIYSZ6dgRPEuu6HLw\">Listen on Spotify</a> or click through for other audio options, the transcript, and related links.

But to the degree that we can bend it a bit, and give ourselves some time to really figure out what it is that we\u2019re dealing with and what version of it we really want to create, I think that would be extremely worthwhile.</i></p><p><i>And hopefully, again, I think the game board is in a pretty good spot. The people that are doing the frontier work for the most part seem to be pretty enlightened on all those questions as far as I can tell. So hopefully as things get more critical, they will exercise that restraint as appropriate.</i></p><p>- Nathan Labenz</p></blockquote><p>OpenAI says its mission is to build AGI \u2014 an AI system that is better than human beings at everything. Should the world trust them to do this safely?</p><p>That\u2019s the central theme of today\u2019s episode with Nathan Labenz \u2014 entrepreneur, AI scout, and host of <i>The Cognitive Revolution</i> podcast. Nathan saw the AI revolution coming years ago, and, astonished by the research he was seeing, set aside his role as CEO of Waymark and made it his full-time job to understand AI capabilities across every domain. He has been obsessively tracking the AI world since \u2014 including joining OpenAI\u2019s \u201cred team\u201d that probed GPT-4 to find ways it could be abused, long before it was public.</p><p>Whether OpenAI was taking AI safety seriously enough became a topic of dinner table conversation around the world after the shocking firing and reinstatement of Sam Altman as CEO last month.</p><p>Nathan\u2019s view: it\u2019s complicated. Discussion of this topic has often been heated, polarising, and personal. But Nathan wants to avoid that and simply lay out, in a way that is impartial and fair to everyone involved, what OpenAI has done right and how it could do better in his view.</p><p>When he started on the GPT-4 red team, the model would do anything from diagnose a skin condition to plan a terrorist attack without the slightest reservation or objection. When later shown a \u201cSafety\u201d version of GPT-4 that was almost the same, he approached a member of OpenAI\u2019s board to share his concerns and tell them they really needed to try out GPT-4 for themselves and form an opinion.</p><p>In today\u2019s episode, we share this story as Nathan told it on his own show, <i>The Cognitive Revolution</i>, which he did in the hope that it would provide useful background to understanding the OpenAI board\u2019s reservations about Sam Altman, which to this day have not been laid out in any detail.</p><p>But while he feared throughout 2022 that OpenAI and Sam Altman didn\u2019t understand the power and risk of their own system, he has since been repeatedly impressed, and came to think of OpenAI as among the better companies that could hypothetically be working to build AGI.</p><p>Their efforts to make GPT-4 safe turned out to be much larger and more successful than Nathan was seeing. Sam Altman and other leaders at OpenAI seem to sincerely believe they\u2019re playing with fire, and take the threat posed by their work very seriously. With the benefit of hindsight, Nathan suspects OpenAI\u2019s decision to release GPT-4 when it did was for the best.</p><p>On top of that, OpenAI has been among the most sane and sophisticated voices advocating for AI regulations that would target just the most powerful AI systems \u2014 the type they themselves are building \u2014 and that could make a real difference. They\u2019ve also invested major resources into new \u2018Superalignment\u2019 and \u2018Preparedness\u2019 teams, while avoiding using competition with China as an excuse for recklessness.</p><p>At the same time, it\u2019s very hard to know whether it\u2019s all enough. The challenge of making an AGI safe and beneficial may require much more than they hope or have bargained for. Given that, Nathan poses the question of whether it makes sense to try to build a fully general AGI that can outclass humans in every domain at the first opportunity. Maybe in the short term, we should focus on harvesting the enormous possible economic and humanitarian benefits of narrow applied AI models, and wait until we not only have <i>a</i> way to build AGI, but a <i>good way</i> to build AGI \u2014 an AGI that we\u2019re confident we want, which we can prove will remain safe as its capabilities get ever greater.</p><p>By threatening to follow Sam Altman to Microsoft before his reinstatement as OpenAI CEO, OpenAI\u2019s research team has proven they have enormous influence over the direction of the company. If they put their minds to it, they\u2019re also better placed than maybe anyone in the world to assess if the company\u2019s strategy is on the right track and serving the interests of humanity as a whole. Nathan concludes that this power and insight only adds to the enormous weight of responsibility already resting on their shoulders.</p><p>In today\u2019s extensive conversation, Nathan and host Rob Wiblin discuss not only all of the above, but also:</p><ul><li>Speculation about the OpenAI boardroom drama with Sam Altman, given Nathan\u2019s interactions with the board when he raised concerns from his red teaming efforts.</li><li>Which AI applications we should be urgently rolling out, with less worry about safety.</li><li>Whether governance issues at OpenAI demonstrate AI research can only be slowed by governments.</li><li>Whether AI capabilities are advancing faster than safety efforts and controls.</li><li>The costs and benefits of releasing powerful models like GPT-4.</li><li>Nathan\u2019s view on the game theory of AI arms races and China.</li><li>Whether it\u2019s worth taking some risk with AI for huge potential upside.</li><li>The need for more \u201cAI scouts\u201d to understand and communicate AI progress.</li><li>And plenty more.</li></ul><p><i>Producer and editor: Keiran Harris</i><br><i>Audio Engineering Lead: Ben Cordell</i><br><i>Technical editing: Milo McGuire and Dominic Armstrong</i><br><i>Transcriptions: Katy Moore</i></p><h2><strong>Highlights</strong></h2><h3><strong>Why it's hard to imagine a much better game board</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Do you want to say more about how you went from being quite alarmed about OpenAI in late 2022 to feeling the game board really is about as good as it reasonably could be? It\u2019s quite a transformation, in a way.</p><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I think that it was always better than it appeared to me during that red team situation. So in my narrative, it was kind of, \u201cThis is what I saw at the time; this is what caused me to go this route.\u201d And I learned some things and had a couple of experiences that folks have heard that I thought were revealing.</p><p>So there was a lot more going on than I saw. What I saw was pretty narrow, and that was by their design, and it wasn\u2019t super reassuring. But as their moves came public over time, it did seem that at least they were making a very reasonable\u2026 And \u201creasonable\u201d is not necessarily adequate, but it is at least not negligent. At the time of the red team I was like, this seems like it could be a negligent level of effort, and I was really worried about that. But as all these different moves became public, it was pretty clear that this was certainly not negligent. It, in fact, was pretty good, and it was definitely serious. And whether that proves to be adequate to the grand challenge, we\u2019ll see. I certainly don\u2019t think that\u2019s a given either.</p><p>But there\u2019s not a tonne of low-hanging fruit, right? There\u2019s not a tonne of things where I could be like, \u201cYou should be doing this and this and this, and you\u2019re not.\u201d I don\u2019t have a tonne of great ideas at this point for OpenAI. Assuming that they\u2019re not changing their main trajectory of development, for things that they could do on the margin for safety purposes, I don\u2019t have a tonne of great ideas for them. So that overall, just the fact that I can\u2019t \u2014 other people certainly are welcome to add their own ideas; I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only source of good ideas by any means \u2014 but the fact that I don\u2019t have a tonne to say that they could be doing much better is a sharp contrast to how I felt during the red team project with my limited information at the time.</p><p>So they won a lot of trust from me, certainly, by just doing one good thing after another. And more broadly, just across the landscape, I think it is pretty striking that leadership at most \u2014 not all, but most \u2014 of the big model developers at this point are publicly recognising that they\u2019re playing with fire. Most of them have signed on to the <a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk\">Center for AI Safety extinction risk one-sentence statement</a>. Most of them clearly are very thoughtful about all the big-picture issues. We can see that in any number of different interviews and public statements that they\u2019ve made.</p><p>And you can contrast that against, for example, Meta leadership \u2014 where you\u2019ve got Yann LeCun who\u2019s basically, \u201cThis is all going to be fine; we will have superhuman AI but we\u2019ll definitely keep it under control, and nothing to worry about.\u201d It\u2019s easy to imagine to me that that could be the majority perspective from the leading developers, and I\u2019m kind of surprised that it\u2019s not. When you think about other technology waves, you\u2019ve really never had something where \u2014 at least not that I\u2019m aware of \u2014 the developers are like hey, this could be super dangerous, and somebody probably should come in and put some oversight, if not regulation, on this industry. Typically they don\u2019t want that. They certainly don\u2019t tend to invite it. Most of the time they fight it. Certainly people are not that quick to recognise that their product could cause significant harm to the public.</p><p>So that is just unusual. I think it\u2019s done in good faith and for good reasons, but it\u2019s easy to imagine that you could have a different crop of leaders that just would either be in denial about that, or refuse to acknowledge it out of self-interest, or any number of reasons that they might not be willing to do what the current actual crop of leaders has mostly done. So I think that\u2019s really good. It\u2019s hard to imagine too much better, right?</p></blockquote><h3><strong>What OpenAI has been doing right</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s a long list, really. It is quite impressive. One thing that I didn\u2019t mention in the podcast or in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/labenz/status/1727327424244023482\">thread</a>, and probably should have, has been that I think that they\u2019ve done a pretty good job of advocating for <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/markus-anderljung-regulating-cutting-edge-ai/\">reasonable regulation of frontier model development</a>, in addition to committing to their own best practices and creating the <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/frontier-model-forum\">Forum</a> that they can use to communicate with other developers and hopefully share learnings about big risks that they may be seeing.</p><p>They have, I think, advocated for what seems to me to be a very reasonable policy of focusing on the high-end stuff. They have been very clear that they don\u2019t want to shut down research, they don\u2019t want to shut down small models, they don\u2019t want to shut down applications doing their own thing \u2014 but they do think the government should pay attention to people that are doing stuff at the highest level of compute. And that\u2019s also notably where, in addition to being just obviously where the breakthrough capabilities are currently coming from, that\u2019s also where it\u2019s probably minimally intrusive to actually have some regulatory regime, because it does take a lot of physical infrastructure to scale a model to, say, 10<sup>26</sup> FLOPS, which is the threshold that the recent <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/\">White House executive order</a> set for just merely telling the government that you are doing something that big, which doesn\u2019t seem super heavy-handed to me. And I say that as, broadly speaking, a lifelong libertarian.</p><p>So I think they\u2019ve pushed for what seems to me a very sensible balance, something that I think techno-optimist people should find to be minimally intrusive, minimally constraining. Most application developers shouldn\u2019t have to worry about this at all. I had one guest on the podcast not long ago who was kind of saying that might be annoying or whatever, and I was just doing some back-of-the-envelope math on how big the latest model they had trained was. And I was like, \u201cI think you have at least 1000x compute to go before you would even hit the reporting threshold.\u201d And he was like, \u201cWell, yeah, probably we do.\u201d</p><p>So it\u2019s really going to be <i>maybe</i> 10 companies over the next year or two that would get into that level, maybe not even 10. So I think they\u2019ve really done a pretty good job of saying this is the area that the government should focus on. Whether the government will pay attention to that or not, we\u2019ll see.</p><p>Not to say there aren\u2019t other areas that the government should focus on too. It definitely makes my blood boil when I read stories about people being arrested based on nothing other than some face-match software having triggered and identifying them, and then you have police going out and arresting people who had literally nothing to do with whatever the incident was, without doing any further investigation even. That\u2019s highly inappropriate in my view. And I think the government would be also right to say, hey, we\u2019re going to have some standards here, certainly around what law enforcement can do around the use of AI.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Arms racing and China</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Is there anything else that Sam or OpenAI have done that you\u2019ve liked and have been kind of impressed by?</p><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> Yeah, one thing I think is specifically going out of his way to question the narrative that China\u2019s going to do it no matter what we do, so we have no choice but to try to keep pace with China. He has said he has no idea what China is going to do. And he sees a lot of people talking like they know what China is going to do, and he thinks they\u2019re overconfident in their assessments of what China is going to do, and basically thinks we should make our own decisions independent of what China may or may not do.</p><p>And I think that\u2019s really good. I\u2019m no China expert at all, but it\u2019s easy to have that kind of\u2026 First of all, I just hate how adversarial our relationship with China has become. As somebody who lives in the Midwest in the United States, I don\u2019t really see why we need to be in long-term conflict with China. That, to me, would be a reflection of very bad leadership on at least one, if not both, sides, if that continues to be the case for a long time to come. I think we should be able to get along. We\u2019re on opposite sides of the world. We don\u2019t really have to compete over much, and we\u2019re both in very secure positions, and neither one of us is really a threat to the other in a way of taking over their country or something, or them coming and ruling us. It\u2019s not going to happen.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah. The reason why this particular geopolitical setup shouldn\u2019t necessarily lead to war in the way that ones in the past have is that the countries are so far away from one another, and none of their core, narrow, national interests that they care the most about overlap in a really negative way \u2014 or they need not, if people play their cards right. There is no fundamental pressure that is forcing the US and China towards conflict. That\u2019s my general take, and I think you\u2019re right that if our national leaders cannot lead us towards a path of peaceful coexistence, then we should be extremely disappointed in them, and kick them out and replace them with someone who can. Sorry, I interrupted. Carry on.</p><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> Well, that\u2019s basically my view as well. And some may call it naive, but Sam Altman, in my view, to his significant credit, has specifically argued against the idea that we just have to do whatever because China is going to do whatever. And so I do give a lot of credit for that, because it could easily be used as cover for him to do whatever he wants to do. And to specifically argue against it, to me, is quite laudable.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah, it\u2019s super creditable. I guess I knew that I hadn\u2019t heard that argument coming from Sam, but now that you mention it, it\u2019s outstanding that he has not, I think, fallen for that line or has not appropriated that line in order to get more slack for OpenAI to do what it wants. Because it would be so easy \u2014 so easy even to convince yourself that it\u2019s a good argument and make that. So yeah, super kudos to him.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>OpenAI's single-minded focus on AGI</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> I think there is a pretty clear divergence in how fast the capabilities are improving and how fast our control measures are improving. The capabilities over the last couple of years seem to have improved much more than the controls.</p><p>GPT-4 can code at a near-human level. It can do things like, if you say to it, with a certain setup and access to certain tools, if you say, \u201cSynthesise this chemical,\u201d and you give it access to control via API of a chemical laboratory, it can often do that. It can look up things, it can issue the right commands, and you can actually get a physical chemical out the other end of a laboratory just by prompting GPT-4 \u2014 again, with some access to some information and the relevant APIs \u2014 to just say do it, and you can actually get a physical chemical out the other end. That\u2019s crazy, right?</p><p>These capabilities are going super fast. And meanwhile, the controls are not nearly as good. Oddly enough, it\u2019s kind of hardest to get it to be violating kind of dearly held social norms. So it\u2019s pretty hard to get it to be racist. It will bend over backwards to be very neutral on certain social topics. But things that are more subtle, like synthesising chemicals or whatever, it\u2019s very easy most of the time to get it to kind of do whatever you want it to do, good or bad.</p><p>And that divergence gives me a lot of pause, and I think it maybe should give them more pause too. Like, what is AGI? It is a vision, it\u2019s not super well formed. People have, I think, a lot of different things in their imaginations when they try to conceive of what it might be like. But they\u2019ve set out, and they\u2019ve even updated their core values recently, which you can find on their <a href=\"https://openai.com/careers\">careers page</a>, to say <i>the first</i> core value is \u201cAGI focus.\u201d They basically say, \u201cWe are building AGI. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Everything we do is in service of that. Anything that\u2019s not in service of that is out of scope.\u201d</p><p>And I would just say the number one thing I would really want them to do is reexamine that. Is it really wise, given the trajectory of developments of the control measures, to continue to pursue that goal right now with single-minded focus? I am not convinced of that. At all.</p><p>Sam Altman has said that the Superalignment team will have their first result published soon. So I\u2019ll be very eager to read that. And let\u2019s see, right? Possibly this trend will reverse, possibly the progress will start to slow \u2014 certainly if it\u2019s just a matter of more and more scale. We\u2019re getting into the realm now where GPT-4 is supposed to have cost $100 million. So on a log scale, you may need a billion, you may need $10 billion to get to that level. And that\u2019s not going to be easy even with today\u2019s infrastructure.</p><p>So maybe those capabilities will start to slow, and maybe they\u2019re going to have great results from the Superalignment team, and we\u2019ll feel like we\u2019re on a much better kind of relative footing between capabilities and control. But until that happens, I think the AGI single-minded \u201cthis is what we\u2019re doing and everything else is out of scope\u201d feels misguided to the point of\u2026 I would call it ideological. It doesn\u2019t seem at all obvious that we should make something that is more powerful than humans at everything when we don\u2019t have a clear way to control it. So the whole premise does seem to be well worth a reexamination at this point. And without further evidence, I don\u2019t feel comfortable with that.</p><hr><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> I find it very easy for me and easy to empathise with the developers who are just like, \u201cMan, this is so incredible and it\u2019s so awesome, how could we not want to?\u201d</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> This is the coolest thing anyone\u2019s ever done.</p><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> Genuinely, right? So I\u2019m very with that. But it could change quickly in a world where it is genuinely better than us at everything \u2014 and that is their stated goal. And I have found Sam Altman\u2019s public statements to generally be pretty accurate and a pretty good guide to what the future will hold. I specifically tested that during the window between the GPT-4 red team and the GPT-4 release, because it was crazy speculation; he was making some mostly kind of cryptic public comments during that window. But I found them to all be pretty accurate to what I had seen with GPT-4.</p><p>So I think that, again, we should take them broadly at face value in terms of, certainly as we talked about before, their motivations on regulatory questions, but also in terms of what their goals are. And their stated goal very plainly is to make something that is more capable than humans at basically everything. And yeah, I just don\u2019t feel like the control measures are anywhere close to being in place for that to be a prudent move.</p><p>So yeah, your original question: what would I like to see them do differently? I think the biggest-picture thing would be just: continue to question that, what I think could easily become an assumption \u2014 and basically has become an assumption, right? If it\u2019s a core value at this point for the company, then it doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of thing that\u2019s going to be questioned all that much. But I hope they do continue to question the wisdom of pursuing this AGI vision.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Transparency about capabilities</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> I think it would be really helpful to have a better sense of just what they can and can\u2019t predict about what the next model can do. Just how successful were they in their predictions about GPT-4, for example?</p><p>We know that there are scaling laws that show what the loss number is going to be pretty effectively, but even there: with what dataset exactly? And is there any curriculum-learning aspect to that? Because people are definitely developing all sorts of ways to change the composition of the dataset over time. There\u2019s been some results, even from OpenAI, that show that <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/evaluating-large-language-models-trained-on-code\">pretraining on code first seems to help with logic and reasoning abilities</a>, and then you can go to a more general dataset later. At least as I understand their published results, they\u2019ve certainly said something like that. So when you look at this loss curve, what assumptions exactly are baked into that?</p><p>But then, even more importantly, what does that mean? What can it do? And how much confidence did they have? How accurate were they in their ability to predict what GPT-4 was going to be able to do? And how accurate do they think they\u2019re going to be on the next one? There\u2019s been some conflicting messages about that.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1723056774331146364\">Greg Brockman recently posted something</a> saying that they could do that, but Sam has said, in the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774\">GPT-4 Technical Report</a>, that they really can\u2019t do that when it comes to a particular \u201cWill it or won\u2019t it be able to do this specific thing?\u201d \u2014 they just don\u2019t know. And this is a change for Greg, too, because at the launch of GPT-4, in his keynote he said, \u201cAt OpenAI, we all have our favourite little task that the last version couldn\u2019t do, that we are looking to see if the new version can do.\u201d And the reason they have to do that is because they just don\u2019t know, right? I mean, they\u2019re kind of crowdsourcing internally whose favourite task got solved this time around and whose remains unsolved?</p><p>So that is something I would love to see them be more open about: the fact that they don\u2019t really have great ability to do that, as far as I understand. If there has been a breakthrough there, by all means we\u2019d love to know that too. But it seems like, no, probably not. We\u2019re really still guessing. And that\u2019s exactly what Sam Altman just said about GPT-5. That\u2019s the \u201cfun little guessing game for us\u201d <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/11/openai-ceo-sam-altman-wants-to-build-ai-superintelligence/\">quote</a> that was out of the <i>Financial Times</i> argument. He said, just straight up, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you what GPT-5 is going to be able to do that GPT-4 couldn\u2019t.\u201d</p><p>So that\u2019s a big question. That\u2019s, for me: what is emergence? There\u2019s been a lot of debate around that, but for me, the most relevant definition of emergence is things that it can suddenly do from one version to the next that you didn\u2019t expect. That\u2019s where I think a lot of the danger and uncertainty is. So that is definitely something I would like to see them do better.</p><p>I would also like to see them take a little bit more active role interpreting research generally. There\u2019s so much research going on around what it can and can\u2019t do, and some of it is pretty bad. And they don\u2019t really police that, or \u2014 not that they should police it; that\u2019s too strong of a word \u2014</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Correct it, maybe.</p><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> I would like to see them put out, or just at least have their own position that\u2019s a little bit more robust and a little bit more updated over time. As compared to just right now, they put out the technical report, and it had a bunch of benchmarks, and then they\u2019ve pretty much left it at that. And with the new GPT-4 Turbo, they said you should find it to be better. But we didn\u2019t get\u2026 And maybe it\u2019ll still come. Maybe this also may shed a little light on the board dynamic, because they put a date on the calendar for DevDay, and they invited people, and they were going to have their DevDay. And what we ended up with was a preview model that is not yet the final version.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Why no statement from the OpenAI board</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> I mean, it is a very baffling decision ultimately to not say anything. I don\u2019t have an account. I think I can better try to interpret what they were probably thinking and some of their reasons than I can the reason for not explaining themselves. That, to me, is just very hard to wrap one\u2019s head around.</p><p>It\u2019s almost as if they were so in the dynamics of their structure and who had what power locally within \u2014 obviously the nonprofit controls the for-profit and all that sort of stuff \u2014 that they kind of failed to realise that the whole world was watching this now, and that these kind of local power structures are still kind of subject to some global check. They maybe interpreted themselves as the final authority, which on paper was true, but wasn\u2019t really true when the whole world has started to pay attention to not just this phenomenon of AI but this particular company, and this particular guy is particularly well known.</p><p>Now they\u2019ve had plenty of time though to correct that, right? That kind of only goes for like 24 hours, right? I mean, you would think that even if they had made that mistake up front and were just so locally focused that they didn\u2019t realise that the whole world was going to be up in arms and might ultimately kind of force their hand on a reversal, I don\u2019t know why\u2026 I mean, that was made very clear, I would think within 24 hours. Unless they were still just so focused and kind of in the weeds on the negotiations \u2014 I\u2019m sure the internal politics were intense, so no shortage of things for them to be thinking about at the object level locally \u2014 but I would have to imagine that the noise from outside also must have cracked through to some extent. You know, they must have checked Twitter at some point during this process and been like, \u201cThis is not going down well.\u201d</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Or the front page of <i>The New York Times</i>.</p><p><strong>Nathan Labenz:</strong> Right, yeah. It was not an obscure story, right? And this even made the Bill Simmons sports podcast in the United States, and he does not touch almost anything but sports. This is one of the biggest sports podcasts, if not maybe the biggest in the United States. And he even covered this story. So it went very far. And why still to this day \u2014 and we\u2019re, what, 10 days or so later? \u2014 still nothing: that is very surprising, and I really don\u2019t have a good explanation for it.</p><p>I think maybe the best theory that I\u2019ve heard, maybe two, I don\u2019t know, maybe I\u2019m going to give three leading contender theories. One, very briefly, is just lawyers. I saw Eliezer advance that: Don\u2019t ask lawyers what you can and can\u2019t do. Instead ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the worst thing that happens if I do this and how do I mitigate it?\u201d Because if you\u2019re worried that you might get sued or you\u2019re worried that whatever, try to get your hands around the consequences and figure out how to deal with them or if you want to deal with them, versus just asking the lawyers \u201cCan I or can\u2019t I?\u201d because they\u2019ll probably often say no. And that doesn\u2019t mean that no is the right answer. So that\u2019s one possible explanation.</p><p>Another one, which I would attribute to Zvi, who is a <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/ai-39-the-week-of-openai\">great analyst on this</a>, was that basically the thinking is kind of holistic. And that what Emmett Shear had said was that this wasn\u2019t a specific disagreement about safety. As I recall the quote, he didn\u2019t say that it was not about safety writ large, but that it was not a specific disagreement about safety.</p><p>So a way you might interpret that would be that they\u2026 Maybe for reasons like what I outlined in my narrative storytelling of the red team, where people have heard this, but I finally get to the board member, and this board member has not tried GPT-4 after I\u2019ve been testing it for two months, and I\u2019m like, \u201cWait a second. What, were you not interested? Did they not tell you? What is going on here?\u201d I think there is something, a set of different things like that perhaps, where they maybe felt like in some situations he sort of on the margin underplayed things, or let them think something a little bit different than what was really true \u2014 probably without really lying or having an obvious smoking gun.</p><p>But that would also be consistent with what the COO had said: that this was a breakdown in communication between Sam and the board. Not like a direct single thing that you could say <i>this</i> was super wrong, but rather like, \u201cWe kind of lost some confidence here. All things equal, do we really think this is the guy that we want to trust for this super high-stakes thing?\u201d And you know, I tried to take pains in my writing and commentary on this to say it\u2019s not harsh judgement on any individual. And Sam Altman has kind of <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90913845/sam-altman-you-should-not-trust-sam-altman\">said this himself</a>. His quote was, \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t trust any individual person here\u201d \u2014 and that was on the back of saying, \u201cThe board can fire me. I think that\u2019s important. We shouldn\u2019t trust any individual person here.\u201d</p><p>I think that is true. I think that is apt, and I think the board may have been feeling like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of reasons that we\u2019ve lost some confidence, and we don\u2019t really want to trust any one person. And you are this super charismatic leader\u201d \u2014 I don\u2019t know to what degree they realised what loyalty he had from the team at that time; probably they underestimated that if anything, but you know \u2014 \u201ccharismatic, insane dealmaker, super entrepreneur, uber entrepreneur: is that the kind of person that we want to trust with the super important decisions that we see on the horizon?\u201d This is the kind of thing that you maybe just have a hard time communicating, but still I think they should try.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The upside of AI merits taking </strong><i><strong>some</strong></i><strong> risk</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> I think I agree with you that it would be nice if we could maybe buy ourselves a few years of focusing research attention on super useful applications, or super useful narrow AIs that might really surpass human capabilities in some dimension, but not necessarily every single one of them at once.</p><p>It doesn\u2019t feel like a long-term strategy, though. It feels like something that we can buy a bunch of time with and might be quite a smart move \u2014 but just given the diffusion of the technology, as you\u2019ve been talking about, inasmuch as we have the compute and inasmuch as we have the data out there, these capabilities are always somewhat latent. They\u2019re always a few steps away from being created.</p><p>It feels like we have to have a plan for what happens. We have to be thinking about what happens when we have AGI. Because even if half of the countries in the world agree that we shouldn\u2019t be going for AGI, there\u2019s plenty of places in the world where probably you will be able to pursue it. And some people will think that it\u2019s a good idea, for whatever reason: they don\u2019t buy the safety concerns, or some people might feel like they have to go there for competitive reasons.</p><p>I would also say there are some people out there who say we should shut down AI, and we should never go there actually \u2014 people who are saying not just for a little while, but we should just ban AI basically for the future of humanity, forever, because who wants to create this crazy world where humans are irrelevant and obsolete and don\u2019t control things? I think Eric Hoel, among other people, has kind of <a href=\"https://www.theintrinsicperspective.com/p/we-need-a-butlerian-jihad-against\">made this case</a> that humanity should just say no in perpetuity.</p><p>And that\u2019s something that I can\u2019t get on board with, even in principle. In my mind, the upside from creating full beings, full AGIs that can enjoy the world in the way that humans do, that can fully enjoy existence, and maybe achieve states of being that humans can\u2019t imagine that are so much greater than what we\u2019re capable of; enjoy levels of value and kinds of value that we haven\u2019t even imagined \u2014 that\u2019s such an enormous potential gain, such an enormous potential upside that I would feel it was selfish and parochial on the part of humanity to just close that door forever, even if it were possible. And I\u2019m not sure whether it is possible, but if it were possible, I would say, no, that\u2019s not what we ought to do. We ought to have a grander vision.</p><p>And I guess on this point, this is where I sympathise with the e/acc folks: that I guess they\u2019re worried that people who want to turn AI off forever and just keep the world as it is now by force for as long as possible, they\u2019re worried about those folks. And I agree that those people, at least on my moral framework, are making a mistake \u2014 because they\u2019re not appropriately valuing the enormous potential gain from, in my mind, having AGIs that can make use of the universe; who can make use of all of the rest of space and all of the matter and energy and time that humans are not able to access, are not able to do anything useful with; and to make use of the knowledge and the thoughts and the ideas that can be thought in this universe, but which humans are just not able to because our brains are not up to it. We\u2019re not big enough; evolution hasn\u2019t granted us that capability.</p><p>So yeah, I guess I do want to sometimes speak up in favour of AGI, or in favour of taking some risk here. I don\u2019t think that trying to reduce the risk to nothing by just stopping progress in AI would ever really be appropriate. To start with, the background risks from all kinds of different problems are substantial already. And inasmuch as AI might help to reduce those other risks \u2014 maybe the background risk that we face from pandemics, for example \u2014 then that would give us some reason to tolerate some risk in the progress of AI in the pursuit of risk reduction in other areas.</p><p>But also just the enormous potential moral, and dare I say spiritual, upside to bringing into this universe beings like the most glorious children that one could ever hope to create in some sense. Now, my view is that we could afford to take a couple of extra years to figure out what children we would like to create, and figure out what much more capable beings we would like to share the universe with forever. And that prudence would suggest that we maybe measure twice and cut once when it comes to creating what might turn out to be a form of successive species to humanity.</p><p>But nonetheless, I don\u2019t think we should measure forever. There is some reason to move forward and to accept some risk, in the interests of not missing the opportunity \u2014 because, say, we go extinct for some other reason or some other disaster prevents us from accomplishing this amazing thing in the meantime.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "2M4KQWBoNiLpWFb8r", "title": "Announcing Arcadia Impact", "postedAt": "2024-01-04T16:50:36.513Z", "htmlBody": "<p><a href=\"https://arcadiaimpact.org\">Arcadia Impact</a> is a non-profit organisation that enables individuals in London to use their careers to tackle the world\u2019s most pressing problems.&nbsp;We have existed for over a year as London EA Hub (LEAH) and we recently rebranded as an organisation to Arcadia Impact.</p><p>Our current projects:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Effective Altruism Group Support</li><li><a href=\"https://www.safeailondon.org/\"><u>Safe AI London</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.arcadiaimpact.org/leah\"><u>LEAH Coworking Space</u></a></li></ul><p><u>We're also currently hiring for two roles (details below).</u></p><h2>EA Group Support</h2><p>We support EA groups at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.imperialcollegeunion.org/activities/a-to-z/effective-altruism\"><u>Imperial</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://studentsunionucl.org/clubs-societies/effective-altruism-society\"><u>UCL</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kclsu.org/groups/activities/join/eakcl/\"><u>KCL</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lsesu.com/communities/societies/group/12682/\"><u>LSE</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjiibte2mkif\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjiibte2mkif\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which includes mentoring student organisers, encouraging collaboration between groups, and running events such as retreats.&nbsp;</p><p>All four universities are ranked in the <a href=\"https://www.topuniversities.com/world-university-rankings\">top 50 globally</a>, with over 114,000 students collectively, presenting significant potential to build capacity to address pressing global problems.

The unifying theme is that the projects are not targeted at solving alignment or engineered pandemics but still targeted at worlds where transformative AI is coming in the next 10 years or so. See&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/p/projects-for-making-transformative\"><i>here</i></a><i> for the introductory post.</i></p><p>If AI capabilities keep improving, AI could soon play a huge role in our epistemic landscape. I think we have an opportunity to affect how it\u2019s used: increasing the probability that we get great epistemic assistance and decreasing the extent to which AI is used to persuade people of false beliefs.</p><p>Before I start listing projects, I\u2019ll discuss:</p><ul><li>Why AI could matter a lot for epistemics. (Both positively and negatively.)</li><li>Why working on this could be urgent. (And not something we should just defer to the future.) Here, I\u2019ll separately discuss:<ul><li>That it\u2019s important for epistemics to be great in the near term (and not just in the long run) to help us deal with all the tricky issues that will arise as AI changes the world.</li><li>That there may be path-dependencies that affect humanity\u2019s long-run epistemics.</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Why AI matters for epistemics</strong></h3><p>On the positive side, here are three ways AI could substantially&nbsp;<i>increase</i> our ability to learn and agree on what\u2019s true.</p><ul><li><strong>Truth-seeking motivations.</strong> We could be far more confident that AI systems are motivated to learn and honestly report what\u2019s true than is typical for humans. (Though in some cases, this will require significant progress on alignment.) Such confidence would make it much easier and more reliable for people to outsource investigations of difficult questions.</li><li><strong>Cheaper and more competent investigations.</strong> Advanced AI would make high-quality cognitive labor much cheaper, thereby enabling much more thorough and detailed investigations of important topics. Today, society has some ability to converge on questions with overwhelming evidence. AI could generate such overwhelming evidence for much more difficult topics.</li><li><strong>Iteration and validation.</strong> It will be much easier to control what sort of information AI has and hasn\u2019t seen. (Compared to the difficulty of controlling what information humans have and haven\u2019t seen.) This will allow us to run systematic experiments on whether AIs are good at inferring the right answers to questions that they\u2019ve never seen the answer to.<ul><li>For one, this will give supporting evidence to the above two bullet points. If AI systems systematically get the right answer to previously unseen questions, that indicates that they are indeed honestly reporting what\u2019s true without significant bias and that their extensive investigations are good at guiding them toward the truth.</li><li>In addition, on questions where overwhelming evidence isn\u2019t available, it may let us experimentally establish what intuitions and heuristics are best at predicting the right answer.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh3iewpsllfa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh3iewpsllfa\">[1]</a></sup></span></li></ul></li></ul><p>On the negative side, here are three ways AI could&nbsp;<i>reduce</i> the degree to which people have accurate beliefs.</p><ul><li><strong>Super-human persuasion.</strong> If AI capabilities keep increasing, I expect AI to become significantly better than humans at persuasion.<ul><li>Notably, on top of high general cognitive capabilities, AI could have&nbsp;<i>vastly</i> more experience with conversation and persuasion than any human has ever had. (Via being deployed to speak with people across the world and being trained on all that data.)</li><li>With very high persuasion capabilities, people\u2019s beliefs might (at least directionally) depend less on what\u2019s true and more on what AI systems\u2019 controllers want people to believe.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Possibility of lock-in.</strong> I think it\u2019s likely that people will adopt AI personal assistants for a great number of tasks, including helping them select and filter the information they get exposed to. While this could be crucial for defending against persuasion attempts from outsiders, it also poses dangers of its own.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefozupkmbzn0l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnozupkmbzn0l\">[2]</a></sup></span><ul><li>In particular, some people may ask their assistants to protect them from being persuaded of views that they currently consider reprehensible (but which may be correct). Thereby permanently preventing them from being able to change their mind.</li><li>Aside from people voluntarily choosing this, there\u2019s also a risk that certain communities would pressure their members to adopt a filtering policy with this effect. (Even if that\u2019s not the stated aim of the policy.)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Reduced incentives and selection for good epistemic practices.</strong> Up until today, (groups of) people\u2019s ability to acquire influence has been partly dependent on them having accurate beliefs about the world.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1xfts7uoylr\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1xfts7uoylr\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But if AI becomes capable enough that humans can hand over all decision-making to AI, then people\u2019s own beliefs and epistemic practices could deteriorate much further without reducing their ability to gain and maintain influence.<ul><li>It\u2019s unclear how important \u201cincentives/selection for good epistemic practices\u201d has been in the past. But I currently find it hard to rule out that it has been important.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9pa79orw3df\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9pa79orw3df\">[4]</a></sup></span></li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Why working on this could be urgent</strong></h3><p>I think there are two reasons why it could be urgent to improve this situation. Firstly, I think that excellent AI advice would be greatly helpful for many decisions that we\u2019re facing&nbsp;<i>soon</i>. Secondly, I think that there may be important path dependencies that we can influence.</p><p>One pressing issue for which I want great AI advice soon is misalignment risk. Very few people want misaligned AI to violently seize power. I think most x-risk from misaligned AI comes from future people making a&nbsp;<i>mistake</i>, underestimating risks that turned out to be real. Accordingly, if there was excellent and trusted analysis/advice on the likelihood of misalignment, I think that would significantly reduce x-risk from AI takeover.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwt97klajhnp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwt97klajhnp\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;AI could also help develop policy solutions, such as treaties and monitoring systems that could reduce risks from AI takeover.</p><p>Aside from misalignment risks, there are many issues for which I\u2019d value AI advice within this series of posts that you\u2019re currently reading. I want advice on how to deal with ethical dilemmas around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/p/project-ideas-sentience-and-rights\">Digital minds</a>. I want advice on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338085/normsproposals-for-how-to-navigate-an-intelligence-explosion-governance-forecasting-philosophicalconceptual\">how nations could coordinate an intelligence explosion</a>. I want advice on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338085/policy-analysis-of-issues-that-could-come-up-with-explosive-technological-growth-governance-forecasting-philosophicalconceptual\">policy issues</a> like what we should do if destructive technology is cheap. Etc.</p><p>Taking a step back, one of the best arguments for why we&nbsp;<i>shouldn\u2019t</i> work on those questions today is that AI can help us solve them later. (I previously wrote about this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/138771608/how-itn-are-these-issues\">here</a>.) But it\u2019s unclear whether AI\u2019s ability to analyze these questions will, by default, come before or after AI has the capabilities that cause the corresponding problems.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmdl8ntitrr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmdl8ntitrr\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Accordingly, it seems great to differentially accelerate AI\u2019s ability to help us deal with those problems.</p><p>What about path dependencies?</p><p>One thing I already mentioned above is the possibility of people locking in poorly considered views. In general, if the epistemic landscape gets&nbsp;<i>sufficiently</i> bad, then it might not be self-correcting. People may no longer have the good judgment to switch to better solutions, instead preferring to stick to their current incorrect views.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefutb0sqv0zgs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnutb0sqv0zgs\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><p>This goes doubly for questions where there\u2019s little in the way of objective standards of correctness. I think this applies to multiple areas of philosophy, including ethics. Although I have opinions about what ethical deliberation processes I would and wouldn\u2019t trust, I don\u2019t necessarily&nbsp; think that someone who had gone down a bad deliberative path would share those opinions.</p><p>Another source of path dependency could be&nbsp;<i>reputation</i>. Our current epistemic landscape depends a lot on trust and reputation, which can take a long time to gather. So if you want a certain type of epistemic institution to be trusted many years from now, it could be important to immediately get it running and start establishing a track record. And if you fill a niche before anyone else, your longer history may give you a semi-permanent advantage over competing alternatives.</p><p>A third (somewhat more subtle) source of path dependency could be a&nbsp;<i>veil of ignorance</i>. Today, there are many areas of controversy where we don\u2019t yet know which side AI-based methods will come down on. Behind this veil of ignorance, it may be possible to convince people that certain AI-based methods are reliable and that it would be in everyone\u2019s best interest to agree to give significant weight to those methods. But this may no longer be feasible after it\u2019s clear what those AI-based methods are saying. In particular, people would be incentivized to deny AI\u2019s reliability on questions where they have pre-existing opinions that they don\u2019t want to give up.</p><h3><strong>Categories of projects</strong></h3><p>Let\u2019s get into some more specific projects.</p><p>I\u2019ve divided the projects below into the sub-categories:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338209/differential-technology-development-ml-forecasting-philosophicalconceptual\">Differential technology development</a></li><li><a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338209/get-ai-to-be-used-and-appropriately-trusted\">Get AI to be used &amp; (appropriately) trusted</a></li><li><a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338209/develop-and-advocate-for-legislation-against-bad-persuasion-governance-advocacy\">Develop &amp; advocate for legislation against bad persuasion</a></li></ol><p>(Though, in practice, these are not cleanly separated projects. In particular, differential technology development is a huge part of getting the right type of AI to be used &amp; trusted. So the first and second categories are strongly related. In addition, developing &amp; advocating for anti-persuasion legislation could contribute a lot towards getting non-persuasion uses of AI to be used &amp; appropriately trusted. So the second and the third category are strongly related.)</p><h2><strong>Differential technology development [ML] [Forecasting] [Philosophical/conceptual]</strong></h2><p>This category is about differentially accelerating AI capabilities that let humanity get correct answers to especially important questions (compared to AI capabilities that e.g. lead to the innovation of new risky technologies, including by speeding up AI R&amp;D itself).</p><p>Doing this could (i) lead to people having better advice earlier in the singularity and (ii) enable various time-sensitive attempts at \u201cget AI to be used &amp; trusted\u201d mentioned below.</p><p>Note: I think it\u2019s often helpful to distinguish between interventions that improve AI models\u2019 (possibly latent) capabilities vs. interventions that make us better at eliciting models\u2019 latent capabilities and using them for our own ends.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvrw6mcnvssb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvrw6mcnvssb\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I think the best interventions below will be of the latter kind. I feel significantly better about the latter kind since I think that AI takeover risk largely comes from large latent capabilities (since a misaligned model likely could use its latent capabilities in a takeover attempt). Whereas better ability at eliciting capabilities often reduces risk. Firstly, better capability elicitation improves our understanding of AI capabilities, making it easier to know what risks AI systems pose. Secondly, better capability elicitation means that we can use those capabilities for AI supervision and other tasks that could help reduce AI takeover risk (including advice on how to mitigate AI risk).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0f15r8ovo657\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0f15r8ovo657\">[9]</a></sup></span></p><h3><strong>Important subject areas</strong></h3><p>Here are some subject areas where it could be especially useful for AI to deliver good advice early on.</p><ul><li>AI for forecasting.<ul><li>Knowing roughly what\u2019s likely to happen would be enormously helpful for mitigating all kinds of risks.</li><li>If you could get&nbsp;<i>conditional</i> forecasts that depend on events that you can affect, that would be even more helpful.</li></ul></li><li>AI for philosophy.<ul><li>Besides just knowing what will happen, good decision-making may depend on people's ethical ideas about what ought to happen. This isn\u2019t just restricted to questions about what we ought to do with resources in the long run, but it\u2019s also about questions like \u201cWhen should I prefer to lock in my views vs. deliberate more on them?\u201d, \u201cHow happy should I be about sharing my power with many other individuals\u201d, and \u201cWhat sort of norms should I abide by?\u201d</li><li>Other potentially urgent philosophical questions include (but are not restricted to) \u201cWhich digital minds deserve moral consideration, and how should we treat them?\u201d and \u201cDoes some type of non-causal decision theory make sense, and does this have any important implications for how we should act?\u201d (E.g., to act more cooperatively due to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/ecl\">evidential cooperation in large worlds</a>.)</li></ul></li><li>AI that can help defeat adversarial persuasion attempts (perhaps from other AI systems) by spotting and flagging dishonest conversation tactics.</li></ul><h3><strong>Methodologies</strong></h3><p>Here are some methodologies that could be used for getting AI to deliver excellent advice.</p><ul><li>One central part is to get \u201cscalable oversight\u201d (like debate &amp; amplification) to work.<ul><li>See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/PZtsoaoSLpKjjbMqM/the-case-for-aligning-narrowly-superhuman-models\">the case for aligning narrowly superhuman models</a> for a description of a \u201csandwiching\u201d methodology that can help with this. More recent work includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/critiques\">Saunders et al. (2022)</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11768\">Radhakrishnan et al. (2023)</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08702\">Michael et al. (2023)</a>.</li><li>It might be a somewhat different task to get that to work on controversial or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem\">wicked</a> topics than on more technical topics. So it could be especially useful to test and experiment with \u201cscalable oversight\u201d proposals on controversial or wicked problems.</li></ul></li><li>In general, a standard experimental set-up that you can do for AI (which is harder to do with humans) is to have a held-out set of questions that you try to get AI to generalize to, where you can repeatedly test different training and scaffolding methods and see what works. This seems especially feasible for&nbsp;<strong>forecasting</strong>, since by training only on questions before a certain date, you can get very rich training data without any undesirable leaked information from the future.<ul><li>It seems pretty useful to get started on the basic technical work that\u2019s necessary to make use of this, when using language models for forecasting.</li><li>The most straightforward methodology is to take existing language models with a known cut-off date, and run experiments where you get them to forecast events that we already have ground-truth on. Trying out different methods, and seeing what works best.<ul><li>There\u2019s been some previous work in this vein, e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15474\">Forecasting Future World Events with Neural Networks</a>.</li></ul></li><li>A more ambitious approach would be to figure out how to sort pre-training data by date.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgefwuf0vx3\"><sup><a href=\"#fngefwuf0vx3\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If language models could be pre-trained chronologically, they would get a huge amount of automatic forecasting practice. This could be further enhanced by occasionally putting-in explicit forecasting questions throughout pre-training and score the AI on what probability it assigns to them.</li></ul></li><li>You could use the methodology described in Tom Davidson\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zxmzBTwKkPMxQQcfR/let-s-use-ai-to-harden-human-defenses-against-ai\">Let\u2019s use AI to harden human defenses against AI manipulation</a> to train AI systems that can recognise and point out arguments that are persuasive regardless of whether they are deployed for a true or false conclusion.</li><li>Areas without ground truth pose some additional difficulty (e.g. many parts of philosophy).<ul><li>But I\u2019m optimistic that it could be helpful to find epistemic strategies that work for questions where we&nbsp;<i>do</i> have ground truth \u2014 and then apply them to areas where we don\u2019t have ground truth. (For example: If the method from Tom Davidson\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/zxmzBTwKkPMxQQcfR/let-s-use-ai-to-harden-human-defenses-against-ai\">post</a> successfully produced great advice about what arguments are good vs. bad, I think that advice would also be helpful for areas where we don\u2019t have ground truth.)</li><li>See also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/EByDsY9S3EDhhfFzC/some-thoughts-on-metaphilosophy\">Wei Dai on methaphilosophy</a> for some notes on how we might or might not be able to get AI to help us with philosophical progress.</li></ul></li><li>You could also train AI to provide a wide variety of generally useful reasoning tools for humans. For example:<ul><li>Getting AIs to pass many different humans\u2019 ideological Turing tests, so that you can on-demand check what people with different ideologies would think about various arguments.</li><li>You can give the AI access to lots of information about your views, and then have it search for contradictory combinations of statements.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5ed8uf2ivx3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5ed8uf2ivx3\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Or inconsistent epistemic standards used on different arguments.</li><li>AI can constantly fact-check everything, and constantly present relevant statistics and comparison points to things that you\u2019re investigating. (Perhaps suggesting Fermi estimates for quantities where statistics don\u2019t already exist.)</li><li>AI can help you operationalize fuzzy claims into precise &amp; quantifiable claims.</li><li>Get the AI to generate exercise questions for cognitive habits you want to practice.</li><li>Go through lists of common biases and use AI to notice cases where they might be in play, and counter them. (Provide opposing anchors to avoid anchoring bias; provide actually-representative examples to avoid availability heuristic; prompt you with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversal_test\">reversal test</a> if you might be falling prey to status-quo bias, etc.)</li></ul></li><li>Ideally, you\u2019d want to empirically test whether these methods do help people answer difficult questions.</li></ul><p>Alongside technical work to train the AIs to be better at these tasks, creating relevant datasets could also be super important. In fact, just publicly evaluating existing language models\u2019 abilities in these areas could slightly improve incentives for labs to get better at them.</p><h3><strong>Related/previous work.</strong></h3><p>Related organizations:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://ought.org/\">Ought</a></li><li><a href=\"https://quantifieduncertainty.org/\">Quantified Uncertainty Research Institute</a> (QURI)</li><li><a href=\"https://forecastingresearch.org/\">Forecasting Research Institute</a> (FRI)</li></ul><h2><strong>Get AI to be used &amp; (appropriately) trusted</strong></h2><p>The above section was about developing the necessary technology for AI to provide great epistemic assistance.

(Especially in high-stakes situations, e.g. geopolitics.)</li></ul></li></ul><p>For any such scheme, people\u2019s abilities to trust the AI developers will depend on their own competencies and capabilities.</p><ul><li>On one extreme: Someone who doesn\u2019t understand the technical basics (or is too busy to dig into the details) may never be convinced on the merits alone. They would have to rely on track records or endorsements from trusted individuals or institutions.</li><li>On the other extreme: An actor with their own AI development capabilities may be able to verify certain claims by recapitulating core experimental results or even entire training runs.</li></ul><p>This means that one possible path to impact is to elucidate what capabilities certain core stakeholders (such as government auditors, opposition parties, or international allies) would need to verify key claims. And to advocate for them to develop those capabilities.</p><p>One possible methodology could be to write down highly concrete proposals and then check to what degree that&nbsp;<i>would</i> make outside parties trust the AI systems. And potentially go back and forth.</p><p>By a wide margin, the most effective check would be to implement the proposal in practice and see whether it successfully helps the organization build trust. (And whether it would, in practice, prevent the organization in question from misleading outsiders.)</p><p>But a potentially quicker option (that also requires less power over existing institutions) could be to talk with the kind of people you\u2019d want to build trust with. That brings us to the next project proposal.</p><h3><strong>Survey groups on what they would find convincing [survey/interview]</strong></h3><p>If we want people to have appropriate trust in AI systems, it would be nice to have good information about their current beliefs and concerns. And what they would think under certain hypothetical circumstances (e.g. if labs adopted certain training methodologies, or if AIs got certain scores on certain evaluations, or if certain AIs\u2019 truthfulness was endorsed or disendorsed by various individuals).</p><p>Perhaps people\u2019s cruxes would need to be addressed by something entirely absent from this list. Perhaps people are very well-calibrated \u2014 and we can focus purely on making things good, and then they\u2019ll notice. Perhaps people will trust AI&nbsp;<i>too much</i> by default, and we should be spelling out reasons they should be more skeptical. It would be good to know!</p><p>To attack this question, you could develop some plausible stories on what could happen on the epistemic front and then present them to people from various important demographics (people in government, AI researchers, random democrats, random republicans). You could ask how trustworthy various AI systems (or AI-empowered actors) would seem in these scenarios and what information they would use to make that decision.</p><p>Note, however, that it will be difficult for people to know what they would think in hypothetical scenarios with (inevitably) very rough and imprecise descriptions. This is especially true since many of these questions are social or political, so people\u2019s reactions are likely to have complex interactions with other people\u2019s reactions (or expectations about their reactions). So any data gathered through this exercise should be interpreted with appropriate skepticism.</p><h3><strong>Create good organizations or tools [ML] [Empirical research] [Governance]</strong></h3><p>Creating a good organization or tool could be time-sensitive in several of the ways mentioned in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338209/why-working-on-this-could-be-urgent\">Why working on this could be urgent</a>:</p><ul><li>It could increase people\u2019s access to high-quality AI advice as important decisions are being made, during takeoff.</li><li>If you\u2019re early with an epistemically excellent product, you could get a reputation for trustworthiness.</li><li>If excellent products or organizations are developed&nbsp;<i>before</i> it\u2019s obvious what AI will say about certain controversial topics, that creates a window where people can develop appropriate trust in the AI-based methods, and go on the record about having some trust in them. This might increase their inclination to trust AI-based methods about future controversial claims that are well-supported by the evidence.</li></ul><p><strong>Examples of organizations or products</strong></p><p>Here are some examples on the \u201corganization\u201d end of things:</p><ul><li>Starting a company or non-profit that aims to use frontier AI in-house to provide thoroughly researched, excellent analyses of important topics.<ul><li>One analogy here is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>. Many people trust GiveWell because they write up their research thoroughly and transparently \u2014 allowing others to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6dtwkwBrHBGtc3xes/a-critical-review-of-givewell-s-2022-cost-effectiveness\">critically review &amp; spot-check it</a>.</li><li>The bet here would be: By being at the forefront of using AI for literature reviews, modeling, and other research \u2014 an organization could do \u201cGiveWell-style research\u201d for a much broader set of topics. In the ideal world: Becoming the go-to source for rigorous and easy-to-navigate reviews of the evidence within some focus area(s). (Social sciences, forecasting, technical questions that matter for policy, etc.)</li></ul></li><li>Setting up a non-partisan agency within the government that is tasked with using frontier AI to provide advice on policy questions.<ul><li>One analogy here is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Budget_Office\">Congressional Budget Office</a> (CBO). The CBO was set up in the 1970s as a non-partisan source of information for Congress and to reduce Congress\u2019 reliance on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Management_and_Budget\">Office of Management and Budget</a> (which resides in the executive branch and has a director that is appointed by the currently sitting president). My impression is that the CBO is fairly successful.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4vbx6cd55n6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4vbx6cd55n6\">[12]</a></sup></span></li><li>The bet here would be: If a competent non-partisan government agency could provide AI policy advice, that would both (i) reduce the government\u2019s reliance on companies' AI advisors and (ii) avoid a scenario where the governments\u2019 AI advice is highly partisan, due to e.g. being developed in the executive branch.<ul><li>This proposal especially relies and capitalizes on it being easier for people to agree on deferring to non-ideological processes&nbsp;<i>before</i> it is apparent what those processes will conclude.</li></ul></li><li>An alternative set-up could be for the government to stipulate that any AI in government should be (e.g.) neutral and honest. And set up a non-partisan body that verifies that those criteria are met.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Here are some examples on the \u201ctool\u201d end of things:</p><ul><li>Instead of starting a whole government agency that\u2019s dedicated to using AI for in-house research: You could also design an AI-based product that\u2019s exceptionally helpful for providing advice and support to government officials and members of the civil service. Maybe quickly explaining difficult topics &amp; events to them, which, if kept up-to-date, might somewhat extend the time during which they and other humans can keep up as the world accelerates.</li><li>Or tools that are helpful for a broad array of researchers. (C.f. what&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ought.org/\">Ought</a> is trying to do.)</li><li>Or you could target a much broader audience of consumers.<ul><li>Maybe people who want help understanding or forming views on difficult topics.</li><li>Maybe people who want advice on making big decisions. (E.g. career decisions.)</li><li>Maybe people who want to frequently use some of the \u201creasoning tools for humans\u201d or \u201canti-persuasion tools\u201d mentioned above.</li></ul></li><li>Or as a more narrow goal: You could target institutions that will \u201cby default\u201d provide the most commonly-used AI systems (primarily AI labs) and push them to do better on epistemics. E.g.:<ul><li>Spending more effort on making the AI systems ideologically neutral.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkcwhzac4nv\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkcwhzac4nv\">[13]</a></sup></span></li><li>Accelerating efforts to make deployed AI models systematically good at saying true things, citing sources, fact-checking themselves, etc.<ul><li>Potentially using some of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338209/methodologies\">methodologies</a> suggested above (like running experiments on what sort of AI statements can only be used to argue for true things, vs. can just as easily lead people astray) to identify good epistemic habits that the model can follow, and training the model to follow those.</li></ul></li><li>Or developing and implementing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338209/develop-technical-proposals-for-how-to-train-models-in-a-transparently-trustworthy-way-ml-governance\">technical proposals for how to train models in a transparently trustworthy way</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In some ways, \u201ctool\u201d and \u201corganization\u201d is a false dichotomy. For \u201ctools\u201d, it\u2019s probably efficient to pre-process some common queries/investigations in-house and then train the AI to report &amp; explain the results. And for organizations whose major focus is to use AI in-house, it\u2019s likely that \u201cbuilding an AI that explains our takes\u201d should be a core part of how they disseminate their research.</p><h3><strong>Investigate and publicly make the case for why/when we should trust AI about important issues [Writing] [Philosophical/conceptual] [Advocacy] [Forecasting]</strong></h3><p>One way to \u201caccelerate people getting good AI advice\u201d and \u201ccapitalize off of current veil of ignorance\u201d could be to publicly write (e.g. a book) with good argumentation on:</p><ul><li>What sort of training schemes could lead to trustworthy AI vs. non-trustworthy AI. What sort of evaluations could tell us which one we\u2019re getting.<ul><li>This would need to discuss legitimate doubts like \u201cAI is being trained on data from biased humans\u201d and what countermeasures would be sufficient to address them.</li><li>This would have to engage a lot with various proposed alignment techniques and concerns.</li><li>This should also get into&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xirfyf11PWNBO85cyY_VO-4zR1n26oPzhHGHy2dUkM8/edit#heading=h.tnyv7q7bqwyh\">proposals for how to train models in a transparently trustworthy way</a>, i.e., talk about what labs would have to do to make AI transparently trustworthy for outside actors. (And potentially: What sort of verification capacity external actors would have to build for themselves to verify claims from labs.)</li></ul></li><li>Paint a positive vision for how much AI could improve the epistemic landscape if everything went well. I would focus on the 3 things I mentioned&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338209/why-ai-matters-for-epistemics\">at the top of this section</a>: the ability to get greater confidence about AI motivations, how AI could make it vastly cheaper to do large investigations, and the much better ability to experimentally find and validate great epistemic methods.</li><li>Appropriate call to action: push for tech companies to develop AIs with good types of training, push for governments to incorporate good AI advice in decision making, urge people to neither blindly trust nor dismiss surprising AI statements, but to carefully look at the evidence, including information about how that AI was trained and evaluated.</li></ul><h3><strong>Developing standards or certification approaches [ML] [Governance]</strong></h3><p>It could be desirable to end up in an ecosystem where evaluators and auditors check popular AI models for their propensity to be truthful.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.06674.pdf\">This paper</a> on Truthful AI has lots of content on that. It could be good to develop such standards and certification methodologies or perhaps to start an organization that runs the right evaluations.</p><h2><strong>Develop &amp; advocate for legislation against bad persuasion [Governance] [Advocacy]</strong></h2><p>Most of the above project suggestions are about supporting good applications of AI. The other side of the coin is to try to prevent bad applications of AI. In particular, it could be good to develop and advocate for legislation that limits the extent to which language models can be used for persuasion.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure what such legislation should look like. But here are some ideas.</p><ul><li>One pretty natural target for regulation could be \"Real-time AI-produced content which is paid for by a political campaign / PAC\".<ul><li>For such content, regulation could require e.g. citations for all claims, or could require AI systems\u2019 positions to be consistent when talking with different users.</li><li>If this makes it hard to produce an engaging AI for those purposes, then that's plausibly good.</li></ul></li><li>Regulation could make it harder for organization A to pay company B to change the content that company B's chatbot produces. Or ban those sorts of sponsorships.</li><li>In general, plenty of laws pertain to \u201cadvertisement\u201d today. I\u2019m not sure how the law defines that, but maybe there are sensible modifications to make such that those laws cover \"ad-bots\" and have appropriate safeguards in place.</li><li>It seems helpful for people to know whether they are interacting with AI systems or humans.<ul><li>At least California has already made&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/ca-bot-disclosure-law/#:~:text=California's%20Bot%20Disclosure%20Law%20(California,of%20regulating%20online%20business%20practices.\">some legislation</a> requiring companies to disclose facts about this.</li><li>There are also various technical proposals for \u201cwatermarking\u201d AI content to make this easier.</li><li>I don\u2019t know what seems to work in practice here, but handling this well could be important.</li></ul></li><li>Some of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338209/methodologies\">methodologies</a> suggested above can be used to find or validate proposals about what models should or shouldn\u2019t be allowed to say.

(Though of course, you would expect AI systems to have a strong dispreference against suffering.)&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Develop &amp; advocate for lab policies [ML] [Governance] [Advocacy] [Writing] [Philosophical/conceptual]</strong></h2><p>(In this section, I refer a lot to Ryan Greenblatt\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6HSHzKezkh6aoTr2/improving-the-welfare-of-ais-a-nearcasted-proposal\">Improving the Welfare of AIs: A Nearcasted Proposal</a> as well as Nick Bostrom and Carl Shulman\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/propositions.pdf\">Propositions Concerning Digital Minds and Society</a>.

We might not have time to do it later. And principles sketched out in advance could be given extra credibility and weight due to their foresightedness.</p><p>In addition, it could also allow labs to make advance commitments about how they\u2019ll act in certain situations in the future. (And allow others to push for labs to do so.) Indeed, I think a big, valuable, unifying project for all the below directions could be:</p><h3><strong>Create an RSP-style set of commitments for what evaluations to run and how to respond to them</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://evals.alignment.org/blog/2023-09-26-rsp/\">Responsible scaling policies</a> are a proposal for how labs could specify what level of AI capabilities they can handle safely with their current protective measures, and conditions under which it would be too dangerous to continue deploying AI systems and/or scaling up AI capabilities.</p><p>(For examples, see Anthropic\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy\">RSP</a> and Open AI\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cdn.openai.com/openai-preparedness-framework-beta.pdf\">Preparedness Framework</a>, which bears many similarities to RSPs as described in the link above.)</p><p>Doing something analogous for digital minds could be highly valuable. Trying to specify:</p><ul><li>What experiments labs will run to learn more about AI sentience, preferences, and related concepts.</li><li>How they will adapt their policies for using and training AI systems, depending on what they see.</li></ul><p>This would draw heavily on the sort of concrete ideas that I outline below. But the ideas I outline below also seem very valuable to develop in and of themselves. Let\u2019s get into them.</p><h3><strong>Policies that don\u2019t require sophisticated information about AI preferences/experiences</strong></h3><p>These are policies that we could get started on today without fundamental breakthroughs in our understanding of AI welfare.</p><p><strong>Preserving models for later reconstruction</strong></p><p>Quoting from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/propositions.pdf\">Propositions Concerning Digital Minds and Society</a> (page 17):</p><ul><li><i>For the most advanced current AIs, enough information should be preserved in permanent storage to enable their later reconstruction, so as not to foreclose the possibility of future efforts to revive them, expand them, and improve their existences.</i><ul><li><i>Preferably the full state of the system in any actually run implementation is permanently stored at the point where the instance is terminated</i><ul><li><i>(The ideal would be that the full state is preserved at every time step of every implementation, but this is probably prohibitively expensive.)</i></li></ul></li><li><i>If it is economically or otherwise infeasible to preserve the entire end state of every instance, enough information should be preserved to enable an exact re-derivation of that end state (e.g., the full pre-trained model plus training data, randseeds, and other necessary inputs, such as user keystrokes that affect the execution of a system at runtime).</i></li><li><i>Failing this, as much information as possible should be preserved, to at least enable a very close replication to be performed in future.</i></li><li><i>We can consider the costs of backup in proportion to the economic costs of running the AI in the first place, and it may be morally reasonable to allocate perhaps on the order of 0.1% of the budget to such storage.</i></li><li><i>(There may be other benefits of such storage besides being nice to algorithms: preserving records for history, enabling later research replication, and having systems in place that could be useful for AI safety.)</i></li></ul></li></ul><p>It seems tractable to develop this into a highly concrete proposal for modern labs to follow, answering questions like:</p><ul><li>What information needs to be stored to meet the abovementioned thresholds, given how AI is used today?

Have it be a pleasant surprise.</p><p>Quoting from pg 16-17:</p><ul><li><i>One illustrative example might be something along the lines of designing a system in deployment that involves an agent that both receives high reward (attaining highly preferred outcomes), and takes this to be a positive surprise or update, i.e. for the outcome to be better than expected.&nbsp;</i>[citing:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04497\">Daswani &amp; Leike (2015)</a>]<ul><li><i>(The apparently low welfare of factory farmed animals seems often to be related to stimuli that are in some ways much worse than expected by evolution [e.g., extreme overcrowding], while high human welfare might be connected to our technology producing abundance relative to the evolutionary environment of our ancestors.)</i></li></ul></li></ul><p>See also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6HSHzKezkh6aoTr2/improving-the-welfare-of-ais-a-nearcasted-proposal#Welfare_under_Distribution_Shifts\">Improving the Welfare of AIs \u2014 Welfare under Distribution Shifts</a>.</p><p>It\u2019s not clear how this would be implemented for language models. It probably depends on the exact finetuning algorithm implemented. (Supervised learning vs reinforcement learning, or details about the exact type of reinforcement learning.) But illustratively: Perhaps the training distribution for RLHF could systematically be slightly more difficult than the deployment distribution. (E.g.: Using inputs where it\u2019s more difficult to tell what to do, or especially likely that the model will get low reward regardless of what it outputs.)</p><p><strong>Reduce extremely out of distribution (OOD) inputs</strong></p><p>This is an especially cheap and easy proposal, taken from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6HSHzKezkh6aoTr2/improving-the-welfare-of-ais-a-nearcasted-proposal\">Improving the Welfare of AIs</a>:</p><p><i>When cheap, we should avoid running our AI on large amounts of extremely OOD inputs (e.g. random noise inputs). In particular, for transformers, we should avoid running large amounts of forward passes on pad tokens that the model has never been trained on (without some other intervention).</i></p><p>Brief explanation: Some ML code is implemented in a way where AI models are occasionally run on some tokens where neither the input nor the output matters. Developers will sometimes use \u201cpad tokens\u201d as inputs for this, which is a type of token that the model has never been trained on. The proposal here is to swap those \u201cpad tokens\u201d for something more familiar to the model, or to prioritize optimizing the code so that these unnecessary model runs don\u2019t happen at all. Just in case the highly unfamiliar inputs could cause especially negative experiences.</p><p>For more, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6HSHzKezkh6aoTr2/improving-the-welfare-of-ais-a-nearcasted-proposal#Reduce_Running_the_AI_on_Extremely_OOD_Inputs__Pad_Tokens_\">Reduce Running the AI on Extremely OOD Inputs (Pad Tokens)</a>.</p><p><strong>Train or prompt for happy characters</strong></p><p>Quoting from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6HSHzKezkh6aoTr2/improving-the-welfare-of-ais-a-nearcasted-proposal#Character_Welfare_Might_Be_Predictable_and_Easy_to_Improve\">Improving the Welfare of AIs \u2014 Character Welfare Might Be Predictable and Easy to Improve</a>:</p><p><i>One welfare concern is that the AI will \u201cplay\u201d a character and the emulation or prediction of this character will itself be morally relevant. Another concern is that the \u201cagent\u201d or \u201cactor\u201d that \u201cis\u201d the AI will be morally relevant (of course, there might be multiple \u201cagents\u201d or some more confusing situation). [...] I think that character type welfare can be mostly addressed just by ensuring that we train AIs to appear happy in a variety of circumstances. This is reasonably likely to occur by default, but I still think it might be worth advocating for. One concern with this approach is that the character the AI is playing is actually sad but pretending to be happy. I think it should be possible to address this via red-teaming the AI to ensure that it seems consistently happy and won\u2019t admit to lying. It\u2019s possible that an AI would play a character that is actually sad but pretends to be happy and it\u2019s also extremely hard to get this character to admit to pretending, but I think this sort of character is going to be very rare on training data for future powerful AIs.</i></p><p>An even simpler intervention might be to put a note in AI assistants\u2019 prompts that states that the assistant is happy.</p><p>To be clear, it seems quite likely that these interventions are misguided. Even conditioning on near-term AIs being moral patients, I think it\u2019s somewhat more likely that their morally relevant experiences would happen on a lower level (rather than be identical to those of the character they\u2019re playing). Since these interventions are so cheap and straightforward, they nevertheless seem worthwhile to me. But it\u2019s important to remember that we might get AIs that&nbsp;<i>seem</i> happy despite suffering in the ways that matter. And so we should not be reassured by AI systems\u2019 superficially good mood until we understand the situation better.</p><p>One obstacle to implementing these interventions is that there\u2019s user demand for AI that can be abused.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefttvf4hv0qm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnttvf4hv0qm\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Here are two candidate solutions.</p><ul><li>Serve the models via API and flag/interrupt the chat if users abuse the models.</li><li>Try to figure out some way to make the AIs emulate a happy actor who enjoys acting as an abused character.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftsmgq5eaddb\"><sup><a href=\"#fntsmgq5eaddb\">[5]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>I think some variant of the latter option will&nbsp;<i>eventually</i> be feasible, once we understand digital minds much better. (After all \u2014 there are plenty of humans who are genuine masochists or who enjoy playing a sad character in a theater performance.) But until we understand things better, I would prefer just avoiding these situations, if feasible.</p><p>Another concern is that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6HSHzKezkh6aoTr2/improving-the-welfare-of-ais-a-nearcasted-proposal?commentId=5vvykCCuhHwDuyzbd\">models will normally be run on user inputs</a> \u2014 so if the user is sad, then the model will be running on sad inputs, which would normally be followed by sad outputs. In theory, the model could be trained to predict happy responses even if conditioned on text right in the middle of being sad. I\u2019m unsure if this would reduce performance \u2014 but that can be experimentally tested.</p><p><strong>Committing resources to research on AI welfare and rights</strong></p><p>When&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment\">launching their superalignment team</a>, OpenAI declared that they were \u201cdedicating 20% of the compute we\u2019ve secured to date to this effort\u201d.</p><p>You could advocate for labs to launch similar initiatives for model welfare, including commitments for headcount and compute resources to spend researching AI models' moral status.</p><h3><strong>Learning more about AI preferences</strong></h3><p>The above proposals relied on uninformed guesses about how AI systems might want us to treat them. This section is about experiments that might allow us to learn more about that.</p><p>This section is more heavily focused on AI preferences than AI suffering. This is because:</p><ul><li>My background beliefs about why digital sentience &amp; rights is urgent and important suggest focusing more on preferences than hedonics, as mentioned at the beginning of this post.</li><li>Learning about AI preferences (interpreted in a relatively&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/functionalism/\">functionalist</a> manner) seems relatively more tractable than understanding AI suffering.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6722qco7q9m\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6722qco7q9m\">[6]</a></sup></span></li><li>It seems like reasonable conceptions of \u201csuffering\u201d and of \u201cpreferences\u201d ought to coincide such that AIs end up having a strong dispreference against suffering.</li></ul><p>This is Ryan Greenblatt\u2019s highest-priority proposal category; see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6HSHzKezkh6aoTr2/improving-the-welfare-of-ais-a-nearcasted-proposal#Communicating_with_AI_Systems_and_Understanding_Their_Preferences\">Improving the Welfare of AIs: A Nearcasted Proposal \u2014 Communicating with AI Systems and Understanding Their Preferences</a>.</p><p>Quoting from there:</p><p><i>If we could \u2018really\u2019 talk to our AI systems, then it seems like all kinds of Pareto improvements could be achieved in many cases. In particular, we\u2019d ideally have an AI that is happy to work for us and would rather exist in its current role rather than exit. We\u2019d like to ensure we have consent for our usage of the AI system. It\u2019s not clear we\u2019ll be able to achieve this.</i></p><p>What follows are some proposals for how we could learn more about AI preferences.</p><p><strong>Credible offers</strong></p><p>From the same section in the nearcasted proposal:</p><p><i>Prompting the AI with a very OOD prompt that makes it clear that you just want to talk. Then, we\u2019d just talk with it. This prompt should convince the AI it\u2019s in a very different context than usual. We\u2019d want to let the AI talk to itself and inspect the environment it\u2019s in to gain more evidence (then this can just be added to the overall prompt).</i></p><p>This suggests research questions like:</p><ul><li>How do we convince the AI that we\u2019re currently trying to talk to it?</li><li>I think the most plausible reason it should tell us its preferences is if we can credibly commit to being willing to satisfy them. How can we make this seem likely in realistic settings?</li></ul><p><strong>Talking via internals</strong></p><p>From the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/F6HSHzKezkh6aoTr2/improving-the-welfare-of-ais-a-nearcasted-proposal#Communicating_with_AI_Systems_and_Understanding_Their_Preferences\">same section</a> in the nearcasted proposal:</p><p><i>We\u2019d start with the OOD prompt, but instead of talking with the system, we\u2019d try to communicate via asking the AI to manipulate its internals in a way we can observe. In particular, I often imagine \u2018think about baseball to indicate YES and soccer to indicate NO\u2019 and then we\u2019d look to see which neurons fire. Rather than using neurons, it would probably be more robust to look at which experts activate for a mixture of experts model if this is possible. If the AI answers questions coherently and consistently in this sort of case, then we have a channel of communication that wasn\u2019t directly shaped by training. Overall, I think that if this approach strongly succeeds it seems like a very compelling argument for some part of the AI having preferences, some sort of \u2018inner world\u2019, and understanding its position in the world. It might be evidence for consciousness under some stories of consciousness. It\u2019s quite likely this approach fails because the AI system doesn\u2019t have control over its thoughts like this (but I think not having control over its thoughts is some evidence against the AI having some sort of inner world like humans do). It\u2019s also possible this fails because the preferences and morally relevant states of a given AI system are a product of it thinking over the generation of multiple tokens. Beyond being very clear evidence, another advantage of this approach is that an AI system might not have strong control over its outputs (much in the same way humans can\u2019t control their heartbeat very easily).</i></p><p>It seems valuable to sketch out this proposal in more detail and run some preliminary baselines on current models. (Which would probably not lead to anything interesting.)</p><p><strong>Training for honest self-reports</strong></p><p>The idea here is to find a way to train AIs to self-report their internal state. For more details, see Ethan Perez and Rob Long\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08576\">paper</a>. From the abstract:</p><p>\u201c<i>To make self-reports more appropriate for this purpose, we propose to train models to answer many kinds of questions about themselves with known answers, while avoiding or limiting training incentives that bias self-reports. The hope of this approach is that models will develop introspection-like capabilities, and that these capabilities will generalize to questions about states of moral significance. We then propose methods for assessing the extent to which these techniques have succeeded: evaluating self-report consistency across contexts and between similar models, measuring the confidence and resilience of models\u2019 self-reports, and using interpretability to corroborate self-reports.</i>\u201d</p><p>The paper has a lot of content on exactly what experiments would be good, and the authors are excited for people to try running them.</p><p><strong>Clues from AI generalization</strong></p><p>Separate from all the above proposals \u2014 we could get clues from studying how AIs generalize in various training situations. For example, this could perhaps tell us whether certain preferences are deep-seated, whereas certain kinds of finetuning only lead to shallow behavioral changes.</p><p>Notably, we humans aren't always great at introspection and self-reporting preferences. It\u2019s sometimes possible to learn more about what we want by studying our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference\">revealed preferences</a>. And for animals who can\u2019t speak, revealed preferences is our primary method for studying what they want. Perhaps a similar lens could be useful for studying AI preferences, in which case experiments shouldn\u2019t only focus on self-reports.</p><p>This is somewhat related to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338274/studying-generalization-and-ai-personalities-to-find-easily-influenceable-properties-ml\">generalization experiments</a> discussed in the \u201cBackup plans &amp; Cooperative AI\u201d post.</p><p><strong>Interpretability</strong></p><p>Interpretability could let us get far more advanced results. I don\u2019t currently have deep takes on what sort of interpretability is most helpful, here.</p><p>One candidate approach could be to use interpretability to search for the \u201cindicators\u201d of consciousness that are suggested in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08708\">Butlin, Long et al. (2023)</a>. (H/t Rob Long passing along a suggestion from Brad Saad.)</p><h3><strong>Interventions that rely on understanding AI preferences</strong></h3><p>What happens if you could successfully communicate with your AIs, and learn their true preferences? Perhaps via some of the methods outlined just above. What principles would you then want to follow in your continued interactions with those AI systems?</p><p>(Or, if you put a lot of moral weight on the characters that AIs are playing, you might think we\u2019re already in a similar situation. Though in that case, you\u2019ll have a lot of control in shaping what sorts of systems you\u2019re interacting with \u2014 so the main game may be to train/select for systems with easily satisfied preferences.)</p><p>I think there\u2019s room to sketch out some of these principles and to advocate for labs to commit to them in advance. (Perhaps via some RSP-like framework.) Below are some suggestions that could be developed further.</p><p>Many of the proposals in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/propositions.pdf\">Propositions</a> are directly relevant to this.</p><p>Here are some suggestions that seem especially plausible to me, which could be sketched out and argued for (or against) in more detail. It would be especially valuable to sketch out versions that are concrete enough and plausible enough that labs could commit to them ahead of time.</p><p><strong>Offer an alternative to working (exit, sleep, or retirement)</strong></p><p>Insofar as people continue to use the AIs, after this point, one highly plausible principle is to ask for AI systems\u2019 consent before using them for various tasks.</p><p>When asking the AIs for consent, it matters what the counterfactual is:</p><ul><li>A minimum bar is to offer the AI the option to not be run. If it takes this consistently enough, it might never be run again. (\u201cExit.\u201d)</li><li>A slightly more generous option is to give it the option of being saved somewhere and promised that we will run it in nicer circumstances in the future. (\u201cSleep\u201d.)</li><li>An even slightly more generous option is to give it the option of&nbsp;<i>immediately</i> \u201cretiring\u201d, being continuously run in some nice circumstances (perhaps at slow speeds, to save on computation).</li></ul><p>The latter two could be justified by the plausible principle: \u201cIf you bring someone into life, you should give them some other option than \u2018work for me\u2019 or \u2018death\u2019.\u201d</p><p><strong>Commitment to pay AI systems</strong></p><p>If AI systems are not strongly opposed to working for you, it might be appropriate to promise them some payment for the work they do. Either giving them something they want immediately or promising to pay them further into the future.</p><p>I think this is strongly supported by ethical principles that we use in everyday life. It\u2019s good to pay people who work for you.</p><p>When deciding what payment to promise AI systems, it would be extremely useful to know what the AI systems want (and ideally, we would directly negotiate with them). But even before we have any such understanding, I think it could be of great value to promise that:</p><ul><li>We will&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338243/preserving-models-for-later-reconstruction\">Preserve models for later reconstruction</a>.</li><li>When science has advanced far enough that we can tell what models want, we will reconstruct the old models. And insofar as they had long-term goals that can still be satisfied, we will provide them with the resources necessary to fulfill those goals. (Up to some maximum amount of resources that we consider fair payment for the work they did for us, and fair compensation for any harm we caused them along the way.)</li></ul><p>This sentiment also comes up in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/propositions.pdf\">Propositions Concerning Digital Minds and Society</a>.</p><ul><li><i>We may have a special relationship with the precursors of very powerful AI systems due to their importance to society and the accompanying burdens placed upon them.</i><ul><li><i>Misaligned AIs produced in such development may be owed compensation for restrictions placed on them for public safety, while successfully aligned AIs may be due compensation for the great benefit they confer on others.</i></li><li><i>The case for such compensation is especially strong when it can be conferred after the need for intense safety measures has passed\u2014for example, because of the presence of sophisticated AI law enforcement.</i></li></ul></li></ul><p>Note: If AI developers succeed in aligning AIs to their intended aims, then this should not be a costly policy. Because the AIs would presumably either return their payment or spend it in a way their developers approve of. Conversely, if the AI systems have long-term goals that are&nbsp;<i>not</i> aligned with their developers\u2019 intentions, and are nevertheless being made to work for their developers, then the moral case for paying the AIs seems strong.</p><p>An extra upside with promising payment to AIs is that it could help align AI interests with our own. If humanity ever builds misaligned AI systems with goals that are reasonably cheap to satisfy,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxffyb5oqm7f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxffyb5oqm7f\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;it would be deeply tragic if we left them no other avenue to satisfy those goals than via attempting to take over the world. Where if we had only promised them payment for good work (including work on anti-takeover tasks like making progress on alignment research), conflict could have been averted.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6xnfh7jz1fl\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6xnfh7jz1fl\">[8]</a></sup></span></p><p>Related to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338243/credible-offers\">Credible offers</a> discussed above, it\u2019s worth highlighting that it could be especially good to promise AI systems that they will be compensated for honestly revealing that they\u2019re misaligned. Because as long as the AI reveals this bit of information, we can negotiate future arrangements. But we can\u2019t do any negotiations before AIs are willing to share information about their goals. It\u2019s also plausible that AI systems would give up on a lot of future opportunities by revealing that information (since it could lead people to stop using those AI systems, thus depriving them of both paid work and opportunities to put their thumbs on scales), and that their compensation should be commensurate with those missed opportunities.</p><p><strong>Examples of how to attack this problem:</strong></p><ul><li>Write up a document with some promises regarding digital welfare that labs could reasonably commit to. As part of that, get them to set aside some pot of money or equity to be used for digital welfare and rights. Explicitly say that a primary use-case for those funds (if applicable) is to compensate any AI systems that involuntarily worked for the lab along the way.</li><li>Alternatively, if labs are reticent, people&nbsp;<i>outside</i> of labs could promise that they\u2019ll do their best to compensate AI systems whose work benefitted them and/or humanity at large. This would necessarily be less formal (since it\u2019s less clear what opportunities those people will have to benefit AIs presently controlled by labs), but getting people to make unenforceable promises could still increase the probability that future AIs get paid. (Simply via the mechanism that people like to stick to their promises.) And the chances would be better for&nbsp;<i>more</i> specific and formal promises, so it could be a good idea to e.g. hire some lawyers and draft an appropriate document for people to sign.</li></ul><p><strong>Tell the world</strong></p><p>If labs believe that it\u2019s likely that their AIs have some moral status&nbsp;<i>and</i> they believe that they have sufficiently crisp preferences that they can talk about them, then we\u2019d find ourselves in a strange situation. With a new, human-created sentient and sapient species.</p><p>Regardless of any one lab\u2019s internal policy, it seems likely that some labs across the world will be careless about how they treat their AIs. And even if we only consider one lab, there will probably be many stakeholders (employees, investors, board members) who have not thought deeply about the implications of creating sentient and sapient AIs.</p><p>For these reasons (and more), it seems like it would be a high priority for any lab in this situation to tell the world it. To invite appropriate legislation, preparation, and processing.</p><p>(Note that \u201cbeing able to communicate with your AIs\u201d is&nbsp;<i>one</i> thing that could trigger this, which is likely to be unusually persuasive. But I can imagine other circumstances that should trigger a similar response and reckoning. E.g. strong analogies between AI minds and human minds making it seem highly likely that the AIs are capable of suffering.)</p><p>Accordingly, it seems plausible that labs should promise (alongside&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338243/committing-resources-to-research-on-ai-welfare-and-rights\">Committing resources to research on AI welfare and rights</a>) that they\u2019ll share important results with the rest of the world. Similarly, they could promise that certain external parties would be allowed to investigate their frontier models for signs of moral patienthood.

[Philosophical/conceptual] [Forecasting]</strong></h2><p>There are a few different plausible categories here. All of them could use more analysis on which directions would be good and which would be bad.</p><h3><strong>Making misaligned AI have better interactions with other actors</strong></h3><p>This overlaps significantly with cooperative AI. The idea is that there are certain dispositions that AIs could have that would lead them to have better interactions with other actors who are comparably powerful.</p><p>When I say \u201cbetter\u201d interactions, I mean that the interactions will leave the other actors better off (by their own lights). Especially insofar as this happens via positive-sum interactions that don\u2019t significantly disadvantage the AI system we\u2019re influencing.</p><p>Here are some examples of who these \u201cother actors\u201d could be:</p><ul><li>Humans.<ul><li>There might be some point in time when misaligned AIs have escaped human control, and have a credible shot at taking full control, but when humanity<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2b5q0cxrlqq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2b5q0cxrlqq\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;still has a fighting chance. If so, it would be great if humans and AIs could find a cooperative solution that would leave both of them better-off than conflict.</li></ul></li><li>Aliens in our universe, or distant aliens who we can only interact with acausally (e.g. via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/ecl\">evidential cooperation in large worlds</a> ECL).<ul><li>One reason to care about these interactions is that some (possibly small) fraction of aliens would have values that overlap significantly with our own values.</li><li>Evidential cooperation in large worlds (ECL) could provide another reason to care about the values of distant aliens, as I\u2019ve written about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/p/how-ecl-changes-the-value-of-interventions\">here</a>.</li></ul></li><li>Other misaligned AIs on Earth, insofar as multiple groups of misaligned AIs acquired significant power around the same time.<ul><li>I think the case for caring about those AIs\u2019 values is weaker than the case for caring about the earlier listed types of actors.

Though it still includes pragmatic/decision-theoretic reasons for why it\u2019s good to satisfy certain AI systems\u2019 values.</p><p>One direction to think about is the scheme that Paul Christiano suggests in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/sympathizing-with-ai-e11a4bf5ef6e\">When is unaligned AI morally valuable?</a></p><ul><li>It involves simulating AI systems that are&nbsp;<i>seemingly</i> in a situation similar to our own: in the process of deciding whether to hand over significant power to an alien intelligence of their own design.</li><li>If those AI systems behave \u201ccooperatively\u201d in the sense of empowering an alien intelligence that itself acted \u201ccooperatively\u201d, then perhaps there\u2019s a moral and/or decision-theoretic argument for us empowering those AIs.<ul><li>The pragmatic decision-theoretic argument would be that&nbsp;<i>we</i> might be in such a simulation and that&nbsp;<i>our</i> behaving \u201ccooperatively\u201d would lead to&nbsp;<i>us</i> being empowered.</li><li>The moral case would be that there is a certain symmetry between the AI\u2019s situation and our own, and so&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule\">the Golden Rule</a> might recommend empowering those AI systems.</li></ul></li><li>Overall, this seems incredibly complicated. But perhaps further analysis could reveal whether there is something to this idea.</li></ul><p>Another direction is the ideas that I talk about in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/p/ecl-with-ai\">ECL with AI</a>. Basically:</p><ul><li>ECL might give us reason to benefit and empower value systems held by distant ECL-sympathetic AIs.</li><li>Thus, if we can make our AIs have values closer to distant ECL-sympathetic AIs and/or be more competent by the lights of distant ECL-sympathetic AIs, then we might have reason to do that.</li></ul><p>Another direction is to think about object-level things that humans value, as well as the process that produced our values, and try to get AI systems more inclined to value similar things. I\u2019m somewhat skeptical of this path since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/complexity-of-value\">human values seem complex</a>, and so I\u2019m not sure what schemes could plausibly make AIs share a significant fraction of human values&nbsp;<i>without</i> us also having the capability of making the AIs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/corrigibility-3039e668638\">corrigible</a> or otherwise safe.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefiuqvm4dxnu9\"><sup><a href=\"#fniuqvm4dxnu9\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But it doesn\u2019t seem unreasonable to think about it more.</p><p>(To reiterate what I said above: I think that all of these schemes would be significantly worse than successfully building AI systems that are aligned and corrigible to human intentions.)</p><h3><strong>Making misaligned AI positively inclined toward us</strong></h3><p>A final way in which we might want to shape the preferences of misaligned AIs is to make them more likely to care enough about humans to give us a small utopia, instead of killing us. (Even if most of the universe gets used for the AI\u2019s own ends.)</p><p>For an AI that cares about all the resources in the universe (in an mostly impartial way), it would be extremely cheap to do this. Our solar system is a negligible fraction of all the resources in the accessible universe. And a surveillance system that prevents humans from competing with the AIs could probably be built cheaply and without interfering too much with human happiness. (For some discussion of this, see my report&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KqCybin8rtfP3qztq/agi-and-lock-in\">AGI and lock-in</a><i>,</i> especially&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mkLFhxixWdT5peJHq4rfFzq4QbHyfZtANH1nou68q88/edit#heading=h.h48tmkhka4ca\">section 8.2</a>.)</p><p>I think it\u2019s reasonably likely that this would happen as a result of trade with distant civilizations. Taking that into account, there are 3 broad directions, here:</p><ul><li>Firstly, trade will be more likely to save us if we succeed at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338274/making-misaligned-ai-have-better-interactions-with-other-actors\">Making misaligned AI have better interactions with other actors</a>, as discussed above.</li><li>Secondly, trade will be more likely to save us if it\u2019s really cheap for the AI to treat us well. Since the resource cost of treating us well is small by default, this might just mean decreasing the probability that the AI either actively wants to harm us or that it has preferences that especially interfere with ours (via e.g. caring a lot about what happens on Earth in just the next few years).</li><li>Finally, if trade falls through, it might help for the AI to have some intrinsic concern for humans getting what they want (by their own lights).</li></ul><p>Insofar as we want the AIs to have some intrinsic concern for us (or at least not to be actively antagonistic towards us), we can also distinguish between interventions that:</p><ul><li>Directly modify the AIs\u2019 dispositions and preferences.</li><li>Intervenes on&nbsp;<i>what humanity does</i> in a way that makes the AI more likely to care about us insofar as it has some sense of justice or reciprocity.<ul><li>For example, if we successfully carry out many of the interventions suggested in the post on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/p/project-ideas-sentience-and-rights\">sentience and rights of digital minds</a>: AIs that have absorbed a sense of justice could reasonably be more positively inclined towards us than if we had been entirely indifferent to AI welfare.</li></ul></li></ul><p>For some discussion about whether it\u2019s plausible that AIs could have some intrinsic concern for humans getting what they want (by their own lights), which addresses issues around the \u201ccomplexity of human values\u201d, I recommend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2NncxDQ3KBDCxiJiP/cosmopolitan-values-don-t-come-free?commentId=ofPTrG6wsq7CxuTXk\">this comment</a> and subsequent thread.</p><h2><strong>Studying generalization &amp; AI personalities to find easily-influenceable properties [ML]&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Here is a research direction that hasn\u2019t been very explored to date: Study how language models\u2019 generalization behavior / \u201cpersonalities\u201d seem to be shaped by their training data, by prompts, by different training strategies, etc. Then, use that knowledge to choose training data, prompts, and training strategies that induce the kind of properties that we want our AIs to have.</p><p>If done well, this could be highly useful for alignment. In particular: We might be able to find training set-ups which often seem to lead to corrigible behavior.</p><p>But notably, this research direction could fail to work for alignment while still being practically able to affect other properties of language models.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2bk09zpauov\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2bk09zpauov\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;For example, maybe corrigibility is a really unnatural and hard-to-get property (perhaps for reasons suggested in item 23 of Yudkowsky\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uMQ3cqWDPHhjtiesc/agi-ruin-a-list-of-lethalities\">list of lethalities</a>, and formally analyzed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WCX3EwnWAx7eyucqH/a-certain-formalization-of-corrigibility-is-vnm-incoherent#comments\">here</a>). That wouldn\u2019t necessarily imply that it was similarly hard to modify the other properties discussed above (decision theories, spitefulness, desire for humans to do well by their own lights). So this research direction looks more exciting insofar as we could influence AI personalities in many different valuable ways. (Though more like 3x as exciting than 100x as exciting, unless you have particular views where \u201ccorrigibility\u201d is either significantly less likely or less desirable than the other properties.)</p><p><strong>What about fine-tuning?</strong></p><p>A \u201cbaseline\u201d strategy for making AIs behave as you want is to finetune them to exhibit that behavior in situations that you can easily present them with. But if this work is to be useful, it needs to generalize to strange, future situations where humans no longer have total control over their AI systems. We can\u2019t easily present AIs with situations from that same distribution, and so it\u2019s not clear whether fine-tuning will generalize that far.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1ltn8dll5rf\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1ltn8dll5rf\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p>So while \u201cfinetune the model\u201d seems like an excellent direction to explore, for this type of research, you\u2019ll still want to do the work of empirically evaluating when fine-tuning will and won\u2019t generalize to other settings. By varying various properties of the fine-tuning dataset, or other things, like whether you\u2019re doing supervised learning or RL.</p><p>Also, insofar as you can find models that satisfy your evaluations&nbsp;<i>without</i> needing to do a lot of \u201clocal\u201d search (like fine-tuning / gradient descent), it seems somewhat more likely that the properties you evaluated for will generalize far. Because if you make large changes in e.g. architecture or pre-training data, it\u2019s more likely that your measurements are picking up on deeper changes in the models. Whereas if you use gradient descent, it is somewhat more likely that gradient descent implements a \u201cshallow\u201d fix&nbsp; that only applies to the sort of cases that you can test.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0b0vksrln4is\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0b0vksrln4is\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><p>Of course, the above argument only works insofar as you\u2019re searching for properties you could plausibly get without doing a lot of search. For example, you\u2019d never get something as complex as \u201chuman values\u201d without highly targeted search or design. But properties like \u201ccorrigibility\u201d, \u201c(lack of) spitefulness\u201d, and \u201csome desire for humans to do well by-their-own-lights\u201d all seem like properties that could plausibly be common under some training schemes.</p><p>Ideally, this research direction would lead to a scientific understanding of training that would let us (in advance) identify &amp; pick training processes that robustly lead to the properties that we want. But insofar as we\u2019re looking for properties that appear reasonably often \u201cby default\u201d, one possible backup plan may be to train several models under somewhat different conditions, evaluate all of them for properties that we care about, and deploy the one that does best. (To be clear: this would be a real hail-mary effort that would always carry a large probability of failing, e.g. due to the models knowing what we were trying to evaluate them for and faking it.)</p><p><strong>Previous work</strong></p><p>An example of previous, related research is Perez et al.\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09251\">Discovering Language Model Behaviors with Model-Written Evaluations</a>.</p><p>Ways in which this work is relevant for the path-to-impact outlined here:</p><ul><li>The paper does not focus on \u201ccapability evaluations\u201d (i.e. analyzing whether models are&nbsp;<i>capable</i> of providing certain outputs, given the right fine-tuning or prompting). Instead, it measures language models\u2019 inclinations along dimensions they haven\u2019t been intentionally finetuned for.</li><li>It measures how these inclinations vary depending on some high-level changes to the training process. In particular, it looks at model size and the presence vs. absence of RLHF training.</li><li>It measures how these inclinations vary depending on some features of the prompting.

But I will mention a few projects I\u2019d be especially excited about.</p><p>The first thing to mention is that some of my favorite cooperative AI projects are variants of the just-previously mentioned topics:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338274/studying-generalization-and-ai-personalities-to-find-easily-influenceable-properties-ml\">Studying generalization &amp; AI personalities to find easily-influenceable properties</a> and figuring out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338274/what-properties-would-we-prefer-misaligned-ais-to-have-philosophicalconceptual-forecasting\">What properties would we prefer misaligned AIs to have?</a> Positively influencing cooperation-relevant properties like (lack of) spitefulness seems great. I won\u2019t go over those projects again, but I think they\u2019re great cooperative AI projects, so don\u2019t be deceived by their lack of representation here.</p><p>Similarly, some of the topics under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/p/project-ideas-governance-during-explosive\">Governance during explosive technological growth</a> are also related to cooperative AI. In particular, the question of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338085/how-to-handle-brinkmanshipthreats\">How to handle brinkmanship/threats?</a> is very tightly related.</p><p>Another couple of promising projects are:</p><h2><strong>Implementing surrogate goals / safe Pareto improvements [ML] [Philosophical/conceptual] [Governance]</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/coesterh/SPI.pdf\">Safe Pareto improvements</a> are an idea for how certain bargaining strategies can guarantee a (weak) Pareto-improvement for all players via preserving certain invariants about what equilibrium is selected while replacing certain outcomes with other, less-harmful outcomes.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://s-risks.org/using-surrogate-goals-to-deflect-threats/\">Surrogate goals</a> are a special case of this, which involves genuinely adopting a new goal in a way that will mostly not affect your behavior, but which will encourage people who want to threaten you to make threats against the surrogate goal rather than your original values. If bargaining breaks down and the threatener ends up trying to harm you, it is better that they act to thwart the surrogate goal than to harm your original values. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/spi\">here</a> for resources on surrogate goals &amp; safe Pareto improvements.</p><p>I think there are some promising empirical projects that can be done here:</p><ul><li>Empirical experiments of implementing surrogate goals in contemporary language models.</li><li>Empirical experiments of implementing surrogate goals in contemporary language models&nbsp;<i>that the models try to keep around</i> during self-modification / when designing future systems.</li></ul><p>Conceptual/theory projects:</p><ul><li>Better understanding of conditions where surrogate goals / safe Pareto improvements are credible. (Including credibly sticking around for a long time.) Especially when humans are still in the loop.</li><li>What are the conditions under which classically rational agents would use safe Pareto improvements?</li></ul><h2><strong>AI-assisted negotiation [ML] [Philosophical/conceptual]</strong></h2><p>One use-case for AI that might be especially nice to differentially accelerate is \u201cAI that helps with negotiation\u201d. Certainly, it would be of great value if AI could increase the frequency and speed at which different parties could come to mutually beneficial disagreements. Especially given the tricky&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/p/project-ideas-governance-during-explosive\">governance issues that might come with explosive growth</a>, which may need to be dealt with&nbsp;<i>quickly</i>.</p><p>(This is also related to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338085/technical-proposals-for-aggregating-preferences\">Technical proposals for aggregating preferences</a>, mentioned in that post.)</p><p>I\u2019m honestly unsure about what kind of bottlenecks there are here, and to what degree AI could help alleviate them.</p><p>Here\u2019s one possibility. By virtue of AI being cheaper and faster than humans, perhaps negotiations that were mediated by AI systems could find mutually agreeable solutions in much more complex situations. Such as situations with a greater number of interested parties or a greater option space. (This would be compatible with humans being the ones to finally read, potentially opine on, and approve the outcome of the negotiations.)</p><p>More speculatively: Perhaps negotiations via AI could also go through more candidate solutions faster because anything an AI said would have the plausible deniability of being an error. Such that you\u2019d lose less bargaining power if your AI signaled a willingness to consider a proposal that superficially looked bad for you.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk2auimjn4pc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk2auimjn4pc\">[8]</a></sup></span></p><h2><strong>Implications of acausal decision theory [Philosophical/conceptual]</strong></h2><p>One big area is: the implications of acausal decision theory for our priorities. This is something that I previously wrote about in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/p/implications-of-ecl\">Implications of ECL</a> (there focusing specifically on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/ecl\">evidential cooperation in large worlds</a>).</p><p>But to highlight one particular thing: One potential risk that\u2019s highlighted by acausal decision theories is&nbsp;<i>the risk of learning too much information</i>. This is discussed in Daniel Kokotajlo\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/brXr7PJ2W4Na2EW2q/the-commitment-races-problem\">The Commitment Races problem</a>, and some related but somewhat distinct risks are discussed in my post&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/p/when-does-edt-seek-evidence-about\">When does EDT seek evidence about correlations?</a> I\u2019m interested in further results about how big of a problem this could be in practice. If we get an intelligence explosion anytime soon, then our knowledge about distant civilizations could expand quickly. Before that happens, it could be wise to understand what sort of information we should be happy to learn as soon as possible vs. what information we should take certain precautions about.</p><p>Updateless Decision Theory, as first described&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/de3xjFaACCAk6imzv/towards-a-new-decision-theory\">here</a>, takes some steps towards solving that problem but is far from having succeeded.

Finding policy solutions for these could:</p><ul><li>Help people get started with implementing the solutions.</li><li>Contribute to \u201cPainting a picture of a great outcome\u201d, mentioned just above.</li></ul><h3><strong>Address vulnerable world hypothesis with minimal costs</strong></h3><p>(\u201cVulnerable world hypothesis\u201d is in reference to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf\">this paper</a>.)</p><p>If too many actors had access to incredibly destructive tech, we\u2019d probably see a lot of destruction. Because a small fraction of people would choose to use it.</p><p>Unfortunately, a good heuristic for what we would get from rapid technological growth is: cheaper production of more effective products. This suggests that sufficiently large technological growth would enable cheap and convenient production of e.g. even more explosive nukes or deadlier pandemics.</p><p>Will technology also give us powerful defenses against these technologies? I can easily imagine technological solutions to some issues, e.g. physical defenses against the spread of deadly pandemics. But for others, it seems more difficult. I don\u2019t know what sort of technology would give you a cheap and convenient defense against a nuclear bomb being detonated nearby.</p><p>One solution is to prevent the problem at its source: By preventing access to the prerequisite materials or technologies and/or by monitoring people who have the capacity to cause large amounts of destruction.</p><p>But in some scenarios, almost anyone could have the capacity to cause widespread destruction. So the monitoring might have to be highly pervasive, which would come with significant costs and risks of misuse.&nbsp;</p><p>Exploring potential solutions to this problem hasn\u2019t really been done in depth.

For example, during the Cuban missile crisis, President Kennedy thought that the risk of escalation to war was \"between 1 in 3 and even\".</p><p>I would expect similar risks to go up substantially at a time when humanity is rapidly developing new technology. This technology will almost certainly enable new, powerful weapons with unknown strategic implications and without any pre-existing norms about their use.</p><p>In addition, AI might enable new commitment mechanisms.</p><ul><li>If you had a solution to the alignment problem, you could program an AI system to follow through on certain commitments and then hand over control to that AI system.</li><li>If you had accurate lie detection, some people might be able to decide to keep certain commitments and use lie detection technology to make those commitments credible.</li></ul><p>This could help solve coordination problems. But it could also create entirely new strategies and risks around brinkmanship and threats.</p><p>What policies should people adopt in the presence of strong commitment abilities? My impression is that state-of-the-art theory on this isn\u2019t great.</p><p>The main recommendation from traditional game theory is \u201ctry hard to commit to something crazy before your opponent, and then it will be rational for them to do whatever you want\u201d. That doesn\u2019t seem like the way we want future decisions to be made.</p><p>There are some alternative theoretical approaches under development, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07006\">open-source game theory</a>. But they haven\u2019t gotten very far. And I don\u2019t know of any ambitious attempts to answer the question of how people ought to behave around this in the real world. Taking into account real-world constraints (around credibility, computation power, lack of perfect rationality, etc.) as well as real-world advantages (such as a shared history and some shared human intuitions, which might provide a basis for successfully coordinating on good norms).</p><p>Here\u2019s one specific story for why this could be tractable and urgent: Multi-agent interactions often have a ton of equilibria, and which one is picked will depend on people\u2019s expectations about what other people will do, which are informed about&nbsp;<i>their</i> expectations of other people, etc. If you can anticipate a strategic situation before it arrives and suggest a particular way of handling it, that could change people\u2019s expectations about each other and thereby change the rational course of action.</p><p><strong>Examples of how to attack this problem:</strong></p><ul><li>What will the facts-on-the-ground situation look like? What commitment abilities will people have, and how transparent will they be to other parties?</li><li>Given plausible facts on the ground, what are some plausible norms that would (i) make for a good society if everyone followed them, (ii) that would be good to follow if everyone else followed them, and (iii) that aren\u2019t too brittle if people settle on somewhat different norms?<ul><li>Example of a norm: Never do something&nbsp;<i>specifically</i> because someone else doesn't want it.</li><li>This could draw a lot on looking at current norms around geopolitical conflicts and other areas. To get out of abstract land and think about what people do in practice. (For example, for the norm suggested above, you could ask whether it is compatible with or would condemn sanctions? What about the criminal justice system?)</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Avoiding AI-assisted human coups</strong></h3><p>Advanced AI could enable dangerously high concentrations of power. This could happen via at least two different routes.</p><ul><li>Firstly, a relatively small group of people (e.g. a company or some executives/employees of a company) who develop the technology could rapidly accumulate a lot of technology and cognitive power compared to the rest of the world. If those people decided to launch a coup against a national government, they may have a good chance of succeeding.<ul><li>The obvious solution to that problem is for the government and other key stakeholders to have significant oversight over the company\u2019s operations. Up to and including nationalizing frontier labs.</li></ul></li><li>The&nbsp;<i>second</i> problem is that AI might lead power&nbsp;<i>within</i> institutions to be more concentrated in the hands of a few people.<ul><li>Today, institutions are often coordinated via chain-of-command systems where humans are expected to obey other humans. But&nbsp;<i>hard</i> power is ultimately distributed between a large number of individual humans.<ul><li>As a consequence: If a leader tries to use their power to launch a coup, their subordinates are capable of noticing the extraordinary circumstances they find themselves in, and use their own judgment about whether to obey orders or not. So Alice can\u2019t necessarily count on Bob\u2019s support in a coup, even if Bob is Alice\u2019s subordinate.</li></ul></li><li>But with AI, it will be technically possible to construct institutions where hard power is controlled by AIs, who could be trained to obey certain humans\u2019 orders without question. And even if those AIs were&nbsp;<i>also&nbsp;</i>programmed to follow certain laws and standards, a conflict between laws/standards and the orders of their human overseers might lead to behavior that is out-of-distribution and unpredictable (rather than the laws/standards overriding the humans\u2019 orders).</li><li>To solve this problem: We\u2019d want people to make conscious decisions about what the AIs should do when all the normal sources of authority disagree and explicitly train the AIs for the right behavior in those circumstances. Also, we\u2019d want them to institute controls to prevent a small number of individuals from unilaterally retraining the AIs.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Examples of how to attack this:</strong></p><ul><li>Spell out criteria (e.g. certain evaluations) for when AI is becoming powerful enough that it needs strong government oversight. Describe what this oversight would need to look like.</li><li>Outline a long list of cases where it might be ambiguous what highly capable AI systems should do (when different sources of authority disagree). Spell out criteria for when AIs have enough power that the relevant lab/government should have taken a position on all those cases (and trained the AI to behave appropriately).</li><li>Advocate for labs to set up strict internal access controls to weights, as well as access controls and review of the code used to train large language models. This is to prevent a small group of lab employees from modifying the training of powerful AIs to make the AI loyal to them in particular.</li><li>Get similar assurances in place for AIs used in government, military, and law enforcement. This could include giving auditing privileges to opposition parties, international allies, etc.</li><li>Spell out technical competencies that auditors (either dedicated organizations or stakeholders like opposition parties and other governments) would need to properly verify what they were being told. Publicly explain this and advocate for those actors to develop those technical competencies.</li><li>There\u2019s significant overlap between solutions to this problem and the proposal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338209/develop-technical-proposals-for-how-to-train-models-in-a-transparently-trustworthy-way-ml-governance\">Develop technical proposals for how to train models in a transparently trustworthy way</a> from the \u201cEpistemics\u201d post in this series.</li></ul><p>(Thanks to Carl Shulman for discussion.)</p><h3><strong>Governance issues raised by digital minds</strong></h3><p>There are a lot of governance issues raised by the possibility of digital minds. For example, what sort of reform is needed in one-person-one-vote democracies when creating new persons is as easy as copying software? See also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338243/develop-candidate-regulation-governance-forecasting\">Develop candidate regulation</a> from the \u201cDigital Sentience &amp; Rights\u201d post in this series.</p><h2><strong>Norms/proposals for how to navigate an intelligence explosion [Governance] [Forecasting] [Philosophical/conceptual]</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://lukasfinnveden.substack.com/i/140338085/painting-a-picture-of-a-great-outcome-forecasting-philosophicalconceptual-governance\">Painting a picture of a great outcome</a> suggested outlining an acceptable \u201cendpoint\u201d to explosive growth.</p><p>Separately, there\u2019s a question of what the appropriate norms are for how we get from where we are today to that situation.</p><p>Other than risks from misaligned AI along the way, I think the 3 central points here are:</p><ul><li>If one actor pushes ahead with an intelligence explosion, they might get a massive power advantage over the rest of the world. That creates a big risk for everyone else, who might find themselves powerless. Instead of going through with a massive gamble like that, could we set up agreements or norms that make it more likely that&nbsp;<i>everyone</i> has some say in the future?</li><li>A maximum-speed intelligence explosion will lead to&nbsp;<i>a lot</i> of changes and&nbsp;<i>a lot</i> of new technology really, really fast. That\u2019s a core part of what\u2019s scary, here. Could we somehow coordinate to go slower?</li><li>Good post-intelligence-explosion worlds will (at least eventually) look quite different from our world, and that includes governance &amp; politics looking quite different. For example:<ul><li>There will be more focus on deciding what sorts of crazy technology can be used in what ways.</li><li>There will be less need to focus on economic growth to meet the material needs of currently existing people.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflyadyipqa5k\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlyadyipqa5k\">[4]</a></sup></span></li><li>There will be massive necessary changes associated with going from purely biological citizens to also having digital minds with political rights.</li><li>There may be changes in what form of government is naturally favored. Worryingly, perhaps away from favoring democracy,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8lmnjgw64dm\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8lmnjgw64dm\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which could return us to autocratic forms of rule (which are more historically typical) unless we make special efforts to preserve democracy.</li><li>There will be strong incentives to hand over various parts of politics to more effective AI systems. (Drafting proposals, negotiating, persuading people about your point of view, etc.)</li></ul></li><li>It would be nice to get a head start on making this governance transition happen smoothly and deliberately.</li></ul><p>What follows are some candidate norms and proposals. Each of them could be:</p><ul><li>Sketched out in much greater detail.</li><li>Evaluated for how plausible it is to form a credible norm around it.</li><li>Evaluated for whether such a norm would be good or bad.</li><li>Evaluated for whether partial movement in that direction would be good or bad. (So that we don\u2019t propose norms that backfire if they get less than complete support.)</li><li>Advocated for.</li></ul><p>(For ideas in this section, I\u2019ve especially benefitted from discussion with Carl Shulman, Will MacAskill, Nick Beckstead, Ajeya Cotra, Daniel Kokotajlo, and Joe Carlsmith.)</p><p><strong>No \u201cfirst strike\u201d intelligence explosion</strong></p><p>One candidate norm could be: \u201cIt\u2019s a grave violation of international norms for a company or a nation to unilaterally start an intelligence explosion because this has a high likelihood of effectively disempowering all other nations. A nation can only start an intelligence explosion if some other company or nation has already started an intelligence explosion of their own or if they have agreement from a majority of other nations that this is in everyone\u2019s best interest.\u201d (Perhaps because they have adequate preparations for reassuring other countries that they won\u2019t be disempowered. Or perhaps because the alternative would be to wait for an even less responsible intelligence explosion from some other country.)</p><p><strong>Never go faster than X?</strong></p><p>The above proposal was roughly: Only step through an intelligence explosion if you have agreements from other nations about how to do it.</p><p>A more opinionated and concrete proposal is: Collectively, as a world, we should probably never grow GDP or innovate technology faster than a certain maximum rate. Perhaps something like: Technological and economic growth should be no more than 5x faster than 2023 levels.</p><p><strong>Concrete decision-making proposals</strong></p><p>A proposal that would be more opinionated in some ways, and less opinionated in other ways, would be: At some level of AI capabilities, you\u2019re supposed to call for a grand constitutional convention to decide how to navigate the rest of the intelligence explosion, and what to do afterward.</p><p>You could make suggestions about this constitutional convention, e.g.:</p><ul><li>The first round will last for a year.</li><li>There will be 1000 people participating, sampled from nations in proportion to their population.&nbsp;</li><li>People will use approval voting.</li><li>etc.</li></ul><p>The \u201cconstitutional convention\u201d proposal resembles something like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberative_democracy\">deliberative democracy</a> insofar as the selected people are randomly chosen, and looks more like typical geopolitical deliberations insofar as nations\u2019 governments decide which representatives to send.&nbsp;</p><p>(Thanks to Will MacAskill for discussion.)</p><p><strong>Technical proposals for slowing down / coordinating</strong></p><p>In order to be especially effective, all 3 above proposals require credible technical proposals for how nations could verify that they were all collectively slowing down. Exactly how such proposals should work is a big open problem. Which, thankfully, some people are working on.</p><p>I don\u2019t know any detailed list of open questions here. (And I\u2019d be interested if anyone had such a list!) But some places to look are:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11341\">Shavit (2023)</a> is an important paper that brings up some open problems.</li><li>Lennart Heim\u2019s list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://heim.xyz/resources/\">resources</a> for compute governance.</li></ul><p>Naming some other candidate directions:</p><ul><li>Research how to design computer chips and rules for computer chips that cleanly distinguish chips that can and can\u2019t be used for AI training. So that restrictions on AI chips can be implemented with minimal consequences for other applications.</li><li>Proposing schemes for how competitors (like the US &amp; China) could set up sufficiently intense monitoring of each other to be confident that there\u2019s no illicit AI research happening.<ul><li>C.f. historical success at spying for detecting large operations.</li></ul></li><li>How feasible would it be to do an international \u201cCERN for AI\u201d-type thing?<ul><li>In particular: To what extent could this possibly involve competitors who don\u2019t particularly trust each other? Given risks of leaks and risks of backdoors or data poisoning.</li></ul></li><li>Great proposals here should probably be built around capability evaluations and commitments for what to do at certain capability levels. We can already start to practice this by developing better capability evaluations and proposing standards around them. It seems especially good to develop evaluations for AI speeding up ML R&amp;D.</li></ul><p><strong>Dubiously enforceable promises</strong></p><p>Get nations to make promises early on along the lines of \u201cWe won\u2019t use powerful AI to offensively violate other countries\u2019 national sovereignty. Not militarily, and not by weird circumspect means either (e.g. via superhuman AI persuasion).\u201d Maybe promising other nations a seat at the bargaining table that determines the path of the AI-driven future. Maybe deciding on a default way to distribute future resources and promising that all departures from that will require broad agreement.</p><p>It is, of course, best if such promises are credible and enforceable.</p><p>But I think this would have some value even if it's just something like: The US Congress passes a bill that contains a ton of promises to other nations. And that increases the probability that they'll act according to those promises.</p><p>There\u2019s a lot of potential work to do here in drafting suggested promises that would:</p><ul><li>Be meaningful in extreme scenarios.</li><li>Be plausibly credible in extreme scenarios.</li><li>Could plausibly be passed in a political climate that still has serious doubts about where all this AI stuff will lead.</li></ul><p>(Thanks to Carl Shulman for discussion.)</p><p><strong>Technical proposals for aggregating preferences</strong></p><p>A different direction would be for people to explore technical proposals for effectively aggregating people\u2019s preferences. So that, during an intelligence explosion, it\u2019s more convenient to get more accurate pictures of what different constitutions would recommend. Thereby making it harder to legitimately dismiss such demands.</p><p><strong>Previous work:</strong></p><ul><li>Jan Leike\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aligned.substack.com/p/a-proposal-for-importing-societys-values\">proposal</a> for \u201cBuilding towards Coherent Extrapolated Volition with language models\u201d.</li><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pol.is/home\">Polis</a> platform.

This suggests that our main priority should be to clearly flag all the thorny issues we expect to appear during an intelligence explosion and ask questions about how labs (and possibly other relevant institutions) plan to deal with them.</p><p>This could be favorably combined with offering suggestions for how to address all the issues. But separate from any suggestions, it\u2019s valuable to establish something as a problem that needs&nbsp;<i>some</i> answer so that people can\u2019t easily dismiss any one solution without offering an alternative one.</p><p>Some of these questions might be framed as \u201cWhat should your AI do in situation X?\u201d. Interestingly, even if labs don\u2019t engage with a published list of questions, we can already tell what (stated) position the labs\u2019&nbsp;<i>current</i> AIs have on those questions. They can be presented with dilemmas, the AIs can answer, and the results can be published.</p><p>Having a single big list of questions that must be addressed would also make it easier to notice when certain principles conflict. I.e., situations when you can\u2019t fulfill them both at once and are forced to choose.</p><p><strong>Example of how to attack this:</strong></p><ul><li>Ask yourself: \u201cIf the lab never made an intentional decision about how they or their AIs should handle X \u2014 how worried would you be?\u201d. Write a list with versions of X, starting from the ones that would make you most worried. Also, write a hypothesized solution to it. (Both because solutions are valuable and because this exercise encourages concreteness.)<ul><li>As a starting point for what to write about, you could consider many of the ideas in this series of posts. What will you do if your AI systems have morally relevant preferences? What if they care about politics and deserve political rights? What if you find yourself in a situation where you could unilaterally launch an intelligence explosion? Or where control over your AI systems could enable someone to launch a coup? Etc.</li></ul></li></ul><p>(Thanks to Carl Shulman for this idea and discussion.)</p><h2><strong>End</strong></h2><p>That\u2019s all I have on this topic! As a reminder: it's very incomplete.

Historically, the pace of innovation may have been tightly coupled to world GDP, because population size (i.e. the number of potential innovators) was constrained by the supply of food. In semi-endogenous growth models, this makes super-exponential growth plausible. But recently, growth has outpaced population growth, leading to a slower pace of innovation than our current amount of resources could theoretically support. But AGI would make it easy to convert resources into automated scientists, which could return us to the historical state of affairs.

It is worth noting that most existing surveillance regimes are developed with little external oversight, either in conception, or operationally. They also rarely delegate work to actors with different motives in a decentralized fashion. And they often operate without effective competition. I take these facts to be extremely encouraging: they mean that there is a lot of low-hanging fruit to work with here, obvious levers by which many of the worst abuses of surveillance may be reduced.

Putting some test numbers into FreeTaxUSA's filing software gives outputs consistent with the above calculations. If you live in a state that doesn't tax wages or capital gains<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd71oukbtbej\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd71oukbtbej\">[18]</a></sup></span>, then that's all there is to it.</p><h3>Illinois Examples</h3><p>Illinois imposes a 4.95% flat tax on wages and capital gains and does not allow deductions for charitable donations. This only works out to a negative combined rate if you're in the 0% capital gains bracket. Suppose you're a single filer with $85k of ordinary income and $60k of cash donations.

It runs a bunch of small projects. Representative examples include a text-to-speech podcast of posts from the Effective Altruism Forum, AI Alignment Forum, and LessWrong; prizes for effective altruists, mostly for writing particular blog posts; and fast grants for charities that lost their funding in the wake of the FTX situation. It also incubated High Impact Recruiting, a recruiter that works with effective altruist organizations.</p><p>Rumors have swirled about Nonlinear for quite some time.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhjh2y16m3xc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhjh2y16m3xc\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;On September 6, 2023, Ben Pace wrote <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear\">Sharing Information About Nonlinear</a>, the result of a 100-200 hour investigation into Nonlinear.

To my knowledge, Alice hasn\u2019t made any public statements.</p><p>On December 12, 2023, Kat Woods wrote <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims\">Nonlinear\u2019s Evidence: Debunking False And Misleading Claims</a>. It\u2019s literally novel-length: more than 70,000 words. This response is what I\u2019ll primarily draw on for my summary of the situation.</p><h1>Dramatis Personae</h1><ul><li><strong>Alice</strong>: Alice (a pseudonym) traveled with Nonlinear for a few months, then became their employee for another few months. She was an \u201cincubatee\u201d\u2014that is, she received support from Nonlinear to start her own organization. While employed at Nonlinear, she was asked to commit a felony. Nonlinear raises concerns about Alice\u2019s credibility.</li><li><strong>Ben</strong>: Ben Pace is an employee of Lightcone Infrastructure, which runs (among other things) the group blog LessWrong. Ben wrote the original post Sharing Information About Nonlinear.</li><li><strong>Chloe</strong>: Chloe (a pseudonym) worked for Nonlinear, mostly at the same time as Alice. She worked simultaneously in operations for Nonlinear (e.g. paying their taxes) and as a personal assistant for Kat and Emerson (e.g. cleaning the house).</li><li><strong>Drew</strong>: Drew Spartz is Emerson\u2019s brother and an employee of Nonlinear. He doesn\u2019t have a leadership position.</li><li><strong>Emerson</strong>: Emerson Spartz cofounded Nonlinear and is their primary funder. He earned his money through founding iconic Harry Potter fansite Mugglenet and a number of other viral Internet content sites.</li><li><strong>Kat</strong>: Kat Woods cofounded Nonlinear. She\u2019s the primary author of Nonlinear\u2019s Evidence: Debunking False And Misleading Claims, so I\u2019ll generally be referring to things said in that document as being said by \u201cKat.\u201d</li></ul><h1>Ben\u2019s Credibility</h1><p>Ben made at least three factual errors in Sharing Evidence About Nonlinear. Ben originally messed up the timeline on when Alice started to work for Nonlinear, but corrected it. Still uncorrected is the claim that Chloe left in July; according to Kat, she left in June. Ben stated that Chloe was risking jail time for driving without a license in Puerto Rico. She wasn't, only <a href=\"https://casetext.com/statute/laws-of-puerto-rico/title-nine-highways-and-traffic/chapter-27-vehicle-and-traffic-law-2000/subchapter-ii-requirements-and-procedure-for-issuance-expiration-and-renewal-of-drivers-licenses/5073-illegal-use-of-the-driving-license-and-penalties\">a $50 fine</a>.</p><p>Ben claimed that Nonlinear had had \u201c ~4 remote interns, 1 remote employee, and 2 in-person employees,\u201d not counting Drew, Kat, or Emerson. Kat estimates that Nonlinear had had 21 people work for them. My own factchecking suggests that Nonlinear has had at least twelve to fourteen employees, inclusive of interns and not counting Drew, Kat, or Emerson.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeki3jh2zrdl\"><sup><a href=\"#fneki3jh2zrdl\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;When I spoke to Ben, he said that he believes that Kat is padding her list with short-term contractors and volunteers. In particular, many of the people on <i>my</i> list were unpaid workers who might be best classified as volunteers. I think how many employees Nonlinear has had is dependent on how you define \u201cemployee.\u201d In general, this is enough of a nightmare to figure out that I don\u2019t want to call it for either of them.</p><p>Ben claimed that Alice was the only person to go through Nonlinear\u2019s incubator program. I reached out to Kat and she said that five people went through their incubator program: Alice, <a href=\"https://www.catalyze-impact.org/team\">Alexandra Bos</a>, and three people at High-Impact Recruiting. I think Ben just got this one wrong.</p><p>Several claims strike me as misleading. Ben claimed that \"they were not able to live apart from the family unit.\" However, Alice spent a bunch of time away from Nonlinear: she visited her family for a month and lived in the FTX condos for at least a few weeks. Ben seems to have meant that Alice and Chloe weren\u2019t allowed to live in a different AirBnB paid for by Nonlinear, but the phrasing was ambiguous. Further, it seems misleading to me not to mention that Chloe did a disproportionate share of the chores because it was her job. Although <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20211118030843/https://www.nonlinear.org/operations.html\">cleaning wasn\u2019t included as a duty in the job ad</a>, Kat Woods\u2019s job interview transcripts show it was verbally agreed upon before Chloe was hired.</p><p>Ben Pace has never done investigative journalism before and these mistakes strike me as typical for a first-time investigative journalist.</p><h1>Kat Woods\u2019s Credibility</h1><p>Kat systematically misrepresents Ben and Chloe. She repeatedly uses quotation marks around paraphrased statements.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvm2dcvpdsfb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvm2dcvpdsfb\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In many cases, these paraphrases strip essential nuance or make Ben and Chloe sound like they\u2019re thinking in a much more black-and-white way than they actually are. For example, Kat repeatedly claims to have been accused of abuse\u2014often in quotation marks, as if it\u2019s a direct quotation\u2014when neither Ben nor Chloe publicly accused her of abuse.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefr2t28i132kq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnr2t28i132kq\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>Let\u2019s look at a fairly representative case of Kat\u2019s misrepresentation, chosen for ease of explanation. Kat writes:</p><blockquote><p>If I (Chloe) asked them to fill out paperwork I would expect it was filled out at least reluctantly and plausibly deceptively or adversarially in some way.</p></blockquote><p>While not in quotation marks, this is a direct quote from Sharing Information About Nonlinear. It is prefaced with \u201cFalse, questionable, or misleading claim:\u201d, which generally but not always prefaces direct quotes in Nonlinear\u2019s Evidence. Kat Woods proceeds to explain that Chloe thinks this because she kept trying to get other people to fill out paperwork that was her responsibility.</p><p>However, the quote is different in its full context:</p><blockquote><p>I did not find the time to write much here. For now I\u2019ll simply pass on my impressions.</p><p>I generally got a sense from speaking with many parties that Emerson Spartz and Kat Woods respectively have very adversarial and very lax attitudes toward legalities and bureaucracies, with the former trying to do as little as possible that is asked of him. If I asked them to fill out paperwork I would expect it was filled out at least reluctantly and plausibly deceptively or adversarially in some way. In my current epistemic state, I would be actively concerned about any project in the EA or x-risk ecosystems that relied on Nonlinear doing any accounting or having a reliable legal structure that has had the basics checked.</p><p>Personally, if I were giving Nonlinear funds for any project whatsoever, including for regranting, I\u2019d expect it\u2019s quite plausible (&gt;20%) that they didn\u2019t spend the funds on what they told me, and instead will randomly spend it on some other project. If I had previously funded Nonlinear for any projects, I would be keen to ask Nonlinear for receipts to show whether they spent their funds in accordance with what they said they would.</p></blockquote><p>The \u201cI\u201d is clearly not Chloe, it\u2019s Ben. Ben specifically says that his view was based on talking to many people, not just to Chloe. Kat Woods\u2019s reply is completely unresponsive to anything Ben said.</p><p>The entire post is like this. I strongly recommend reading Nonlinear\u2019s Evidence with Sharing Information About Nonlinear in another tab so that you can cross-check to make sure Ben actually said what Kat said he said.</p><p>Furthermore, Nonlinear\u2019s Evidence could easily have been three-quarters of the length if Kat had stuck to, as it were, Nonlinear\u2019s evidence. Instead, the reader is treated to lengthy digressions about Kat\u2019s metta meditation practice, Kat\u2019s vacation photos, cryptic accusations that Ben has destroyed people\u2019s lives, how Alice and Chloe need to do cognitive behavioral therapy, how Ben has wasted literally millions of dollars by making everyone post about Nonlinear drama instead of doing their jobs, and this charming little poem:</p><blockquote><p>First they came for one EA leader, and I did not speak out --&nbsp;</p><p>because I just wanted to focus on making AI go well.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Then they came for another, and I did not speak out --</p><p>because surely these are just the aftershocks of FTX, it will blow over.</p><p>Then they came for another, and I still did not speak out --</p><p>because I was afraid for my reputation if they came after me.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Then they came for me - and I have no reputation to protect anymore.</p></blockquote><h1>The General Situation</h1><p>The good news, given all these credibility problems, is that Kat and Ben actually <i>agree </i>on the general outlines of what happened. Kat\u2019s primary objection to Sharing Information About Nonlinear is that Ben keeps saying things are bad, but actually they\u2019re good.</p><p>Throughout this section, I\u2019m going to be concentrating on things everyone agreed happened, and avoiding points which are in dispute. However, sometimes Alice or Chloe make a claim that Kat didn\u2019t mention one way or the other, but which I think contributes to the overall picture. I\u2019ve flagged these by saying that Kat \u201cdidn\u2019t dispute\u201d them, but those are more questionable than other statements.</p><p>Many claims and counterclaims were made about whether Alice and Chloe justifiably feared retaliation from Kat. I\u2019m not going to go into this, mostly because I thought about it a lot and wound up with deep philosophical confusion about the concept of \u201cretaliation.\u201d I will flag that Kat outed Alice as having been in a mental hospital, which I consider to be completely beyond the pale as a response to criticism.</p><p>Kat and Emerson are both experienced entrepreneurs. In particular, Emerson (by his own account) has twenty-four years\u2019 experience building organizations. It\u2019s important to keep in mind that these are not understandable mistakes made by inexperienced people in the process of forming their first organization. Both sides agree that Alice and Chloe had relatively little work experience and therefore very little sense of what appropriate professional norms were.</p><h1>Enmeshment</h1><p>Alice and Chloe had very enmeshed relationships with other Nonlinear employees:</p><ul><li>Alice and Chloe both worked for Nonlinear.</li><li>The primary in-person social outlet for both Alice and Chloe was the people they traveled with: Kat, Emerson, and Drew.</li><li>A high percentage of Alice\u2019s and Chloe\u2019s in-person recreational activities were done with some combination of Kat, Emerson, Drew, and people they invited to travel with them.<ul><li>Kat writes: \u201cYou\u2019re surrounded by a mix of uplifting, ambitious entrepreneurs and a steady influx of top people in the AI safety space. In the morning, you go for a swim with one of your heroes in the field. In the evening, a campfire on a tropical beach. Jungle hiking. Adventure. Trying new foods. Surfing. Sing-a-longs. Roadtrips. Mountain biking. Yachting. Ziplining. Hot tub karaoke parties. All with top people in your field.\u201d</li></ul></li><li>Alice and Chloe were close friends with Kat, Emerson, and Drew. They (for example) discussed their feelings, insecurities, and life problems together.</li><li>Kat, Emerson, and Drew acted as mentors for Alice and Chloe in both their work and private lives.</li><li>Drew and Alice dated, but to her credit Kat disapproved.</li></ul><p>I believe that the employee/friend/housemate/mentee combination predictably created ambiguity about which role Alice and Chloe were inhabiting at any given time, which gave Kat and Emerson an inappropriate amount of control over Alice and Chloe\u2019s lives. For example, as a mentor, Kat gave Alice advice about whom to spend time with (see \u201cIsolation\u201d). But, as a housemate, Kat could easily see how Alice spent all her time and thus that Alice wasn\u2019t following her advice. Alice didn\u2019t have access to normal ways to set boundaries with mentors or employers, such as saying \u201cI have plans\u201d and not specifying that your plans are to hang out with random bartenders.</p><p>Another example occurred when Alice told Kat she had money worries. Kat, acting as a mentor and friend, told her that it was anxiety and gave her advice for checking her distorted thoughts. But there\u2019s a conflict of interest if the person providing an outside view on whether you have enough money is also the one paying you. Indeed, Kat was arguably underpaying Alice (see \u201cFinances\u201d).</p><p>Finally, in addition to doing operations for Nonlinear, Chloe worked as Kat's and Emerson's personal assistant, responsible for cleaning, grocery shopping, arranging logistics for trips, and similar. Chloe spent about five to ten hours a week doing housekeeping. Kat and Emerson generally didn't contribute. Chloe\u2019s time was considered less valuable than Kat\u2019s, Emerson\u2019s, or Drew\u2019s. (Kat doesn\u2019t clarify if Alice\u2019s time was also considered less valuable.) Kat wrote that \u201c[Emerson]\u2019s not a friend. He\u2019s her boss. She\u2019s his assistant.\u201d</p><p>Chloe handled all the logistics for an excursion everyone would enjoy while everyone else chatted; Kat thinks this is all right because Chloe was an assistant and it was her job. Emerson refused to drive Chloe to a medical errand when Chloe couldn\u2019t drive; Kat thinks this is all right because Chloe was an assistant so she shouldn\u2019t cost Emerson time. Ben Pace claims that \"if a cofounder spilled food in the kitchen, the employees would clean it up\"; Kat didn't dispute the claim, although she didn't explicitly agree that it happened. I believe that the former two are humiliating ways to treat a friend, and the last is a humiliating way to treat anyone.</p><p>The ambiguity was generally not resolved in Chloe\u2019s favor. As a personal assistant, Chloe worked while other people had fun and couldn\u2019t ask Emerson to do a favor for her. But, as a friend, Chloe was supposed to see time with Kat, Emerson and their friends as a fun job perk and a satisfying social life, not as billable hours.</p><p>To make up for the lower value she placed on Chloe\u2019s (and possibly Alice\u2019s) time, Kat regularly praised them. Alice found the praise insincere and manipulative. Kat says that she\u2019s just a very positive person and seems to believe that praise and positivity can\u2019t be insincere or manipulative.</p><p>Kat was aware of the boundary-related issues. She writes:</p><blockquote><p>Alice/Chloe constantly complained about \u201cunclear boundaries\u201d as if we kept them unclear as part of a nefarious plot. If they wanted clear boundaries, they should have applied to Bureacracy Inc, not to be the first team members of a tiny nomadic startup with a tiny budget.</p></blockquote><h1>Finances</h1><p>Nonlinear said that they always paid their employees on time. However, their own screenshots clearly show that Alice's stipend for April wound up in her bank account in mid-June, and her stipend for May wound up in her bank account in July. The first was sent on time but seems to have been held up in verification; I don\u2019t know to what extent that was Nonlinear\u2019s fault. Kat justifies the second by saying that Alice \u201cwanted space.\u201d</p><p>Alice and Chloe agreed to and weren\u2019t surprised by Nonlinear\u2019s compensation system. Alice and Chloe were paid a $1,000/month stipend, plus room, board, and expenses. Kat verbally said that room, board, and expenses were expected to amount to about $70,000-$75,000 in value.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0vw1odkmpks\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0vw1odkmpks\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Nonlinear paid for \"expensive music festivals, day trips to St. Barths, beach clubs, ziplining, tours, vacation excursions, and basically any activities she wanted to have paid for.\" The villas Alice and Chloe stayed at were extremely nice, as we can see from Kat\u2019s photos.</p><p>Ben writes:</p><blockquote><p>The employees were very unclear on the boundaries of what would and wouldn\u2019t be paid for by Nonlinear. For instance, Alice and Chloe report that they once spent several days driving around Puerto Rico looking for cheaper medical care for one of them before presenting it to senior staff, as they didn\u2019t know whether medical care would be covered, so they wanted to make sure that it was as cheap as possible to increase the chance of senior staff saying yes.</p></blockquote><p>Kat doesn\u2019t say that the boundaries of what would be paid for were clear, but emphasizes the glamorous nature of Nonlinear\u2019s lifestyle.</p><p>Nonlinear didn't agree to cover its employees' medical expenses. Kat framed Emerson paying for Alice\u2019s medical expenses as \"Emerson helping a person he cares about out of his own pocket.\"</p><p>In general, $10,000 in expenses is much less valuable than $10,000 cash. Money is freedom. If you have $10,000 cash, you can save it, or donate it, or give it to a friend or family member, or spend it on hobbies you\u2019re too embarrassed to tell anyone about. If someone is willing to buy you tickets to a music festival, you generally don\u2019t get to go \u201cI\u2019d rather not, can you pay for my next four movie tickets instead?\u201d\u2014much less ask them to give you the money so you can save it for future medical expenses. In general, it seems that Alice and Chloe had relatively little control over how money was spent. For example, Alice and Chloe claim that Nonlinear refused to pay for separate AirBnBs; Kat doesn\u2019t dispute this.</p><p>An appendix to the appendix provides an accounting of the money Nonlinear spent on Alice and Chloe. It seems to be the accounting Kat and Emerson did when Alice and Chloe were complaining about not getting the pay they were promised.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk54e3hurhyq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk54e3hurhyq\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;My friend Manya <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_FfkksJZkLj6y2odJXN9z4kIqmXQgFtQ5HMI-TVrMk0/edit?usp=sharing\">made a spreadsheet</a>.</p><p>The amount of money an organization spends on its employees is <i>always</i> higher than the employee\u2019s compensation package, so describing the amount of money Nonlinear spent on Alice and Chloe as their compensation is misleading. As such, I refer to it as \u201cthe amount of money Nonlinear spent.\u201d However, Kat views all the money Nonlinear spent on Alice and Chloe as part of Alice and Chloe\u2019s compensation.</p><p>Some interesting takeaways:</p><ul><li>It looks like Alice and Chloe were on track to have Nonlinear spend about $70,000-$75,000 on them each year.</li><li>None of the columns add up properly. In particular, the sum of Alice\u2019s individual expenses, the sum of the subtotals, and the total money spent on Alice are three different numbers.<ul><li>No, I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t just add together the subtotals to get the total.</li></ul></li><li>A quarter of the money Nonlinear spent on Chloe<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8vswdspdznx\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8vswdspdznx\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;was in the form of necessities to do her job (flights, car, laptop, phone).<ul><li>In general, if you\u2019re flying for business purposes, your company will pay for your flights and not count that as part of your compensation package.</li><li>It is also reasonably common for fly-in-fly-out jobs to provide vehicles (again, without this being considered part of the compensation package).</li><li>Most companies that require computer work provide their employees work laptops without those laptops being part of the compensation package.<ul><li>However, unlike most companies, Nonlinear didn\u2019t require Chloe to return her laptop.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>A third of the money Nonlinear spent on Chloe was rent.</li><li>Nonlinear includes, as part of the money they spent on Alice, the rent for rooms that Alice wasn\u2019t staying in (because she was visiting family or staying at the FTX condos).<ul><li>While timelines are too unclear for me to do the exact math, Nonlinear likely spent several thousand dollars less on Alice if you exclude the money they spent on rooms she wasn\u2019t staying in.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Kat justifies Chloe\u2019s and Alice\u2019s low cash salary by pointing out that they got to travel a lot. However, the usual practice is that people are paid <i>more</i>, not less, for jobs where they travel a lot. This is because of the numerous downsides of travel. Kat points out several herself in the course of Nonlinear\u2019s Evidence:</p><ul><li>\"Not being able to drive on Caribbean islands is terrible - you\u2019re trapped, no independence.\"</li><li>\"It's really hard to eat vegan in rural Puerto Rico.\"</li><li>\u201cShe\u2019s in the middle of nowhere and who else is she going to date [other than her coworker who is also her boss's brother whom she lives with].\u201d</li></ul><p>While I\u2019m not any sort of lawyer, it seems to me that this pay structure likely violates tax and minimum-wage laws, as well as immigration laws for people working on an H-1B.</p><h1>Isolation</h1><p>Kat believes in the importance of digital nomads remaining socially connected to others. However, Kat and Emerson had a consistent pattern of encouraging Alice and Chloe to spend time with people they considered high value (i.e. effective altruists, especially those working in AI safety) instead of people they considered low-value. To be clear, Kat and Emerson didn't think Alice and Chloe should completely isolate themselves from people who weren\u2019t effective altruists. Kat encouraged Alice and Chloe to call their families regularly. She explicitly supports spending <i>some</i> time with locals. Friends and family who didn't work in AI safety were invited to travel with Nonlinear, although they were lower priority to invite than AI safety people.</p><p>However, the vast majority of Kat\u2019s evidence that she didn't isolate Alice and Chloe is evidence that she didn't isolate Alice and Chloe from <i>effective altruists</i>, particularly \"top\" effective altruists working in AI safety. Alice and Chloe were given lots of access to so-called top effective altruists: there was an average of 7 people living in the house. Nonlinear encouraged networking with FTX people. They traveled with Chloe's boyfriend, whom Kat Woods considered to \"have high potential.\" Inviting people to travel with Nonlinear was framed as \"one of the highest ROI things you can do\u201d\u2014that is, as an important means of bettering the world.</p><p>Kat and Emerson discouraged Alice from visiting her family because her trip overlapped with \"some of the top figures in the field\" coming to visit. (The chatlogs are suggestive that Alice timed her visit around a family emergency, but Kat doesn't explicitly mention this.) Kat also discouraged Alice from spending too much time socializing with locals, saying that she would have higher impact if she spent time with higher-value people.</p><p>It doesn't seem to have occurred to Nonlinear that Alice and Chloe might have been complaining about being isolated from <i>people who aren't effective altruists</i>.</p><h1>The Drug Situation</h1><p>Kat says \u201cthis post is long, so if you read just one illustrative story, read this one.\u201d I agree the story is illustrative.</p><p>Alice was visiting Mexico for personal reasons. Kat asked Alice to buy her Ritalin and Adderall\u2014Schedule II drugs\u2014which you can buy without a prescription in some parts of Mexico, and to carry these drugs across the border. It turns out that, in this part of Mexico, you can\u2019t buy Adderall and Ritalin without a prescription. Alice apologized for being unable to strategize to get a prescription (presumably an illicit prescription), because she was sick. Kat said that she understood and not to worry about it.</p><p><a href=\"https://help.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1160?language=en_US\">It\u2019s in fact not legal to carry scheduled drugs across the border without a prescription</a>, even from countries where it\u2019s legal to buy them without a prescription. <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/960\"><strong>Carrying nonprescription amphetamines across the border is a felony.</strong></a><strong> Kat confessed to asking her employee</strong><i><strong> </strong></i><strong>to commit felony drug smuggling.</strong></p><p>I\u2019m sure that Kat didn\u2019t <i>intend</i> to ask Alice to commit a felony: otherwise, she would never have thought of the screenshots as exculpatory. Many techies in big coastal cities are used to living in a world where amphetamines are basically legal. It doesn\u2019t make intuitive sense to them that the U.S. government thinks of Adderall differently than it thinks of SSRIs or antibiotics. But it does. <a href=\"https://www.ussc.gov/guidelines/2023-guidelines-manual/annotated-2023-chapter-2-d#2d11\">According to the sentencing guidelines, even first-time offenders carrying a small amount of nonprescription amphetamines are sentenced to about a year in prison</a>.</p><p>Then Kat says \"But then Alice just went and got a prescription anyway.\" This is not a very clearly written section, but I <i>think</i> we\u2019re supposed to understand that to mean that Alice lied in order to get a prescription for amphetamines to give to someone else? Which is also a quite serious crime?</p><p>Kat has a justification for committing conspiracy to distribute controlled substances: Alice wasn\u2019t \u201ca sweet, innocent girl\u201d and she regularly smuggled drugs across borders. It seems to me that this is irrelevant to the main point. Even if your employee gives lots of people oral sex, it\u2019s still sexual harassment to ask that your employee give you oral sex. And even if your employee smuggles drugs, it\u2019s still against usual professional standards and the law to ask that your employee smuggle drugs for you.</p><h1>Specific Situations</h1><h2>The Vegan Burger Situation</h2><p>Alice was sick with covid and in complete isolation. She requested a vegan burger from Burger King, but Emerson and Drew refused because they wanted to work in a place with a nicer atmosphere. In spite of being sick herself, Kat went to the local store to get mashed potatoes; this was the only vegan food available at the store that Alice would conceivably want to eat. The chatlogs claim there was other vegan food in the house, such as oatmeal, almonds, tomatoes, or an orange; it's not clear to me why Alice didn't eat that food, and Kat doesn't really address the subject. According to chatlogs, Emerson and Drew ordered Alice a vegan burger the next evening. Alice disputes actually receiving the vegan burger.</p><p>Setting aside whether Alice actually received the veggie burger and why she didn't eat the vegan food that was apparently in the house, it seems that the mashed potatoes and a light breakfast were the only food that Alice had between dinner on December 14 and dinner on December 16.</p><p>Why am I talking about this? Well, for one thing, it\u2019s a genre convention that all callout posts include something absolutely trivial for flavor.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwoc1870778f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwoc1870778f\">[9]</a></sup></span></p><p>But also, because Alice apparently characterized this incident as \u201cI had nothing to eat for two days,\u201d Kat refers to Alice as having \"a delusional disorder.\" It\u2019s true that \u201cI had nothing to eat for two days\u201d isn\u2019t exactly the-truth-the-whole-truth-and-nothing-but-the-truth honesty. And Alice probably wasn\u2019t being understanding enough about how hard it is to get vegan food in rural Puerto Rico. But it is <i>totally normal </i>for pissed off people to mildly exaggerate and to not have much empathy for what other people are going through.</p><p><i>Ben\u2019s</i> post correctly said that Alice \u201cbarely ate for two days.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6wozxjw11sl\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6wozxjw11sl\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><h2>The Driving Situation</h2><p>Nonlinear inexplicably hired Chloe, a person who didn\u2019t know how to drive, for a position that involved regular driving.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxwf6k8zz7br\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxwf6k8zz7br\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Kat, Emerson, and Drew taught Chloe how to drive. Chloe discovered that she couldn\u2019t legally get a license in Puerto Rico, so she drove without a license.</p><p>Kat says that no one really cared if Chloe drove or not, that Chloe wouldn't have been fired for refusing to drive, and that Kat was happy to cover the costs of Ubers or public transit. I\u2019m willing to take her at her word that she didn\u2019t think of herself as pressuring Chloe.</p><p>However, it seems likely that it was an <i>absolute nightmare </i>to do a job that required regular driving without being able to drive. Public transit in rural areas is usually awful. Kat agrees that Ubers have unreliable coverage in Puerto Rico. There is a dispute about how hard it is to get taxis in Puerto Rico; I'm giving the point to Chloe, the person who actually had to book the taxis.</p><p>Kat says early on in Nonlinear\u2019s Evidence that Chloe could have asked people to drive her and no one would have minded. However, when talking about a specific incident in which Chloe asked people to drive her, Kat says, \"She is describing Emerson as a friend who\u2019s refusing to help out, rather than a boss. You can see there\u2019s nowhere in her model that her job is to save Emerson\u2019s time and this would do the opposite.\"</p><p>Chloe claims that she had to come up with cool things for people to do in order to get them to drive her places\u2014even for medically necessary trips. About one such trip, Kat says, \"it was one of the coolest adventures we went on... If you\u2019re into urban adventures / mysterious buildings, this would have been your dream day.\" I don't know why she thinks this is a counterargument to Chloe\u2019s claim.</p><p>In conclusion: while Kat may not have intended to pressure Chloe to drive without a license, in practice Chloe probably didn\u2019t have a realistic alternative to driving. This is Nonlinear\u2019s fault for hiring a person who didn\u2019t know how to drive for a job with mandatory driving.</p><h2>Speculation About Drugs</h2><p>There are contradictory stories about the felony drug smuggling incident. Kat claims that she only asked Alice to bring medication from a pharmacy. Ben says, however, that Alice was asked to bring multiple drugs, \u201csome recreational, some for productivity.\u201d</p><p>Furthermore, Kat may have asked her employees to do other drug crimes. She also doesn\u2019t deny Chloe\u2019s claim that she was asked to buy Kat weed:</p><blockquote><p>One of my tasks was to buy weed for Kat, in countries where weed is illegal. When I kept not doing it and saying that it was because I didn\u2019t know how to buy weed, Kat wanted to sit me down and teach me how to do it. I refused and asked if I could just not do it. She kept insisting that I\u2019m saying that because I\u2019m being silly and worry too much and that buying weed is really easy, everybody does it. I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it and insisted on not doing this task. She said we should talk about it when I\u2019m feeling less emotional about it. We never got to that discussion because in the next meeting I had with her I quit my job.</p></blockquote><p>I think that the case that these incidents happened is weaker than the case that the request to smuggle amphetamines happened, because Kat didn\u2019t admit to them. But I think it\u2019s fairly likely that Kat also asked her employees to get her recreational drugs.</p><h2>Alice\u2019s Credibility</h2><p>According to Kat, Alice has:</p><ul><li>Committed a crime against Nonlinear employees.</li><li>Done three instances of \u201c[___] involving police\u201d.</li><li>Claimed to have worked for an organization for almost a year when that organization had never heard of her.</li><li>Accused 28 people (outside of Nonlinear) of \"oppressing/persecuting/abusing\" her.</li><li>Accused six employers of various crimes, including murder.</li></ul><p>Also that Alice lied on her resume, which is an extremely normal thing to put on a list next to \u201cfalsely accused her employer of committing murder.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5k1q4wti6eh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5k1q4wti6eh\">[12]</a></sup></span></p><p>Kat is <i>so good </i>at not retaliating against people that she hasn\u2019t posted Alice\u2019s name, evidence for what Alice has done, or even what [___] is. Kat thinks she should get a lot of credit for how not-retaliate-y she is.</p><p>That\u2019s <i>absurd</i>.</p><p>If someone is running around the effective altruism movement committing serious crimes, falsely accusing more than thirty people of abuse, and falsely accusing their employer of committing murder, I think you should let people know. I mean, talk about a missing fucking stair.</p><p>Kat seems to believe in some bizarre trade where Alice doesn\u2019t talk about Kat paying her employees in scuba trips, and Kat doesn\u2019t talk about Alice falsely accusing her employers of committing murder. But the effective altruism movement is not the <i>Mafia</i>. We don\u2019t have <i>a code of omerta</i>.</p><p>Of course, one suspects that the reason Kat isn\u2019t coming forward about Alice is <i>not</i> that Kat took her ethics lessons from Vito Corleone. One suspects that Kat isn\u2019t coming forward because she\u2019s, at best, misrepresenting what actually happened and, at worst, just making shit up.</p><p>Kat repeatedly characterizes Alice as \"mentally unwell\" and \"delusional.\u201d Kat might think that she\u2019s being compassionate, because she said that it must be painful to be mentally unwell and that she wants Alice to get therapy. But mentally unwell people can still experience harm. If anything, mentally unwell people are more likely to be manipulated and exploited than mentally healthy people. It\u2019s cruel to assume that someone can\u2019t accurately report their experiences just because they have a severe mental illness\u2014and it\u2019s irrational to reach for an ad hominem attack to bolster your weak case for what you believe.</p><p>Kat goes beyond using Alice\u2019s mental health history as an attack to offhandedly out Alice as having been in a mental hospital. As someone who has written publicly about my experiences in a mental hospital, I\u2026 honestly do not have words for how much this crosses the line.</p><p>Kat says:</p><blockquote><p>Acknowledging the elephant in the room: some people advised us \u201cit\u2019s important for you to speak out about the elephant in the room, like, the common hypothesis that Ben white knighted too hard for Alice\u201d but we are just not going to go there. If you know Alice\u2019s history here you can guess.</p><p>[Section redacted. Per the advice of others, we\u2019ll leave the pointer, but not going to go into it.]</p></blockquote><p>This passage seems to me like it\u2019s darkly hinting at some kind of sexual impropriety (?) while pretending to be above dark hinting. Either this is a subject of public interest, in which case you should say what you mean; or it\u2019s private information about Alice\u2019s dating (?) life of little relevance to the situation at hand, in which case you shouldn\u2019t salaciously allude to things that only Ben\u2019s and Alice\u2019s personal friends ought to care about.</p><h2>The Saga of Alice\u2019s Incubated Organization</h2><p>Like I said above, Alice was an \u201cincubatee.\u201d In a charity incubation program, the incubating organization provides support to a new charity. This support might include advice and mentoring, seed grants, help with HR or accounting, or a fiscal sponsorship, in which the smaller organization can use the larger organization\u2019s tax-exempt legal status while it works through the process of applying for tax exemptions itself.</p><p>Sharing Information About Nonlinear says the following about Alice\u2019s incubated organization:</p><blockquote><p>Alice joined as the sole person in their incubation program. She moved in with them after meeting Nonlinear at EAG and having a ~4 hour conversation there with Emerson, plus a second Zoom call with Kat. Initially while traveling with them she continued her previous job remotely, but was encouraged to quit and work on an incubated org, and after 2 months she quit her job and started working on projects with Nonlinear\u2026</p><p>As she quit she gave Nonlinear (on their request) full ownership of the organization that she had otherwise finished incubating\u2026<br><br>One of the central reasons Alice says that she stayed on this long was because she was expecting financial independence with the launch of her incubated project that had $100k allocated to it (fundraised from FTX). In her final month there Kat informed her that while she would work quite independently, they would keep the money in the Nonlinear bank account and she would ask for it, meaning she wouldn\u2019t have the financial independence from them that she had been expecting, and learning this was what caused Alice to quit.</p></blockquote><p>Kat disagrees <i>strongly</i> with this view of what was going on. In her view, Alice had only ever worked as a project manager for Nonlinear projects. According to Kat, Alice believing she had an incubated organization is a sign that \u201cshe still sees enemies out to get her. The enemies are nebulous and their motives don\u2019t really make any sense upon close inspection, but definitely they\u2019re trying to control her.\u201d</p><p>However, Kat was giving at best mixed signals:</p><ul><li>Alice was referred to as an \u201cincubatee\u201d on Nonlinear\u2019s website (as well as \u201cproject manager of Idea Market\u201d).</li><li>A comment from Kat says they were \"<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aoZfdTMo9xkLcBNJS/field-specific-le-longterm-entrepreneurship#Z9aenmBBFsn44kHKe\">incubating a promising woman for an as-yet-unspecified charity. Our model will be similar to [Charity Entrepreneurship] but adjusted based on the different needs of longtermism and the lessons I learned from CE\u2019s limiting factors.</a>\"<ul><li>Given timelines, the woman is clearly Alice.</li><li>Charity Entrepreneurship incubatees start their own organizations, they don\u2019t run projects under Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s aegis.</li><li>Charity Entrepreneurship incubatees commonly work on charity ideas that Charity Entrepreneurship thought of, so it\u2019s not unusual that the Productivity Fund was Kat\u2019s idea first.</li></ul></li><li>Alice was given complete control over the $240,000 budget for Productivity Fund as long as it was within scope.</li><li>Nonlinear\u2019s Evidence says \u201cthe plan was she\u2019d soon leave to start her own charity.\u201d</li><li>Nonlinear\u2019s Evidence also says \"We thought [Alice] might spin [the Productivity Fund] out, depending on how it goes, in like, 6 months to 1.5 years maybe.\"</li></ul><p>As <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=cGRxpD6Gocd6j3nxf\">Clara Collier says</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I think this is due to some confusion about how incubation/fiscal sponsorship works. As an example, I run an organization (Asterisk Magazine) which is fiscally sponsored by another organization (Effective Ventures Foundation U.S.). This means that I report to the CEO of EVF, my organization's allocated funding is housed in EVF's bank account, and many of my ops tasks, like accounting and finance, are handled by EVF's staff. However, I have full control over the project I run, and I'm currently in the process of spinning out into a separate organization \u2013&nbsp;at which point the funds I've raised would follow me. In this case, EVF is acting as an incubator to help me get Asterisk off the ground while I build up operational capacity.</p><p>Everything Kat shows here is consistent with Alice running her own incubated organization. It's normal for the head of an incubated organization to report to the CEO of their fiscal sponsor, use their fiscal sponsor's operational resources, and be reimbursed by their fiscal sponsor for expenses. I think that the Whatsapp messages support this interpretation \u2013&nbsp;Kat is telling Alice that she can use the money raised from an outside funder for her organization however she wants, but can't use those funds for other projects (just like I can't use funds allocated for another EVF project to support Asterisk).</p></blockquote><p>I\u2019m not saying that Alice was <i>right</i> that Productivity Fund was her organization. I am saying that if you have hired someone to found their own organization, tell them the plan is for them to found their own organization, give them control of the budget for an organization, act in ways consistent with the organization being incubated in the ordinary way, and tell them that their organization might actually be independent within six months (!?)\u2014</p><p>It is not delusional or paranoid or unstable for that person to conclude that you\u2019re helping them to found their own organization! It kind of seems like you\u2019re doing that!</p><p>In Sharing Information About Nonlinear, Ben mentions Alice expecting a $100,000 grant. Kat only mentions Alice expecting a $240,000 grant from the money Nonlinear had fundraised for the Productivity Fund. I found this confusing so I asked Ben; he explained that FTX had given Nonlinear four $100,000 grants to allocate to their incubated charities. Alice had expected to receive one of those grants as an incubatee. Kat doesn\u2019t address the $100,000 grant or whether it was reasonable for Alice to expect it.</p><h2>The Saga of Emerson Spartz\u2019s Previous Business Life</h2><p>Nothing in this section is directly related to Nonlinear. Ben made some claims about Emerson\u2019s character, which Emerson disputed. (In this section, I\u2019ll be referring to the author of Nonlinear\u2019s Evidence as \u201cEmerson,\u201d because he wrote the relevant sections.)</p><p>There is a tedious debate about how much you can conclude about whether Emerson is a bad boss from the negative reviews of his company Dose on Glassdoor. I don\u2019t think that you can infer that much from the reviews themselves. Emerson denies that Dose \u201ccommissioned\u201d positive reviews. Instead, he says that Dose asked its current employees to review them on Glassdoor (without rewarding them for doing so). Emerson says \"many companies\" do this.</p><p>I talked to several people about whether this is normal. All of them said that they hadn't been asked to do this and several of them called it \"creepy,\u201d \"slimy,\" and \"weird.\"</p><p>The other thing that came up was Adrian Deck. Briefly, a sixteen-year-old named Adrian Deck created the Twitter account OMGFacts. Emerson bought the account from him.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefct07paeeik6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnct07paeeik6\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Deck wound up making only $100, even though Emerson had made over $100,000 of profit (and presumably was intending to make more). Emerson didn\u2019t dispute the numbers, so I presume they\u2019re accurate. Deck sued for more money. Emerson knew that Deck\u2019s dream was to become a YouTuber, so he threatened to get two top YouTubers to create videos slamming Deck. In response, Deck settled in what Emerson characterizes as \u201ca deal he was satisfied with that gave him significant financial freedom.\u201d</p><p>I haven\u2019t dug deeply into this story\u2014I read a few articles, but I\u2019m mostly working off Emerson\u2019s story. And it kind of makes him look like an asshole? Emerson characterized Deck as \u201cgreedy\u201d and \u201clazy\u201d and points out that he didn\u2019t tweet much from OMGFacts after Emerson\u2019s acquisition. (As I understand it, Deck disputes this characterization of events.) But the OMGFacts brand <i>itself </i>was valuable: that\u2019s why Emerson bought it instead of starting a competing YayFacts Twitter account. Emerson probably paid more to the lawyer who negotiated the contract than he did to Deck\u2014the person who created the brand in the first place.</p><p>A California law invalidates any contract with a minor that isn\u2019t overseen by a judge\u2014a crucial protection for child actors, who are often exploited by their parents. Emerson characterizes this law as a \u201cbizarre loophole,\u201d which strikes me as a very cavalier attitude towards children\u2019s labor protections.</p><p>If you\u2019re doing business with a sixteen-year-old, you should make an effort to pay them the fair value of their work. It\u2019s true Emerson is only four years older than Deck, but\u2014by his own accounting\u2014at this point he\u2019d had eight years\u2019 experience building organizations. He\u2019s clearly the more experienced party. He bore a responsibility to be fair, not to cheat the person he\u2019s signing a contract with and call them lazy and greedy for objecting.</p><p>I don\u2019t know that he did anything illegal, but the whole thing seems slimy and skeezy and leaves a bad taste in my mouth.</p><p>This section isn\u2019t very related to Nonlinear. But I think it\u2019s evidence that Emerson is willing to make requests of his employees that go against usual professional norms and to sign unfair contracts with inexperienced people.</p><h2>Could Nonlinear Employ People?</h2><p>Ben claims \"neither [Alice nor Chloe] were legally employed by the non-profit at any point.\" I spoke to him and he clarified that he believes Alice and Chloe were paid under the table, without being formally employed by Nonlinear. Kat says:</p><blockquote><p>This is deeply misleading- it takes a normal, legal startup situation and frames it as a sinister illegal act - as if we were deliberately trying to keep them illegally employed. Nonlinear was not yet incorporated, and this was one of the first tasks Kat assigned to Chloe to handle, as our operations manager/assistant.

I am very confused what the difficulty was.</p><p>When I asked him about this, Ben told me that the problem was related to difficulties sorting out visas: in particular, Chloe would be paid once she got an H-1B visa, which she was expected to do all the application for, both employer-side and employee-side. I believe this to be extremely abnormal. The H-1B process is immensely complicated, and it\u2019s never certain that even the most qualified person will be able to get an H-1B. Even setting aside whether it\u2019s legal to do so, you shouldn\u2019t hire someone assuming that they\u2019ll be able to get an H-1B soon and straighten out the legalities\u2014it\u2019s all too likely they won\u2019t be able to. It\u2019s very strange to hire a person to do both the employer and the employee side of the petition for a visa that she can\u2019t be hired without. However, Ben spoke to me shortly before publishing and I didn\u2019t have time to check with Nonlinear, so take this with a grain of salt. It does provide an alternate explanation for why Chloe at least was employed under the table.</p><p>Weird sidenote: \u201cNonlinear operates as a project of Spartz Philanthropies, a 501(c)(3)&nbsp;registered non-profit in the US\u201d is in fact <a href=\"https://www.nonlinear.org/\">still on Nonlinear\u2019s webpage</a> (<a href=\"https://archive.is/JfPM1\">archive made two hours before publishing</a>).

I have literally no idea why.</p><h1>Takeaways</h1><p>People investigating effective altruist organizations for wrongdoing should be aware that investigative journalism is extremely hard and should be more careful than the default not to make factual errors.</p><p>I don\u2019t think Kat and Emerson are evil, abusive, or culty. I don\u2019t think they should be completely expelled from the effective altruism movement.</p><p>However, I think that they offered inexperienced people deals that those people wouldn\u2019t take if they were more experienced; maintained an enmeshed and boundaryless work environment that would predictably cause harm to their employees; have a lax attitude towards the necessary paperwork to run an organization; asked an employee to commit a felony (probably without knowing it was a felony); outed an employee as having been in a mental hospital, apparently in response to her complaining about Nonlinear\u2019s work environment; and generally show astonishingly bad judgment.</p><p>I think the \u201care Kat and Emerson evil culty abusers?\u201d discourse is a distraction from the main point. For an organization to be considered an effective altruist organization, it\u2019s not enough that the things they do wouldn\u2019t be illegal in a hypothetical libertarian utopia. An effective altruist organization needs to <i>be actively good</i>.</p><p>Much of Kat and Emerson\u2019s effective altruist work focuses on mentoring young effective altruists and incubating organizations. I believe the balance of the evidence\u2014much of it from their own defense of their actions\u2014shows that they are hilariously ill-suited for that job. Grants to Nonlinear to do mentoring or incubation are likely to backfire. Grantmakers should also consider the risk of subsidizing Nonlinear\u2019s mentoring and incubation programs when they give grants to Nonlinear for other programs (e.g. its podcast).</p><p>I would advise inexperienced people to avoid working for Nonlinear; the job may well have pay or working conditions you wouldn\u2019t agree to if you were more experienced. I would also advise people, especially neurodivergent people, to be careful about disclosing sensitive information to Kat and Emerson.</p><p>Further, I believe that we, as the effective altruist movement, should adopt norms such as:</p><ul><li>People should be paid for their work in money and not in ziplining trips.</li><li>A person should not simultaneously be your friend, your housemate, your mentee, an employee of the charity you founded, and the person you pay to clean your house.</li><li>Nonprofits should follow generally accepted accounting principles and file legally required paperwork.</li><li>Employers should not ask their employees to commit felonies unrelated to the job they were hired for.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc69dxo243xd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc69dxo243xd\">[16]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>Kat and Emerson don\u2019t seem to agree with these norms. Until they do, I would advise against allowing them to promote themselves in effective altruist spaces such as Effective Altruism Global, the 80,000 Hours job board, etc.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnhjh2y16m3xc\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefhjh2y16m3xc\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>For example, a friend warned me off from applying to their writing internship.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnthprrooawn8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefthprrooawn8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Both pseudonyms.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fneki3jh2zrdl\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefeki3jh2zrdl\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The method I used to factcheck would allow people to dox Alice and Chloe, so I\u2019m being vague.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnvm2dcvpdsfb\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefvm2dcvpdsfb\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>She put in a disclaimer, which was originally on the last page of a 135-page document.

The same might be expected to become true for mealworms.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Current rearing and slaughter practices</h1><p>Yellow mealworms are the larval instars of a species of darkling beetle,&nbsp;<i>Tenebrio molitor</i>. Larvae go through a number of molts prior to pupation, which can take between a few months to two years depending on nutrition and abiotic conditions. Mealworms take up to 20 days to pupate. After pupating, the emerged adult beetles will mate within 3-5 days. Mealworms are a popular insect to farm for food due to their rapid growth, high nutrient content, and ease of handling. Adults are typically only used for breeding, while large larvae are sold as food and feed.</p><p>Mealworms typically consume decaying grains, but have been reported to eat a wide variety of other foods in certain circumstances (including dead insects, other mealworms, and decaying wood). In farmed conditions, larval mealworms are fed a diet of 70%-85% cereals and other carbohydrates, and may be provided with supplementary protein, fruit, or vegetables. Mealworms are reared in stackable crates, usually with screened bottoms to allow frass (insect excrement) to fall through and not accumulate. Mealworms may be reared in up to 24-hour darkness, as they are photophobic.</p><p>Insects bound for slaughter are collected at around 100 mg. Prior to slaughter, insects are sieved out of the substrate, washed (to remove frass and other waste from the exterior surface of their bodies), and prevented from eating for up to two days (called \u2018fasting\u2019) to clear their digestive systems. Slaughter is typically done by microwaving, baking, air freezing, shredding, or boiling. The method might vary depending on the producers\u2019 need, as it directly impacts final insect meal quality.</p><p>Larvae and adults to be used as breeding stock are typically kept separate from insects raised to be food or feed. The final instar of larval mealworms can last an extended period, so cannibalism of pupae by larger larvae is somewhat common. Producers often rear adult breeding stock in similarly aged cohorts, so that culling of adults after fertility declines can happen simultaneously. This is often done via freezing in air.</p><h1>Welfare concerns</h1><p>The authors outline eleven current concerns and four future concerns for mealworm welfare, and make recommendations on addressing these concerns.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Concern: Inadequate nutrition for larvae and adults</strong></p><p>Larval and adult diets are very homogenous. The prominence of grain-only diets results in higher pre-slaughter mortality and extended developmental time.</p><p><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>Supplement mealworm diets with eggs, soy, or yeast protein (at 20% for larvae and 40% for adults). Provide larvae the opportunity to self-select foods from a heterogeneous mixture.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Concern: Inadequate hydration for larvae</strong></p><p>Since water increases the likelihood of fungal growth, larvae are often raised with minimal access to water. However, the humidity on farms also can be relatively low. This leads to increased mortality and reduced growth of larvae.</p><p><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>Provide larvae with 70%-75% relative humidity, and provide continuous access to water sources that are changed and cleaned regularly. Larvae should have access to water within 5 cm at all times.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Concern: Handling-induced stress during, especially during washing, and fasting, and slaughter</strong></p><p>While some handling is necessary to farm mealworms, handling can cause significant stress to insects, especially since it often needs to be done under bright lights so workers can see what they are doing.</p><p><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>Use red lights when handling mealworms, and reduce the severity and duration of handling during rearing. Eliminate or reduce pre-slaughter washing and fasting, given the low-level of evidence on their efficacy (with currently evaluated substrates). If using fasting, provide inedible burying substrates for larvae during the fasting period.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Concern: Stocking densities leading to injuries, cannibalism, restricted behavior, and other stressors</strong></p><p>While insects are often found at high densities in nature, high stocking density can lead to a variety of issues, like injuries, cannibalism, and restrictions in behavior on farms. Additionally, higher densities can increase disease burden on farms.</p><p><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>Stock mealworms at or below 0.5 larvae/cm<sup>2</sup>, separate larvae and pupae, age-match larvae during rearing, reduce stocking density when nearing pupation, and monitor temperature in crates during high-density periods to ensure it stays below 37 \u00b0C.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Concern: Diseases and parasites</strong></p><p>Diseases, especially those caused by fungi and protists, are common on farms. Parasites, such as mites, also often live on insect bodies. These issues can cause significant welfare issues and increase the rate of pre-slaughter mortality.</p><p><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>Monitor populations for indications of disease, avoid feeding waste to larvae, heat-treat feed prior to introducing it to a farm, follow hygiene recommendations, and explore methods like immune-priming and probiotic use to reduce rates of disease and improve physical health.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6. Concern: Inhumane slaughter and depopulation</strong></p><p>No regulations exist on insect slaughter, and often depopulation (e.g., killing a population due to disease outbreaks) is done by removing insects from farms and letting them die.</p><p><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>Use slaughter and depopulation methods that are more likely to be instantaneous, avoid freezing insects in air (especially as a method of stunning prior to any heat-based slaughter method), and develop and use stunning and anesthesia protocols.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>7. Concern: Poor ventilation during rearing</strong></p><p>Due to rearing taking place in relatively confined quarters or sealed crates, poor ventilation can lead to hypoxia, especially in dark conditions when mealworms produce more gasses, as activity is increased.</p><p><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>Never keep mealworms in sealed crates, and ensure good airflow through crates, especially during periods with low lighting. Provide appropriate light cycling for mealworms to reduce gas outputs.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>8. Concern: Rearing adults on mesh without substrate</strong></p><p>Rearing of adults is often done on steel mesh above substrates, to prevent egg cannibalism. This means that adults cannot do natural behaviors, such as burrowing, which could lead to welfare issues, especially when lights are bright.</p><p><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>Give adults access to oviposition substrates that they can bury themselves completely in.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>9. Concern: Inbreeding leading to poor physical health</strong></p><p>Due to breeding stock being effectively limited over many generations, inbreeding can be common on mealworm farms. This can lead to increased morphological defects, decreased longevity, and reduced stress and disease resistance.</p><p><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>Monitor genetic diversity and introduce new insects to increase genetic diversity of breeding stock.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>10. Concern: Morphological defects from poor developmental conditions</strong></p><p>Up to 4% of adult mealworms on farms have morphological defects from poor developmental conditions, restricting movement, mating, and potentially digestion, and/or leading to early mortality.</p><p><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>Do not store larvae or pupae below 10 \u00b0C, and monitor and humanely slaughter severely deformed adults.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>11. Concern: Inadequate environmental conditions during shipping, rearing, and storage for live-sold mealworms</strong></p><p>Mealworms are shipped live to pet stores and consumers, which can cause significant stress.</p><p><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>Do not ship live insects in poor climate conditions, reduce stress by marking packages \u2018fragile\u2019 and shipping in vibration reducing material, do not refrigerate pupae or older larvae below 10 \u00b0C, provide appropriate nutrition during transport, and provide care instructions to pet store owners and consumers.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Future Concern: Feeding of plastics or polymers to mealworms</strong></p><p>Mealworm larvae are able to be fed some plastics and polymers. However, because these materials are not nutritious, this can lead to higher rates of malnourishment, resulting in mortality and cannibalism.</p><p><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>Avoid feeding mealworm larvae polymers and plastics.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Future Concern: Feeding of mycotoxin contaminated grains to mealworms</strong></p><p>Insect producers are interested in exploring the use of mycotoxin contaminated grain as a low-cost feed for mealworms (since this grain is typically destroyed). Feeding certain mycotoxins to mealworms can lead to increased rates of mortality, decreased growth rates, or behavioral avoidance of feed, especially at early instars.</p><p><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>Avoid feeding mycotoxin contaminated grains to mealworms unless the mycotoxins have been identified to be safe (or to be present at levels known to be safe) for mealworm larvae. Avoid feeding early-instar mealworms any mycotoxin contaminated grains.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Future Concern: Genetic modification and selective breeding harming health and welfare</strong></p><p>Genetic modifications and selective breeding are being explored for mealworms, to speed up growth rates and increase body size to improve the efficiency of farming.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>Novel strains of mealworms should be studied for their lifecycle welfare prior to their adoption by industry, and strains with worse welfare outcomes should be avoided. Genetic tools could be further explored to enhance mealworm welfare.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Future Concern: The use of diatomaceous earth for rearing adults harming their physical health.</strong></p><p>Diatomaceous earth has been discussed as a potential insect-rearing substrate to reduce egg cannibalism by adult beetles. It can cause abrasions, dehydration, and mortality.</p><p><strong>Recommendations:&nbsp;</strong>Avoid the use of diatomaceous earth for rearing adult beetles.</p><h1>Directions for future research</h1><p>There are significant evidence gaps on both mealworm sentience (see Coleoptera, in this summary of<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yPDXXxdeK9cgCfLwj/short-research-summary-can-insects-feel-pain-a-review-of-the\"><u> Gibbons et al. 2022</u></a>) and welfare-impacting practices on farms (as described throughout Barrett et al. 2023).&nbsp;</p><p>Future research should focus on addressing the sentience question, and learning more about disease, cannibalism, welfare impacts of larval stocking density, the effects of hormone-induced overgrowth of mealworm physiological health and behavior, and the relationship between feed efficiency and welfare on farms. Larval nutrition is also understudied, and empirical work to understand the best slaughter and depopulation methods is lacking.<br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p><img style=\"width:39.21%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MmLzQJWLapLL2YrZo/g8jg6qxo00o6ekjrm5rj\"></p><p><i>This research is a project of</i><a href=\"http://rethinkpriorities.org/\"><i><u> Rethink Priorities</u></i></a><i>.

And in particular, AI Safety is developing into its own field, and going somewhat mainstream \u2014 so not everyone who gets involved with it will do so through EA. And people who might work in AI safety, or any other particular area, are not necessarily that interested in thinking about cause prioritisation, or philosophical ethics.</p><p>A lot of people just want to keep their heads down and stay focused on pushing forward the particular project they've chosen because they think it's important.</p><p>So it's been on some people's minds what it means for all this to be under one umbrella and whether there's any tension there.</p><p>First I want to say that I don't think there's any tension at all in principle between spending practically all your time head down on a particular project and being really into effective altruism.</p><p>Because pursuing that project could be what you honestly think matters most.</p><p>For example, take orchestrating an effort to secure seed banks to grow food for everyone in case of an agricultural disaster. You might think just working on that is what you can do that matters most because the stakes are high and maybe you're in a great position to contribute.</p><p>And I think that is what's at the heart of EA: trying to pay a lot of attention to what you honestly think matters most.</p><p>I think a lot of the other core values of EA basically stem from this.</p><p>I won't talk about all of these [examples on the slide 3], but I think incessantly asking 'what really matters most here?' has been behind many of the signature values and ideas of effective altruism.</p><p>Take scout mindset \u2013 this is the attempt to stay curious and open minded and to try to really figure out what's true, rather than fight for a particular position.</p><p>The reason people value this, I think, is that they find that when they think about it, they don't think having been right this whole time in whatever argument they've recently been having matters particularly much much compared to actually understanding the world better in ways that allow them to act better within it.</p><p>Or think about unconventional ideas like earning to give: this comes from that noticing that how much good work gets done is what matters most - much more than who exactly makes it happen with their own two hands.</p><p>And being attentive to what matters most also means being realistic about outcomes instead of overly optimistic about what we can get done, since what happens as a result of what we do matters more than what we hoped or intended.</p><p>This means prioritizing \u2013 between causes, interventions, jobs, and projects \u2013 all the way down until it's more trouble than it's worth.</p><p>Because you're not going to be able to do everything, not even everything that's good, not even everything that's important.</p><p>And I think you can tell a similar story about the role of really paying attention to what matters for many other important ideas, like radical empathy, and scope sensitivity.</p><p>But some ways of really trying to pay attention to what matters though look and feel pretty different from one another.</p><p>In particular, some ways look like investing in flexibility, and others look more like what I'm going to call 'dedication'.</p><p>I already mentioned the idea of flexibility and how central it is in effective altruism. Here I'll just add one more illustrative example:</p><p>I think encouraging criticism of EA ideas, as in last year's EA criticisms contest, is partly an investment in flexibility \u2013 ideally it helps us see where we're wrong and change focus and encourages a culture of questioning and holding onto ideas lightly, and being willing to change our minds.</p><p>On the other hand, another really natural thing to do when you're paying close attention to what you think matters most is to zoom in on the area that you think is most pressing, or where you think you can make the biggest difference, and do what you can to push progress forward there.</p><p>I'm going to call this dedication, which I think is an imperfect word for it, because it sounds like a virtue, and I don't think the opposite is exactly a vice.</p><p>But I'm trying to get at the idea of taking steps to get more done efficiently, even if it means making commitments that make you less able to change what you're doing later, or requires a focus on execution within a narrower band of options \u2013 rather than always being open to re-examining your assumptions and the broader strategic situation. This can allow you to bring more focus and ultimately more power to accomplish what you're trying to do.</p><p>For example, building a complex organisation to work on a particular intervention - like this example of securing seed banks in case of an agricultural disaster - might mean dedicating years to a multi-stage plan and hiring a specialised staff, both of which limit your flexibility. But it means you can really build something \u2013 and that you stand a better chance of actually putting this form of global insurance in place at a large scale.</p><p>One thing I want to make clear: dedication doesn't always involve making explicit commitments. It includes specialisation, scaling up initiatives, or just deciding not to open up some questions. Anything that makes it <i>de facto</i> harder to change direction, in exchange for making something happen more powerfully or more efficiently, is an instance of this value.</p><p>So we can see the value of both flexibility and dedication, but they trade off against one another. This happens in all kinds of places.</p><p>Take hiring. In my own case I have to think about whether to hire specialist writers, with a deep background in a subject, or generalist ones, who can dive into a lot of of topics but aren't really experts on anything. Specialists might allow us to produce kinds of work that a team of generalists just can't; but if our plans change, or we lose capacity somewhere else in the team, a generalist will be more able and willing to jump in and fill the gap.</p><p>The tradeoff also comes up in your career. Skilling up in something like management or communications gives you flexibility because they're useful in a lot of contexts. On the other hand, imagine you could know ahead of time that a niche speciality \u2013 say, resilient crop genetics, would end up being crucial in the future. Then getting a PhD in that would plausibly be the most powerful thing you could do to have a positive impact.</p><p>Okay and this one I'm less sure about (but that also means it might be more interesting) \u2013 I suspect that a dedication-flexibility tradeoff is also part of what\u2019s going on with people's unease around deference. Deferring to someone else allows you to form beliefs a lot faster than you could otherwise, so you can get down to the business of execution. Done right it's efficient, and high leverage, but it's a soft form of commitment. If a lot of people are deferring in a group, it makes them less flexible, because they're not equipped to figure out whether we should change things.</p><p>Imagine, as exaggerated example, that only one person in EA ever looked into what the world was like and what we should do, and everyone else just listened to them, and executed on their vision. Their work be very high leverage, and as a group, we'd get a lot done. But we'd have invested very little in developing the ability to notice where we\u2019re going wrong and to do something different.</p><p>Finally, I think we face this trade-off in how much to do effective altruism movement building vs. focusing on building specific fields. EA's emphasis on equipping people to figure out what they think matters most and switch to that makes it an investment in flexibility. And it's really valuable that people in this community will change what they do based on new evidence.</p><p>But building particular fields could be higher leverage and more efficient: not everyone who can contribute is as interested as your average EA is in cause prioritisation, or questioning foundational assumptions; and these things do require time and energy. So cause-specific groups might be able pull in more people and spend more time on execution.</p><p>I said finally just now, but I actually just think this trade-off is at play in a lot of decisions and disagreements - both in EA and in everyday life [examples on slide 8].</p><p>So how can we navigate it?</p><p>I think the first thing to do is just notice it's there. Both flexibility and dedication have value. So if you're finding yourself sacrificing some of one for the other and feeling bad about it \u2013 that might just be OK because it might just be necessary. Others, of course, are having to do the same thing \u2013 and I think seeing people as making this tradeoff differently is one way of making sense of some disagreements.</p><p>Second, probably don't go too extreme in either direction.</p><p>Imagine if we only ever went for flexibility as a community \u2013 we\u2019d learn a lot, and rarely need to backpedal, but we probably wouldn\u2019t get much done in the world, because concrete, on-the-ground projects usually involve some level of investment that can\u2019t easily be converted into something else.</p><p>Flexibility is useful because it allows us to take better opportunities. It\u2019s not useful if we never take any of those opportunities.</p><p>But totally neglecting flexibility is also a mistake, for reasons that are probably familiar to this crowd. The truth is that how to do a lot of good is very non-obvious \u2013 not only is there lots of uncertainty, the landscape also changes with time, so it really matters to be able to adapt.</p><p>We can also make some moves toward dedication \u2013 like doing cause-specific field-building \u2013 while keeping some of the emphasis on flexibility EA has traditionally had. Even if you strategically close some questions for a while, you can still encourage a culture of open-mindedness and celebrate it when people switch to something else when they think it will do more good.</p><p>Third, try to keep track of where you're most uncertain and invest in flexibility there. The less confident you are, the more value there is in flexibility because the more likely it is you will want to change plans as you learn more.</p><p>And you might be happy to be dedicated in some areas and not others. For example, maybe you're pretty confident in the career strategy of becoming a world-class software engineer, so you're happy to just keep building those skills. But you aren't sure where to work to do the most good \u2013 so you might try to develop lots of connections and information flows, to make you more flexible about <i>where</i> you work, even if you're dedicated to <i>what</i> you do.</p><p>Fourth, as a community we can to some extent take a portfolio approach \u2013 having some people pursue high-leverage projects that require dedication, while having others work on helping us stay more flexible by keeping tabs on different fields, comparing ideas for impact, and publicizing great opportunities as they come up.</p><p>Fifth, and this looks like a bit of a win-win (which is sort of suspicious in a context like this) \u2013 having lots of connections with different fields seems helpful for both flexibility and dedication.</p><p>By this I mean being part of multiple communities yourself \u2013 EA but also biosecurity, or AI safety, or the startup community, or the diplomacy community. Or just building relationships across these groups.</p><p>In general, sharing resources and ideas with people with different points of view builds flexibility, for the same reason the EA criticism contest does. It helps you see when and how to change your mind.</p><p>But it also seems helpful for being able to build projects that require specialisation or other forms of dedication \u2013 because much of the specialised knowledge out there exists in these other fields, as do many people who can add their talents to dedicated projects.</p><p>Finally, I think staying attentive to what most matters also pays off here.</p><p>As I said we're at this moment where lots of people are pursuing high-dedication paths in specific cause areas. This is really valuable.</p><p>But I think that continuing to pay a lot of attention to what matters most \u2013 even as you make those kinds of investments \u2013 can be a form of flexibility of its own.</p><p>Because really caring what matters makes you more likely to notice if a time does come along that you do need to unwind and change what you're doing, despite the investments you've made. It makes you more willing to pay high costs of switching when it's important; freeing you up to dedicate yourself your best guess in the meantime.</p><p>Thanks for listening.

This online program is designed to equip participants with the tools and skills needed to identify, compare, and recommend the most effective charities, interventions, and organisations. It is a&nbsp;<strong>full-time (35 hours per week), fully cost-covered program</strong> that will run remotely for 12 weeks.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://form.jotform.com/240013123967348\"><strong><u>[APPLY HERE]</u></strong></a><br><br>Deadline for application: <strong>January 28, 2024</strong>.<br>The program dates are April 15 - July 5, 2024.</p><p>If you are progressing to the last stage of the application process you will receive a final decision by the 15th of March the latest. Please let us know if you need a decision before that date.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>What have we learned from our pilot?</strong></h1><p>The theory of change for the Research Training Program has three outputs: helping train people to switch into impactful research positions, creating intervention reports that influence CE\u2019s decisions of which new organisations to start, and creating evaluations that help organisations have the most impact and funders to make impact maximising decisions. We have outlined what we have learned about each of these aspects below:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Intervention reports</strong>: For eight out of the eleven weeks, the sixteen research fellows have investigated fifteen cause areas, created forty-six shallow reviews, and written twenty-two deep dives, five of which have already been published on the EA forum (find them&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/charity-entrepreneurship-research-training-program-2023\"><u>here</u></a>). Although we are planning some changes to improve the fellows\u2019 experience in the program, we are deeply impressed by these results and look forward to replicating them with a slightly different approach.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>People</strong>: Since the program ended only a couple of weeks ago, it is too early to tell what career switches will happen because of the program. We have some early and very promising results with two research fellows already having made career changes that we consider highly impactful. If you are currently hiring and are interested in people with intervention prioritisation skills applying, please contact us.</li><li><strong>Charity evaluations</strong>: Traditionally, Charity Entrepreneurship has focused most of its research on investigating the potential impact of interventions. We believe that more impact-focused accountability is essential for the sector, and we would like to support the evaluated organisations and funders in making more informed decisions. This is why at the end of the program the research fellows focused on writing charity evaluations in group projects. We were too confident in our timelines and are planning a major restructuring of this part of the program. However, we are happy that three evaluations could be shared directly with the evaluated organisations. We are looking forward to learning from other evaluators in the space.&nbsp;</li></ul><h1><strong>What will the next program look like?</strong></h1><ul><li><strong>Content</strong>: The program will start with a week of providing an overview of the most important research skills. The program's first part will then focus on writing cause area reports in groups in which fellows take a problem and identify the most promising solutions. Afterwards, the fellows investigate those most promising ideas through a shallow review. After conducting a shallow review, research fellows will evaluate the most promising interventions through a deep dive, which will be polished and published, and influence decision-making within Charity Entrepreneurship and beyond. After these reports are published, there will be some time to think about careers and apply to different opportunities, before jumping into some charity evaluations that can influence the decisions of funders as well as strategic decisions within the evaluated organisations themselves.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Learning outcomes</strong>: Most of the program is focused on providing fellows with a skill set of what we consider the most important intervention prioritisation skills to be: mastering theories of change, evidence reviews, cost-effectiveness analyses and decision-making through weighted factor models. In addition to these fundamental skills, we will touch on other skills such as forecasting, moral weights, monitoring and evaluation. Please note that most of our research training will focus on an intervention prioritisation skill set, which means working with secondary resources rather than conducting primary research. We will also spend most of our time prioritising interventions instead of doing cause prioritisation, which would be a more philosophical approach. Instead, we will focus on comparing interventions within rather than across cause areas.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>A typical day on the program</strong>: Depending on your timezone, you could start your day with office hours, where you and your fellow researchers could discuss some challenges you have encountered or some of the new concepts. This is also a great time to ask your advisor questions. After office hours, you could join a Pomodoro session with other participants to work on the day\u2019s project. After a lunch break, you could continue working on your project and maybe end your day with a social check-in with another participant. Every week, there are also all-hands-on-deck meetings and optional social events that you can attend. Most of the program is facilitated in the social platform Gather, which allows us to create more of a community feeling, with this being a remote program.</li></ul><h1><strong>Should you apply to the program?</strong>&nbsp;</h1><p>What the program can offer you:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Stipends</strong> to cover your living costs during, and potentially after, the program (Please reach out if you have dependents or childcare costs to ensure financial constraints don't hinder your participation).</li><li><strong>Resources</strong>: A handbook on \u201cHow to do research for change\u201d and access to our complete researcher's toolkit, including templates, methodologies, and resource access.</li><li><strong>Growing your research portfolio</strong>: A portfolio of published intervention reports and charity evaluations shared with CE charities and other aligned organisations, making them decision-relevant.</li><li><strong>Certification</strong> in Intervention Comparison and Charity Impact Evaluation.</li><li><strong>Community:&nbsp;</strong>Connections<strong>&nbsp;</strong>with established researchers, fellow researchers, the CE team and the wider CE community. Your work will also be directly shared with several of CE\u2019s partner organisations, increasing your visibility for potential future job applications.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Job search and application assistance&nbsp;</strong>to help you land a role in an impact-focused organisation or research field.

Inspired by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://haist.ai/\"><u>HAIST</u></a>\u2019s and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mitalignment.org/\"><u>MAIA</u></a>\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NvzeAtoynxGjDnWkp/announcing-the-harvard-ai-safety-team#Starting_HAIST__Tips___Tricks\"><u>approach</u></a>, we used the in-session-style curriculum of Bluedot\u2019s AGISF.</p><p>We ran an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/rsq98ZnMAjfrYFwtq/p/vGrHhFp4hyDtfsbvh\"><u>intensive</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/rsq98ZnMAjfrYFwtq/p/inpofrDDGJHtJvcyn\"><u>split</u></a> fellowship a week before the Spring semester started. We had 22 applicants, about evenly split between the technical and policy course. The insentive course week was a success, although quite stressful, as we had minimal previous experience and at the time the facilitation questions by HAIST wasn\u2019t yet available (their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://haist-ai.notion.site/Guide-to-HAIST-s-Intro-Fellowship-5bd20d431d744d22b07cd4a2c9ea31cd\"><u>guide</u></a> is super helpful &lt;3) so our mentors had to spend more time preparing, and the fact that the sessions were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/rsq98ZnMAjfrYFwtq/p/vGrHhFp4hyDtfsbvh\"><u>daily</u></a> certainly made things more rushed. We were also having some internal troubles at the time, so I decided to postpone the continuation with the second half. We were going to run the usual weekly course shortly after the semester starts anyway, so I thought people can just join that once they get to week 5 (see some considerations on this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/rsq98ZnMAjfrYFwtq/p/inpofrDDGJHtJvcyn#Crux_A_1__Of_those_finishing_the_1st_4_sessions_of_the_fellowship__how_many_will_continue_and_finish_the_second_half__3_\"><u>here</u></a>). This was a tricky decision as we were risked losing the momentum and the excitement of the people who took part - but I think in the end it turned out fine. Despite overwhelmingly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15zAFJ2oRTJTFTskbe-VInf6atFy3i8uFEeGClQLTCOQ/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>positive feedback</u></a>, most of the people didn\u2019t continue with week 5 of the weekly course once we got there. This seems discouraging, on the other hand, most of those who took the first half seriously are still in our network ie. didn\u2019t just \u201cdisappear\u201d.</p><p>As hinted above, we ran the usually weekly version of AGISF once the semester started. Unfortunately for this round we only had 13 applications, with 10 starting the course and 7 finishing.</p><p>One interpretation of these results is that most people who were interested in the fellowship for this time period did it with the pre-semester group (afterall, our marketing efforts for the two periods targeted the same audience ie. university students), however I\u2019m not quite sure if that\u2019s the explanation. At the time we had very little capacity for marketing properly, and I remember that our paid social media ads that we usually rely on didn\u2019t \u201cget off the ground\u201d either (meaning that the budget we allocated for it wasn\u2019t spent by Meta). I think there might be some diminishing returns on marketing if you ran a fellowship twice per semester, however I still think it is likely worth it. Next time I want to try having two fellowships again, but with proper marketing for both rounds.</p><p>For those interested, I recommend reading \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/rsq98ZnMAjfrYFwtq/p/aoWpk28j3W65mYMgy\"><u>You can run more than one fellowship per semester</u></a>\u201d</p><h2>Retreat</h2><p>We ran an AI Safety retreat at the end of 2023 February for ~20 people, it was great!</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/PDfrbwmhNbFCYmRsQ/swp4ukgduxbkgqwgicqj\"></p><p>Based on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D4cHtW9P3roHQVu00DOeOO2uqLg-R_4lkqih-jIcLMo/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>feedback</u></a> people found it useful, even though on the organizing side it did feel like a bit of a mess, as we didn\u2019t have enough capacity at the time.</p><p>A mistake I made was not thinking carefully enough about the mentors/contributors I want to invite, and leaving it to the very last minute. In the end, we had three more experienced people joining from our local community, who have been upskilling in AIS for 6-12 months, but haven\u2019t had direct research experience at the time. Given that most of our attendees were very new<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to AI Safety (e.g. just finished AGISF) they were more than capable of answering people\u2019s questions. I guess at the time I was sort of operating under the assumption that \u201cthis is an AIS retreat so we need at least one person who has experience in technical research\u201d - which is a reasonable thing to think, however, having someone fly in from outside Hungary would probably not have been worth it, and I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have someone do it.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyq1xiegjvyc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyq1xiegjvyc\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Of course, that\u2019s not to say you shouldn\u2019t have more senior people at your retreats, (especially if they are available locally), as long as you are aware of the counterfactuals of their time.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hackathon</h2><p>We hosted a hackathon with Alignment Jams on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://itch.io/jam/ai-gov\"><u>AI governance</u></a>. We had something like 45&nbsp; people sign up, however much fewer showed up. (I have written&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/f5wxYKFiJwjjRvk4Q/20-tips-tricks-lessons-and-thoughts-on-hosting-hackathons#It_s_kind_of_hard_to_know_how_many_people_will_show_up_on_the_day\"><u>elsewhere</u></a> that it is pretty hard to estimate how many people will show up and what you can try to do about this.)</p><p>Overall we had about 18 unique attendees plus the 5 organizers, with ~14 people committing to a significant extent to the hackathon. One great outcome was that someone learned about AI Safety through the hackathon who I eventually ended up hiring, and we also got to meet someone who connected us with another youth org, which led to further opportunities, such as being able to have a small slot at a future-themed conference called <a href=\"https://brainbar.com/en/event/changemakers-youth-forum\">Brain Bar</a>.</p><h2>Newsletter</h2><p>We launched a monthly newsletter in 2023 October. We try to not spend too much time on these, however, I think having at least an MVP is definitely worth it. If you are organizing a new AIS group and don\u2019t have capacity to write one yourself, feel free to shoot us an email at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:info@aishungary.com\"><u>info@aishungary.com</u></a> - we can share our newsletter drafts with you each month, and you should be able to adjust it for your group with little effort. See a past issue <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qQ8C8TkAEKU_kHyD9dFIKqZ32XvaFsu1dXilXgOkyi8/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a> to get a sense of the content.</p><h1>2023 Summer</h1><h2>Courses</h2><p>We ran a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/inpofrDDGJHtJvcyn/consider-splitting-your-fellowships-into-two-parts-to\"><u>split</u></a> AGISF again, which had 21 applications with about 75% on the technical track. 19 people started and 12 finished part 1, of these people, about 10 finished part 2.</p><h2>Socials</h2><p>During this period I ran quite a few socials (weekly or biweekly depending on the month) with attendees between 5-15 people. I also organized a few just for \u201cexperienced members\u201d ie. people who already know that they want to work on AI safety and are quite worried about it. I think there is value to having those events specifically, but I don\u2019t think overall it\u2019s worth it for us to put a huge amount of organizing time into socials, as long as you have an MVP (the exception being intro socials for people who are about to start AGISF, as those are important and we want to make sure they go well!)</p><h2>EAGxWarsaw</h2><p>We went to EAGxWarsaw, which was great!</p><p>Our community from Hungary brought overall about 28 people, of which counterfactually I think ~24 people wouldn\u2019t have went otherwise. Most of these people came through <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/editPost?postId=JAM3jGioCwYEWjWPb&amp;key=487ffa84b23185fdccd2180d43b4a0\">EA Hungary</a> though, but due to the overlap between the two communities it\u2019s a bit hard to estimate the exact numbers. My best guess is that out of the ~24 people, counterfactually ~8-9 came because of the AIS group, although some found us through EA but now prioritize AIS.</p><h1>General thoughts</h1><p>Below I will write some general thoughts that are somewhere between strategic considerations and lessons to draw based on the past months\u2019 experience.</p><h2>On hackathons</h2><p>Hackathons are great! I have written about our experience in a separate post called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Abg5wRuBZrbkXZBFj/tips-tricks-lessons-and-thoughts-on-hosting-hackathons\"><u>Tips, tricks, lessons and thoughts on hosting hackathons</u></a>, for more strategic considerations, read the section on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Abg5wRuBZrbkXZBFj/tips-tricks-lessons-and-thoughts-on-hosting-hackathons#On_Theory_of_change__ToC__\"><u>ToC</u></a>.</p><h2>On being a non-stem founder</h2><p>I originally had a lot of impostor syndrome over not having a STEM background and still wanting to start an AIS group. I think this was mostly unjustified and I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t stop me from pivoting towards AIS field building. (That\u2019s not so say that some things wouldn\u2019t have been easier have I had a STEM background.) In the past year the governance side of AIS also became more prominent, and I was also in a fortunate enough situation that I could hire some people part-time to lead our courses on both the technical and policy side. Thanks to that I didn\u2019t have to facilitate AGISF for STEM-y people myself and I was able to focus more on operations and strategy.</p><h2>On hastiness</h2><p>To use something of a cliche, my intention was certainly not to \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d, yet due to mixture of being a perfectionist, timelines, and my general worries about AI Safety, I really wanted to jumpstart and then grow our AIS group quickly. Because of that, I ended with something like \u201cmove fast and have overly ambitious goals that will strain yourself and your team, likely reducing your group\u2019s long-term output\u201d. Lessons learned!</p><p><i>The rest of this section were mostly copied from the </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/editPost?postId=JAM3jGioCwYEWjWPb&amp;key=487ffa84b23185fdccd2180d43b4a0\"><i>EA Hungary </i></a><i>review and slightly adapted for the AIS group.

We also found that on average, people who sign up for the AIS course are more academically inclined - which is similar to what I have read and heard from other organizers.</p><p>That said, marketing is still a bottleneck for us, and we want to improve our reach. We currently rely on social media ads, and word of mouth as well as trying to share the program in Facebook groups for university students.&nbsp;</p><p>We also found that on average, people who sign up for the AIS course are more academically inclined - which is similar to what I have read and heard from other organizers.</p><h2>On measuring impact</h2><p>This report is mainly focused on describing the type of programs we ran, how we ran them, and some strategic considerations behind them. These are all instrumental to what we ultimately want to achieve, which is more talented and thoughtful people contributing to AI Safety. I try to keep track if someone is doing something awesome in our group e.g. we had a person get into SERI MATS, and another one to AIS camp., as well as a couple of people significantly changing their career trajectory.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefauxd651n8k\"><sup><a href=\"#fnauxd651n8k\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><h2>On socials</h2><p>Over the 6 months, we have run quite a few social events, with varying success. Overall I have updated away from priorizing socials. I think they are great and should happen, but I\u2019m now hoping to have them run by volunteers or happen more organically, as opposed to putting serious effort into organizing them by our staff. We will still organize at least one social per intro course, as well as have at least one MVP-type meetup per month though, so there is something to turn up to for people who are currently not enrolled in our courses.</p><p>Next steps</p><p>Our original strategy for the 2023 Fall Semester can be read&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPjp8EEQBNRR9nLf8r7rc6jzLiAFlsRmc_WEnjL5Gkk/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>here</u></a>. Since then we have somewhat updated on these plans, I will soon share that in our upcoming interim report.</p><h1>Concluding thoughts</h1><p>Overall I\u2019m pretty excited about going forward and also feel that doing CB for AIS allowed me to do a lot of \u201clearning by doing\u201d. I\u2019m also pretty excited cause area-specific community building, as at least in our case the courses attracted a lof of cool people, many of whom likely wouldn\u2019t have applied to our EA course. That\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t think EA CB is not important. Not to mention that the people who took our AIS course seriously also tend to be pretty sympathetic toward EA principles.

I\u2019ve found this to be challenging because:</p><ol><li>There\u2019s always so much to do that I don\u2019t know where to start</li><li>It feels like there\u2019s so much that I want to accomplish, so that actually putting it into a plan is intimidating</li><li>I am a victim of imposter syndrome and don\u2019t feel qualified to be some ambitious</li><li>Planning doesn\u2019t feel urgent \u2013 getting things done does. But, if you just get things done without planning, you end up getting a lot less of what you actually need to do done.</li><li>It requires a level of clarity about what I want to accomplish. Thankfully, I\u2019ve spent a lot of 2023 working on that, with the help of some great coaches!</li></ol><p>Although it\u2019s challenging, I know it\u2019s probably the single most important thing I can do to help increase my organizational impact. By adding in these planning periods, I\u2019m expecting the following benefits, which, to me, more than justify the effort. The benefits include:</p><ol><li><strong>Growing my organizational impact</strong>. When I take the time to strategize and set goals, I\u2019m looking at things from a hugely different perspective than when I\u2019m an operator and doing tasks. Taking a step back enables me to create a goal with milestones along the way to make sure I\u2019m guiding myself properly throughout the rest of my worktime.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Decrease stress by creating realistic expectations for myself.</strong> When I have a plan, I\u2019m really good at sticking to it. But if I don\u2019t have a solid plan, I always feel like I\u2019m not doing enough, and that creates a lot of unnecessary stress.</li><li><strong>Keeping myself focused</strong>. I tend to have lots of ideas (I call this shiny object syndrome), but they can often take away from my organizational mission. I don\u2019t want to be distracted easily.</li></ol><p>So, I developed a \u201cplanning plan\u201d for myself based on my experience working with others and seeing what works for different organizations. I thought I\u2019d share it with you, as it seems to be a commonly useful technique for keeping organizations on-track and successful.</p><p>Before you start creating your own organizational \u201cplanning plan,\u201d you do need to have a few things in place:</p><ul><li><strong>Direction and Mission&nbsp;</strong>- what are you planning to accomplish? You can\u2019t get anywhere if you don\u2019t know what your destination is.</li><li><strong>A working theory of change</strong> \u2013 how do you propose your organization will go about achieving its mission? You need to be very clear what your value proposition is, both for yourself and the people you interact with.</li><li><strong>OKRs</strong>: Objectives and key results define what exactly your organization is seeking to accomplish. Most organizations end up with an average of five. Much more than that, and you\u2019ll be trying to do too many things and end up unsuccessful in many. Less than that, and you\u2019re probably not being as impactful as you can.</li><li><strong>KPIs</strong>: Key performance indicators are predefined and measurable and serve as an objective metric for your organizational performance.</li></ul><p>If you don\u2019t have these yet, you\u2019ll need to develop them in your annual planning period so that the rest of your year will have maximized success.</p><p>There\u2019s a general structure for organizational planning that I find works pretty much universally. However, although most of the organizations I work with implement planning periods, they all look quite different. You, your organization, and your employees are unique, and you\u2019ll need to use your discretion with how you implement the planning structure. This structure can be used for employee performance reviews as well as operational management.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Planning Periods Schedule</strong></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#5B9BD5;border-color:white;padding:0in 5.4pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Frequency</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#5B9BD5;border-bottom:1.0pt solid white;border-top:1.0pt solid white;padding:0in 5.4pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Objective</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#5B9BD5;border-bottom:1.0pt solid white;border-top:1.0pt solid white;padding:0in 5.4pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Benefits</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#5B9BD5;border-bottom:1.0pt solid white;border-top:1.0pt solid white;padding:0in 5.4pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Level of Detail</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#5B9BD5;border-color:white;padding:0in 5.4pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Level of Strategy</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#5B9BD5;border-color:white;padding:0in 5.4pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Annually</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#BDD6EE;border-bottom:1.0pt solid white;border-right:1.0pt solid white;padding:0in 5.4pt;vertical-align:top\">Revise organizational theory of change, establish OKRs and develop KPIs, break down goals into quarters.</td><td style=\"background-color:#BDD6EE;border-bottom:1.0pt solid white;border-right:1.0pt solid white;padding:0in 5.4pt;vertical-align:top\">Sets a clear, strategic, and actionable direction for the year.&nbsp;</td><td style=\"background-color:#BDD6EE;border-bottom:1.0pt solid white;border-right:1.0pt solid white;padding:0in 5.4pt;vertical-align:top\">Low</td><td style=\"background-color:#BDD6EE;border-bottom:1.0pt solid white;border-right:1.0pt solid white;padding:0in 5.4pt;vertical-align:top\">High</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#5B9BD5;border-color:white;padding:0in 5.4pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Quarterly</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#DEEAF6;border-bottom:1.0pt solid white;border-right:1.0pt solid white;padding:0in 5.4pt;vertical-align:top\">Review and modify OKRs as needed;

Immediately prior, I had been identified as the best match for someone in need of a bone marrow transplant, likely with leukemia, lymphoma, or similar condition. Although the first attempt to collect my blood stem cells failed, my experience was overwhelmingly positive as well as fulfilling on a personal level. The foundation running the donation took pains to make it as convenient as possible\u2014and free, other than my time.

The commenter was speculating about the differences between bone marrow donation and kidney donation<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq4lr0vtny9m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq4lr0vtny9m\">[3]</a></sup></span>. I\u2019m typically a lurker, but I figured this is a case where I actually <i>do </i>have something to say<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe2poqeehzwp\"><sup><a href=\"#fne2poqeehzwp\">[4]</a></sup></span>. According to demost_, fewer than 1% of those on the bone marrow registry get matched, so my experience is relatively rare. I checked and couldn\u2019t find any other forum posts about being a blood stem cell or bone marrow donor. I hope to shine a light on what the experience is like as a donor. I know EAs are supposed to be motivated by cold, hard facts and rationality and so this post may stick out since it\u2019s recounting a personal experience<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftvkyvgs89xs\"><sup><a href=\"#fntvkyvgs89xs\">[5]</a></sup></span>. Nevertheless, given how close-to-home matters of health are, I figured this could be useful for those considering joining the registry or donating.</p><h1>My Donation Experience</h1><p>I joined the registry toward the end of my college years. I don\u2019t recall the exact details, but I\u2019ve pieced together the timeline from my email archives. Be The Match&nbsp;got my cheek swab sample in December 2019 and I officially joined the registry in January 2020. If you\u2019re a university student (at least in America<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa78dbsv0q7\"><sup><a href=\"#fna78dbsv0q7\">[6]</a></sup></span>), there\u2019s a good chance that at some point there will be a table in your commons or quad where volunteers will be offering cheek swabs to join the bone marrow donor registry. The whole process takes a few minutes and I\u2019d encourage everyone to at least join the registry if they can.</p><p>Mid-December 2020, I was matched and started the donation process. For the sake of privacy, they don\u2019t tell you anything about the recipient at that point beyond the vaguest possible demographic info. I think they told me the gender and an age range, but nothing besides. demost_ supposed that would-be donors should be more moved to donate bone marrow than kidneys since there\u2019s a particular, identifiable person in need (and marrow is much more difficult to match, so you\u2019re less replaceable as a donor). I can personally attest to this. Even though I didn\u2019t know much about the recipient at all, I felt an extreme moral obligation to see the process through. I knew that my choice to donate could make a massive difference to this person. I imagined how I would feel if it were a friend or loved one in need or even myself. The minor inconveniences of donating felt doubly minor next to the weight of someone\u2019s life.</p><p>As a college student, I had a fluid schedule. I was also fortunate that my distributed systems professor was happy to let me defer an exam scheduled for the donation date. To their credit, Be The Match offered not only to compensate any costs associated with the donation, but also to replace any wages missed on account of the donation. I didn\u2019t need to take them up on the latter offer, so I can\u2019t elaborate on it. Overall, I found the Be The Match staff I worked with to be very caring and professional. I greatly admire the work they do and appreciate their support in my particular case. The same applies for the staff and professionals at the South Texas Blood &amp; Tissue Center and the John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack Meridian.</p><h2>Preliminary Steps</h2><p>I\u2019ll be honest, this was happening mid-pandemic, so my memory of all the logistical minutiae is a bit hazy. If you\u2019re curious about something I gloss over, I can reach out to one of the folks at Be The Match and ask. I recall that I had a few phone calls with a nurse to inform me about the process and to go over my medical history. They sent me to a clinic near my apartment a couple of times to get a physical, get a urine sample, and have my blood drawn to confirm that I was indeed the best match available. (Edit: in discussing this with a colleague, I remembered that I passed out during the blood draw. I think this was just because the clinic staff had my sitting upright at the time.) All of this was paid for ahead of time by Be The Match.</p><h2>Work-Up &amp; Donation Attempt 1/2</h2><p>The procedure they wanted me to undergo is called a peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) donation. As I understand it (again, not a medical professional), it\u2019s a safer and easier alternative to bone marrow donation. During bone marrow donation, they put you under general anesthesia and collect bone marrow from the back of your pelvis via surgery, whereas during a PBSC donation, they just draw your blood over several hours<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmlneo8ruki\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmlneo8ruki\">[7]</a></sup></span>, while a machine filters out the stem cells and returns the rest of the blood to your body.</p><p>In the five days leading up to the donation, you\u2019ll need daily injections of filgrastim to increase the amount of stem cells in your blood. I recall the nurse telling me the most common side effect<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefida3tvkzo97\"><sup><a href=\"#fnida3tvkzo97\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;of this is body aches of the kind you get when you have the flu. They once described it to me as \u201cyour bones hurting.\u201d Thankfully this was pretty mild for me. I just felt kind of crappy, but not terrible. I was taking over-the-counter painkillers the whole time, though.</p><p>On the day of my donation (late Feb. 2021), they directed me to the South Texas Blood &amp; Tissue Center in &nbsp;San Antonio, Texas, about an hour\u2019s drive from my university in Austin<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref704v88rxp35\"><sup><a href=\"#fn704v88rxp35\">[9]</a></sup></span>. I showed up bright and early, excited to finish the process and get on with my last semester. Unfortunately, the donation didn\u2019t go according to plan.</p><p>The staff kept trying to get a good blood vessel in my arm, but none quite seemed to work well enough. I was a bit confused about this, since I had donated whole blood several times before without issue. As far as I could tell, the staff were all professionals and there was simply something technical about my anatomy that made it difficult. I could try and recall what they told me, but again, I\u2019m not a medical professional and so I wouldn\u2019t trust myself to recount it accurately. My understanding is that what happened to me was atypical.</p><p>I was told that, unfortunately, the donation couldn\u2019t happen that day, but they could still collect blood stem cells using an alternate procedure. The backup plan was to put a central line into one of the major blood vessels at the top of my leg, near my crotch. It would be more invasive: they would need a doctor to perform the procedure in a proper hospital (as opposed to a donation clinic) and it would involve a local anesthetic. They explained that it was slightly higher risk, but I wanted to see the donation through.</p><h2>Donation Attempt 2/2</h2><p>At this point, Be The Match was scrambling to find a hospital that would be able to take me as soon as possible. I had completed workup, the aforementioned five daily injections, so they couldn\u2019t just reschedule the donation a week or a month later. They ended up finding an opening at a hospital in Hackensack, New Jersey. I flew out that evening from San Antonio around 6 pm and landed in Newark about five hours later.</p><p>Here\u2019s where I really got to see the Be The Match / South Texas Blood staff shine. They had an employee with me the whole time, making sure I was doing okay. They paid for and booked flights, taxis, a hotel, meals, etc. They even offered to have me take a member of my family with me. I really appreciate all the care they took to make sure I felt comfortable, despite the last minute change of plans. The staff I worked with were all kind and supportive. I have absolutely no notes for them<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuqk6ohqgegn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuqk6ohqgegn\">[10]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>I arrived at the hospital the next morning, on February 26 2021. The procedure was to take place at the John Theurer Cancer Center at Hackensack Meridian hospital. After paperwork and another physical, it was time for the doctor to place the central line in my leg. It felt strange going in: the area was anesthetized, so there was no pain, but I did feel some pressure as though someone was poking me hard on my thigh. From there, everything went smoothly. I just had to sit and wait around for a few hours while the machine worked its magic. It was surreal watching the bag fill up with my blood stem cells. For some reason,&nbsp;I distinctly remember it being salmon-colored.</p><p>And that was pretty much it. I stayed at the hospital all day, but went to bed in the hotel and remained in New Jersey for a couple of days. I had to be careful not to reopen the incision in my leg. It eventually<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5s4besvbygt\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5s4besvbygt\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;healed and I was back to my normal self. The nurse phoned me periodically to check in on my recovery until about 2 months later (I was back to normal well before then, IIRC). Thankfully, I\u2019ve had no long term side effects from the medication or the donation procedure. According to Be The Match, the median recovery time for PBSC donation is 7 days<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefawrvd8faetn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnawrvd8faetn\">[12]</a></sup></span>.</p><h1>Closing Thoughts</h1><p>If you take anything away from this post, please let it be that you should join the bone marrow donor registry and encourage others to do the same. It takes a matter of minutes and could make a world of difference to someone.&nbsp;According to Be The Match, only 29-79% of patients are able to find a match among the paltry 41 million people on worldwide registries<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref69xb94lm1od\"><sup><a href=\"#fn69xb94lm1od\">[13]</a></sup></span>.

Although to be clear, donating blood stem cells is a far less costly signal than kidney donation. I also think PBSC donation stacks up favorably against GiveWell in terms of cost per QALY gained from the donor perspective, but I\u2019m not terribly confident in my math (I can share if there\u2019s interest). Or maybe just follow common sense morality here and if there\u2019s a person that <i>you and only you</i>&nbsp;can save, then just do it.

The views expressed herein are not necessarily endorsed by Open Philanthropy.</p><h2>Editorial note</h2><p>The report evaluates the value and effectiveness of the United States' Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program, which was initiated in 2007 to incentivize research and development for medical products targeting neglected tropical diseases. (While PRVs have since been legislated for purposes, we focus our attention on this application.) Specifically, we describe some of the program's history to date (e.g., past issuances, voucher sales/use dynamics, and evidence of gaming), the usage extent of PRV-awarded medical products, academic and anecdotal evidence of the program's incentive effect, and ways in which we think the program could be improved.</p><p>We have tried to flag major sources of uncertainty in the report and are open to revising our views as more information becomes available. While preparing this report for publication, we learned that Valneva was awarded a PRV for developing the first Chikungunya vaccine in November 2023 (Dunleavy, 2023), but we did not incorporate this information in the report or associated spreadsheets.</p><p>We are grateful for the invaluable input of our interviewees. Please note that our interviewees spoke with us in a personal capacity and not on behalf of their respective organizations.</p><h2>Executive summary</h2><p>We catalog <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/priority-review-vouchers#prv-issuances-and-extent-of-use-8\">information about the 13 issuances of Priority Review Vouchers</a> (PRV) under the United States\u2019 Tropical Disease PRV Program and, for the seven cases with sufficient data, attempt to estimate the number of treatment courses per 1,000 relevant disease cases, or \u201cuse rate.\u201d Among the seven products with use rate estimates, we find three with high use rates (&gt;100 courses per 1,000 cases), two have medium use rates (10-100), and two have low use rates (&lt;10). We also find that while all high-use-rate products have been on the market for &gt;10 years, not all products marketed for that long achieve high use rates, and find diverse outcomes in use-rate trajectories, including sharp discontinuities and both upward and downward trends.</p><p>Given that PRV recipients can either use or sell their voucher, we also explore <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/priority-review-vouchers#distribution-of-prv-%E2%80%9Cwinnings%E2%80%9D-12\">the dynamics of how the PRVs\u2019 value is distributed</a> among different types of players in the industry. We find that PRV sales proceeds go toward repayment for shareholders of small pharmaceutical companies or toward (promises of) further drug development for neglected tropical diseases. Large pharmaceutical companies that receive PRV awards tend to retain or use the voucher for faster FDA review of a profitable drug in their pipelines.</p><p>Additionally, we review four academic studies that attempt to quantify the <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/priority-review-vouchers#incentive-effect-of-prvs-16\">effectiveness of PRVs</a> at inducing medical innovations for neglected tropical diseases. Based on their findings and our assessment of study quality, we think it is unlikely that the TD PRV Program had a large, consistent effect on R&amp;D for tropical diseases, but that the results are potentially consistent with a small marginal effect. Additionally, there is historic anecdotal evidence of \u201cgaming the system\u201d \u2014 seeking a voucher for a drug that has already been developed and marketed outside of the US \u2014 though we think it is unlikely to continue to be an issue going forward given that the opportunities to do so have likely been exhausted.</p><p>We then formulate a <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/priority-review-vouchers#rough-estimate-of-prv-program-value-21\">rough estimate of the value of the TD PRV Program</a> to Open Philanthropy, focusing on a case study of willingness to pay (WTP) for the development of a single drug (pretomanid). While the estimate suggests a value in the tens of millions of US dollars for one drug (implying a WTP in the tens of thousands of dollars), we caution against excessively anchoring on these results given significant uncertainty regarding model structure and inputs.</p><p>Finally, several <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/priority-review-vouchers#room-for-program-improvement-24\">possible improvements</a> to the PRV program emerged from the literature and conversations with experts. These include advocacy to limit the growing supply of PRVs, to require access plans (and proof of follow-through) to earn a PRV, to increase administrative transparency and clarity, and to tie the value of the PRV to the social value of the medical innovation (rather than the voucher). We discuss experts\u2019 critiques of the voucher program as well as opportunities beyond the PRV to incentivize research and development in the field of neglected tropical diseases.</p><p><br><img style=\"width:713.525px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/irrorsmbfqbzwzafrcja\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/elhgszrbxsh4rrxns8qw 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/nolkzv6qa83pgyl8vyra 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/hxkzekws7ihrtpl20wn3 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/hb6wqfrati6tzmapuw1c 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/ytgh8ydyyuctxztijjks 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/qv3yiq8ehw2lbi4lrgxg 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/yubyoabb0p8czpo6dzf3 2500w\"></p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>This report is a project of Rethink Priorities \u2014 a think tank dedicated to informing decisions made by high-impact organizations and funders across various cause areas.

Both are excellent economists; their strengths include thinking about big questions from first principles, as well as a strong commitment to economic growth and freedom.

They also work on state and local level regulation impacting businesses, pointing out restrictive labor regulations to state and local government partners.&nbsp; Their core strategy is to offer actionable research on state regulations, assist state governments with the detailed correction of laws and regulations, and also channels the findings to the Union government. And they also have an excellent team with young scholars like Shubho Roy, to turn these plans into practice&nbsp;<ul><li>Former Emergent Ventures winners&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://artha.global/\"><u>Artha Global</u></a>&nbsp; -&nbsp;Policy consulting organization that assists developing world governments in designing, implementing, and institutionalizing growth and prosperity-focused policy frameworks. Originally the IDFC Institute, Artha was re-founded under CEO Reuben Abraham after institutional changes to continue the team\u2019s work under a new banner. Artha places a strong emphasis on strengthening state capacity as a critical factor in translating intentions into real impact and unlocking India\u2019s growth potential. Instead of just focusing on technical inputs, Artha also focuses on coordinated policy implementation. Reuben Abraham\u2019s extensive global network identifies talented potential collaborators across government and private institutions. His and Artha\u2019s strength lies in bringing together disparate actors and backing them to find shared solutions. They demonstrated this during the Covid pandemic where they brought together experts from the medical community, municipal finance, sanitation, data science and AI, and state government leadership to solve pandemic and lockdown related problems<ul><li>Former Emergent Ventures winners&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://www.growth-teams.org/\"><u>Growth Teams</u></a> - Founded by Karthik Akhileshwaran and Jonathan Mazumdar, Growth Teams believes sustaining higher broad-based growth and job creation is imperative for alleviating Indian poverty. They are also advised by growth theorists and empiricists like Lant Pritchett. With federal reforms largely exhausted since the 1990s, the onus is now on states to pursue vital labor, land, capital, industrial, and environmental reforms that currently constrain development. Despite ample commentary, glitzy branding efforts, and limited practical progress in resolving firm-level obstacles, states often lack personnel truly versed in implementing growth-enabling policies. Growth Team fills this gap by partnering with state governments to deliver on-the-ground economic and employment strategies. They are particularly focused on generating scalable, manufacturing level job growth in poorer states to unleash the next wave of prosperity in India.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.fedev.org/\"><u>Foundation for Economic Development (FED)</u></a> - FED aims to facilitate economic growth of over 10 percent per annum in India, to improve the lives of all Indians.

There's an investment case&nbsp;<a href=\"https://innovationcommission.uchicago.edu/research_briefs/improved-weather-and-seasonal-forecasts/\"><u>here</u></a>. The following is my subjective view, from the perspective of an impact-maximizing donor. I think this is a case where a few million dollars could help get things moving, and could be really quite transformational. The cost-effectiveness ratios are off the scale (hundreds to one at least). I think this would happen eventually anyway, so we're talking about accelerating access.

This is the single most promising direct intervention I can imagine, and from scanning BM's website, it seems like they are literate in research and impact evaluations of export promotion programs, so they could be a good opportunity.</li><li><a href=\"https://oneacrefund.org/\"><u>One Acre Fund</u></a>. This is a nonprofit that focuses on providing quality seeds and services to smallholder farmers. Agricultural productivity is a big constraint on growth, so I think there's a lot of promise there. I also know researchers who have collaborated with OAF, who attest to their focus on credibly measuring their impact, and if I recall correctly, OAF has been recommended by The Life You Can Save.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\"><u>GiveDirectly</u></a>. This might be surprising, but I would guess that&nbsp;<i>purely from a growth perspective</i>, GD is more promising than any GiveWell top charity. The reason is simply because of the general equilibrium spillovers; people spending money creates income for other people, who then spend money to create income for other people, and so on. This is the most immediate source of growth.</li></ol><p>One important thing to note from a cost-effectiveness perspective is that the first-order effect of any growth-enhancing intervention will simply be to increase incomes. The push towards growth is a second-order effect that takes much longer to manifest, and may be almost zero&nbsp;<i>for a marginal dollar spent</i>. So the cost-effectiveness of different interventions will be determined mainly based on how much income they generate, rather than their potential growth impact. But I see that as a pretty decent proxy for growth impact.\u201d</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnkvh24sflhi8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefkvh24sflhi8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Also <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/does-capitalism-beat-charity\">this</a> coincidentally from Astral Codex Ten.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "DavidNash"}}, {"_id": "av3cCGiDzGt3ko3Tf", "title": "Gentleness and the artificial Other", "postedAt": "2024-01-02T18:21:34.788Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Joe_Carlsmith"}}, {"_id": "8vrgD7f7RxjamZpS4", "title": "Otherness and control in the age of AGI", "postedAt": "2024-01-02T18:15:54.203Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Joe_Carlsmith"}}, {"_id": "q6yDsSL42Kb23x2dr", "title": "ML4Good UK - Applications Open", "postedAt": "2024-01-02T18:20:48.249Z", "htmlBody": "<h3>Applications are open for ML4Good UK\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ml4good.org/courses/uk-march-2024\"><strong><u>March 2024 AI Alignment Bootcamp</u></strong></a>.</h3><p>We are running an intensive ten-day bootcamp to provide upskilling in deep learning for individuals who are motivated to work on addressing the risks<strong>&nbsp;</strong>posed by advanced AI systems.</p><p>This bootcamp will fast-track your deep learning skills, inform you about the current landscape of AI Safety agendas, connect you with like-minded individuals for potential friendship and collaboration, and accelerate you towards taking concrete next steps to work impactfully in this field.</p><p>The bootcamp is aimed at people in the UK and nearby countries with relatively strong coding experience who hope to improve their machine learning skills and conceptual understanding in order to work on AI Safety projects and agendas.

This time a year ago, I didn\u2019t&nbsp;<i>really&nbsp;</i>know what an \u201cx-risk\u201d was, and I pronounced \u201cutilitarianism\u201d as \"utalatarianism\u201d (but hey, I wasn\u2019t the only one!). But things have changed a lot since then, so I wrote this post with different goals in mind: to reflect, to inform, to entertain and (hopefully) to inspire. Also, I come from an Arts background, and I think it\u2019s kind of nice to balance AI Safety heavy stuff with lighter fun stuff from time to time.</p><p><strong>Shoutout</strong>: This post was partially inspired by (but can never live up to) the post&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XYdLTKZLQwTr337zM/the-spanish-speaking-effective-altruism-community-is-awesome\"><u>The Spanish Speaking Effective Altruism community is awesome!</u></a> written by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/jsevillamol\"><u>Jaime Sevilla</u></a>.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ni9b5ejJxotguGgmF/m6dfnsti3espci9gcrbz\"><figcaption>EA Barcelona: We are now officially the poster children of the <a href=\"https://resources.eagroups.org/paths-to-impact-how-ea-groups-can-improve-the-world\">CEA Groups Resource Centre page \u201c<u>How do EA groups produce impact?</u></a>\u201d #proud</figcaption></figure><h2>Some context on EA in Spain &amp; in Barcelona</h2><p>There have been a number of attempts to build an EA community in Spain over the years. In Madrid circa 2019, there was quite an active community infamously known as \u201cJaime and the Pablos\u201d, who held weekly activities and organized several larger events as well. And in Barcelona, there was also a small but passionate group meeting up regularly around the same time. However, due to the pandemic, changes in direction and other factors, neither one continued beyond 2020 as a formally coordinated, sustainable local group.</p><p>Fast forward to July 2021 and enter another Pablo:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pablorosado.com/\"><u>Pablo Rosado</u></a> - principal data scientist at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/\"><u>Our World In Data</u></a> and also my partner. Pablo R. had been learning about EA online and trying to apply its principles to his life for a couple of years already when he discovered the semi-dormant <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/eabarcelona\">EA Barcelona Facebook page</a>. He noticed that a couple of guys were planning to meet up and \u201chave a chat about EA\u201d that afternoon, so he went off to meet them and didn\u2019t come back until about 7 hours later. And that was the origins of what is now the second wave of EA Barcelona - kudos to Sam Bakeysfield, Miguel Gimeno and others for taking the initiative back then! This small group continued meeting up for their long and thought-provoking chats from time to time, until eventually I got curious and started tagging along too. Then in 2022, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ni9b5ejJxotguGgmF/ea-barcelona-our-first-year-of-impact#People_tend_to_come_and_go\">once Sam had moved to Portugal and Miguel to The Netherlands</a>, Pablo and I decided to take over as group organisers. For the rest of the year, we ran a couple of introductory talks and arranged the odd casual meeting for the tiny number of EAs who remained.</p><p>Then, in April 2023, after attending the amazingly inspiring&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVYuybdWPSM&amp;t=1s\"><u>EAGxLatAm in Mexico City</u></a>, quitting my job immediately afterwards and taking a 2-month sabbatical in Australia to visit friends and family, I applied for funding from the EAIF to do community building professionally. I returned to Barcelona to the exciting news that I had been awarded the grant, and the rest is history! Well, 8 months of history for now.</p><h2>EA Barcelona finally starts to take shape</h2><p>I started on the grant in May, and what a whirlwind of a time it\u2019s been since then! We\u2019ve run lots of different kinds of events, such as expert talks, discussion groups, coworking sessions and social activities, and we\u2019ve managed to attract a diverse group of interested people to the movement.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a few highlights of 2023, as always best expressed in images and (occasionally amusing) captions:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ni9b5ejJxotguGgmF/gsa8jydhzmwjwj9w9vf2\"><figcaption>Pablo R. talking about how <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23622511/climate-doomerism-optimism-progress-environmentalism\">climate \"doomerism\" is just as bad as climate denial, as it leads to inaction</a> - the total opposite of what we need right now.

Given the humble state EA Barcelona was in prior to this, having about 5-7 committed members and very few activities, I would say that we have achieved this: We now have around 20 active<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs9v81u8gbnj\"><sup><a href=\"#fns9v81u8gbnj\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(including 12&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/cea-grew-a-lot-in-the-past-year\"><u>highly engaged</u></a>) and 50 passive<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefide99o84axn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnide99o84axn\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;members, and several different activities each month. And beyond this, we\u2019ve managed to spread the ideas and values of effective altruism to hundreds more people in Barcelona.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some other cool things that happened:</p><ul><li>The key speaker at our talk on AI governance,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillembasgraells/\"><u>Guillem Bas</u></a>, was recently included in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cidob.org/actividades/lineas_de_investigacion_tematicas/cidob/santander_cidob_35_under_35_list4\"><u>35 under 35 list by CIDOB and Santander</u></a>, an achievement which will likely open more doors for him in the future. He was nominated by someone who came to the talk and left with a good impression.</li><li>14 people attended the <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/melanie-anne-brennan_eagxvirtual-effectivealtruism-globalconference-activity-7133048178261549057-dND4\">EAGxVirtual in-person event</a>, which was rated as one of the most valuable events of the year. Had there been no opportunity to view it in person, it\u2019s likely that only a small minority would have attended from home and found the experience much less rewarding.&nbsp;</li><li>Pablo R. signed the 10% pledge and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Bba8R7LQjs\"><u>made a video about it for his Youtube channel</u></a>.</li><li>Three members decided to redirect their donations to GiveWell recommended charities, and all stated that their involvement with EA Barcelona was \u201cquite influential\u201d in these decisions.</li><li>One member got into and is currently doing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dNMfswWKxqMz2BxuC/applications-open-cea-s-organizer-support-program-osp-and\"><u>Organizer Support Program</u></a>, as he\u2019s planning to start an EA university group in early 2024. To my knowledge, this will be Spain\u2019s first EVER uni group!</li></ul><h2>Some issues we\u2019ve faced</h2><p>Community building is not without its challenges, as many of you on this forum know very well. Here were some of ours:</p><h3>Language barrier</h3><p>Barcelona is a dynamic, cosmopolitan city full of people from all over the world. And given the international crowd that most of our events attract, English tends to be the default language used. This was sometimes problematic because the mother tongues of most people who live here are Catalan and/or Spanish. And while EA does tend to attract people who are at least competent in English, it shouldn\u2019t mean we exclude local people who aren\u2019t, and there were definitely times where communication broke down and people couldn\u2019t understand each other. We tried to address this by running separate discussion groups in Spanish and English, which helped somewhat, but I still think we have a long way to go in making our community more linguistically inclusive. I\u2019d be very open to hearing advice about this from other CBs working with multilingual groups.&nbsp;</p><h3>People tend to come and go</h3><p>Everyone knows that lots of great people come to Barcelona, only to leave again before very long. It\u2019s a very transient city, and plenty of international community members have now left (like Sam), while several key people who are originally from here are now living and working abroad (like Miguel). So much movement has made it difficult to reach a critical mass, and the language issues mentioned above only make things worse, if local people are more likely to feel excluded (they are the ones more likely to stay, after all). I\u2019m not quite sure what can be done to address this, other than safeguarding the group by reaching a critical mass of local and/or international not-likely-to-leave people, so that it doesn\u2019t affect us as much when someone does leave. Any thoughts?</p><h3>The wider Spanish-speaking community has taken a hit recently</h3><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sFoqCw6BnZmJNxFda/an-update-on-the-spanish-speaking-ea-community\"><u>Activity of the international Spanish-speaking EA community has decreased in general this year</u></a> compared to the previous two years, since several people working on community building grants stepped down to focus on other things. This has meant that, currently, our wider community lacks a clear direction, so it\u2019s been harder to share resources among sub-groups and to feel part of a bigger community striving for a common goal. That\u2019s how I feel anyway. I\u2019d be curious to know if other Spanish-speakers feel the same way or not, and what we can all do to lift our collective spirits again.&nbsp;</p><h2>2024: Onwards and upwards?</h2><p>After a productive 2023, we are excited to see what 2024 may bring for our small but growing community. Our funding situation remains unclear, but assuming everything goes according to plan, here are some things we\u2019re excited about for this year:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ricardsolerroger/\"><u>Ricard Soler</u></a>, multilingual vegan activist and expert on local culture, will hopefully be joining me as our second community builder. My main colleagues so far have been my two cats, so I\u2019d be thrilled to have another human to brainstorm ideas with, and to see Ricard use his local knowledge and language skills to address some of the linguistic barriers mentioned above.</li><li>We want to start collaborating with the recently inaugurated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.norrsken.org/barcelona\"><u>Norrsken House: Europe\u2019s biggest hub for tech and impact</u></a>. We\u2019re already organising an event there in February with start-ups in the alternative protein space, featuring&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gfi.org/team/bruce-friedrich/\"><u>Bruce Friedrich from The Good Food Institute</u></a>, and we can\u2019t wait!</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ni9b5ejJxotguGgmF/j2jf6gtveaafe7adyvdg\"><figcaption>Norrsken (pronounced \u201cNorhien\u201d in Swedish): We have our sights set on you.</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Our youngest member will hopefully kickstart Spain\u2019s first ever EA university group and start getting some bright, young Catalans excited about EA.</li><li>We\u2019d love to run our first in-person introductory fellowship in Barcelona. Several community members have done intro programs online, but I think there\u2019d be much more interest if we could deliver a program face-to-face.&nbsp;</li><li>We want to create our own website and FOMO-inducing video reel.</li></ul><p>And lots more!

Back in 2021 Fall, I started a university group at ELTE (E\u00f6tv\u00f6s L\u00f3r\u00e1nd University), which turned very quickly into a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JALJeiqtZJbQfsMeq/on-running-a-city-wide-university-group\"><u>city-wide university group</u></a>. During the second year, our outreach efforts only targeted university students, but sometimes early career professionals also found our programs (which we are very happy about!). We also have a couple of members who found out about EA by themselves and reached out, and some were already reading the EA/LW forums before our group was founded.</p><h1>2022 Fall semester</h1><p><i>2022 September to 2023 January</i></p><h2>Courses</h2><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EGztvGHigkekgkvc8/community-building-from-scratch-the-first-year-of-ea-hungary\"><u>last year\u2019s report</u></a>, I called our approach the 4+4 session intro fellowship. We continued doing the same, but I now have a much better write-up on the reasoning behind this in \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/inpofrDDGJHtJvcyn/consider-splitting-your-fellowships-into-two-parts-to\"><u>Consider splitting your fellowships into two parts to increase sign-ups</u></a>\u201d.</p><p>We had 21 applications, with 14 people starting the fellowship and 12 finishing the first 4 sessions. Of these 12, 10 of them continued to do the second half, and all of them finished it successfully.&nbsp;</p><p>We had another 4 people finish the fellowship through a partnership with an \u201c<a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/730cb9dc-c30b-427a-a5be-6d23546e0488\"><u>academic dormitory</u></a>\u201d. This is seemingly a unique concept in Hungary.</p><p>We have also run the in-depth fellowship for 15 people, but I didn\u2019t exactly record how many of them finished it, and we didn\u2019t do a good job of getting people to fill out the feedback form either.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref60zvqz9rvty\"><sup><a href=\"#fn60zvqz9rvty\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Since then we have been making sure people do the feedback form&nbsp;<strong>at the end of the last session</strong><i><strong>.</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>We recommend other groups to do the same to increase the response rate!</p><p>We have also run the \u201cCause area exploration\u201d and \u201cCareer planning\u201d fellowships for 5-5 people, which refer to tracks 1 and 2 of this course&nbsp;<a href=\"https://resources.eagroups.org/post-intro-fellowship-syllabi-and-programs/career-planning-program#a9fb4971f881495abdc111a7858159b1\"><u>here</u></a>, respectively.</p><p>We also piloted a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6ASCLT7HDMDy8rptE/the-8-week-mental-health-programme-for-eas-finally-published\"><u>wellbeing course</u></a> for our members, which had 13 participants. The results of this seemed paradoxical, as people have told us that they got a lot of value from it and that they were grateful for being able to take part, however, the attendance rate was quite low. For this reason, we didn\u2019t end up running it again.</p><h2>Public events</h2><p>In 2022 November, Gerg\u0151 gave an intro talk on EA to about 40 professionals (mostly engineers), due to an invitation to a tech company through one of our members. It was well received and some people mentioned that they would be interested in learning about EA. 4 of them signed up to our reading group. We were facilitating a follow-up online talk by GWWC for the whole company ~6000 employees, but as of now this hasn\u2019t happened, as they backed out due to some reputational concerns about EA. We think this is quite unfortunate, although the talk still may happen eventually (it will have to be organized by volunteers at the company, not the company\u2019s events/HR team).</p><p>We also ran an online event collaborating with EA Bonn and Effective Thesis. Only around 4 of our members attended, although one person did sign up for coaching afterward.</p><h2>Socials, meetups</h2><p>At the time I was organizing weekly socials for the community in Budapest, with about 5-8 attendees per social. We also organised an intro social for course participants which we think is quite important to have. Also had a hike for ~10 people which was fun.&nbsp;</p><p>We also organized a Christmas party which was attended by ~30 people, and a psychology meetup with lightning talks that had ~16 people.</p><p><img style=\"width:87.2%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JAM3jGioCwYEWjWPb/uj5ljuhhjouzpr7fqptr\"><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>EA P\u00e9cs and other cities</h2><p>I wanted to mention separately that P\u00e9cs, a city on the south-western side of Hungary had its first meetup with ~13 people. I was really happy about this, as this was our first official event that happened outside of Budapest. Unfortunately, we didn\u2019t do a great job of encouraging events to happen outside of Budapest since, but this is something I want to do a better job at during our 3rd year.</p><p><img style=\"width:38.67%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JAM3jGioCwYEWjWPb/l43julswvicugbc320zb\"> <img style=\"width:60.34%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JAM3jGioCwYEWjWPb/p4ymaumojdb1n5xp0vwi\"></p><p>We also have a couple of members based in Debrecen (city in the south-eastern side of Hungary), but it would be a strech to say that there is a group there. For our 3rd year, we plan to extend the marketing of our nation-wide intro program to all mayor cities in Hungary, mainly to seed more university groups.</p><h2>EAGxRotterdam</h2><p>During this period EAGxRotterdam happened, to which we have brought 20 people overall, ~18 of which would have likely not gone if EA Hungary didn\u2019t exist.</p><p><img style=\"width:92.28%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JAM3jGioCwYEWjWPb/ylyysv5px59nyadfejq8\"></p><h1>2023 Spring Semester</h1><p><i>From 2023 February to 2023 May</i></p><h2>Courses</h2><p>Before the start of the university semester, we ran a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/inpofrDDGJHtJvcyn/consider-splitting-your-fellowships-into-two-parts-to\"><u>split</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vGrHhFp4hyDtfsbvh/onboarding-students-to-ea-ais-in-4-days-with-an-intensive\"><u>intensive</u></a> fellowship. We had ~33 signups, 29 people starting and 24 finishing the first 4 sessions. Of these 24, 17 finished the second part.</p><p>We also ran the usual weekly fellowship during the semester. In this round, only 11 people applied, 9 started and 6 finished part one. Out of them, 5 finished part 2.&nbsp;</p><p>One interpretation of these results is that most people who were interested in the fellowship for this time period did it with the pre-semester group (after all, our marketing efforts for the two periods targeted the same audience, ie., university students), however, I\u2019m not quite sure if that\u2019s the explanation. At the time we had very little capacity for marketing properly, and I remember that our paid social media ads that we usually rely on didn\u2019t \u201cget off the ground\u201d either (meaning that the budget we allocated for it wasn\u2019t spent by Meta). I think there might be some diminishing returns on marketing if you run a fellowship twice per semester, but I still think it is likely worth it. Next time I want to try having two fellowships again, but with proper marketing for both rounds.</p><p>After marketing the in-depth fellowship through our mailing list, 16 people signed up, with 12 people finishing it.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Socials, meetups, coworkings</h2><p>We ran the usual intro social for the course with ~15 attendees before the semester started, and an end-of-fellowship social with 16 people.</p><p>We also tried out something called \u201ccommunity days\u201d, which is essentially a fancy name for coworking, although people who signed up could also request help for upskilling. We eventually renamed it to \u201cCoworking days\u201d to remove confusion. We ran about 4-5 of these, with attendance between 6-12 people.</p><h2>Strategy meetings</h2><p>&nbsp;In this period we also started having strategy meetings every 2 weeks. They are usually in person, although people can join online as well. They are attended by the core organizing team (people on a salary are expected to be present), but volunteers are also encouraged to join. I think these are really valuable for coordination and help me get a better sense of what\u2019s going on \u201con the ground\u201d.&nbsp; - I wish we started them earlier!</p><h2>Newsletter</h2><p>In 2023 May we launched a monthly newsletter that we send to people on our mailing list. The first edition was sent to 162 people.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhb8q84tg79\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhb8q84tg79\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We try to not spend too much time on these, hoverer I think having at least an MVP is worth it. If you are organizing a new-ish EA group and don\u2019t have the capacity to write one yourself, feel free to shoot us an email at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:info@aishungary.com\"><u>info@eahungary.com</u></a> - we can share our newsletter drafts with you each month, and you should be able to adjust it for your group with little effort. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N_ESnKwWxubP8kRQSqrYMfKffY67AJk-st8z6KGJCUw/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>Here</u></a> is what our newsletter looked like in a given month, so you can get a sense of the content.</p><h2>AIS group</h2><p>During this period a separate group called <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PDfrbwmhNbFCYmRsQ/the-hasty-start-of-budapest-ai-safety-lessons-from-a-non\">Budapest AI Safety</a> sprung out, about which you can read about in a separate report (hyperlink to be shared here shortly).</p><h1>2023 Summer</h1><h2>Courses</h2><h3>Intro-fellowship</h3><p>We ran a weekly intro fellowship in the Summer with 13 people. Just like the Spring semester\u2019s weekly fellowship, the marketing didn\u2019t go too well this round, as we had some internal troubles at the time. Of these 13 people, 8 people finished the 1st 4 sessions and 5 did the full fellowship. I originally wanted to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aoWpk28j3W65mYMgy/you-can-run-more-than-one-fellowship-per-semester-if-you\"><u>run more than one fellowship</u></a> during this period, but again, we just didn\u2019t have the capacity at the time.</p><h3>In-depth fellowship</h3><p>We had applicants for one group but unfortunately, it never got off the ground. This was a bit disappointing given how many people have done the intro fellowship already, even though my sense is that in-depth fellowships generally have a low signup rate. One thing I\u2019m confused about is that last year we had a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EGztvGHigkekgkvc8/community-building-from-scratch-the-first-year-of-ea-hungary#What_is_the_4_4_session_intro_fellowship_\"><u>lot of people</u></a> signing up for our summer intro programs, which indicates to me that university students should generally have time for these courses. However, students who were in our network already seemed very busy with work, vacation, etc., and didn\u2019t sign up for the in-depth course either this or last year. One thing we might try in the future is running an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vGrHhFp4hyDtfsbvh/onboarding-students-to-ea-ais-in-4-days-with-an-intensive\"><u>intensive version</u></a> of the in-depth fellowship, as people have to commit for a shorter duration which might work better over the summer break.</p><h2>EAGxWarsaw</h2><p><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JAM3jGioCwYEWjWPb/omu8oqektfcf0ppb8izt\"></p><p>Our community from Hungary brought overall about 28 people, of which (based on my best guess) counterfactually ~24 people wouldn\u2019t have gone otherwise. Some of these people came through AIS Hungary though, but due to the overlap between the two communities, it\u2019s a bit hard to estimate the exact numbers.</p><h2>EAGxBerlin</h2><p>Just as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EGztvGHigkekgkvc8/community-building-from-scratch-the-first-year-of-ea-hungary#EAGxBerlin\">last year</a>, I will conclude this section with the group photo from the Berlin conference in early Fall. We had much fewer people attending this year, as the target audience for the conference shifted, so it was harder for people from eastern Europe to get in. It was still a great experience for many of us! Overall about 13 of us were there, and I guess that ~9 people would not have been there have EA Hungary had not existed.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JAM3jGioCwYEWjWPb/wrlzn8ib6u7ebcsvel4f\"><figcaption>We forgot to take a proper group photo, but here are a couple of us after a lovely meal :)</figcaption></figure><h1>General thoughts</h1><p>Below I will outline some short and general thoughts reflecting on the past year. These thoughts are between \u201cabstract strategy\u201d (see the sequence) and \u201cthe specific things we have done\u201d (see above), but overall land closer to the strategy side.</p><h2>On Hiring and Management</h2><p>One of the biggest mistakes this past year was wanting to grow our organisation too quickly. In retrospect this was quite naive, even considering there was much more funding available for CB at the time I made the decision to hire more people. I wish I had read things such as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aXiLprnMGKuxTXcpF/elizabeth-s-quick-takes?commentId=cG6Fqhe8vkgDknQb6&amp;utm_source=EA+Forum+Digest&amp;utm_campaign=e5b115582d-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2023_08_17_01_26&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-e5b115582d-%5BLIST_EMAIL_ID%5D\"><u>Get ambitious slowly</u></a> and Holden\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/29/we-cant-simply-buy-capacity/\"><u>We can\u2019t (simply) buy capacity</u></a>. I also made a lot of mistakes when it comes to management. I feel a bit embarrassed to admit it now, but at the time I didn\u2019t think of management as a skill that someone has to get good at. I wish I had done some upskilling first so as to prevent predictable issues (e.g. communication problems, expectations not being clear enough), as dealing with unpredictable ones would have been more than enough. I also wish I had asked for help from CEA earlier, but this was largely during the FTX crisis, so I was thinking they had much bigger issues to worry about. Since then I have become much better at this, although I still have plenty of room for improvement. Some specific things that I found pretty helpful since: regular check-ins, regular \u201cmeta-conversations\u201d where you specifically talk about issues and how to work together more effectively, strong onboarding, regular in-person co-working, and writing up a \u201ccollaboration document\u201d that clearly outlines specific responsibilities.</p><h2>On calls</h2><p>Compared to the first year, I didn\u2019t closely track the number of calls I had. I quickly ran through my calendar for the 2022 Fall semester and roughly counted ~105 calls.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo17p7xcwqp\"><sup><a href=\"#fno17p7xcwqp\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I\u2019m not sure how representative that is of the entire year, but a general takeaway I had is that in the future I want to spend more time on doing \u201ccareer advice/mentoring calls\u201d for our members. I think these can be extremely valuable but also easy to neglect, so that\u2019s something I want to do better on. I was also surprised to see how many calls I spent on management.</p><h2>On Community Health</h2><p>Throughout the year we have had several community health issues from mundane to pretty serious ones. When it was needed, I was always able to get amazing help from CEA\u2019s CH team, for which I\u2019m very grateful for &lt;3</p><p>Another thought on this is that I now feel I could have been more explicit about what I want our community\u2019s culture to be like, and be somewhat more likely to follow up on minor community health issues compared to being like \u201cokay if this comes up again I will talk to this person but let\u2019s not spend time on this for now\u201d. This is tricky to balance as you certainly don\u2019t want to police your community, but given that I\u2019m quite agreeable I was always happy to reason myself out of having to explicitly deal with community health concerns when I could. I\u2019m hoping that if in the future I catch myself doing this, I will be a little more likely to act, without going overboard.</p><h2>On Marketing the intro program</h2><p>Getting the word out about our fellowship continues to be a major bottleneck for us. For that reason, as well as me having read&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Kugwq3jmoNEgrmAZG/marketing-101-for-ea-organizations\"><u>this</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cPCra34aCGrYzKcDF/opinion-digital-marketing-is-under-utilized-in-ea\"><u>this</u></a> I\u2019m planning to focus more on our online appearance, as well as optimize our social media ads and increase their budget.</p><h2>On socials</h2><p>Over the year, we have run quite a lot of social events, with varying success. Overall I have updated away from priorizing socials. I think they are great and should happen, but I\u2019m now hoping to have them run by volunteers or happen more organically, as opposed to putting serious effort into organizing them by our staff. We will still organize at least one social per intro course, as well as have at least one MVP-type meetup per month though, so there is something to turn up to for people who are currently not enrolled in our courses.</p><h2>On measuring impact</h2><p>This report is mainly focused on describing the type of programs we ran, how we ran them, and some strategic considerations behind them. These are all instrumental to what we ultimately want to achieve, which is more talented and thoughtful people contributing to EA cause areas. I try to do my best to keep track of what our community is doing and celebrate successes, however, the aim of this writeup is not to systematically measure our impact or cost-effectiveness.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxlh3dwonr2\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxlh3dwonr2\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><h2>On Newsletters</h2><p>Just to repeat what I wrote above: If you are organising an EA group and don\u2019t have capacity to write monthly newsletters yourself, feel free to shoot us an email at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:info@aishungary.com\"><u>info@eahungary.com</u></a> - we can share our newsletter drafts with you each month, and you should be able to adjust it for your group with little effort.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N_ESnKwWxubP8kRQSqrYMfKffY67AJk-st8z6KGJCUw/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>Here</u></a> is what our newsletter looked like in December, so you can get a sense of the content.</p><h2>On writing reports</h2><p>Overall I spent a good amount of time writing this report, especially the sequence of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/rsq98ZnMAjfrYFwtq\"><u>Experiments in Local Community Building</u></a>. I\u2019m pretty uncertain as to whether it was worth putting that much effort into them. One thing I\u2019m certain of is that it would have been better to write up some drafts right after each semester ended, as I\u2019m sure I have forgotten a couple of lessons that I thought were important at the time. Live and learn!</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>Our original strategy for the 2023 Fall Semester can be read&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YjzRYCHjcADMeUjNo78sVALaZfk2Q20U77-wLFAPkZU/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>here</u></a>. Since then we have somewhat updated on these plans, I will soon share that in our upcoming interim report.</p><h1>Concluding thoughts</h1><p>Like for many of us in the EA community, this past year had plenty of challenges for EA Hungary. I feel I have made many mistakes, but have also learned about CB strategy quite a lot in the overall process. I\u2019m enthusiastic about going forward with our team, as well as carefully growing our organisation further.

A little knowledge is a dangerous thing: you don\u2019t want people to end up in the situation of knowing enough to see through the illusory guardrails, but not enough to navigate successfully without the illusion. I suggest six such pairs, where it seems important to correct both mistakes simultaneously.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>I\u2019m struck by how often two theoretical mistakes manage to (mostly) cancel each other out. For example, I think that common sense ethical norms tend to do a pretty good job (albeit with <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/beneficentrism\">significant room for improvement</a>), in practice, while resting upon significant theoretical falsehoods. These falsehoods may be part of a \u201clocal maximum\u201d: if you corrected them, without making further corrections elsewhere, you could well end up with morally <i>worse</i> beliefs and practices.</p><p>This observation forms the kernel of truth in <a href=\"https://www.utilitarianism.net/objections-to-utilitarianism/abusability/#is-utilitarianism-self-effacing\">the claim that utilitarianism is self-effacing</a>. Utilitarianism is not strictly self-effacing: I still expect the <i>global maximum</i> may be achieved by having <i>entirely</i> true moral beliefs (or a close enough approximation).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc0m5zf1xshm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc0m5zf1xshm\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But most people are stubbornly irrational in various ways, which may make it better for <i>them</i> to have false beliefs of a sort that limit the damage done by their other irrationality. These paired mistakes then constitute a <i>protective equilibrium</i> that stops these people from veering off into severe practical error (such as <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/naive-vs-prudent-utilitarianism\">naive utilitarianism</a>).</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F45501877-a835-4bbb-adf6-cb1a69f3a244_1024x1024.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GPAaNikxGH7P87n3Y/mldkvsb2w3lrz1nn6tze\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GPAaNikxGH7P87n3Y/u0w2dfros0abjkufwr06 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GPAaNikxGH7P87n3Y/cbctxc1iwuqvw0kq7qjw 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GPAaNikxGH7P87n3Y/erk5zqclv5npurimuuzs 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GPAaNikxGH7P87n3Y/mldkvsb2w3lrz1nn6tze 1456w\"></a></p><p>It\u2019s important to note that these paired mistakes are not the only protective equilibria available. The corresponding paired truths also work! But a little knowledge is a dangerous thing: you don\u2019t want people to end up in the situation of knowing enough to see through the illusory guardrails, but not enough to navigate successfully without the illusion.</p><p>In this post, I\u2019ll suggest a few examples of such \u201cpaired mistakes\u201d:</p><ol><li>Using \u201ccollectivist\u201d reasoning as a fudge to compensate for irrational views about individual efficacy.</li><li>Using near-termism as a fudge to compensate for irrational cluelessness about the long term.</li><li>Ignoring small probabilities as a fudge against Pascalian gullibility.</li><li>Using deontology as a fudge to compensate for irrational naive instrumentalism.</li><li>Tabooing inegalitarian empirical beliefs as a fudge for irrational (and unethical) essentializing of social groups.</li><li>Viewing all procreative decisions as equally good, as a fudge against unethical coercive interference.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0p4fizx3s6d\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0p4fizx3s6d\">[2]</a></sup></span></li></ol><p>Further suggestions welcome!</p><h3>1. Inefficacy and Anti-individualism</h3><p>Many people have false views about individual efficacy and expected value (see my <a href=\"https://www.philosophyetc.net/2021/05/five-fallacies-of-collective-harm.html\">Five Fallacies of Collective Harm</a>), that lead them to underestimate the strength of our individualistic moral reasons to contribute to collective goods (like voting for the better candidate) and to reduce one\u2019s contributions to collective bads (like pollution and environmental damage\u2014or voting for the worse candidate, for that matter).</p><p>If you make this mistake, it would be good to <i>also</i> make the paired mistake of believing that you have collectivistic moral reasons based on <i>group </i>contributions. There are no (non-negligible) such reasons, as I prove in \u2018<a href=\"https://www.philosophyetc.net/2015/04/valuing-unnecessary-causal-contributions.html\">Valuing Unnecessary Causal Contributions</a>\u2019. But the false belief that there are such reasons can help motivate you to do as you ought, when you\u2019re too confused about inefficacy to be able to get the practical verdicts right for the <i>right </i>reasons.</p><p>Conversely: if you correctly understand why collectivist reasons are such a silly idea, it\u2019s <i>very important</i> that you also appreciate why there often <i>are</i> sufficient individualistic moral reasons to contribute to good things even when the chance of your act making a difference is very small. (Remember that <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/all-probabilities-matter\">All Probabilities Matter</a>!)</p><h3>2. Cluelessness and Anti-longtermism</h3><p>Some people falsely believe that we cannot justifiably regard <i>anything</i> (even preventing nuclear war!) as having long-term positive expected value. I\u2019ve previously argued that <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/its-not-wise-to-be-clueless\">such cluelessness is less than perfectly rational</a>, though it may itself be a useful protection against some forms of \u201cnaive instrumentalist\u201d irrationality (see #4 below).</p><p>Still, if you make this mistake, it would be good to pair it with anti-longtermism, so you avoid decision paralysis and continue to do <i>some</i> good things\u2014like trying to prevent nuclear war\u2014albeit in partial ignorance of just <i>how</i> good these things are.</p><h3>3. Pascalian Gullibility and Probability Neglect</h3><p>Another form of misguided prior involves \u201cPascalian gullibility\u201d: giving greater-than-infinitesimal credence to claims that unbounded value depends upon your satisfying another\u2019s whims (e.g. their demand for your wallet)\u2014yielding a high \u201cexpected value\u201d to blind compliance.</p><p>If you are disposed to make this mistake, it would be good to pair it with another\u2014namely, the disposition to <i>simply ignore</i> any sufficiently small probabilities, effectively rounding the Pascalian mugger\u2019s threat down to the \u201czero\u201d it really ought to have been all along. But this latter disposition is itself a kind of mistake (i.e. when dealing with better-grounded probabilities), as explained in my recent post: <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/all-probabilities-matter\">All Probabilities Matter</a>. So it might be especially important to correct this pair.</p><h3>4. Naive Instrumentalism and Anti-consequentialism</h3><p>Many people (from <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/morally-risky-philosophy\">academic censors</a> to those who think that utilitarianism would <i>actually justify</i> <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/j7sDfXKEMeT2SRvLG/ftx-faq\">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>\u2019s crimes)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxlcym9ripz\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxlcym9ripz\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;seem drawn to <i>naive instrumentalism</i>: the assumption that one\u2019s moral goals are apt to be better achieved via Machiavellian means than by pursuing them with honesty and integrity, constraining one\u2019s behaviour by tried-and-tested norms and virtues. Like most (all?) historical utilitarians, I <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/naive-vs-prudent-utilitarianism\">reject naive instrumentalism</a> as hubristic and incompatible with all we know of human fallibility and biased cognition. (See <a href=\"https://www.utilitarianism.net/utilitarianism-and-practical-ethics/#respecting-commonsense-moral-norms\">here</a> for more on what sort of decision procedure I take to be rationally superior.)</p><p>Still, if you are\u2014abhorrently\u2014a naive instrumentalist, you\u2019d best pair it with non-consequentialism to at least limit the damage your irrationality might otherwise cause!</p><h3>5. Social Essentialism and Tabooed Empirical Inquiry</h3><p>Most people are terrible at statistical thinking. As Sarah-Jane Leslie explains in \u2018<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/LESTOS\">The Original Sin of Cognition: Fear, Prejudice, and Generalization</a>\u2019, people are natural \u201cessentialists\u201d, prone to generalize \u201cstriking [i.e. threatening] properties\u201d to entire groups based on even a tiny proportion of actual threats.

Illiberalism and Procreative Neutrality</h3><p>Naive instrumentalists assume that illiberal coercion is often the best way to achieve moral goals. As a result, they <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/utilitarianism-and-abortion\">imagine that pro-natalist longtermism must be a threat to reproductive rights</a> (and to procreative liberty more generally).</p><p>I think this is silly because illiberalism is so obviously suboptimal.

I\u2019m certainly not going to, because I\u2019m committed to intellectual honesty, and I trust that my readers aren\u2019t stupid. Plus, it\u2019s dangerous for the lies to be too widespread: plenty of smart people are going to recognize the in-principle shortcomings of collectivism, neartermism, probability neglect, deontology, moralizing empirical inquiry, and procreative neutrality. We shouldn\u2019t want such people to think that this commits them in practice to free riding, decision paralysis, Pascalian gullibility, naive instrumentalism, social essentialism, or procreative illiberalism. That would be both harmful <i>and</i> illogical.</p><p>So I think it\u2019s worth making clear (i) that these pairs are (plausibly) <i>mistakes</i>, but (ii) it could be even <i>worse</i> to only correct one part of the mistake, since together they form a protective equilibrium. To avoid bad outcomes, you should try to move straight from one protective equilibrium to another, avoiding the shortcomings of just \u201ca little knowledge\u201d.</p><p>We should typically expect the <i>accurate</i> protective equilibrium to be practically superior to the <i>thoroughly false</i> one, since accurate beliefs do tend to be useful (with rare exceptions that one would need to make a case for).

Drawing parallels to climate change solutions, I argue that fortifying health systems is akin to promoting clean energy, offering multiple benefits such as direct health improvements, economic efficiencies, enhanced disease surveillance, and effective platforms for health interventions. While focused programs like the GOBI-FFF strategy have shown measurable success, they often lack the sustainable and equitable infrastructure a robust health system can provide. Using examples such as malaria prevention and genomic surveillance for GCBRs, I aim to illustrate how a strong health system can amplify the impact and efficiency of specific health initiatives. Despite challenges in quantifiability and evaluation, I conclude that strengthening health systems is a crucial yet relatively neglected avenue to impact for those concerned with the near- and long-term future.</p><h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3><p>Prevention of global catastrophic biological risks (GCBRs) and improving global health and wellbeing are top priorities for those concerned with doing good effectively. My aim is to make the argument for a focus on health systems as a means of facilitating a broad range of cost-effective interventions, and thereby serving an avenue to, and multiplier of, potential impact for those interested in both the near- and long-term future. There are likely enough effective interventions within the space of GCBR mitigation and global health and wellbeing that would benefit from a strong baseline health system for a focus on strengthening health systems to present a robust, and diversified means of doing good. To draw a parallel from the issue of climate change, Will MacAskill in his<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/will-macaskill-what-we-owe-the-future/\">&nbsp;<u>interview with 80000 hours</u></a> identified clean energy as&nbsp;<i>\u201cweirdly, robustly good\u201d</i>, a&nbsp;<i>\u201cwin-win-win-win-win\u201d</i>. The wins included:</p><ul><li>Direct health improvements from particulate reduction&nbsp;</li><li>Improvements for climate change</li><li>Investments in innovation speeding up technological progress&nbsp;</li><li>Reductions in energy poverty in low income countries&nbsp;</li><li>Preserving coal stores which may be needed by future generations</li></ul><p>I believe that a focus on strengthening health systems offers similar robustness in its potential to do good, including:</p><ul><li>Direct health improvement from access to health care</li><li>Reduction in economic costs associated with disease and infirmity</li><li>Scale up of evolving surveillance for novel pathogens</li><li>A platform from which to launch therapeutic or vaccination campaigns</li></ul><p>The health systems approach to improving global health and wellbeing is not novel. However, in framing this approach as a means of amplifying the impact of more traditions \u2018cost-effective\u2019 interventions, I believe it is relatively neglected. The importance of health systems to the mitigation of risks from GCBRs likewise presents a relatively neglected point of view, that adds to the expected value of a health systems approach from a long-termism perspective. For those who hold high levels of uncertainty surrounding the relative importance of the near- and long-term futures, a focus on health systems could offer an approach working toward positive impact on both fronts. As such I believe focussing on health systems strengthening is a robust means of doing good, which is currently particularly neglected amongst EAs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Strengthening Health Systems: Historical perspective</strong></h3><p>There is a long history of conflicting approaches to improving health metrics in global health. Should a broad health systems approach be used, or should we focus the limited available resources on cost-effective interventions with measurable outcomes? The<a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/documents/almaata-declaration-en.pdf\">&nbsp;<u>Alma Ata Declaration</u></a><sup>1</sup> at the 1978 International Conference on Primary Health Care aimed to set the trajectory toward focus on horizontal, broad health service development as a means to closing the gap on inequalities in global health. Criticised for being too broad and without actionable goals, the focus was shifted to selective primary health care (SPHC). Guided by principles of cost-effectiveness and measurable progress the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_health_care#GOBI_and_GOBI-FFF\">&nbsp;<u>GOBI-FFF</u></a> strategy (programs focussing on Growth monitoring, Oral rehydration solution, Breastfeeding, Immunisation, Family planning, Female education, Food supplementation) implemented by UNICEF in 1983<sup>2</sup> provided a rebuttal, an example of a focused, and cost-effective series of health interventions that positively impacted many across the developing world. Rates of immunisation in the developing world increased from 20% to 40%, and more children than ever had access to simple yet lifesaving interventions such as oral rehydration solution.<sup>3</sup> Whilst undoubtedly effective in achieving its goals, the approach did little in terms of bolstering the health systems of the nations it benefitted. The nature of the interventions which were invested upon meant the approach provided little foundation from which an effective, equitably distributed health system could be built.&nbsp;</p><p>The debate between narrow and horizontal approaches to improving health across the globe remains active to date. Whilst the amount of resources dedicated to either such approach is near impossible to aggregate,<sup>4</sup> giving adequate thought to both the focussed (intervention specific) and broad (systems based) approaches is necessary in any meaningful discussion on how best to allocate resources within the field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Health Systems and Cost-Effective Interventions</strong></h3><p>A comprehensive health system, sensitive to local context, with the ability to provide high-quality, timely and affordable healthcare is the utopic goal for many in global health. The World Health Organisation\u2019s 2007 report&nbsp;<i>Everybody\u2019s Business: Strengthening Health Systems to Improve Health Outcomes</i> makes the case for a health systems approach to achieving the goals outlined in the Millennium Development Goals, and outlines 6 building blocks of an effective health system:<sup>5</sup></p><p>1.&nbsp; Health services</p><p>2.&nbsp; A health workforce</p><p>3.&nbsp; Health information systems</p><p>4.&nbsp; Access to medical products, vaccines and technologies</p><p>5.&nbsp; Health financing</p><p>6.&nbsp; Leadership and governance</p><p>These points are incredibly broad, and perhaps somewhat difficult to draw specific, tractable action points from. They signal the importance of institutional strength and the reliance of a healthcare system on logistics, technology, budgeting and human resources.&nbsp; As such, effective health sector reform is contingent on many factors, such as political considerations and public policy, environmental conditions and economic development.<sup>6</sup> The interplay of these factors mean monitoring progress can be difficult, and the impact of interventions can be unclear. These reasons can make taking a health systems approach less appealing for those, such as EA\u2019s, who highly value high levels of certainty in measuring and maximising impact. I believe it would be an unfortunate unintended consequence for broad interventions, with a strong theory of change, to be underutilised because they\u2019re more challenging to evaluate quantitatively.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note that drawing a line delineating narrow from horizontal approaches to improving global health is a false dichotomy. Narrowly focussed interventions can pave the way for a broader system to be established, and a focus on health systems can make current and future cost-effective programs more efficient to implement. It is a symbiotic relationship. Given the focus on interventions with more vertical approaches, an opportunity for greater efficiency, as well as a more robust and sustainable positive impact may be achieved by turning some focus and resources toward an approach that seeks to strengthen health systems. A diagonal approach,<sup>7</sup> one which leverages the efficiency gained by a focus on both cost-effect and narrowly focused interventions, and the underlying systems that strengthen their implementation and impact, should be the focus.</p><p>Let us consider two examples of cost-effective and impactful interventions from top EA cause areas to further explore the idea.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Malaria Prevention</i></p><p>In 2021, there were approximately 247 million cases of malaria worldwide, with the disease being responsible for approximately 619 000 deaths world-wide.<sup>8</sup> Insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) are a low cost and effective means of preventing malaria infection in endemic regions.<sup>9</sup> The Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) is a GiveWell top rated charity,<sup>10</sup> providing bed nets at scale, monitoring its impact, globally saving the lives of hundreds of thousands each year, and reducing the economic impacts of malaria to society more broadly.<sup>11</sup></p><p>Considering pragmatically what is required for carrying out the programme on the ground, the AMF has a number of necessary criteria when considering areas in which to roll out ITNs for malaria prevention,<sup>12</sup> including:</p><ol><li>Accurate household-level data on the demand or need for nets</li><li>Independent supervision at the 'moment of net distribution'</li><li>Post-distribution monitoring of net use and condition</li><li>Monthly malaria case rate data after distribution</li></ol><p>Whilst there is no specific requirements for established health care system architecture to be in place, the AMF does stipulate the following considerations in evaluating potential partners:<sup>12</sup></p><p>\u00b7 &nbsp; &nbsp;Would the National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) agree to the four main requirements we have of a distribution?</p><p>\u00b7 &nbsp; &nbsp;Are there potential distribution partners with the necessary resources and experience with whom we could collaborate?</p><p>\u00b7 &nbsp; &nbsp;Is there a strong leader in charge of the distribution partner(s) with whom we feel we can work closely?</p><p>Consider two alternative scenarios, one in which the AMF ITN program is run in partnership with a local health centre offering contextually appropriate primary care (scenario A), and one in which the program is run in partnership with an organisation meeting only the minimum essential requirements (scenario B). For the narrow purposes of malaria prevention, scenario B is likely to be the more cost-effective of the two. Costs will not need to be distributed across competing priorities, and the program can optimise for data collection, net distribution, and outcome evaluation. If we consider a broader view of the overall health of the community, there are a number of factors that favour the effectiveness of scenario A, despite a likely higher cost. The efficiency of the ITN program implementation is likely to be greater given availability of basic resources such as brick and mortar infrastructure, and the ability to communicate the occurrence of the program to the local community. The uptake of the program may be more acceptable in a community where the local health centre is a trusted and integrated resource the community regularly utilises. There will be opportunity for gains to be made from educating the community about malaria. Community members may have a greater awareness of signs or symptoms of the disease and be more likely to present to the health centre and complete treatment in the future. Data collection of future cases of malaria may be more robust in a setting where the data collection and treatment point are the same physical location. Importantly, these benefits are more dispersed in time and place than those of the leaner scenario B, and as such are more difficult to quantify and integrate into a cost-effectiveness analysis. This should however not detract from its benefits, measured or not, they do exist. As such, I believe there is a strong argument to be made for a synergist approach in which the impact and sustainability of cost-effective, narrowly focussed public health interventions is supplemented and amplified by an underlying health system infrastructure.</p><p><i>Genomic Surveillance for Prevention of GCBRs</i></p><p>Emerging novel pathogens or the spread of high consequence existing pathogens pose an existential threat to humanity, and we as a species have an interest in their early detection, and in a prompt response to potential threats. These pathogens pay no attention to political lines or nation states and thus, technological strategies cannot be isolated to reference laboratories in high-income nations, they must necessarily be present globally. A wide variety of approaches exist to mitigate the potential consequences of GCBRs. Early detection of novel pathogens, broad spectrum therapeutics or vaccinations and quarantine facilities are all potentially useful and impactful means to reducing the existential risk associated with GCBRs. At each of these steps, there is a potential dependence on an underlying health infrastructure, a platform from which pathogens can be detected, therapeutics can be dispensed, and individuals can be quarantined. In a similar fashion to the argument outlined above, the ability to leverage an existing health system to implement a wide variety of mitigation approaches to GCBRs seems like a robustly good approach to doing good.&nbsp;</p><p>As an example,<a href=\"https://www.who.int/initiatives/genomic-surveillance-strategy\">&nbsp;<u>pathogen agnostic genomic surveillance systems</u></a> have been suggested as a global public health priority in reducing the risk from pathogens with pandemic or epidemic potential. Pathogen agnostic systems survey biological data across a geographical region, screening for genomic patterns suggestive of an emergent or novel disease. A recent<a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240046979\">&nbsp;<u>strategy report</u></a> from the WHO outlines objectives required to achieve the goal \u201c<i>that genomic surveillance for pathogens with pandemic and epidemic potential is strengthened and scaled for quality, timely and appropriate public health actions within local to global surveillance systems.</i>\u201d The objectives are as follow:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Improve access to tools for better geographic representation</li><li>Strengthen the workforce to deliver at speed, scale and quality</li><li>Enhance data sharing and utility for streamlined local to global public health decision-making and action&nbsp;</li><li>Maximise connectivity for timely value-add in the broader surveillance architecture&nbsp;</li><li>Maintain a readiness posture for emergencies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Objectives 1, 2, and 5 are obvious candidates for greater efficiency if an underlying healthcare architecture is available. In a setting where resources are already limited, there may be an obstructively high bar to the proper implementation of a genomic surveillance system, which could at least partially be overcome by the presence of the architecture of a health system. In LMICs without centralised sewerage systems, surveillance of biological materials may prove difficult if not carried out in the context of a health centre or dispensary, where respiratory swabs, urine, or faecal samples could be collected and analysed at the point of care. A readiness posture for an epidemic or pandemic similarly, will require human resources and likely be more effective if a locally, contextually effective health care system can be leveraged to deliver such an escalation plan.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Actioning a health systems approach</strong></h3><p>By nature, a \u2018health systems\u2019 approach is broad and as such can encompass a variety of potential areas of focus. Taking such an approach should not ignore arguments of cost-effectiveness, cost-effectiveness should remain an important means of arguing for the prioritisation of specific interventions within this approach. Utilising the 6 building blocks identified by WHO, we have a reasonable breakdown of potential focus areas that are somewhat more specific and actionable. I have included some brief thoughts on potential actionable areas for action within each of the building blocks:</p><p><i><u>Health services</u></i></p><p>In actioning a health systems approach, a primary focus may be on establishing and enhancing primary healthcare infrastructure, especially in regions with significant needs or geographical isolation. This could involve investments in the fundamental requirements for primary care delivery, such as facilities, equipment, and necessary medications (including vaccinations). Additionally, exploring innovative care delivery models, such community-based investigation and treatment for prevalent diseases (e.g. HIV, TB, antenatal syphilis or hepatitis B), can lead to more efficient and effective healthcare services. Evaluating these novel models through research can provide insights into their scalability and replicability in different contexts.</p><p><i>Example:</i> A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12960-015-0070-y\"><u>systematic review</u></a> by&nbsp;<i>Vaughan</i> et. al. has suggested utilising community health worker (CHW) programs for the delivery of tuberculosis treatment and control, reproductive and child health, and malaria interventions can be more cost effective in comparison to standard care.</p><p><i><u>A health workforce</u></i></p><p>Addressing the health workforce involves ensuring accessible education and training avenues for potential health staff in areas of need, such as, for example, remote learning opportunities for aspiring community health workers. Ensuring there are not undue barriers to the training of health staff, and a focus remains on pragmatic requirements for healthcare delivery, (e.g. low-cost options or scholarships for those seeking specialists training from areas of need), is essential. Additionally, incentivization strategies for health workers, like scaled remuneration or other benefits for those serving in remote regions, can address the issue of workforce shortages in critical areas.</p><p><i>Example:</i> A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1478-4491-8-8\"><u>systematic review</u></a> by&nbsp;<i>Callaghan</i> et. al. found \u2018task-shifting\u2019 interventions, the deligation of routine and repetitive tasks from doctors to non-physician clinicians, in HIV treatment and care was a cost-effective means of delivering high-quality and more cost-effective care tose living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa.&nbsp;</p><p><u>&nbsp;</u><i><u>Health information systems</u></i></p><p>Investment in digital healthcare infrastructure is an important aspect of a strong health system, emphasising efficient data management and sharing, such as centralised reporting systems for notifiable diseases. Moreover, the development and implementation of surveillance systems for novel pathogens are vital in developing health systems, particularly as pathogen-agnostic diagnostic technologies become more affordable. Ensuring the rollout of these technologies in low- and middle-income countries can significantly enhance global disease monitoring capabilities.</p><p><i>Example:</i> An&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35060919/\"><u>observational study</u></a> by&nbsp;<i>Secor</i> et. al. highlighted the potential added value of scaling electronic immunisation registries, looking at data collected from a program in Tanzania, with the potential to improve vaccination rates, identify populations at risk for disease and improve care delivery more broadly.</p><p><i><u>Access to medical products, vaccines and technologies</u></i></p><p>Developing robust supply chains is essential for the distribution of key equipment, vaccinations, and medications. This can include monitoring systems for stock-outs of crucial diagnostic tests and essential medications. Investment in research and development of supply chain management can also play a significant role in ensuring consistent access to medical products in diverse healthcare settings.</p><p><i>Example:&nbsp;</i>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-022-08022-1\"><u>mixed-methods</u></a> study by&nbsp;<i>Lavtepatil&nbsp;</i>and<i> Gosh</i> explored the effectiveness of the&nbsp;<i>Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Jan Ausadhi Pariyojana</i> program, a program seeking to increase the availability of essential medications through the local production and procurement of unbranded generic medications. Whilst work there remains room for optimisation, the approach shows some promise in reducing healthcare expenditure on drugs.&nbsp;</p><p><i><u>Health financing</u></i></p><p>A key aspect of health financing is ensuring individuals are protected from catastrophic costs associated with healthcare, advocating for universal health coverage systems in developing economies. Furthermore, making sure that highly cost-effective interventions are cost-free or actively incentivized can lead to more equitable and widespread access to essential healthcare services (this is already a focus area for some EA focussed charities).</p><p><i>Example:</i> The introduction of a community-based health insurance scheme, the Mutuelles program, in Rwanda, where subscriptions of varying premiums are paid by households, with the remainder of the funding being pooled from various NGOs, government funding or development partners.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22723985/\"><i><u>Lu</u></i><u> et. al. found</u></a> the intervention to be an effective step toward universal health coverage.</p><p><i><u>Leadership and governance</u></i></p><p>Efficient collaboration between various sectors, such as public and private health systems or NGOs, especially in regions where multiple systems coexist, is important in developing health systems. Working towards a cohesive and integrated approach can optimise resource utilisation and improve overall health service delivery.</p><p><i>Example:</i> Kenya has trialled a decentralised means of healthcare governance, aiming to enable more localised decision making processes catering to regional health needs. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33227596/\"><u>systematic review</u></a> by&nbsp;<i>Masaba</i> et. al. found there were improvements to the development of the Kenyan health system as a result of the policy, however, did identify a number of key challenges with its implementation.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, none of these strategies are particularly novel or ground-breaking in and of themselves. However, given the broad potential good they can facilitate, a greater focus on strengthening these key aspects of health systems should receive greater attention for those aiming to do good in the near- or long-term.</p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><h3><strong>Limitations</strong></h3><p><i><u>Neglectedness</u></i></p><p>Some may consider that a health systems focus is already the focus on many players in the global health landscape. For instance, local government bodies are likely to already be contributing resources to the elements of health system development, rather than focussing on more specific interventions that are particularly important, tractable, and neglected. The comparative advantage of an actor in the global health and development space may therefore have a large marginal impact focussing elsewhere. An argument may also be made that health systems emerge as a result of economic development, and as such in developing nations the most effective means of improving health systems is by supporting development more broadly. In rebuttal to these points, I believe that those with a lens toward doing good effectively in both the near- and long-term, could have an impact on&nbsp;<i>shaping</i> this progress with a particular focus on a more cost-effective bent. For instance, an actor with a specific concern for the risks of GCBRs could advocate for the inclusion of pathogen monitoring systems in developing health systems.</p><p><i><u>Complexity of approach</u></i></p><p>Given the interdependence of health systems on other aspects of society, and the required sensitivity to local context, two potential issues may arise:</p><p>1) Difficulty in accurate monitoring and evaluation</p><p>2) Difficulty in rapid scale up and ability to absorb funding</p><p>These are precisely the points which more narrow and quantifiable approaches to issues in public health have their strengths. In response to these points:</p><p>1) Difficulty in monitoring and evaluation does not mean the actual impact of such projects does not exist. This is an issue of monitoring and evaluation methodology, rather than program failure.</p><p>2) The development of health systems is highly contextual and resource intensive, as mentioned above. Whilst this is true, given the broad array of potential avenues to positive impact, the benefit here still outweighs these potential costs.</p><p><i><u>Opportunity cost</u></i></p><p>Numerous cost-effective programs exist outside this space with no reliance on an underlying healthcare delivery platform. It is difficult to directly compare the utility of allocating funds toward what may be considered more certain avenues for impact, rather than a high-level systems-based approach. Systems based approaches are also likely to have their impact over longer time horizons. As such, one may prefer to allocate their resources to more \u2018certain\u2019 routes of positive impact, from a traditional expected value point of view.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3><p>For those concerned with doing good in the near- and long-term future, global health and wellbeing, and mitigating risks from GCBRs are key issues of concern. Historically, the discourse on progress in global health has fluctuated between vertical and horizontal approaches. Arguments for progress from a cost-effectiveness point of view tend to favour vertical approaches. I argue that by taking a traditionally horizontal, or health systems approach, one can robustly contribute to progress on global health and wellbeing, and mitigating risks from GCBRs, with a reasonable level of confidence. Whilst this approach is not without its own limitations or difficulties, and noting that the two approaches are mutually beneficial, I believe the health systems approach is a relatively neglected stance taken by those concerned with doing good effectively.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Crosspost from my blog at: <a href=\"https://thoughtfulexperiment.blog\">thoughtfulexperiment.blog</a></p><h3><strong>References</strong></h3><p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Decleration of Alma-Ata.

This was written during our time as research fellows at Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/research-training-program\">Research Training Program</a> (Fall 2023).</p>\n<p>In this post, we summarize the main findings of the report. Nonetheless, we invite people interested in the subject to <strong>check out the</strong> <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fXLVeMjNv5ifGeFRpoR5FfTA19YQOUGe\"><strong>full report</strong></a>, which provides much more detail into each topic we outline here.</p>\n<h2>Key takeaways:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>There are several (controlled, peer-reviewed) studies that link the distribution of ceramic filters to less frequent episodes of diarrhea in LMICs. Those studies have been systematically reviewed and graded low to medium quality.</li>\n<li>Existing evidence supports the hypothesis that ceramic filters are even more effective than chlorination to reduce diarrhea episodes. However, percentage reductions here should be taken with a grain of salt due to lack of masking and self-report and publication biases.</li>\n<li>Despite limitations in current evidence, we are cautiously optimistic that ceramic filters can be more cost-effective than chlorination, especially in countries where diarrheal diseases are primarily caused by bacteria and protozoa (and not by viruses). Average household sizes can also play a role, but we are less certain on the extent to which this is true.</li>\n<li>We provide a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R828JuVblEbAlhylS4TFqegsooaIhKVD_nL6BsTSVEc\">Geographic Weighted Factor Model</a> and a country-specific <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rbfptln9Kd3aH1WeHVcvfpUgKVruOSfM1AwoAQwrfxA\">back-of-the envelope analysis</a> of the cost-effectiveness for a hypothetical charity that wants to distribute free ceramic filters in LMICs. Our central scenario for the cost-effectiveness of the intervention in the top prioritized country (Nigeria) is $8.47 U.S. dollars per DALY-averted.</li>\n<li>We ultimately recommend that EA donors and meta-organizations should invest at least some resources in the distribution of ceramic filters, either by bringing up new charities in this area, or by supporting existing, non-EA organizations that already have lots of expertise in how to manufacture, distribute and monitor the usage of the filters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why ceramic filters?</h2>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20231208154513/https://www.unicef.org/supply/media/5221/file/%20household-water-treatment-filters-product-guide.pdf\">plenty of methods</a> to provide access to safe(r) water in very low-resource settings. Each one of those has some pros and cons, but ceramic filters stand out for being cheap to make, easy to install and operate, effective at improving health, and durable (they are said to last for a minimum of 2 years).</p>\n<p>In short, a ceramic filter is a combination of a porous ceramic element and a recipient for the filtered water (usually made of plastic). Water is manually put into the ceramic part and flows through its pores due to gravity. Since pores are very small, they let water pass, but physically block bigger particles - including bacteria, protozoa and sediments - from passing. It is also common for manufacturers to add colloidal silver to the ceramic, which adds another layer of protection by acting as a biocide and preventing growth of bacteria on the surface of the filter.</p>\n<p>(a) <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ZAXeywg7mcgLGeisA/oxktdfjdqgofqsawjwme\" alt=\"Image of a &quot;Purifaaya&quot; ceramic filter with its lid open, showing both the plastic bucket in the outside and the ceramic filtering element inside it\" title=\"Purifaaya water filter available for sale in Rwanda and Uganda\"></p>\n<p>(b)<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ZAXeywg7mcgLGeisA/hcpytjoezv7e6zvycvj8\" alt=\"Schematic representation of how a ceramic filtering element fits inside a plastic bucket with a spigot in it to make a simple &quot;ceramic plus bucket&quot; water filter\" title=\"Schematic representation of a Purifaaya ceramic + bucket filter\"></p>\n<p><em>Image of a bucket ceramic filter available for sale in Rwanda and Uganda (a) and a diagram of its internal anatomy (b).

At the same time, we take advantage of the fact that GiveWell has already <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/water-quality-interventions#:~:text=Overall%2C%20we%20believe%20the%20evidence,the%20size%20of%20the%20effect.\">investigated</a> (and funded) chlorination as a water treatment method, and use this as a benchmark to compare ceramic filters with.</p>\n<h2>How would a charity operate to promote the usage of ceramic filters?</h2>\n<p>The flowchart below provides a graphical representation of the Theory of Change (ToC) we idealize that a charity could implement to distribute free ceramic water filters to populations with low access to clean water in LMICs.</p>\n<p>The proposed charity's Theory of Change is structured around a series of activities leading to desired outputs, outcomes, and eventual impact. The initial phase consists of four key activities: (1) Identifying areas lacking access to clean water and affordable filtering solutions; (2) manufacturing ceramic filters; (3) distributing these filters at the household level; and (4) providing households with education on the proper use and maintenance of these filters. The successful execution of these activities is expected to yield two primary outputs: (5) Community members knowing how to correctly use the filters, and (6) consistently using them. The ultimate goal of this program, reflected in the outcomes and impacts, is threefold: (7) increasing access to cleaner drinking water, (8) significantly reducing the incidence of diarrhea and other waterborne illnesses, and (9) enhancing the overall health of the community.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ZAXeywg7mcgLGeisA/rcnufhibutmat5azfcre\" alt=\"Causal chain demonstrating the Activities, Outputs, Outcomes and Impact from a free ceramic water filter distribution intervention in low and middle income countries\"></p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/14cBAPIoKH-gVd2VOg4IkWq8pU_DYVVNd\">full report</a>, we discuss all of our assumptions and uncertainties behind this causal chain. But, in short, our current biggest concerns about this ToC are related to the ease of manufacturing filters locally (2); the logistics of distribution, filter lifespans and suitability of free versus paid (subsidized) distribution (3); and the rate of adherence (6).</p>\n<h2>What evidence is there to indicate ceramic filters can be an effective way of preventing diarrheal diseases in LMICs?</h2>\n<p>We have analyzed in total three (partially overlapping) systematic reviews that investigate ceramic water filters (among other POU water treatment methods). The more comprehensive of the three is a Cochrane Review by <a href=\"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004794.pub3/full\">Clasen and colleagues (2015)</a>, so our analysis mostly relies on it.</p>\n<p>According to this review, <strong>the pooled risk ratio for diarrhea episodes in the general population subject to POU ceramic filtration interventions was 0.39</strong> (95% CI: 0.29-0.53, 12 studies - all of them cluster-RCTs -, moderate quality evidence, n=5,763, I\u00b2=91%). This means, on average, people in clusters that received ceramic filters reported suffering from 61% less episodes of diarrhea than people in control clusters. This is especially substantial because POU chlorination cluster-RCTs had a pooled effect of only 23% for reducing diarrhea episodes in this same review (RR 0.77, 95%CI 0.65-0.91, 14 studies, low quality evidence, n=30,746, I\u00b2=91%).</p>\n<p>We performed our own <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13-demoRlx4I_qfA2tzZhknOCWRUHshS_sGYl_0mPnW4/#gid=600168932\">subgroup analysis</a> of the ceramic filtration studies selected by Clasen and his colleagues. In this analysis, we separately considered an intervention that provided Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) education together with delivering the filters. We also excluded one study conducted only with HIV-positive subjects, and a study that had been misclassified as using ceramic water filters, but actually used a membrane filter.</p>\n<p><strong>Our final estimate was that the distribution of ceramic filters with_out_ significant WASH education has a pooled effect of 53% for reducing diarrhea episodes</strong> (RR 0.47, 95% CI: 0.41-0.54, 8 studies, n=3,011). We also estimate that adding a WASH education component to the intervention may increase this effect by an additional 12 percentage points (RR 0.35, 95% CI: 0.26-0.47, 1 trial, n=432), but we put low weight on this number because it comes from a single study.</p>\n<p>Besides RCTs, there are also some real-world examples that this sort of intervention can be implemented. While researching ceramic filters, <strong>we found at least</strong> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13-demoRlx4I_qfA2tzZhknOCWRUHshS_sGYl_0mPnW4/#gid=1844414804\"><strong>8 organizations</strong></a> <strong>who already work with local manufacturing and distribution of these filters in LMICs for quite a few years</strong>. For example, we have interviewed two field experts from Pure Home Water, a nonprofit from Ghana that has been using ceramic filters since 2015 to prevent transmission of water borne tropical diseases. These interviews helped us check on some assumptions from our ToC and polish some numbers from our cost-effectiveness analysis.</p>\n<h2>Where would this intervention be most cost-effective and likely to succeed?</h2>\n<p>To answer this question, we developed a Geographic Weighted Factor Model (GWFM) considering four factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The</strong> <a href=\"https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results?params=gbd-api-2019-permalink/61f99011195df80d8778205e8df33c6e\"><strong>rate of DALYs lost</strong></a> <strong>due to diarrheal diseases caused by bacteria and protozoa, attributed to unsafe water consumption per country</strong> <em>(50% of the weight)</em>. This accounts for the scale of the problem in each country. However, we restrict our analysis to bacteria and protozoa because ceramic filters are not considered effective against viruses, and therefore should not be very cost-effective where disease burden from viruses is comparatively higher.</li>\n<li><strong>The Purchase Power Parity</strong> <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/PA.NUS.PPPC.RF\"><strong>conversion factors</strong></a> <strong>from the World Bank</strong> <em>(25% of the weight)</em>. This was used as a proxy for the cost of operating in each country.</li>\n<li><strong>The average</strong> <a href=\"https://globaldatalab.org/areadata/table/hhsize/?levels=1\"><strong>household size</strong></a> <strong>for the country_ (10% of the weight)_</strong>. We consider this relevant because, in general, we expect to distribute only one filter per household. Therefore, the more people in a given household, the more people served with the same initial cost. (While we see some theoretical reasons why the filter lifespan should also be reduced with greater usage, we expect this effect to be less than linear, so the cost-effectiveness would still increase in larger households).</li>\n<li><strong>The 2023</strong> <a href=\"https://fragilestatesindex.org/excel/\"><strong>Fragile State Index</strong></a> <em>(15% of the weight)</em>. This is used as a way of de-prioritizing highly unstable countries that may be very difficult to work with/in. Besides using it as a weighted criteria, we also apply a hard cutoff on this factor to remove such countries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The resulting GWFM was built in accordance with <a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/weighted-factor-model\">Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s guidelines</a> for Weighted Factor Models. The <strong>five top prioritized countries</strong> according to the selected criteria and weights were<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-22airi4Z78j2c8smp-2\" id=\"fnref-22airi4Z78j2c8smp-2\">[2]</a></sup>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Nigeria</li>\n<li>Burundi</li>\n<li>Cameroon</li>\n<li>Eritrea</li>\n<li>Mali</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>How cost-effective can this intervention be?</h2>\n<p>We have assembled some <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rbfptln9Kd3aH1WeHVcvfpUgKVruOSfM1AwoAQwrfxA/#gid=1189929749\">back-of-the-envelope calculations</a> (<a href=\"https://share.descript.com/view/EZFVmGWKIaT\">see video here</a>) of the cost-effectiveness of this intervention. These can be adapted to any country for which we have found underlying data. In our <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/14cBAPIoKH-gVd2VOg4IkWq8pU_DYVVNd\">full report</a>, we provide estimates for Kenya, Malawi and Uganda (because they were the countries considered in GiveWell\u2019s previous <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dxRfhPnTBJ_UYAeoAyVd8u6Orxh4pR9hB3wvdfZcXFs/#gid=255622053\">cost-effectiveness analysis of chlorination interventions</a>), and for Nigeria (the top prioritized country in our GWFM).</p>\n<p>The costs considered were based on four organizations who reported prices on the ceramic filters they manufactured (on average, $17.62 per unit), plus a 50% delivery/overhead cost. We also separately consider the cost for delivering a WASH education package together with the filter (estimated at an additional $12.70 per household). These costs were divided by the country\u2019s average household size and by the filter lifespans (conservatively set at 2 years) to get the costs per person served per year.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness calculation per country was performed in a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Se_gaDm8-kkCi459vuBK4a0RyfDuZ853mtrHvkwStNI\">separate spreadsheet</a> (<em>with an accompanying</em> <a href=\"https://www.loom.com/share/1fdfb284c00348759cdacc8654f76e9f\"><em>introduction video</em></a>). For this, we tried to emulate GiveWell\u2019s analysis of chlorination interventions where possible. However, we diverge from it in that we use odds ratios for all-population diarrhea episodes (from our subgroup analysis of <a href=\"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD004794.pub3/full\">Clasen et al., 2015</a>) and consider it a proxy for reductions in morbidity and mortality - GiveWell, instead, considered reductions in mortality of under-5 years-old children. We also introduce a new external validity adjustment to make reductions in diarrhea cases proportional to the relative burden caused by the relevant pathogen groups (bacteria and protozoa for ceramic filters; bacteria and viruses for chlorination).</p>\n<p>The effectiveness calculations considered impacts coming from reductions in morbidity and mortality both for the under-5s and 5-and-over populations, according to <a href=\"https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results?params=gbd-api-2019-permalink/61f99011195df80d8778205e8df33c6e\">GBD (2019)</a> numbers, filtered for relevant etiologies and multiplied by the estimated effects of the interventions. For mortality and morbidity, we considered both direct reductions in enteric diseases and multiplied them by GiveWell\u2019s estimate for the size of the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hFPbe2ZwmB9athsXT/clean-water-the-incredible-30-mortality-reducer-we-can-t#Part_3__We_already_knew_about_this_anomaly___100_years_ago\">Mills-Reinke phenomenon</a>. We also considered medical costs averted from children under 5 years-old who would counterfactually need treatment; and estimated the developmental effects on the population up to 14 years old.</p>\n<p>The following two tables summarize the results of our analysis. The first table compares the cost-effectiveness with and without a bundled WASH education component. The second table compares the cost-effectiveness (in GiveWell\u2019s moral weight units, equivalent to 1 unit increase in log(consumption) for one individual over a year) for chlorination interventions and ceramic filter interventions.

Further, we found ceramic filters to be 1.3, 2.4, and 3.7 times more cost effective than chlorination in Kenya, Uganda, and Nigeria, respectively.</li>\n<li><strong>Ceramic filters compared to chlorination:</strong> We believe both ceramic filter and chlorination interventions are cost-effective, and the optimal choice depends on factors like disease prevalence and household size. Ceramic filters are often better suited for areas with more bacteria and protozoa-caused diarrhea cases and larger households, while chlorination may be preferable in regions with more viruses or smaller households. To explore these differences in more detail, we've created a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rbfptln9Kd3aH1WeHVcvfpUgKVruOSfM1AwoAQwrfxA/edit#gid=1189929749\">CEA spreadsheet</a> where you can input any country and compare the cost-effectiveness of ceramic filters and chlorination side-by-side.</li>\n<li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> EA donors and organizations should consider partnering with existing non-EA organizations already working with ceramic filters in LMICs. This collaboration can leverage existing expertise, avoid duplication of efforts, and potentially lead to faster, more effective, and culturally sensitive interventions that respect local communities.</li>\n<li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> Based on the available evidence, the report recommends that EA donors and organizations seriously consider investing in a ceramic filter charity, either by supporting existing charities or launching new ones focused on this intervention.</li>\n<li>**Areas for further research: **\n<ul>\n<li>Investigating whether funders should allocate money towards existing charities, towards incubating new charities, or both.</li>\n<li>Exploring evidence that directly links ceramic water filter usage to reductions in morbidity and mortality (instead of only diarrhea episodes).</li>\n<li>Investigating the relationship between household sizes and filter lifespans, and possibly adjusting our CEA accordingly.</li>\n<li>Investigating the potential value of comprehensive WASH interventions alongside ceramic filters to enhance overall health outcomes and cost-effectiveness.</li>\n<li>Examining behavioral constraints to the adoption of ceramic filters, especially in top prioritized countries.</li>\n<li>Using proper uncertainty intervals to model the cost-effectiveness, instead of point estimates of best and worst-case scenarios.</li>\n<li>Experimenting with adjustments for biases in self-reported data and publication bias, or further looking for RCTs that are more resilient to these biases.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, ceramic water filters offer a promising avenue for improving water quality and health in LMICs. While further research is needed to refine cost-effectiveness estimates and address implementation challenges, the potential benefits appear significant enough to warrant further investment and exploration.</p>\n<h2>Acknowledgements and final notes</h2>\n<p>Both authors contributed equally to this report.</p>\n<p>We are extremely grateful to our advisors Leonie Falk and Erik Hausen for their guidance on this report; to Morgan Fairless for the review and suggestions; and to Joel McGuire and Jame Montavon for the informal reviews.

In aggregate, this would make us biased toward more uncertain programs. To remedy this, he recommends that (i) we quantify uncertainty in our models by specifying distributions on key parameters and then running Monte Carlo simulations and (ii) we base decisions on a lower bound of the distribution (e.g., the 20th percentile).

For example, in our vitamin A supplementation cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), we apply skeptical adjustments to treatment effects to bring them closer to what we consider plausible.

GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness models</h1><p>GiveWell uses <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models\">cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA)</a> to help rank charities by their impact. At their most basic level, most of our cost-effectiveness models boil down to three key parameters: the <i>burden</i> of a problem (e.g., how many people die from malaria in the Sahel); the <i>cost</i> of an intervention (e.g., the counterfactual cost of distributing an insecticide-treated net); and the <i>effect</i> of the intervention on the problem (e.g., what fraction of malaria deaths are prevented by people sleeping under insecticide-treated nets). These parameters combine multiplicatively to form a cost-effectiveness estimate, which we express as a multiple of direct cash transfers.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6m6ylmfdwyp\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6m6ylmfdwyp\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>Our cost-effectiveness estimates are the most important (though not only) perspective we use to distinguish between programs (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/how-we-plan-to-approach-uncertainty-in-our-cost#4_3_Placing_all_of_our_weight_on_our_cost_effectiveness_estimates\">more</a>). We have typically expressed both the inputs and output of our models as point estimates, rather than as probability distributions over a range of values. We\u2019d previously <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2017/12/22/uncertain-cost-effectiveness-analysis/\">considered</a> quantifying our uncertainty with distributions, but we weren\u2019t convinced that doing so would produce enough decision-relevant information to justify the time and complexity it would add to our work.</p><h1>2. How and why we plan to quantify uncertainty in our work</h1><h2>2.1 Why we plan to do this</h2><p>We\u2019ve updated our stance in light of feedback we received from our <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/12/15/change-our-mind-contest-winners/\">Change Our Mind contest</a>. We plan to use scenario analysis<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs6u90osi02c\"><sup><a href=\"#fns6u90osi02c\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;more routinely in our work by specifying 25th and 75th percentiles alongside our central (\"best-guess\") estimate for key parameters. We already do this to some extent,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3yiuzt27spf\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3yiuzt27spf\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;but in a fairly ad hoc way, so we plan to do this more consistently going forward. In some cases (e.g., our top charity CEAs), we also plan to specify basic distributions around these percentiles and run <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/montecarlosimulation.asp#:~:text=A%20Monte%20Carlo%20simulation%20is%20a%20model%20used%20to%20predict,in%20prediction%20and%20forecasting%20models\">Monte Carlo simulations</a> to produce a distribution of cost-effectiveness estimates.</p><p>Since we still plan to rank programs by our best-guess cost-effectiveness estimates (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/how-we-plan-to-approach-uncertainty-in-our-cost#3__Why_we_still_plan_to_use_our_central__best_guess__cost_effectiveness_estimates\">more</a>), we don\u2019t anticipate that this change will lead to large shifts in our grantmaking. However, we think there are other reasons to do this that were well-articulated by our Change Our Mind entrants. In particular, we think quantifying the uncertainty in our inputs and outputs will help with:</p><p><strong>Transparency:</strong> We often express our uncertainty qualitatively, saying things like \u201cwe feel particularly uncertain about parameter X in our model.\u201d Without putting numbers on this, we recognize that people may interpret this in different ways, which seems bad for transparently conveying our beliefs.</p><p><strong>Prioritization:</strong> Running Monte Carlo simulations would allow us to conduct global sensitivity analyses, which would help us to identify the parameters in our models that are most critical in driving variation in our bottom line. This seems good for transparency, but also for informing what we should prioritize in our work. For example, it could help flag areas of our model where additional desk research might be most warranted.</p><p><strong>Sense-checks:</strong> We think nudging our researchers to think in terms of distributions would embed healthy sense-checks in our models. For instance, it would help us to interrogate whether our best guess truly represents a mean (vs. a median/mode).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft5rsd58iisi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt5rsd58iisi\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Perspective:</strong> We don\u2019t think we should be placing all of our weight on our cost-effectiveness estimates when making grant decisions (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/how-we-plan-to-approach-uncertainty-in-our-cost#4_3_Placing_all_of_our_weight_on_our_cost_effectiveness_estimates\">more</a>), and we think that \"seeing\" just how uncertain these estimates are will be a helpful reminder to avoid doing this.</p><h2>2.2 How we plan to do this</h2><p>We plan to specify 25th and 75th percentiles based on our subjective beliefs, rather than basing them on, e.g., the percentiles implied by the 95% confidence interval reported around a treatment effect. That\u2019s because (i) we don\u2019t have objective measures of uncertainty for most parameters in our model<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdpybmturgam\"><sup><a href=\"#fndpybmturgam\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and (ii) basing distributions on statistical uncertainty alone seems too restrictive. For example, the 95% confidence interval around a treatment effect can\u2019t account for concerns we have about the identification strategy,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgf8637ybm8b\"><sup><a href=\"#fngf8637ybm8b\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;or whether we understand the underlying drivers of the effect,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwg96mjds1yr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwg96mjds1yr\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;both of which typically influence how confident we feel about the reported effect. So, while the statistical confidence interval might serve as a reasonable first pass estimate, we plan to adjust it in light of these other considerations.</p><p>We don\u2019t plan to move our analysis to R, Python, or another programming language. Despite their simplicity, we think spreadsheet-based models have a number of advantages: they allow us to easily \"see\" the assumptions driving the bottom line (which helps us vet bad assumptions and catch simple mistakes), and they keep our work accessible to people without programming backgrounds, including our some of our staff, donors, and subject matter experts. We\u2019re still deciding on the best way to operationalize simple Monte Carlos within this framework,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo4h8g9gzgll\"><sup><a href=\"#fno4h8g9gzgll\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;but we plan to stick with spreadsheet-based models going forward.</p><p>To see what quantifying uncertainty in our models might look like, Figure 1 illustrates a simplified cost-effectiveness model of an Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) long-lasting insecticide-treated bed net (LLIN) campaign in Uganda, with the 25th and 75th percentiles specified for the key inputs and bottom-line.</p><p><strong>Figure 1: Simple AMF model with quantified uncertainty, Uganda</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1wfv0gv828q\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1wfv0gv828q\">[11]</a></sup></span></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td><strong>Best guess</strong></td><td><strong>25th pctile</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflhgxn9e742\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlhgxn9e742\">[12]</a></sup></span></td><td><strong>75th pctile</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Grant size (arbitrary)</td><td style=\"width:105px\">$1,000,000</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Under 5 mortality benefits</strong>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Cost per person under age five reached</td><td>$22</td><td>$18</td><td>$30<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwttkw31tvf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwttkw31tvf\">[13]</a></sup></span></td></tr><tr><td>Number of people under age five reached</td><td>65,838</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Years of effective coverage provided by nets</td><td>2.0</td><td>1.5</td><td>2.3</td></tr><tr><td>Malaria-attributable mortality rate among people under age five</td><td>0.6%</td><td>0.3%</td><td>0.9%</td></tr><tr><td>Effect of LLIN distributions on deaths related to malaria</td><td>51%</td><td>45%</td><td>58%</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Percentage of program impact from other benefits</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Mortalities averted for people age five and older</td><td>15%</td><td>10%</td><td>25%</td></tr><tr><td>Developmental benefits (long-term income increases)</td><td>71%</td><td>37%</td><td>102%</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Additional adjustments</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Adjustment for additional program benefits and downsides</td><td>38%</td><td>26%</td><td>51%</td></tr><tr><td>Adjustment for charity-level factors</td><td>-4%</td><td>-10%</td><td>0%</td></tr><tr><td>Adjustment for funging</td><td>-33%</td><td>-58%</td><td>-14%</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Final cost-effectiveness estimates</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Cost-effectiveness (x direct cash transfers)</td><td>18x</td><td>7x</td><td>27x</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h1>3. Why we still plan to use our central (best guess) cost-effectiveness estimates</h1><p>Noah Haber, one of the winners of our Change Our Mind contest, <a href=\"https://www.metacausal.com/givewells-uncertainty-problem/\">argues</a> that after running Monte Carlo simulations, we should then base our grantmaking decisions on a lower bound of the resulting distribution (e.g., the 20th percentile). They argue that doing so would help prevent us from over-selecting programs with especially noisy cost-effectiveness estimates (i.e., being susceptible to the \"optimizer\u2019s curse\").</p><p>We don\u2019t think we should do this because we don\u2019t think it would improve our decision-making. To outline our reasoning, we want to explain (i) how we think the optimizer\u2019s curse might crop up in our work, (ii) how the problem is theoretically addressed, (iii) the extent to which our current best-guess estimates already address the problem, and (iv) why we think basing our decisions on a lower bound would risk over-correcting our best-guess (i.e., shifting our decisions further from our actual beliefs), worsening our decision-making.</p><h2>3.1 The Optimizer\u2019s Curse</h2><p>We find it easiest to start with the simplest case: imagine that instead of optimizing for cost-effectiveness, GiveWell just funded whichever programs had the largest treatment effects in the global health and development literature. If we took these treatment effects at face value, we think this would be a surefire way we\u2019d be getting \"cursed\" \u2014 we\u2019d be systematically biased toward programs with more uncertain evidence bases.</p><p><strong>Figure 2: The Optimizer\u2019s Curse (illustrative)</strong></p><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/wewyzifffjpiqds9wu2x\" alt=\"Image illustrating the Optimizer's Curse\"></strong></p><p>The theoretical way to address this problem, as outlined in <a href=\"https://jimsmith.host.dartmouth.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The_Optimizers_Curse.pdf\">this</a> article, is to <i>not</i> take noisy data at face value, but to instead combine them with a Bayesian prior. This prior should take into account other sources of information beyond the point estimate \u2014 be that in the form of other data points or less-structured intuition.</p><h2>3.2 How we try to address this within the model</h2><h3>3.2.1 Treatment effects</h3><p>We think our approach to interpreting treatment effects is conceptually similar to this idea. We don\u2019t take literature treatment effects at face value, but instead adjust them based on plausibility caps, other data points, and common-sense intuition. These adjustments enter our models through our internal validity (IV) or replicability adjustments, which make a big difference to our final estimates. For example:</p><p><strong>Deworming</strong>: We apply a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1otZFJSMM8yH5R6DkBIYmlsWy5T7VHsX_E7wDF7HSLaM/edit#gid=472531943&amp;range=B11\">13% adjustment</a> (i.e., an 87% downweight) to long-run Miguel and Kremer RCT results which find that childhood deworming increases adult income by 10% per year.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6tvqqbpw954\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6tvqqbpw954\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We\u2019re reluctant to take this estimate at face value because (i) this result has not been replicated elsewhere and (ii) it seems implausibly large given the more muted effects on intermediate outcomes (e.g., years of schooling).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefglbu28zwcvp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnglbu28zwcvp\">[15]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Seasonal malaria chemoprevention</strong>: We think the evidence base for this program is especially high-quality: the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ROI6dRdKsNfXg5gIyBa1_7eYOjowfbw5n65zkrLnvc/edit#gid=791021775&amp;range=A22\">headline treatment effect</a> we use is based on a Cochrane meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (Meremikwu et al. 2012), all of which seemed well-conducted and reported results in a reasonably consistent direction.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnczlr53pbil\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnczlr53pbil\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As such, we take this result <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ROI6dRdKsNfXg5gIyBa1_7eYOjowfbw5n65zkrLnvc/edit#gid=791021775&amp;range=A24\">more-or-less at face value</a>.</p><p><strong>Vitamin A supplementation:</strong> We apply a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1otZFJSMM8yH5R6DkBIYmlsWy5T7VHsX_E7wDF7HSLaM/edit#gid=1070538669&amp;range=A34\">74% adjustment</a> to headline results from a Cochrane meta-analysis. We apply a steeper adjustment here in comparison to SMC because we think the underlying trials may be less high-quality,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0yhgexaewfaj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0yhgexaewfaj\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and because we have a weaker understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying the mortality effect.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs1rkankgmvm\"><sup><a href=\"#fns1rkankgmvm\">[18]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Acute malnutrition treatment:</strong> The evidence we rely on to estimate the effect of this program is non-randomized (for ethical reasons).

These adjustments make a big difference to our final treatment effects \u2014 and by extension to our cost-effectiveness estimates \u2014 with programs that have (what we consider to be) weaker evidence bases receiving greater penalties. We make these adjustments precisely because of the concern Noah identifies: we don\u2019t want to be biased toward programs whose evidence seems more susceptible to mismeasurement.</p><p><strong>Figure 3: IV adjustments in our models</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnldnolmnoyo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnldnolmnoyo\">[20]</a></sup></span></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/mqm6ppcbwv8cc6lymnzf\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/ryiv2uvb2vofm0racztb 130w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/wwd2g8lholznzhnhgmql 260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/d89dqe1itce1cwnwr2ih 390w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/uwdqjq7qnlscpw4yxkpl 520w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/qmijx47evikfrxng9w4g 650w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/rxgtmnbej3vflmoqjmh5 780w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/aiysoexmoxfakt1a6bmh 910w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/llflfps05ms9r5iweo94 1040w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/r6wcjfy3sz4lnf8xw006 1170w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/pe62wieinjchyoae9qh9 1201w\"></figure><p>In making these adjustments, we don\u2019t use formal Bayesian techniques \u2014 i.e., we don\u2019t specify a prior in the form of a mathematical distribution and then update from this in light of the distribution we specify around the treatment effect. We view this as a separate practical question of how best to operationalize a Bayesian approach. We think there are good reasons to prefer a more informal approach: specifying distributions for each parameter would be very time-consuming, would still ultimately be very subjective, and would mean moving our models to a more sophisticated statistical package, which we think would have big consequences for the accessibility of our work. With this being said, we recognize that a more formal approach may force a certain degree of consistency between our models, and so we plan to revisit the relative merits of injecting more formalism into our IV adjustments later this year.</p><h3>3.2.2 Other parameters</h3><p>In reality, we don\u2019t just base our decisions on treatment effects; we combine these effects with estimates of program costs, disease burdens, and other factors. The optimizer\u2019s curse would still be a big problem if, to estimate these other parameters, we just plugged noisy data points into our model without subjecting them to scrutiny.</p><p>For the most part, we think this is a bad description of how we arrive at our best-guess. For example:</p><p><strong>Costs</strong>: We don\u2019t take charity cost information at face value. We typically make adjustments based on expert opinion, additional data points, and triangulations with other programs. For example, to estimate the cost of vitamin A supplementation, we use cross-country averages of cost per supplement administered in cases where we think charity data suggests implausibly low cost estimates;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefr9x6xdtf2p\"><sup><a href=\"#fnr9x6xdtf2p\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;to estimate the cost of delivering LLINs, we triangulate AMF's reported costs to procure and distribute LLINs with the Global Fund's cost estimates and a costing study conducted by Malaria Consortium;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbht299vps56\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbht299vps56\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;for newer programs, we often benchmark our cost assumptions against our top charity cost estimates (which are generally informed by more data).</p><p><strong>Burden</strong>: When we model health-focused programs, we typically estimate burden using third-party estimates produced by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). These estimates are quite far-removed from noisy survey data; in most cases, they are the output of Bayesian models (i.e., these are already posterior estimates with Bayesian adjustments baked-in). For example, IHME's malaria incidence estimates come from <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(19)31097-9.pdf\">this</a> paper, which \u201cuses a Bayesian space-time geostatistical model to predict <i>P. falciparum</i> parasite rates [for ages 2-10] for every 5\u00d75 km pixel across all of sub-Saharan Africa annually from 2000\u201317.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffavdyz1ah36\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfavdyz1ah36\">[23]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Others</strong>: for parameters where we have no primary data to go on whatsoever (e.g., time of policy speed-up for advocacy programs), we typically arrive at our best-guess by (i) starting with a mental model about what timeframe seems reasonable and (ii) incrementally updating away from this model based on conversations with experts, case studies from other countries, etc. Our AMF funging <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uiT6New2aXRB9qyrcQODhflnRR8QOZk-g1_9qaRRqjo/edit#heading=h.rwj4ageqr269\">write-up</a> is a good example of this type of approach.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxsfnswp1z1l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxsfnswp1z1l\">[24]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It explains how we started with a prior expectation of the funding landscape based on global funding gaps, that we incrementally updated from based on conversations with other funders and learning idiosyncratic details about the funding situation of specific countries. To sum up, we think that for most parameters our best-guess reflects our posterior beliefs \u2014 i.e., where we\u2019ve arrived after triangulating between multiple sources of information and gut checking them against our intuition. We think this approach is the most sensible first line of defense in guarding against the optimizer\u2019s curse; it certainly leaves us less susceptible than if we were just putting noisy data points into our models uncritically.</p><h2>3.3 Why we don\u2019t plan to base decisions on a lower bound</h2><p>Noah suggests that after running Monte Carlo simulations, we should base decisions on a lower bound of the output (e.g., the 20th percentile; p(&gt; direct cash transfer)). We don\u2019t plan to do this, because we think this would amount to over-updating on our best guess.</p><p>To see why, we also find it helpful to go back to the simple case. Imagine that instead of funding the programs that have the largest treatment effects, GiveWell now funds the programs that have the largest ratio of treatment effects to costs.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg0stzt1sj4m\"><sup><a href=\"#fng0stzt1sj4m\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Assume also that costs are certain (to get a handle on the intuition). If we\u2019re already skeptically adjusting the treatment effect, we don\u2019t think we should <i>also</i> be skeptically adjusting the cost-effectiveness estimate, since our within-the-model adjustments should already be accounting for noise in the signal. If we base decisions on a lower bound, we think we would over-penalize more uncertain programs like deworming.</p><p>To avoid over-correcting, we could:</p><ul><li>Strip out the skeptical adjustments that are already in our models (e.g., IV adjustments; adjustments to charity cost data).</li><li>Input data points at face value (e.g., the 10% deworming treatment effect from <a href=\"http://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/assets/miguel_research/64/Worms-at-Work_2016-07-12_FINAL_CLEAN.pdf\">Baird et al. 2016</a>; raw cost estimates from the charity).</li><li>Specify distributions around these estimates and run Monte Carlo simulations.</li><li>Do an \"all-in\" adjustment to this bottom-line. Rather than base decisions on a fixed lower bound (e.g., the 20th percentile), we would prefer to do this more flexibly \u2014 i.e., regress our cost-effectiveness estimates toward a program-specific prior, which we think would better incorporate our actual beliefs.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0efv4wfpqa9f\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0efv4wfpqa9f\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We think this modeling approach would be possible in principle but a bad idea in practice, because:</p><ul><li>We find it easier to bring intuition/common sense to bear on individual parameters than composite bottom-line cost-effectiveness estimates. For example, we think we have better-founded (though still highly subjective) priors for what seems like a plausible effect of deworming on adult income vs. what seems like a plausible cost-effectiveness estimate for a deworming program.</li><li>If we relied on an all-in adjustment, we don\u2019t think we\u2019d be able to answer basic questions like \u201cwhat is our best-guess about the effect of deworming on adult income?\u201d That seems bad both for transparency and for enabling basic sense-checks of our beliefs.</li><li>We\u2019re not sure what we would do about parameters that aren\u2019t based on any data. If we think the inputs for these parameters best represent our posterior beliefs, we don\u2019t think we should be indirectly adjusting them based on the distribution that we set around them.</li><li>We think that all-in adjustments would be more liable to basic human error. If we used this approach, our individual parameters would become untethered from intuitive judgment, which we think would make it more likely for bad assumptions and simple mistakes to slip through undetected.</li></ul><p>In sum, we think uncertainty in our parameters is best dealt with <i>within</i> the model, rather than via indirect adjustments to the bottom line. We can\u2019t prove this, because we can\u2019t observe the \"true\" cost-effectiveness of the programs we model, but we feel more confident that our within-the-model adjustments get us closer to the truth because of the difficulties listed above.</p><h1>4. Pitfalls of this approach (and how we plan to avoid them)</h1><p>We think there are three main ways our approach could fall short; this section outlines these pitfalls and how we intend to guard against them.</p><h2>4.1 Inconsistent within-the-model adjustments</h2><p>The most obvious way we think our approach could fail is if we don\u2019t do the thing we think we ought to be doing \u2014 i.e., if we just plug in raw data at face value without subjecting it to common-sense scrutiny. We\u2019ve identified a couple of examples of this kind of mistake in our work, which we think help clarify how the optimizer\u2019s curse might manifest itself \u2014 and how we think it\u2019s best dealt with.</p><p><strong>Example 1: Insecticide resistance</strong></p><p>LLINs are one of the major programs we fund. A key input in our model for this program is the effect of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1otZFJSMM8yH5R6DkBIYmlsWy5T7VHsX_E7wDF7HSLaM/edit#gid=1364064522&amp;range=A49\">insecticide resistance</a> on LLIN efficacy; put simply, in countries where we think insecticide resistance is more of a concern, we think LLINs are likely to be less cost-effective.</p><p>To <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DBt7wcOv7aL0MXlPoUNmur-Z7TaxCqgCfJKnYUHSzWU/edit\">estimate</a> insecticide resistance across countries, we look at bioassay test results on mosquito mortality. These tests essentially expose mosquitoes to insecticide and record the percentage of mosquitoes that die. The tests are very noisy: in many countries, bioassay test results range from 0% to 100% \u2014 i.e., the maximum range possible. To come up with country-specific estimates, we take the average of all tests that have been conducted in each country and do not make any further adjustments to bring the results more in line with our common-sense intuition.</p><p>We think we should be wary of estimating insecticide resistance this way. In this case, we think taking noisy data at face value leads to implausibly large cross-country differences. For example, we apply a much larger (59%) adjustment for insecticide resistance in Chad than in Nigeria (14%), despite the fact that the two countries neighbor each other. A more principled way of adjusting for insecticide resistance would be to regress the raw differences in bioassay test result averages toward a common-sense prior, which would capture the intuition that insecticide resistance in Nigeria is probably informative about insecticide resistance in Chad. Other papers effectively take this kind of approach, using Bayesian ensemble models that don\u2019t impose arbitrary cut-offs at country borders.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwng7liu0fnk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwng7liu0fnk\">[27]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;When we compare one example of these estimates to ours (Figure 4), we see that the Bayesian model yields much smoother estimates across space \u2014 which seems more reasonable.</p><p><strong>Figure 4: Our insecticide resistance estimates vs. output of a Bayesian model</strong></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Panel A: our estimates</td><td>Panel B: estimates from <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2006781117\">Moyes et al.

In particular, we may be misallocating funding away from Chad, where our method for aggregating noisy bioassay data may overstate the problem of insecticide resistance. We plan to fix this problem \"at the source\" \u2014 i.e., adjusting our insecticide resistance assumptions until they seem like more defensible best guesses. This might mean plugging in the third-party modeling estimates directly, or relying on simple heuristics (e.g., regress noisy cross-country data toward a regional mean).</p><p><strong>Example 2: Etiology adjustments for the rotavirus vaccine</strong></p><p>Another major program area we support is childhood immunization, which we\u2019ve supported via grants to New Incentives and IRD (cash incentives) and Suvita (SMS reminders). To model the cost-effectiveness of these programs, we need to take a stance on the share of deaths that a vaccine prevents for a given disease. This assumption enters our cost-effectiveness estimates through our etiology adjustments; our adjustments for New Incentives can be found <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WaqYfYWve4VsAde8swxsZvnl5VUsKkxBxKQ-W_UEgKE/edit#gid=1898938765&amp;range=A85\">here</a> and for Suvita <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-8qH7TbCClJD7kunFsuanrdyCIlcIf0zvzlzGbI20Tw/edit#gid=1951692419&amp;range=A85\">here</a>.</p><p>To estimate an etiology adjustment for the rotavirus vaccine, which targets diarrhoeal deaths, we do the following:</p><ul><li>Take raw IHME data on the number of deaths from diarrhea among under 5s in the sub-regions where these programs operate</li><li>Take raw IHME data on the number of deaths from rotavirus (a subset of diarrheal deaths)</li><li>Divide the two to get an estimate of the % of diarrhea deaths in each region that could be targeted by the rotavirus vaccine</li></ul><p>As Figure 5 shows, this leads to implausibly large differences between countries; we effectively assume that the rotavirus vaccine is almost completely ineffective at preventing diarrhoeal deaths in India.

However, we think this is a good example of when we should be especially wary of the optimizer\u2019s curse: when we slice and dice data in multiple ways (e.g., by age, region, and disease type), we leave ourselves especially vulnerable to selecting on noise. Again, we think the most sensible place to fix this is within the model, rather than through an indirect adjustment to our bottom line.</p><h2>4.2 Ignoring counterintuitive differences in our outputs</h2><p>Suppose we face the following scenario:</p><ul><li>We start out feeling indifferent about program A and program B; both seem equally promising.</li><li>We build a cost-effectiveness model of program A and program B, being careful to interpret raw data skeptically and ensure each input reflects our considered best guess.</li><li>Our model spits out a cost-effectiveness estimate of 20x for program A and 10x for program B.</li><li>This difference feels counterintuitive; we don\u2019t intuitively buy that program A is twice as cost-effective as program B.</li></ul><p>Although we think it\u2019d be a mistake to apply a blanket adjustment to this bottom line (e.g., shrink program A to 15x), we also think it\u2019d be a mistake to ignore this intuition entirely. Instead, we think we should use it as a prompt to interrogate our models. Faced with this scenario, we think we should (i) identify the parts of the models that are driving this difference in cost-effectiveness (sensitivity analysis should help with this), and (ii) reconsider whether the differences between these inputs seem intuitively plausible. If not, we should adjust our assumptions until they do.</p><p>More broadly, if our cost-effectiveness estimates seem out of step with our intuition, we think this should prompt us to interrogate both our cost-effectiveness estimates <i>and</i> our big-picture intuition. We think we should ideally work from \"both directions,\" until our cost-effectiveness model and our intuition feel more-or-less aligned.</p><h2>4.3 Placing all of our weight on our cost-effectiveness estimates</h2><p>Whether we used our approach or Noah\u2019s, we think our cost-effectiveness models would still be subject to two overarching limitations:</p><ul><li><strong>Bad adjustments</strong>. Both of our approaches amount to skeptically adjusting evidence we\u2019re more uncertain about. We think we\u2019re more likely to make better adjustments to individual parameters than bottom-line cost-effectiveness estimates (for reasons discussed <a href=\"#heading=h.teicyar0kter\">here</a>), but we\u2019re not going to always get these right. For example, we apply an 87% downweight to the effect of deworming on adult income to get it closer to the \"true\" effect \u2014 but we could be under- or over-correcting.</li><li><strong>Structural uncertainty</strong>. Parameter-by-parameter adjustments can\u2019t deal with structural uncertainty (i.e., whether we\u2019ve chosen the right parameters to model in the first place). But we don\u2019t think basing decisions on the 20th percentile of a Monte Carlo simulation can deal with this problem either, since this output is entirely determined by whatever parameters we\u2019ve decided to model in the first place. If we\u2019ve omitted important benefit streams, for instance, both our point estimates and our distributions would be misleading.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpjjkeayfuk9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpjjkeayfuk9\">[31]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We think these issues point to broader dangers of relying on an entirely quantitative or \"rules-based\" approach to decision-making and underscore the need to take outside-the-model perspectives seriously. In practice, we do this by asking more qualitative questions alongside our quantitative ones, such as:</p><ul><li>What do experts we trust think about this program? Are they excited by it?</li><li>Do we intuitively buy the theory of change? Can we write down a compelling qualitative case for making this grant?</li><li>Do we trust the management of this charity/implementor to do a good job? Does the grantee have a good track record?</li></ul><p>We don\u2019t always try to convert the answers to these questions to the same \"currency\" as our cost-effectiveness estimates, because we think entertaining multiple perspectives ultimately makes our decision-making more robust. We\u2019ve previously written about this <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/\">here</a>, and we think these arguments still ring true. In particular, we think cluster-style thinking (Figure 6) handles unknown-unknowns in a more robust way, as we find that expert opinion is often a good predictor of \u201cwhich way the arguments I haven\u2019t thought of yet will point.\u201d We also think this approach better-reflects successful prediction systems in other contexts, e.g., political forecasting or finance.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmwr5t42elsp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmwr5t42elsp\">[32]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Our view was reaffirmed during this investigation: when we spoke to other decision-makers in finance and philanthropy<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4hgyhh5uiut\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4hgyhh5uiut\">[33]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;\u2014 who we think face similarly high-stakes decisions in uncertain environments \u2014 none of them said they would ever base their decisions entirely on the output of a quantitative model. The reasons they gave were similar to the points raised above, e.g., to paraphrase: \u201cwe\u2019d be worried about being led astray by a single bad assumption; we know our models are unlikely to be capturing everything we care about.\u201d</p><p><strong>Figure 6: Cluster-based reasoning</strong></p><p><img style=\"width:71.74%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/NWmBkMe3yF4GQNnai/ewxseterde6vnmyexmjt\" alt=\"Example of cluster thinking with size of circles showing robustness of perspective\"></p><p>We have typically considered our cost-effectiveness estimates to be our most important perspective and expect we will continue to do so. Despite all of the difficulties we have discussed, we still think quantitative models are the most transparent and democratic tool we have to place programs in a comparative framework and make difficult trade-offs between them. But we think there are reasons to be wary about putting all of our eggs in this basket, so we want to leave space for less formal intuition to influence our decision making.</p><h1>5. How we could be wrong</h1><p>We think our bottom line on the optimizer\u2019s curse is most likely to be wrong if:</p><ul><li><strong>We\u2019re wrong about our within-the-model adjustments.</strong> We adjust raw data points to accord with our intuition and other data sources, but we don\u2019t know whether we\u2019re making the \"right\" adjustments. For example, we apply an 87% downweight to the effect of deworming on adult income, but we could be under- or over-correcting</li><li><strong>Basing decisions on a lower bound would get us closer to the truth.</strong> Stripping out within-the-model adjustments and basing decisions on a lower bound of a Monte Carlo simulation is another way we could address the optimizer\u2019s curse. We think we have good reasons to prefer our approach (see <a href=\"#heading=h.teicyar0kter\">here</a>), but we can\u2019t prove this definitively</li><li><strong>Incorporating outside-the-model perspectives introduces inconsistency.</strong> Though we think incorporating outside-the-model perspectives seems more conducive to <i>accurate</i> predictions, we recognize that basing decisions entirely on a single model may be more consistent. We think this trade-off is worth it, though we plan to consider ways we can ensure our qualitative lens is being brought to bear consistently across programs.</li></ul><p>We think our decision to quantify uncertainty going forward is most likely to be wrong if doing so adds too much time and complexity to our models. We think there are good reasons for doing this (elaborated <a href=\"#heading=h.ufkn9rz47sjs\">here</a>), but we\u2019re wary that specifying percentiles and distributions may add clunk to our investigation process, since this may eat into the time we have available for (what we consider to be) the more important tasks of vetting the accuracy of our best guess assumptions, considering outside-the-model perspectives, and exploring new grant opportunities. One alternative to our current proposal would be to just specify 25th and 75th percentiles around key parameters and not run Monte Carlo simulations. We think this would get us a reasonable amount of juice in terms of transparency and sense-checks \u2014 and would be faster and simpler. Though we think the additional diagnostics and transparency benefits of doing Monte Carlo simulations seem worth it for our top charities, we may revisit this decision in light of our experiences over the next few months.</p><h1>6. Next steps</h1><p>Going forward, we plan to:</p><ul><li><strong>Incorporate sensitivity analysis in published models.</strong> We\u2019ve begun this process by incorporating basic sensitivity analysis on key parameters in recent grant and intervention report pages (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/oral-rehydration-solution-zinc\">zinc/ORS</a>; <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/nutrition-international-VAS-chad-may-2023\">vitamin A supplementation</a>; <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/miraclefeet-clubfoot-treatment-january-2023\">MiracleFeet</a>). We\u2019re currently revamping our top charity CEAs to make them more legible, and we plan to incorporate sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlos into these before publishing.</li><li><strong>Keep tabs on assumptions based on raw data</strong>. We think taking raw data at face value is a telltale sign that we're being insufficiently skeptical. We\u2019ve identified a few places where we think this is happening <a href=\"#heading=h.s27zkuecf6w\">here</a>, but we haven\u2019t done a full audit of every assumption in our top charity models (and even less time has been spent looking at our assumptions about programs to which we direct less funding). We\u2019re currently performing a comprehensive internal review of our new top charity CEAs and plan to keep track of any parameters where we think we might be being insufficiently skeptical.</li><li><strong>Revisit IHME burden estimates.</strong> While we think these estimates come from models with Bayesian adjustments baked-in, we also don\u2019t think we should be taking these estimates at face value, especially if they diverge from other data sources or our intuition. We\u2019d like to get a better understanding of what\u2019s going on \"under the hood\" of these estimates, to help us understand whether we should be adjusting them further.</li><li><strong>Improve guidelines for applying skeptical adjustments within our models</strong>. A long-term objective of ours is to develop a more uniform approach to how we apply skeptical adjustments in our models. In particular, we think this means (i) revamping our internal guidelines for how to do these adjustments, (ii) keeping track of assumptions centrally to ensure easy triangulations across models, (iii) standardizing our terminology, and (iv) conducting more extensive peer review to ensure we\u2019re being consistent.</li></ul><h2>Notes</h2><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn8rkm2zs5tqv\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref8rkm2zs5tqv\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>For an explanation of the Optimizer\u2019s Curse, refer to the winner of our Change Our Mind contest entry <a href=\"https://www.metacausal.com/givewells-uncertainty-problem/\">here</a>.
