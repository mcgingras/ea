According to Wikipedia, \u201c44% of Peruvians born in the United States over the age of 25 have college degrees,[8] exceeding the US national average of 24%.\u201d Last year when I checked the US Census data website\u2019s most recent data, it showed around 36%, if I remember correctly.</p>\n<p>Working with the Institute for Liberty and Democracy based in Lima can have a high impact too.
