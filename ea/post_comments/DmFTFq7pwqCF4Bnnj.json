The positive ones are the first-order effects: hopefully people actually make better career choices and this helps the world. I have some fears about the second-order effects though. Mainly, I worry that (mainly through social dynamics) some people are pushed out of careers where they would actually have more impact, by moving into careers where they can't thrive as well, and thus grow less and end up making less of a difference on the world. It's hard to judge this impact on those people's lives, since it shows up slowly and over time.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "lincolnq"}}, {"_id": "hPYdBtwwcpzbuwPBk", "postedAt": "2022-10-29T20:43:05.939Z", "postId": "DmFTFq7pwqCF4Bnnj", "htmlBody": "<p>The  deprioritization of nonlongtermist issues, orgs and paths.
