Some of the paranoia\u2014rumor-mill references to secret Google docs and ruthless clandestine councils\u2014seemed overstated, but there was a core cadre that exercised control over public messaging; its members debated, for example, how to formulate their position that climate change was probably not as important as runaway A.I. without sounding like denialists or jerks.\" (New Yorker)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What makes EA, <em>EA</em>, what makes EA antifragile, is its ruthless transparency. If we are self-censoring because we have <em>already concluded something is super effective</em>, then there is no point in EA. Go do your own thing with your own money. Become Bill Gates. But don't associate with EA.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Being honest, I do genuinely think that climate change is less important than runaway AI, primarily because of both option value issues and the stakes of the problem. One is a big problem that could hurt or kill millions, while AI could kill billions.</p>\n<p>But I'm concerned that they couldn't simply state why they believe AI is more important than climate change rather than do this over-complicated scheme.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Finances should be partially anonymized. If an EA org receives some money above a certain threshold from an individual contribution, we should be transparent in saying that we will reject said money if it is not donated anonymously. You may protest that this would decrease the number of donations by rich billionaires. But take it this way: if they donate to EA, it's because they believe that EA can spend it better. Thus, they should be willing to donate anonymously, to not affect how EA spends money. If they don't donate to EA, then they can establish a different philanthropic organization and hire EA-adjacent staff, making for more competition.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Disagree, this would make transparency worse without providing much benefit.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li>The new button of \"support\" is great, but I think EA forum should have a way to <em>sort</em> by controversiality.

The red-teaming and self-criticism are excellent, but if the only way we aggregate how \"good\" red-teaming is is by up-votes, that is flawed. Perhaps the best way to know that criticism has touched a nerve is to compute a fraction: how many members of the community disagree vs how many agree.

I'm sure there are lots of criticisms that have been produced over the years about the kind of extreme utilitarianism that EA ostensibly promotes so I'm a little bit surprised that people are shocked that a concern highlighted in some of these criticisms has materialized. I guess that it maybe proves that EA criticism is more of an intellectual exercise rather than something that is truly digested and taken into account. The only thing that can burst an ideological bubble is when a catastrophe makes it clear that the ideology in question does not match reality. If EA survives the ensuing media fire storm (and probably a Netflix show that will be produced as a result of this conflagration) then I expect it will go back into an ideological bubble until the next time it pops.  My  bet on the next pop is when it becomes painfully clear that the ideological thinking behind imminent AI catastrophe doesn't match the facts on the ground but hopefully that will have less collateral damage on people outside of EA circles.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": null}, {"_id": "C57gx8vDz4GDAvw8k", "postedAt": "2022-11-11T19:27:34.496Z", "postId": "9YodZj6J6iv3xua4f", "htmlBody": "<p>I don't understand #3.
