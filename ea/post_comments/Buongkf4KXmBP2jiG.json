That sounds terrible, and I understand his and your anger about this. Unfortunately, there are a great deal of problems in the world, so EA's need to think carefully about where we should allocate our resources to do as much good as we can. Currently, <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">you can save a life for around 3500-5500 USD</a>, or for animals, focusing on factory farming can lead to tremendous gains (Animal Charity Evaluators estimates that lobbying for cage-free campaigns for hens can lead to <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-humane-league/#c3\">multiple hen-years affected per dollar</a>).<br><br>So, we need to consider how much it would cost to fix this problem. Building a better enclosure would cost a great deal of money, as would convincing the zoo to let the tiger be released and transported back to its home continent. I don't know how much construction costs, but it definitely wouldn't be in the four figures. I'd estimate six figures, minimum. Even if it were five figures, this is enough to save multiple human lives, or prevent tens of thousands of chickens living even more wretched lives.<br><br>I don't want to trivialise the problem you've mentioned. It's an injustice. However, this injustice is far from unique. Millions of people and animals are suffering right now, and since we cannot help them all, EA focuses on trying to help as many as we can.&nbsp;<br><br>This cause prioritisation is at the heart of the EA movement. &nbsp;If you've got questions, I'd be happy to answer them as best I can, whether here or via PM.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "7xCpuyczuQPHh4Yn7", "user": {"username": "Jay Bailey"}}, {"_id": "r3rxAwoLwgCdostfw", "postedAt": "2022-12-14T18:41:14.736Z", "postId": "Buongkf4KXmBP2jiG", "htmlBody": "<p>Hey David, congrats on launching this! Really well-designed site. So great to see the WAS discussion steadily spreading out of academia. It's obviously still quite fringe, but it's progressing faster than I expected. Big thanks to people like you, Humane Hancock and others who are laying the groundwork to bring the discussion into the mainstream.</p><p>I thought I'd let you know that my bank card was temporarily blocked due to \"Vegan Hacktivists\" sounding shady to someone at my bank's fraud department - I'm not sure if you can change this with Donorbox or your bank, but if you can it might make sense. Although this could be a rare/one-off thing that has only happened to me.</p><p>Also, while I'm here, some random bits of feedback - please feel free to completely ignore these:</p><ul><li>It would be great to have a \"promising directions\" page to show people that, actually, there are tractable things that can already be worked on. E.g. many countries have already ~eliminated certain diseases that cause a lot of suffering for wild animals - like rabies, via mass vaccination. And contraceptive baits are already in use to control population sizes of certain r-selected species. These programs are currently \"selfish\" in that they're mainly for the benefit of humans, rather than to help the wild animals themselves, but it shows that tractable and large-scale programs are possible, which is exciting and I think somewhat surprising to many people.</li><li>It may make sense to have a page that tries to put a \"vivid\" picture in the reader's mind about what suffering can be like in the wild. The existing pages give statistics and broad descriptions, but humans often benefit from stories/descriptions of individuals - e.g. (as mentioned in one of the videos you embedded) a deer suffocating to death due to nasal bots, or a young chick that falls out of the nest and dies over the course of many hours or days. It may make sense for this section to have videos and photos, and would perhaps have some sort of CSS effect to censor the whole section, with an explanation and a button for the viewer to actively choose to view the content. I say this because although actively choosing to view this content is not something that many people will do, for those who do view it, it can have a very profound effect in terms of grounding the \"abstract\" and \"statistical\" aspect of the overall explanation - concretely showing how cruel nature can be. This sort of thing was helpful for me when I was introduced to WAS. There are <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtVXFonpaWo \">some particularly terrible videos</a> that I don't necessarily suggest that you include (especially because predation is already overemphasised as an aspect of WAS, in regard to early-stage tractability), but which definitely did work to remove my nature-documentary-tinted glasses, and may do so for others, but you'd obviously want to gate them with some very strong content warnings.</li><li>I'm not sure, but I think it might make sense to exclude the earthworms and insects from the pie chart. The scale is likely already enough to make the point after fish, and the point may get muddied when worms and insects are added - since there are many people who think their capacity to suffer is far, far less than the larger-brained animals. Obviously it shouldn't matter to add these in, because it's more wild animal suffering, regardless of how small they think it is, but I feel like everyone is convinced at the scale where fish are added, and adding insects and earthworms makes the point less \"clean\" for a subset of viewers, and for little additional benefit.</li></ul><p>And a few very minor points that I am only adding because it's clear by the quality of your sites that you care about attention to detail:</p><ul><li>On the \"Even Worse, Wild Animals Suffer in Terrible Ways\" page, the drawing for the \"accidents\" button should probably show a non-human-caused accident - e.g. a deer limping with a broken leg, or something like that? Since the road kill situation should probably fall under \"anthropogenic harms\". I only say this because I think accidents/injuries are a bit underrated even in discussions between people who are reasonably informed about WAS, and so I think it's worth giving people the correct \"at-a-glance\" impression here.</li><li>In the video player, when you click the play button, it loads the youtube player, which then requires the user to click a second time (on the youtube play button) to actually start the video. IIUC, you need the user to click the embed, since auto-play functionality (after clicking your \"fake\" play button) won't include sound, but you don't want to load all the embeds up-front. So on desktop you could trigger the embed load when they click the video thumbnail from the side-menu (and do away with \"fake\" play button), and on mobile, perhaps you could load the embed when the video container enters the page (you can use IntersectionObserver <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/66394121/11950764\">like this</a>). If you want to keep the fake button for aesthetic reasons, then you could use `pointer-events:none` on it so the click goes through to the embed (that was loaded with the IntersectionObserver) underneath.</li><li>In the \"Other Resources You Might Like\" section, I missed the fact that there are other categories (blogs, books, podcasts) that I can toggle through. It was only when I viewed the page on mobile that I noticed, since they are expanded into their own section with horizontal scrolling. I wonder if it might make sense to use that mobile format for desktop too?</li></ul><p>Thanks again to you and the other contributors for putting this site together!</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Joe Rocca"}}, {"_id": "k39pKPArpQreAHXw3", "postedAt": "2022-12-14T19:16:55.721Z", "postId": "Buongkf4KXmBP2jiG", "htmlBody": "<p>I upvoted both of the comments in this thread, because I empathised with Edward's feelings of horror/sadness at the animal abuse they witnessed, and because I thought that Jay's comment was a kind, honest, and full explanation of why Edward's proposal was unlikely to be taken up by others on this Forum :) Thanks both.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "rLAbQSe7LASC874wJ", "user": {"username": "Bella_Forristal"}}, {"_id": "cetGE6WStiTNtAeBb", "postedAt": "2022-12-15T02:04:03.735Z", "postId": "Buongkf4KXmBP2jiG", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Edward,</p><p>You might be interested in the work of the Non-Human Rights Project. &nbsp;They are attempting to establish the legal and political frameworks to ensure that animals (e.g. tigers) will be treated well by people.</p><p>https://www.nonhumanrights.org</p>", "parentCommentId": "7xCpuyczuQPHh4Yn7", "user": {"username": "Tyner"}}, {"_id": "jmiAyRmGqACwJfCiB", "postedAt": "2022-12-17T13:44:25.011Z", "postId": "Buongkf4KXmBP2jiG", "htmlBody": "<p>What a gorgeous website!</p>\n<p>One value to think about in this website\u2019s design is how much to optimize it for persuading EA/rationalists, vegans, or normal people.

We're going to make the tabs on the desktop format sticky so no matter how low you scroll, you'll notice that there's other sections. We want to avoid using the mobile format for desktop in order to keep the page a reasonable length. Hopefully this is a good middle-ground solution!</li></ul><p>We can't thank you enough for the really detailed feedback, appreciate it! I'm sending over all of these notes to the team, and if you have any more comments, feel free to message me directly!</p>", "parentCommentId": "r3rxAwoLwgCdostfw", "user": {"username": "davidvanbeveren"}}, {"_id": "djNt6mFnzrx3BfZC7", "postedAt": "2022-12-20T13:23:03.363Z", "postId": "Buongkf4KXmBP2jiG", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for that explainer!
