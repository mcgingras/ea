More analysis is needed to assess the actual opportunities.</li><li>The theory could incentivize groups to search for and collaborate on interventions that provide mutual gains.</li><li>Other possible areas for collaboration using this framework include animal agriculture's environmental impact.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This comment was auto-generated by the EA Forum Team.
