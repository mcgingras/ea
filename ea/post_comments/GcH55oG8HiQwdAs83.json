Great question. I don't have any data at hand on the recruitment industry as a whole compared to in-house recruiting. I know that the demand and market for recruitment services are growing as it gets harder and harder for companies to fill their positions. There are economic calculations comparing the total costs of in-house recruitment vs. hiring an external service, of course assuming that external services are doing a better job (as in successful and efficient). I do believe that there are plenty of services that only do an okay job and might not be better than in-house recruitment. But sometimes these services just get hired because the in-house recruiters don't have the capacity to manage all recruiting processes themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>This being said, my article wasn't about promoting the recruitment industry as a whole. I think what makes recruitment impactful is if you are hiring for an impactful project or organization. So I was referring to in-house recruiters of EA (or EA-aligned) organizations and recruiters for EA (or EA-aligned)<strong> </strong>hiring agencies.&nbsp;<br><br>I hope this was helpful and thanks for sharing your experience :-)&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "uBLHZztkzjkikGqpK", "user": {"username": "PV"}}, {"_id": "ZaEqabTSWsdpA2fbL", "postedAt": "2022-08-23T18:44:42.324Z", "postId": "GcH55oG8HiQwdAs83", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for writing this! There's been a lot of interest of EA community building, but I think the one of the most valuable parts of EA community building is basically just recruiting \u2013 e.g., notifying interested people about relevant opportunities and inspiring people to apply for impactful opportunities. A lot of potential talent isn't looped in with a local EA group or the EA community at all, however, so I think more professional recruiting could help a lot with solving organizational bottlenecks.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "michaelchen"}}, {"_id": "NcP7tjyQPBBTEmYc7", "postedAt": "2022-08-23T21:22:28.755Z", "postId": "GcH55oG8HiQwdAs83", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for this article, Pia!&nbsp;<br><br>I agree that as EA grows, I believe there will be an increase in demand for recruiters (in-house to organizations, and external in different niches/cause areas).
