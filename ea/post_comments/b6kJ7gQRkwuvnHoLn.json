To clarify, degrowth does not imply \"everyone on earth.\" There is a distinction to be made between the affluent global north (the primary source of environmental impact) where consumption is excessive, and the global south where development is still needed to create an equitable living standard. And while there is certainly more research to be done on how to practically implement a degrowth methodology (thus the need for funding), there is existing research which indicates a \"comfortable\" life style could still be possible under this approach. &nbsp;There is no doubt the paradigm shift required is significant.
