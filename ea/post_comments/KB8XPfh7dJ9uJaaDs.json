If this happens, it will be a far-right dictatorship with an incredibly powerful military and intelligence apparatus, likely including all the tech company data that privacy advocates have been nagging us about.</p>\n<p>Given the numbers above, \"preventing people from adopting far-right ideology\" (as I discussed in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Zynbd3nF6eCyvrnz3/do-better-please?commentId=wwrFHLAdpuqb3fJJn\">this comment</a>) seems like a weak intervention for the \"preventing harms from far-right ideology\" cause area.

In case FLI\u2019s past work, its website and the lifetime work, writing, and talks by FLI leadership left any doubt about that, we included this final sentence in our statement above just to be 100% clear: \u201cthe Future of Life Institute stands and will always stand emphatically against racism, bigotry, bias, injustice and discrimination at all times and in all forms.  They are antithetical to our mission to safeguard the future of life and to advance human flourishing.\u201d  In terms of Nya Dagbladet, further investigation of them has only further validated our November decision to reject their proposal, and we regret that we did not understand their organization and history better sooner, so as to reject them earlier in the process. We will be improving our processes to reduce the risk of anything like this ever happening again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For what it's worth, as someone who mentioned the possibility that Tegmark was \"partway down some sort of far-right pipeline\" elsewhere in this thread, I found the addition reassuring.</p>\n<p>My personal best guess is now that FLI made an honest mistake, and we are reaching diminishing returns on litigating this further.  My sense is that it is incredibly difficult to please everyone with this kind of statement.  It doesn't seem like <em>any</em> of the recent statements by major EA organizations or figures have been well-received overall.

I call it efficient. You can call someone \"fat\", or \"overweight\", or \"having a BMI substantially above average\". You can call someone \"dumber\", or \"stupider\", or \"less intelligent\", or \"having a smaller IQ score\". &nbsp;The number of letters increases, but the intended meaning stays the same. Once we make an euphemism for something society deems undesirable, negative connotations grow back over time, so we have to invent more and more elaborate euphemisms. It wouldn't do to be too rude, but we have to stop somewhere before the number of syllables gets out of hand. \"Stupid\" or \"overweight\" seem like reasonable compromises to me.</p><p>It is true that <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/12/weak-men-are-superweapons/\">in some contexts</a> true statements can be used to coordinate violence against a group of people, and it is reasonable to be concerned in these situations. But there are also contexts where people need to communicate clearly and efficiently, without adding a thousand disclaimers to every factual statement they make, because it's necessary to solve problems. You don't take offence if your doctor tells you you're overweight, or if a scientist writes a paper discussing possible causes of rising obesity rates. Writing by rationalists and EAs should be treated the same way. Given the track record of EA in general and Nick Bostrom in particular, and the explicit clarification in his letter that his statement should be understood literally and not as an expression of hatred towards Black people, it is crazy to assume that the statement was intended to coordinate some racial violence. EA community did a lot to help Black people.</p><p>EA and rationalist communities have always leaned towards <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7cAsBPGh98pGyrhz9/decoupling-vs-contextualising-norms\">decoupling norms</a> in a conversation. Following decoupling norms means you must understand statements literally and avoid unwarranted inferences. If someone says X, and you believe that X implies Y, or you believe that the speaker believes that X implies Y, you are not allowed to just act like they said Y. You should first clarify.&nbsp;</p><p>Epistemic rigor of EA is valuable and unique. It is what distinguishes EA from other do-gooder organizations. I was, for example, a part of Russian opposition movement. It was outright taboo to discuss whether this or that tactic was effective (what if we looked into it and it turned out ineffective? It would be so discouraging to everyone!). I rarely saw anyone express less than complete confidence in our victory (surely making different predictions would just mean you were rooting for the other side). I've seen people try to organize a popular opposition movement while reassuring each other that they were NOT trying to gain power (surely only bad people could have goals like that...).
