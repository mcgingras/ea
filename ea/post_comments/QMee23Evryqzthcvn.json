In particular, I find your mention of shame vs edginess interesting.. But I expect that at least one person reading your story will think \"Uh sounds like you need <i>more</i> shame, dude, not less\" so I'd like to share a perspective for any such readers:&nbsp;<br><br>If I understand Owen anyway, I'll say that I relate in that I also have had some brazen periods of life, prompted by a sort of cultural rebirth and sex-positive idealism. An outsider might have labelled these brazen periods as a swinging of the pendulum in response to my strict religious upbringing, but that isn't quite right.. It's hard to notice how it is related to shame but in my case:<br><br>For a very shame-prone or shame-trained person, it can be very difficult to parse out \"What is the actual harm here? What are the actual bad acts and why, when I know that most of these things I'm programmed to feel shame about simply are not wrong or shame-worthy?\" This can lead to a sort of idealistically-motivated throwing out of all feelings that look like shame. Anxiety, hesitance, guilt, and self-criticality are examples of possibly-adaptive-feelings that can be mistakenly thrown out here. This, I think, can lead to social permissiveness and lack of boundaries (you might call it \"edginess\") to a problematic extent. Ironically, I can see this happening <i>more</i> for the people who have been <i>most</i> shame-prone because those are the people for whom shame has been such an omnipresent guide that \"feeling something similar to shame\" actually loses most of it's compass potential without highly tuned emotional intelligence. Additionally, when such people throw shame out as a compass, they might find that other social-guiding inclinations (social skills which help you realize the unstated preferences of others) are underdeveloped. This is, I think, more likely the more you have used shame as a compass, especially if it was your primary compass during your whole developmental years.<br><br>It's actually pretty hard to express in language, but I hope I have helped share one perspective on how, ironically, more shame can lead to worse behavior for a certain type of rational person, especially in their younger, not-at-all-wise-yet, years. &nbsp;<br><br>I found reading this document somewhat healing*, and I bet I am not the only EA woman who has**. With transparency and accountability, maybe we can move forward as a community. &nbsp;I'm hopeful to know that you are prioritising getting the help you need, and I hope other EA men follow suit. I hope that your therapist (or coach) helps you to develop other (non-shame) social compasses for sorting truly unhelpful acts from neutral or helpful acts. Long periods of focused tumult-free reflection are also important, so I'm glad you are putting polyamory and any extra obligations like board responsibilities on hold til you have things sorted.&nbsp;***<br>&nbsp;<br>[*Edit 1: \"Somewhat healing\" = I've been thinking about SA in EA for months now (ramping up since September but obviously peaking now). And my mind has come back to <i>this </i>(Owen's) incident a lot. Why this incident? Well it is probably the most egregious incident in that Time piece that there has (til today) been no public clarity on. I have every day since the Time piece thought to myself \"So, who is that man? This one seems the most likely to still, today, be strongly connected to EA. Do we need to be concerned about this actor?\" It's embarrassing to admit that it has consumed my mind this much recently, but I think other <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sDaXKQCKHmX5DKhRy/ea-community-builders-commitment-to-anti-racism-and-anti?commentId=qpWXkdu9xgHn3FZah\">community builders are struggling similarly</a>. So, this post <i>somewhat</i> heals 3 things for me: (1) this extra-worrying incident can be crossed off the list as handled without a doubt, eg that's one less potential predator or reputational risk around. We don't have to worry about that actor anymore. (2) The man himself is actually stepping up to take responsibility for it. That's one less man's scandal or misconduct that EA women have to clean up/monitor/apologize for. I feel healed in expectation that I and others might be able to get some of our energy back. I am acutely aware of how much energy men's mistakes here cost women (women who are often supposed to be working on other altruistic questions!) (3) this post is also a model for how other men can clarify their pasts. I hope to see more of those Time incidents handled or somehow clarified, (although I still wish it could have happened in a different way). So this post might even signal further upcoming clarity, which will be what the community needs to move forward. And having <i>hope</i> that EA can move forward, improved, and back to impact, is healing too.]<br><br>[**Edit 2: I've gotten some fair pushback on the \"I think I speak for a lot of EA women\" phrasing I had originally. I modified the language to more what I really mean. I don't presume to speak for all readers or any single reader. It would even be perfectly valid if this were your moment of peak fury or despair.. like maybe that's right for you. Personally I am able to take healing from this post, and I bet I'm not the only one who is finding something positive to take out of it]</p><p>[***Edit 3: Some people feel this particular paragraph is too warm, and feel it's an example of dialogue being gentler toward men than women. (1) It felt humanly natural for me to flow into my own thoughts once I'd crossed that shame writeup off my list. That was a mistake and in future I'll just start a new comment. (2) I don't regret being warm and leaving out affirmations of ill-fit, because sitting below my comment as I was composing mine was another comment saying how distraught they were at reading this post, and how disappointed in Owen. I did and still do think it was equally important (in expectation to the first part of my comment) for Owen and for this community that someone share a different perspective on reading the piece and also like, wish him well rather than pile the guilt on. Frankly I expected more negative sentiment toward him to come (which has), and some of these responses would make me straight up want to die if I were OP. I don't want anyone to feel that way. The woman seems to have forgiven him herself so I presume no reason to withhold compassion myself.]</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Ivy_Mazzola"}}, {"_id": "nGzWqrSGY7sKw5Lpo", "postedAt": "2023-02-20T20:52:27.438Z", "postId": "QMee23Evryqzthcvn", "htmlBody": "<p>Perhaps people who pushed back or even attacked the Time article should have some reflection?</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "anolderea"}}, {"_id": "SJgKMnHtQFZjHZh8Y", "postedAt": "2023-02-20T20:55:41.496Z", "postId": "QMee23Evryqzthcvn", "htmlBody": "<p><i>(In this comment I'm assuming that the context Owen provided is accurate.)</i></p><p>I expected worse from the TIME Magazine article.

Don't expect others to read your mind.</p></blockquote><p>I'd be about 50%* on your side if there weren't for power dynamics. With the power dynamics, it's more like 5%.&nbsp;I agree that Owen's account sounds less concerning than the one in the TIME article, but I still think this sort of thing shouldn't happen. Since it sounds like this was a work trip for an interview rather than a visit at a friend's place, the person who's responsible for getting you the interview shouldn't be testing the waters for what might or might not make you uncomfortable enough to speak up. That doesn't involve mind reading \u2013 it involves staying away from anything sexually or romantically pressuring. (Many would say that this means staying away from anything sexual or romantic altogether in an asymmetric power dynamic, since it's hard to foresee what is or isn't \"pressure.\" I think that makes sense for the most extreme types of power dynamics, like supervisor and direct reports. For power-and-(perceived)-friendship dynamics like the one Owen describes, I think it's not per se indefensible to express interest in some way (not that Owen necessarily did this by mentioning masturbation \u2013 but it can straightforwardly be interpreted to have these undertones). However, I'd say it's on the person at the upper end of the power dynamic to make extra sure they're choosing a timing and method of expression that's as easy to reject as possible (and also minimize fallout/subsequent awkwardness). (So, not before a job interview when the other person has no place arranged to stay except your flat.) And if you can't see this going well, then don't express interest or breach these topics. (For these reasons, many orgs have a strict policy against this, which is of course separate from the moral question of it, but still, it's often good to mimic what's \"good practice\" if the context is similar.) In any case, if Owen had deliberately thought about it from that angle, he'd himself have realized that he shouldn't do the thing he did. (I read his apology to imply agreement with this view I just expressed.)<br><br>*On why I only agree 50% with \"People have a personal responsibility to tell others to stop what they're doing if they don't feel like they want others to do those things. Don't expect others to read your mind\":&nbsp;<br>The user \"nananana.nananana.heyhey.anon\" expresses this really well in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/QMee23Evryqzthcvn/a-statement-and-an-apology?commentId=8hFmyqezEDcMWqF3G\">their comment</a>. Sure, ultimately, it's your responsibility to say something. At the same time, people <i>also</i> have a responsibility to not go around pushing boundaries. Imagine a psychopath who always stops doing things when explicitly told to stop doing <i>that specific thing</i>, but he keeps pushing boundaries left and right whenever he's not asked to stop. Clearly, such a psychopath shouldn't be a part of the sort of communities we want to build. Therefore, there's more to the picture than \"Others have to speak up if they're uncomfortable.\" When a person expresses that they were made uncomfortable, that means things already went too far.<i> </i>It's not a big deal if this happens unintentionally, but it's still regrettable. It shouldn't form a pattern. We can't read minds, but we can guess \u2013 and it's important to cultivate this sort of guessing and learn to get good at it.<br>&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "SJgKMnHtQFZjHZh8Y", "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}, {"_id": "o3BJdgneqp5haiNfi", "postedAt": "2023-02-20T23:45:21.247Z", "postId": "QMee23Evryqzthcvn", "htmlBody": "<p>Some of you should write other polls in this post, so we can figure out what we think.

Probably not the best place to share this, but if I don't post here it here, might not post it anywhere.</i><br><br>My &nbsp;impression is that young women new to the community have at the least felt uncomfortable or uneasy in EA in some of their interactions with men who've been in the community longer and are a bit older. There's probably enough of an issue here that it warrants a systemic solution.</p><p>As for myself, I admit that I have contributed a bit to the <i>problem</i>. Being a bit older and having been in the community for a while, I have engaged romantically and sexually with women who are younger and new to the community. Looking back, I recognize the problematic power dynamics at play and think there are things I would take back if I could. Nothing egregious, just stuff that wasn't ideal.</p><p>I'm uncertain about the ideal systematic changes and norms, and where to draw the line when it comes to engaging in romantic relationships. While not abusing power is obvious, the gray area is unclear.</p><p>In my opinion, the best changes will come from a deeper understanding of the current situation and how we got here. From what I've seen, heterosexual men in the EA community who seek intimate relationships with women face significant challenges due to the crushing gender ratio. It can feel like a highly competitive environment where only the most attractive and successful men have any \"luck.\" Finding relationships outside of EA doesn't feel like a real solution either, especially when one wants a partner who shares similar values and culture.</p><p>In my experience, being in the community for a long time or working in an organization does not feel powerful from the inside. Even in that position , it can &nbsp;lonely and desperate from a romantic/sexual angle, which in turn can make attractive women feel like they have significant power. As for me, I'm not particularly interested in women in their early 20s, both because of age and power imbalances and because of maturity and other factors. However, this age range seems to be where EA is most successful at recruiting women. Selfishly, I'd love to see more mid-late 20s or older women join.</p><p>There's also the issue of pursuing younger women simply because they might be more impressed with one's accomplishments so far. However, it would be fantastic if a woman a bit older with many impressive accomplishments took an interest in me. Unfortunately, it seems like women who are already established in the community are already in relationships, leaving only people new to the community as options.</p><p>In summary, while from angle there are men who are abusing their power and influence to gain sexual favor with younger woman, from another angle you have men who don't feel that powerful and do feel lonely and desperate. This does not justify all behavior, of course. I believe that understanding where this behavior comes from is essential to changing it. That's why I'm writing this.</p><p>The gender ratio imbalance in the EA community is a significant challenge, and I don't think there are any quick or easy solutions. It is a challenging situation for both men and women, albeit in different ways. While this does not excuse mistreating others for one's own needs, a better understanding of the root causes may help us be more effective in changing this behavior.<br><br>A solution might look like teaching people to recognize the power and influence they have even when it doesn't feel like they have it.

Which to me simply isn't the issue, plenty of people explore polyamory/circling without making such mistakes, because they come from a background of already having done work to understand their identities and social positions. To me the issue appears to be primarily a lack of a sufficiently formed critical lens for his own position of power (which could have clued him in to his actions being unacceptable). If I take at face value that he is being genuine in saying \"Then&nbsp;<strong>when I found out that I\u2019d made the person feel uncomfortable...

So lets estimate 2016-2018? Owen has been married for 17 years, so I'd estimate his current age at close to 40. So if he was in his early/mid 30s when this happened, clearly he and/or his bubbles were not paying sufficient attention to gender/power dynamics (and probably DEI issues more broadly). The #metoo movement gained widespread attention in 2017. I'd definitely be curious to know if this incident happened before or after that. I think it's important for us to all remember that even in the past 6 years, society has shifted in important ways towards improvements in handling gender/power/sexual dynamics.

My career is the most important thing in the world to me, so I have empathy for women who would take actions that feel drastic to me to protect theirs.

They had no direct power over me, but a word from them would have been extremely helpful in getting an interview or a job. I criticize them freely about all sorts of things, and think this is the best way of engaging in these friendships that honestly feel more like peer relationships than relationships of different status to me. &nbsp;The idea of trying to be strategic by not being honest if one of them flirted with me and I didn't like it makes me even more uncomfortable than not being honest with them in general would. Wouldn't that mean I was trying to get ahead based on something other than the quality of my work? I'm not suggesting a woman who would feel pressured to do this is doing something unsavory, but rather that a society that tells her she should &nbsp;feel pressured is reducing her to her gender and devaluing her work. I came away thinking the problem may be less about shyness in general than imposter syndrome specifically. Victims of it require our support not judgement (and I certainly feel it myself coming from a very different class than EAs typically do, and honestly being below average in my community in career prowess), but it requires different interventions than the problems you've described.</p><p>I can't help but thinking if more women were as comfortable criticizing friends with very different statuses in their field as I am, &nbsp;they would discover that high status EA men typically welcome criticism (my local EA community is the EA hub of the San Francisco bay area, so my experiences probably generalize better than &nbsp;they otherwise would). &nbsp;Importantly, I have this experience even when they are just acquaintances, so it doesn't seem to be a result of something hard to develop. We've just learned that possibly the worst example in the Time article was caused not by the man operating in bad faith in a way that would make him likely to retaliate by not supporting his friend's career if she stood up to him, but by miscommunication (his severe miscommunication). His post seems to contain the passion for self-improvement I've witnessed time and time again in the men with these power differences from me when I've criticized &nbsp;them. I encourage more women to experiment with criticizing &nbsp;their male friends with power differences. It can start small!

Moreover, it is framed as a question of \"when\" he will resume these responsibilities, rather than \"if\".</p><p><strong>Owen attempts to insert himself into the conversation regarding governance measures.</strong> However, the act of a board member providing their opinions to the community health team could potentially disrupt efforts to uncover the truth of what occurred.</p><p><strong>So I don't believe that the apology was very reassuring. But what concerns me more is that from skimming the forum, one may think that forum readers are taking Owen's side here.</strong> I think two things are going on. Firstly, few seem willing to speak against Owen due to his still considerable power in the EA community (that he indicates he intends to cling onto), so there is an imbalance in the comments. Secondly, people like Owen and his writing, and face cognitive dissonance in contemplating that he might be a bad guy, so there is an imbalance in the votes (e.g. between this post and the one from the EVF board). Understandable though this may be, it could have a chilling effect on those who have their own cases of sexual assault to report. I realise that we are a community who prize ourselves on thinking about the big issues, and striving to do the most good. But here I worry about our ability to handle the basics. For me, it's a matter of decency - we should make righteous whistleblowers feel comfortable, rather than backing powerful members of own tribe.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Hattie Caroll"}}, {"_id": "vjuJuqjg235TdqQ9k", "postedAt": "2023-02-21T15:20:35.514Z", "postId": "QMee23Evryqzthcvn", "htmlBody": "<p>I think 'randomly' doesn't apply here.

Update now.&nbsp;<br><br>Some EAs think that a public reckoning in the comments is what is needed but honestly, if I was a victim looking in, such a show of shock and pearl-clutching just looks naive and frankly some of the responses would frustrate me a bit. Like \"do you guys think you are a community of angels [or robots] or something?\" I hypothesize that many of the people who are reacting kindly to Owen already got our surprise and despair out of our systems before now. Like I already mourned this, both that leaders can do dumb stuff that puts their own movement at risk and that the men I know and respect can do sexually problematic and power-naive things. And I've mourned it many times before now too, inside and outside of EA, when finding out that friends of mine or even partners have sexually problematic or manipulative pasts, or even been the one on the receiving end of sexual misconduct or worse from the people I love and trust the most.&nbsp;[I've also mourned my own &nbsp;professional stupidity plenty so I know deep in my bones that people who usually try pretty hard to do good can make major fuckups.]<br><br>I don't want this message to be taken as dramatically proclaiming something like \"men suck\" or \"reject all gods\" or something.... I don't think either of those are useful scripts. But honestly.... this community needs to come to terms that sexual harrassment or professional misconduct <i>can be done by anyone</i>. Sexual-assault-awareness advocates have been trumpeting that for decades now. Frankly the surprise this community is displaying is more concerning to me than Owen's behavior itself. Like.... this is almost exactly what we should expect this to look like? Men have been disrespecting &nbsp;women or just not noticing the perspectives of women for most of human history, only improving sharply on a sociological level a few years ago, which is <i>after</i> most of the men in this community reached adulthood. The decent men with past fuckups are trying to atone for their past sins or mistakes, and I guarantee we all are connected to at least some of those men. You don't realize who they are, but you should factor in that you are already close to a couple of them. So just like you shouldn't be surprised when a woman tells you she has sexual abuse in her past or is uncomfortable, don't be so surprised when a man tells you he has done something intentionally or accidentally problematic. Like, start integrating these social justice and human lessons, please. I feel this should be a relatively quick update to make, you should have downloaded almost the entire package already -_-<br><br>Again thank you for writing, it really did help me clarify a lot about this community's reaction vs. my own, I think.<br><br>[Edit: I want to add that from a personal development perspective, I know mistakes happen, including moral mistakes and professional or &nbsp;social mistakes. I've done them and so has every person I've ever become close enough with to discuss such things with. That is one reason I want to treat <i>both</i> the women <i>and</i> Owen kindly. It could be you or your loved one or your child next time, trying to present a truthful situation that everyone views as outlandish but which you'd have found troubling in their shoes. Likewise, it could be you, or your loved one or your child next time being caught up after doing something everyone else thinks (and which you now humiliatingly agree) is egregious. From behind the veil of ignorance, how would you want the world to treat your or your child's incident report <i>or</i> &nbsp;apology letter?]</p>", "parentCommentId": "QpJdkecKdvy7kcB5R", "user": {"username": "Ivy_Mazzola"}}, {"_id": "eXnjBTF75aJThDkHK", "postedAt": "2023-02-22T01:13:45.545Z", "postId": "QMee23Evryqzthcvn", "htmlBody": "<p>Of course, funders and event organizers can collectively decide how long Owen's pause from influence in those areas last.

I see three problems with the situation (am I missing some?):</p><ol><li>The masturbation comment</li><li>The couchsurfing</li><li>The power differential</li></ol><p>No. 1 seems easy to avoid. I hardly ever talk about such private things. Generally the topic of \"Things to do with sex\" seems relatively sharply defined to me, so that I don't find it challenging to avoid it categorically.</p><p>The other two seem like things I could more easily get wrong, so I find it disconcerting how easily this mistake could've happened to me.</p><p>Couchsurfing is something that I've offered before, regardless of the gender of the guest. It itself puts me, as the host, in a position of power because I know the place, have keys, etc., and the guest doesn't have an easy fallback option. So I'm usually quite careful with it and use a phrasing like, \"By the way, if you want to crash at my place just let me know. It's quite small and messy though and there's all the construction work. You can probably find something nicer.\" (Typically with some links to the main EA couchsurfing sites.) That gives the guest a plausible reason so they can refuse without having to give a reason. (Or would people not do that because they'd feel it's misleading/dishonest to refuse an offer for a reason other than the implied one? Or would they understand that I\u2019m giving the pretend reasons on purpose so it's okay?)</p><p>But apart from that my general feeling was that offering couchsurfing is good and nice and should be done? (I like to save costs for hotels if possible, so I want to pay it forward or give back to the community.) Or should there be guidelines for when offering couchsurfing is appropriate and when it is not? I mean, refusing when someone asks would be awkward, but just not offering it in the first place if the other person is newer to EA, more junior, or younger could work, apart from the fuzziness of those terms?</p><p>The third one is particularly tricky because I don't usually perceive myself as being in a position of power (except in, to me, known cases like couchsurfing), but someone else might easily perceive me as more powerful, unbeknownst to me. E.g., I can't tell people's ages very well. And a lot of EAs usually seem really impressive to me, so if more people are like me and we meet, we'll be intimidated by each other without realizing this about each other. At one point I had just given a talk, and suddenly there was someone talking to me all flustered-like. It took me a moment to realize that giving the talk must've increased my perceived power charisma, so that I tried to be extra silly to get it down again. But I could've easily missed or misattributed the flusteredness and probably have in many other cases.</p><p>Would it be acceptable to quite generally (when there is any doubt about the power dynamics, so like 80% of the time) to be like, \"I'm generally concerned about power dynamics. I'm a bit intimidated by your accomplishments, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you also see yourself in an equal or higher position of social power. What is your impression? Do you think it might be more prudent to try to find another solution than the couchsurfing?\" Something like that?</p><p>So in summary:</p><p>There are my questions above about guidelines for offering couchsurfing and about how to find out about the other person's perception of power.</p><p>But I'd also be interested in the relative importance of the three (or more?) factors: Is it more additive, and if so, is like 10 bad + 10 bad + 10 bad = 30 bad or 27 bad + 1 bad + 2 bad = 30 bad? Or is it multiplicative: 10 bad x 10 bad x 10 bad = 1000 bbbaaaddd or 10 bad x 2 bad x 5 bad = 100 bbbaaaddd? I mean, the sum/product is not important. I just get the feeling that there's an understanding that the masturbation comment was bad, but it's less clear to me whether the other two factors were equally bad or half as bad or much less bad.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "WobblyPanda"}}, {"_id": "nKkggv7QRfwCdjSbL", "postedAt": "2023-02-22T06:58:01.224Z", "postId": "QMee23Evryqzthcvn", "htmlBody": "<p>How do you define \"decent\"?</p>\n<p>I'm a straight guy, and I grew up in an era of pre-#metoo, sex-positive feminism.

Women are just people, after all!\"</p>\n<p>Obviously, at a certain point I figured out that this was a bad heuristic.  I believe I've technically been the victim of sexual assault (rot13'd: n qehax thl ng n cnegl tenoorq zl pebgpu bhg bs gur oyhr nsgre V gbyq uvz ur jnf cneglvat gbb uneq -- V unir ab vagrerfg va thlf naq jnf tvivat fvtanyf bs naablnapr, abg frkhny vagrerfg).

The OP doesn't read at all to me like an instance of premeditated, deliberate harm.  (And, separately, I wish women would invest more in helping men model their preferences.  It seems like if a guy says \"that doesn't seem bad to me\", the most common response is some variant of \"you're a horrible person!\", which is counterproductive for learning.  It doesn't communicate any general rule which could allow me to extrapolate from this instance and accurately model your preferences in other situations.)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "PysuQzfdzSBzhBSwm", "user": {"username": "Aptdell"}}, {"_id": "Pyy8n7aFh3Dg5Hfd2", "postedAt": "2023-02-22T09:05:19.214Z", "postId": "QMee23Evryqzthcvn", "htmlBody": "<p>I think he was relatively well known and respected in a much smaller community 5 years ago.

The badness is broken up into a number of different factors.</p>\n<p>Most interactions don't lead to upset. So If we trust Owen's narrative, then he misread social cues in a way that upset his accuser by talking about masturbation when she didn't want to and so upset her. If you are a consequentialist, upsetting people is bad. If you are a deontologist, not taking time to understand boundaries such that you overstep them is bad.</p>\n<p><em>If</em> we trust his account, which I guess I do, they had talked about this kind of thing before. But she still didn't want to and she is still upset about it 5 years later. This caused harm and so was an error.</p>\n<p><em>If there was nothing else at play I guess personally I think this was a bit bad. Worth sitting down and evaluating how one communicates. I think some men you know will have done something like this (though I think it was avoidable and that the costs weren't worth it). I imagine there is disagreement on his bad this is. I guess some  of those reading this aren't thinking \"will I talk about sex despite not wanting to\" but instead \"will I be as upset as this woman is. I'd like to avoid that\"</em></p>\n<p>Next, the woman in question was staying at his house in a foreign country. And she knew that he had the ability to recommend her for jobs and (I sense) figured that he was important to have on her side. This seems to be why Owen thinks she went along with it. Owen was pretty well respected in EA even then, right?</p>\n<p><em>If there was nothing else at play I guess I'm somewhere between a more than a bit bad and very bad. Because he is well known, women who heard of this might think this is the norm or they might just have heard how a well known well liked person upset a woman they know. Perhaps they wondered if sometimes you have to sit feeling uncomfortable (perhaps unsafe/grossed out) to get jobs. Some will leave EA as a result. I hope their fear isn't reality, but I sense the harms are. \"Is this the kind of thing that happens a lot? \"  \"Can I invite friends to EA if this might happen\". I don't know how bad this is, but I sense that after the second time I would stop taking these risks as a community leader. And I imagine some people think even this one event is disqualifying. And even if you the reader disagree, would you have been more careful here? If you would, then I think revealed preferences show you don't think this was wise.</em></p>\n<p>Next, there are four other occasions where something a bit like this has happened. How many of these happened after the main events described here? I guess 2 or 3. So even after upsetting someone like this, this pattern continues. This does make me question a Owen's judgenent.</p>\n<p><em>For me this is the part that probably makes it fully bad though I guess many were there already. I am not na\u00efve here. I think people often upset eachother in romantic interactions. I sadly guess many men (10-20%?) have at one time seriously upset romantic partners and some women/nb (1-5%) have too.  But if one has a pattern of behaviour, one should avoid risky situations. Especially if one is a community leader. Instead Owen seems to keep pushing the boundaries. And I'm not claiming to be perfect, just that this falls short . Again, I weakly sense that the kind of person who thinks Owen did nothing wrong is often an individual who  doesn't seek leadership positions. Should leaders be held to higher interpersonal standards? Well I think their behaviour is taken as what is normal by a much wider group.. so yes.</em></p>\n<p>Finally, after what seems like a possibly unresolved pattern of bad behaviour, Owen is further elevated in the community. Perhaps without this article he would have kept upsetting women at a rate of 1 person every couple of years.</p>\n<p><em>I think a lot of these last two points hang on what has happened in the intervening 5 years. For myself, if the upset caused between now and then was very small,  then perhaps a reasonable decision-maker would come to the conclusion that Owen had changed his behaviour and was suitable for community leadership. If an event like the above has been happening once a year then it seems really bad that he became a board member in the first place.</em></p>\n<p>I think reasonable people can disagree a bit here, and there are things we don't know, and I think it's worth considering that people might be arguing with different assumptions (\"There are probably other bad stories\" \"Owen is probably being overly scrupulous here\" \"what would I want if I were Owen/the woman\" \"how should we judge this specific case\" \"how do we send a credible signal about this kind of behaviour\" \"it is good he was honest\" \"he only admitted this because he had to\"). I find it pretty unlikely that Owen wasn't a bit unkind not to have avoided the later situations in this pattern and unwise given the increased harms from his behaviour as opposed to him being a random community member. But there is some possibility that in 3 months with new information I'll feel differently.</p>\n<p>If you disagree, I suggest you write a version. But I think mine is better than nothing.

I'll match your anecdote with another: I have many close and dear male friends - several of whom have a very 'edgy' sense of humour, they are able to joke about sex, men, women, relationships - any number of topics, without ever making me feel unsafe.

So, it's not like I thought \"no way this could happen to EA.\" The main thing I was taken aback by is that it ended up being someone who was not only very influential within EA, but also someone to whom the adjective \"trusted\" applied to a very high degree. &nbsp;In my view, SBF was never \"trusted\" in the same way Owen was, even though he was even more influential and better known. (I still agree that \"by far most EAs trusted SBF\" is an accurate statement overall. I just want to highlight that there's a difference between \"minimum degree of trust required for someone to hold influential positions\" and \"would trust this person so much that they'd be among the very last people I'd expect to cause some kind of scandal.\")</p><blockquote><p>But honestly.... this community needs to come to terms that sexual assault or professional misconduct <i>can be done by anyone</i>.</p></blockquote><p>I want to distinguish here between types of sexual assault or professional misconduct that are very rare for anyone who isn't high on dark tetrad traits and types of it that also frequently happen with people without dark tetrad traits. Both are bad, but if someone is a serial predator high on dark tetrad traits, you'll potentially end up with several dozens of victims and there can be violence or very explicit<i> </i>and agentic threats to physical safety and ruining someone's reputation, as opposed to just contextually having to worry that one's reputation might suffer as a consequence of speaking up. Owen's case was nothing remotely like the former, so it seems super important to still have a category that is qualitatively different and a lot worse (and that's the category SBF was in, with respect to financial/regulatory misconduct rather than sexual misconduct).</p><p>The difference is easy to pin down.* Ask the question: \"Does someone genuinely care about not messing up, not harming others or making them uncomfortable (or breaking laws/regulations/moral conventions), etc.? Yes or no?\" If the answer is \"yes,\" then you're in a different regime than if it's \"no.\"&nbsp;</p><p>*Edit: actually, it's probably a bit harder to pin this down. I think some bad actors may consciously care about not harming others, but their mind might have anti-social patterns of underlying emotions and self-deception and so on, which can trick highly-empathetic people into wanting to give them second and third chances because it convincingly seems as though they \"mean well.\" So, maybe instead of asking \"do they care (conscious intent)?,\" we have to also ask if they have a mind that's sufficiently conducive to genuinely caring.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "8e3g53JutLSXaP2ak", "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}, {"_id": "u4ri7mNfxCu6Lu5Ld", "postedAt": "2023-02-22T14:57:13.310Z", "postId": "QMee23Evryqzthcvn", "htmlBody": "<p>(This comment is not intended to provide anyone who has committed misconduct with an excuse, it is meant to inform preventive measures.)</p><p>I think this is a strong argument for clearer / more explicit community norms, and much more training/education.

Maybe my comment was complicated by me trying to word it in such a way that anyone can \"get it\" whether they believe Owen did a <i>anything&nbsp;</i> \"bad\", from a minor faux pas (socially bad, not ill-intentioned) to actual SA (morally bad, or creepy and otherwise badly and selfishly-intentioned)&nbsp;<br><br>At the end of the day what I'm trying to get at is something like:&nbsp;<br><br>\"Not every scandal/negative incident is a black swan event. Everything relevant to <i>this</i> situation from 'your supposedly-sage leaders do PR-risky professional misconduct' to 'your trusted friends and idols do SA within your community' should be in your model of the world already.&nbsp;<br><br>On the other side of the coin, just because an incident is not a black swan event, doesn't mean you think you should have been able to predict it. Surprises exist. The community shouldn't feel a need to do a lot of handwringing about the community, society, and what happened. At least not if having these types of surprises (SAs or professional misconduct, including by leaders) were factored in. Why suddenly do a lot of self-flagellation in response?<br><br>That the incident is confirmed and by a leader doesn't mean there are necessarily deep underlying structural problems (some cracks I'd like to see sealed, sure!). In particular I'm pretty upset about the amount of pushback Julia and the CH team is getting. Mistakes happen. We are all learning. Factor in that, sometimes, mistakes (as by Julia) will line up with other mistakes (as by Owen) and/or bad-intentioned acts (as by the journalist or Owen depending on your perspective) and create a bigger mishap. Roll the dice enough and it happens. And also, frankly, we should expect to see this happen in a way that brings up gender issues and SA, or just straight up <i>is</i> it, because that's how the world goes [this is what my above comment might have appeared to focus on, but I also want to make the more complex point about expecting mishaps in general]<br><br>Also, that this incident is confirmed and by Owen doesn't mean we should be updating that the community has a horrible problem out of scale with other (neurodivergent-heavy in cases of faux pas or male-heavy in cases of SA) communities, or that the Time piece was otherwise honest or something. I'd say it's more clear than ever that the journalist had an intention to create a salacious narrative even if they stated facts as they knew them. And if anyone had significant suspicion before Owen's post that the Time piece was overblown.. well this is exactly what they should have been imagining. This is what you'd expect a piece written by a bad-actor, lying journalist to look like.... nuggets of truth slanted in such a way that truth is on the back-burner and scandal put front and center.&nbsp;<br><br>So idk, if ppl are updating much now (which the handwringing implies) I kinda think EAs just did a bad job in the beginning? <strong>Sorry to rub it in to those who are shocked, but that's actually a problem cuz that's what EA is supposed to be good at..?</strong><br><br>As someone who has herself \"reported\" men doing problematic stuff in EA ~twice (one for a faux pas, one for being an actual danger, and also a third man this year but I don't want to count it because it's more complicated), and gone through a lot of garbage in my own life, including my own faux pas, idk Owen's piece hardly updates me at all. It fit in my pre-existing model perfectly? Sometimes these things just happen. It's a bug of the world. Mistakes happen. Crappy people get into good places and do crappy things. We will never catch all of these people. Also, <i>good people do crappy or dumb things</i>. We will never prevent all the stupid acts. In both cases, we should also expect it will disproportionately fall onto women in a male-heavy community. <i>We should keep trying to do better</i>, but I don't think we need a show of handwringing about it because it is inevitable even in the best communities (before AGI anyway) that things like this happen eventually and that you will be the one witnessing it eventually if you are paying attention.&nbsp;<br><br>I therefore think the shock shows EA's naivete tbh, and it is ironically making me <i>less</i> confident that EAs will notice when things are going awry (than I was before) , because people still seem to have protected categories in their head (leaders and friends and EA itself). Like, <i>I'm </i>shocked<i> </i>too, but I'm shocked that the majority community reaction <i>sounds</i> to be anything other than 'Welp this sucks. Guess getting one of the more-disappointing-but-still-not-too-surprising outcomes is how the cookie crumbled here.' But maybe this is the area I needed to update on? EAs' naivete (around SA and/or social risks) and automatic self-flagellation (or other-flagellation) tendencies?

After that leader arranged for her to be flown to the U.K. for a job interview, she recalls being surprised to discover that she was expected to stay in his home, not a hotel. When she arrived, she says, \u201che told me he needed to masturbate before seeing me.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>\"influential figure in EA\": 100% correct.&nbsp;</p><p>\" whose role included picking out promising students and funneling them towards highly coveted jobs\": Slightly incorrect in that he did not hold the role officially at the time. However he did appear to be doing the role <i>unofficially</i>, to the point where he said it it \"makes sense to me that this was her perception\"</p><p>\"After that leader arranged for her to be flown to the U.K. for a job interview\" : Presumably correct (he recommended her for the job and was in contact with the organization), although not explicitly confirmed.&nbsp;</p><p>\"she recalls being surprised to discover that she was expected to stay in his home, not a hotel\": 100% correct as relayed by Owen himself.&nbsp;</p><p>\"When she arrived, she says, \u201che told me he needed to masturbate before seeing me.\u201d\": presumably correct as Owen never denied the claim.&nbsp;</p><p>There was also some context &nbsp;that was not mentioned:&nbsp;</p><p>Context that makes Owen look better: &nbsp;Owen and the woman were &nbsp;friends at the time, Owen and the woman had talked about sex and masturbation before, so the comments were less out of the blue. &nbsp;Owen felt bad about what he did and claims to be trying to reform. (there was also the aforementioned misunderstanding about his role).&nbsp;</p><p>Context that makes Owen look worse: The woman only learned about this accommodation on the <i>exact day of the flying out</i>, making her alternative options limited, thus making it hard for her to say no to staying with him. &nbsp;Owen self-admittedly went on to make other innapropriate comments to people on 4 other occasions (although they were self-judged to be less egregious).&nbsp;</p><p>So the final score is 4/5 statements true, 1/5 &nbsp;misleading due to an understandable mistake. Some missing context made Owen look better, some missing context made Owen look worse.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall I see a flattening of context that made Owen look somewhat worse &nbsp;than he actually was, but not by a significant degree. &nbsp;I see nothing to justify these accusations of outright lying you claim occurred here.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "BhFg6SAFfouFD9L8o", "user": {"username": "titotal"}}, {"_id": "PF3KAoTxNcfZvGdrW", "postedAt": "2023-02-22T18:08:36.899Z", "postId": "QMee23Evryqzthcvn", "htmlBody": "<p>I largely agree.

Sorry about that:</p><ol><li>Actually I am very glad the women came forward<i> </i>and even glad they tried a new method than the CH team (those who had reported already but weren't happy with the outcome). And I respect them for doing so. <i>[My impression is that women were and are still bouncing off EA because of mismatch in professional and cultural expectations so this needed addressing. And I believe it is important for anyone who suspects they might view something awry with our culture to try to raise alarm bells so it can be fixed.]</i></li><li>I am much<i> less </i>happy that the <i>method</i> chosen was to speak to Time. Is any EA happy about this reality specifically? Are the women? I think other methods, like posting anonymous incident reports on the Forum or something<strong> with actual usable details </strong>(which still no woman has done),<strong> </strong>could have led to faster resolution, including outcomes like OCB stepping down from the board and prompting a period of reflection where he and other men figure out why he/they'd been so slow to improve and notice perspectives of women before (in other words, both tangible and intangible systemic improvements).</li><li><i>BUT</i> I simultaneously do <i>not</i> blame the women or hold it against them or think they acted immorally or dishonestly or something by speaking to TIME. <i>My respect for them stands.</i>&nbsp;</li><li>Firstly I imagine that most if not all were sought out by the journalist for their takes, and responding to and and trusting journalists is &nbsp;very normal thing to do. I claim it's a risky move to talk to journalists without further caveats [<i>but I don't expect anyone else to believe this and I myself would not have even have held back from talking to journalists up til say a year ago. In other words, I have an inkling they did as I would have done just a couple years ago if a journalist asked me for my perspective. If a Time journalist reaches out to a normal conscientious person, they are going to assume it is an important reason and do their part.]&nbsp;</i></li><li>It also makes total sense that the women would be worried about SA and toxicity-to-women in EA because, from the POV of experiencing it, and feeling anxiety that something has gone awry, they can't really tell if the experiences that made them uncomfortable are a sign of something bigger or if they had a bad dice roll. Actually from the POV of experiencing worse in EA than elsewhere, without knowing anyone else's experiences, it <i>should</i> update the women that there is a significant problem in EA.</li><li>Also, in any of the cases where there were misunderstandings, I get it and don't think this is itself a reason that we should expect people to be quiet about their discomfort. Where someone is feeling uncomfortable, they may also be new, so it's understandable that they would struggle to tell who is vs isn't a self-described EA, or EA vs rationalist, or EA-adjacent vs EA-central, or coincidental invite vs actual ingroup, or anomaly vs norm, or awkwardness vs sexually or selfishly-motivated etc. It falls on the journalist to put together the right narrative, much more than the women.</li><li>Of course it's possible that one or more of the women were intentionally scandal-promoting in their own telling, but that would <i>not</i> be the majority of women and anyway the buck is supposed to stop at the journalist (they are supposed to be able to find bad actors pushing a self-interested narrative), so I am not even entertaining the possibility in this moment. I don't think it meaningfully changes the conclusions about the journalist.</li></ol><p>Sorry to always write so much but I just don't have any simple one-line opinions about anything about this situation.&nbsp;<br><br>I agree that surveys are the community's job. And that option has been considered since the November SA post (I know cuz I talked to Catherine about it) and is now <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mEkRrDweNSdNdrmvx/plans-for-investigating-and-improving-the-experience-of\">moving forward</a>. Tbh I chalk it up to bad timing that concerns about gendered experiences in EA weren't handled immediately with such a survey back in November. That would have been really in character for the community before then. But the major post about SA came right after the FTX crisis, and the community had just lost a lot of slack to start new projects. Everyone's workload at CEA grew, and I doubt they could even do much hiring due to concerns about financial investigations. It seems to me that a truth-intentioned (and skilled) journalist could have shown how EA was struggling right then and portrayed things in a nuanced and better light (again like Kelsey did <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/2/15/23601143/effective-altruism-sexual-harassment-misconduct\">here</a> in a response to that very Time piece). Normally it's correct to assume incompetence rather than mal-intent/ulterior motives, but we have to assume a Time Magazine journalist is about as skilled as they come, so I think not-well-intentioned, or not-well-<i>enough</i>-intentioned when it comes to <i>prioritizing truth over scandal</i>, holds water.<br><br>Regardless of surveys, &nbsp;some of these incidents were easily-noted to be (accidental on the part of the women I assume) red herrings when it came to the claim that EA (not rationality, not bay area group houses, not tech, but EA) has an acute sexual harassment problem or toxicity problem, and it is the role of the truth-focused journalist to figure out which is which. Just read <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JCyX29F77Jak5gbwq/ea-sexual-harassment-and-abuse?commentId=jKJ4kLq8e6RZtTe2P\">these details </a>which have since come out about the Time incidents. I think all those details would have been trivially easy for a truth-focused journalist to figure out, if they had made it known to Julia or Catherine that they wanted them. And I think they <i>should have wanted them before blasting something on the national stage</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>Of course, the problem from a journalist's perspective with getting more details and a more nuanced view is that they can make the piece no longer important-seeming enough to be worthy of Time Magazine. And then all your investigation will have to go on the chopping block and never be seen really. So incentives align for them to blow things out of proportion, both intentionally and self-servingly/unconsciously.&nbsp;[I'd even guess there is a selection effect that journalists who get enough clout to work at Time are adapted to do this].<br><br>So yes it seems like the journalist jumped on this with little to no good faith assumptions or curiosity as to other hypotheses for how a narrative could come to them which might look real but actually be false. And that's the very generous way of putting it that I don't necessarily put as high odds on as a simpler narrative about outright dishonesty and willful ignorance.&nbsp;<br><br>I think I can't keep responding to this thread but you should feel free to write a response if you like.<br>If you want some further perspective on what I think about journalists vs the women, you might grok it from <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/hLzwNuPyEvR4mfAce/simulacra-levels-summary\">this post reflecting on different levels of comms </a>or this <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2eotFCxvFjXH7zNNw/people-will-sometimes-just-lie-about-you?commentId=x7xzewgoXmbLE5qhQ\">comment thread</a> (including the responses, but starting there).

Publish the guidelines and say \"if you don't like the guidelines, we recommend you avoid EA events\".</p>\n<p>I think <em>if</em> EA has a major problem with sexual harassment, an approach like this could be really effective.  On the other hand, if sexual harassment is not actually much of a problem in EA, we may as well continue with the current approach.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I think the problem with checklists is that fundamentally, negotiating social interactions so that everyone is happy and comfortable, and flirting and appropriate escalation, are social skills. And social skills tend to be fuzzy and involve very different types of thinking than analysis, or rule-following. So when people throw their hands up in despair, or ask for explicit rules, it feels a bit like they're getting annoyed that they can't just throw their technical skills at a social-skills problem. (Written as someone who finds some social skills hard, including in the areas of flirting/romance)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First, I suspect there are cultures in which romantic interactions are much more ritualized than our current culture.  Flirting doesn't <em>have</em> to be this super fuzzy thing if we don't want it to be.</p>\n<p>I also think there's room for social skills in the approach I suggested.  People seem to believe there are situations where you shouldn't flirt with someone <em>even</em> if you think they're trying to flirt with you -- some examples might be: when you're interviewing them for a job, when you're in a confined space, when you're on a deserted street late at night, etc.  Basically, social perception can just be another factor on the list of factors to consider.  But, as you state, it's an inherently fuzzy factor, so it probably shouldn't be as load-bearing as it currently is.</p>\n<p>I don't know Owen that well -- I've probably interacted with him for half an hour or something -- but he never struck me as particularly deficient in social skills.  My guess is if he had read this situation accurately, and the woman in question appreciated his edginess, we never would've heard about any of this.  People seem to favor a really punitive approach to Owen's actions, but the problem is that even if you're really good at reading social situations, say 99% accurate, there are always going to be those 1% misreadings which show up if you have a large enough number of social interactions.</p>\n<p>Speaking for myself, I don't think I am notably deficient in social skills.  I enjoy social deduction games, acting classes, etc.  In my mind, the issue has more to do with differing moral intuitions, especially regarding when harsh punishments are appropriate.  (My own moral intuitions would be <a href=\"https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2018/05/25/models-a-summary/\">along the lines of</a>: \"First, there is no such thing as a romantically or sexually successful person who has never ever creeped anyone out. Give yourself permission to be creepy. I am not saying that you should go around trying to creep people out... [but, stuff happens].\")  I'm usually comfortable trusting my social intuitions, but when so many condemn so harshly based on a short description of a situation with very little social context, that's when I wonder if social intuitions are really enough.</p>\n<p>Maybe a good intuition pump is: Imagine if people could send you to jail if they thought you were being kind of an asshole.  Can you see how you would be tempted to stop posting on social media and never leave your room?  Even if you're fairly skilled socially, it's inevitable that people will sometimes think you're being kind of an asshole, unless you have an unhealthy obsession with what others think.  Now consider that, as far as I can tell, Owen's crime was essentially \"being kind of an asshole\", but in the romantic/sexual domain.  If the costs of \"being kind of an asshole\" in the romantic/sexual domain are much higher than in other domains -- I have no particular reason to doubt that -- then maybe it's worthwhile to add in additional precautions beyond just \"use social skills\"?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "RKzDxTkGW9wpEhcZm", "user": {"username": "Aptdell"}}, {"_id": "PBXBLwxNb9vjacLMd", "postedAt": "2023-02-23T04:45:13.861Z", "postId": "QMee23Evryqzthcvn", "htmlBody": "<p>I've continued to work hard to see things from the perspective of women like you over the last couple days, and just had another surprising realization.

I also agree that a lot (if not most) of the harassment/women face in EA come from sentiments like the one you're describing in this comment.

Montgomery's reply</a> that some of this comment rubbed me the wrong way. As I mentioned, my guess is that most sexual harassment stems from sentiments like the one you described. It comes from an understandable place -- romantic longing -- but has oppressive outcomes. This means, even if the emotional origin is sympathetic, the men who hold this perspective should still work to change their perspective. The specific manifestation of romantic longing that I find ends up being oppressive is one which causes men to see EA women they encounter primarily as potential romantic/sexual partners. Rather than say, having their thoughts about a woman shaped by her professional accomplishments or personality. This is de-personifying, and leads to many harmful behaviors. If you meet a woman and categorize her primarily as a romantic/sexual interest, you are much less likely to instinctively think of other aspects of her. For example, if you learn of a new opportunity, and are thinking of people who might be matches for it, just on a gut level, it makes it more likely you'll forget about her when you're not in a romantic/sexual state-of-mind. Or, if you describe her to other people, if you are primarily commenting on her appearance/your interest in her, what you are then not commenting on (at least as much) is other aspects of her, aspects you would describe if you were meeting a man. This causes other people to view her in a de-personifying way, even if they've never met her/don't have any romantic/sexual interest in her. Maybe she gets a reputation for being a \"hot EA\" rather than a reputation for something like \"early career but seems good at x/y skills, and quirky in z way.\" Usually, it's more subtle than this, but still quite harmful.</p><p>Your comment is reflecting on this, and I appreciate that. But some sections come across as you are still framing women's primary &nbsp;role, at least here, as potential romantic partners. I think you could write a comment about this motivation and how you are still wrestling with it in your own life, without indulging it it so much. Sorry if that's too forward.&nbsp;</p><p>One sentence that stood out to me in particular:&nbsp;</p><p>\"Selfishly, I'd love to see more mid-late 20s or older women join.\" This gives me the impression that the main thing you think of when you think of older women joining is how it benefits your dating prospects. That's at least the framing here, though in real life I would guess you oscillate more between this framing and a more personifying one. But this specific sentence has no real reason for being here. There's some self-reflection that this perspective is harmful (the \"selfishly\") but not enough in my view. If this statement was necessary to include, I would have liked to see more caveating along the lines of \"I don't like that this is how I think and I'm trying to change it, but ...\" But since this statement seems unnecessary to me, I'm wondering why it's even included.&nbsp;</p><p>The section that S.E. Montgomery commented on about EA's gender ratio also stood out to me. As they already explained, it read to me like you were saying one important reason to work on the gender imbalance is to help men date. That seems like a nice benefit of improving the gender ratio, but far and away from the most important reasons for it. Framing it in a dating context feels uncomfortable.</p><p>I'm going into detail about this comment not because I want to chastise you or anything, but because this serves (to me at least) of an example of where a lot of harassing/objectifying/oppressive behavior towards women comes from. It's a subtle thing, so I want other people to read this, see an example worked out in real life, and have that inform their thoughts in the future.

It's just this whole implication of \"Frequently, I do not think of you in terms of your accomplishments or personality, but rather your looks and body. I indulge in my sexualization and objectification of you and am making little attempt to remedy that. I want you to know that I think of you sexually, and I will leave and think about your body as I go engage in this sexual act. Only after this will I be able to think of you as a full, fully fleshed out person with value that stems from things other than your sexual appeal.

Since he's making it sound like attraction played a role here. But it's hard to tell. And regardless, whether it's the first situation or the second is unclear to the woman, leaving in her mind that it very well could be the first situation.

But, I think it is hard for people (both men and women) to view women sexually without objectifying them. There are a few studies that demonstrate this, though I haven't seen a massive body of literature on this, which means I view these studies with some skepticism. Specifically, the studies will find that people can view sexual images of men without objectifying brain responses, but cannot do the same for women. Women are consistently objectified in a way men aren't when viewed in a sexual context. See <a href=\"https://newsroom.unl.edu/announce/todayatunl/1469/8272\">this study</a>, <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611434748\">this other study</a> by the same authors, <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/bikinis-women-men-objects-science\">this study</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6491438/\">this study</a>. (There may be more studies on this; I spent a few minutes googling and reading abstracts based on a memory of a study press release I read some time ago).</p><p>The issue here is not that people are sexually attracted to women, it's that this sexual/romantic attraction becomes the primary way they view the woman.&nbsp;</p><p>Sometimes when I bring up this trend (finding women sexually attractive often involves a high level of objectification, and this is harmful to women), &nbsp;people's response is \"It's natural/normal so it isn't a problem.\" But the behavior <i>is</i> harmful, and leads to systemic oppression. That it's extremely common and may be largely innate means it's more challenging to solve, not that we should not put effort into solving it.</p><p>There are a few things I recommend men do to try to curb this behavior. (1) Try to notice when you are engaging in this behavior. That is, when you are speaking to/thinking of a woman and viewing her primary as a sexual/romantic option. (2) When you do notice it, try to reframe her in your mind, actively thinking of things like her professional accomplishments or personality. [This is going to be very difficult to do, and you will not be perfect at it.] (3) Do not talk about her to other people in an objectifying way, which (in the broad definition I'm using now), includes talking about her primarily as a potential romantic partner. This means, if you meet a woman and you're interested in her, when you talk about her to others, you should spend some time describing her general qualities in addition to the fact that you are interested in her, and avoid bringing up that you think she's hot altogether. (4) Don't expect perfection, but consistently strive to be better. Acknowledge objectification is normal, and don't beat yourself up about doing it. But don't feel like it's a problem you can ignore either.</p><p>These are not hard and fast rules for every situation, but this is generally the approach I recommend.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me dive into an example of what can seem like innocuous behavior, but can actually be harmful to women, and contribute to a bad environment for women, especially when gender ratios are skewed and this sort of thing happens often.</p><p>You're single and want to be in a relationship. You meet a woman at an event/party and develop a crush on her. You get back to your friends and say something like \"I just met this woman named Phoebe. I'm not sure if she's into me but I'm into her\" and you don't say much else about her.</p><p>This is pretty innocuous and it's really not that bad on the scale of things. But it can still be harmful. Let's say you met another man at the event/party, and you also really liked him, but you're straight so it's not in a romantic/sexual way. When you're summarizing your time at the event/party to others, you might mention him and talk about the reasons that you like him, things that focus on his personality and who he is as a person. But with Phoebe, in this example, the only thing you're saying about her is that you like her. So now, Phoebe's building a reputation that is not built on her personality, but her role as a romantic/sexual partner. This other man, though, gets to build a reputation for his personality.&nbsp;</p><p>The harm goes away if you spend some time describing the non-appearance based reasons of why you like Phoebe. But, again, if the major focus of your conversations about Phoebe is just that you like her, that can be harmful in the way described above. It's real subtle stuff, but maybe this example shows how even innocuous things can be harmful, and why they should be avoided (with a lot of leeway for not being perfect about it), even if they're extremely normal.</p>", "parentCommentId": "uFuRZPvjzsHsTceM5", "user": {"username": "Masha Winchell"}}, {"_id": "tAQnS3T3tHdkn7bwP", "postedAt": "2023-02-23T18:49:48.712Z", "postId": "QMee23Evryqzthcvn", "htmlBody": "<p>This may be nitpicky about your word choice, but my original comment is framed outright as speculation as to what Owen meant, so I'm not making conclusions.&nbsp;</p><p>But, as I state later in the original comment, what Owen meant by the comment is not the biggest factor in this situation.

I'd guess that if OCB would've felt less shame about his sexual and romantic desires (which I remember him saying in his apology) then he would've talked about them more with friends and he'd've been in a better position to evaluate what type of romantic and sexual behavior is cooperative and a good idea in general.</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": "wXwMwM9giqbN4wSQs", "user": {"username": "MaxRa"}}, {"_id": "5ygn3q9k5QCdpADoy", "postedAt": "2023-02-23T20:03:20.840Z", "postId": "QMee23Evryqzthcvn", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>so his sharing this information meant (at least to him) \"I am very sexually attracted to you and cannot treat you 'normally' until I have masturbated.\" This is truly appalling behavior, though I can understand why someone who is socially obtuse about these things might not realize the extent of its harm/its appalling nature.</p></blockquote><p>I feel pretty scared to say this.&nbsp;</p><p>I think some people might read this not in the context of this case, but in general, that you can never talk to your consenting friends about sex.

I think people would do well to be curious - what do people in EA believe? What do women believe and want? What norms will create a community that does the most good? Again, I don't know, but I don't think that anyone else does either</li><li>On the what \"Owen did was not \"wrong and very serious\" \" poll, I think that is a deeply unpopular view to express under one's own name, so I'm not surprised people haven't said it. But I think it's a thing people believe - I've talked to some. I think it's easy to be repulsed by this, to theorize that these people don't care about the accusers welfare or are closing ranks around Cotton Barrett. I don't know! Which is why I ask. It seems clear to me that this discussion is a scary and exhausting place, not just for people who ignore the polls but for those who are voting in ways that surprise you.&nbsp;</li><li>I think of this community as a brain. And when my brain is scared and hurt it comes to quick conclusions \"Owen is really bad\" \"casual sex should not happen in EA\" or \"Owen was misunderstood\" \"We should be able to do what we want\". But this often isn't useful. Instead I want to understand what happened, what makes people able to keep doing good work and what good norms should be. And allowing the community to raise it's prefereces is the first part of that. Many people seemingly thought that SBF was reckless and broke promises. I wish we'd had some comment polls about that.</li><li>Bruce, I am glad you raised this and thanks to any who agree with him.

For example, the man I'm referring to was one of the top people at an EA organization I wanted very much to work at at the time, but if I already worked there and it happened at work or in a private environment (this was a group conversation), I would have felt uncomfortable.&nbsp;</p><p>If I wasn't allowed to have unique conversations that mention sex/romance with higher status EAs anymore, I wouldn't be able to have them at all at the moment, because I am in a very early stage of my career (I'm an undergraduate) and all my close friends are EAs. Not centering my social life around EA would be a very large sacrifice I am unwilling to make. However, Will's post Lauren referred to seems like it might be a good compromise. I don't personally sleep around, but it appears to be something easier to enjoy with less unique people than edgy conversations are.</p><p>I also think reducing global poverty and x-risks is so important that I would be willing to make a lot of sacrifices if it made a big difference to these causes.

I think I would have experienced it as an edgy conversation that involved bad wording that happened to have a large power differential, but didn't involve pressure to engage in a relationship. This is because if the man in the Time article had done something concrete that would make someone with my personality feel pressured to be in a relationship with him like ask her on a date, I think the article would have mentioned it. Instead it referred to her feelings, which I think we are learning depend a lot on people's personalities as well as objective facts.

I\u2019m sharing my experience with Owen below, because I think it\u2019s probably helpful for people reflecting on this situation (and by default, it would remain confidential indefinitely), but as an FYI, I\u2019m probably unlikely to participate in substantive discussion about it in the comments section. (I\u2019m posting this anonymously because I\u2019d prefer to avoid being pulled into lots of discussions about this in a way that drains my time and emotional energy, not because I\u2019m afraid of retribution from someone or negative consequences for my career.)</p><ul><li>Several years ago, I stayed at Owen\u2019s house for a while while I was visiting Oxford. Owen and I were friends, I had been to his house several times before, and he had previously offered that I could stay there if I was in Oxford. I was working at an EA organization at the time that was not professionally connected to Owen.</li><li>Towards the end of my stay, Owen and I went on a long walk around Oxford, where we talked about a lot of different things, including my romantic interests. At one point in the conversation (potentially adjacent to me talking about my romantic interests, though I can\u2019t remember), Owen told me he was attracted to me.</li><li>I didn\u2019t feel pressured or particularly uncomfortable hearing Owen\u2019s comment, but I found it somewhat jarring, given Owen was someone who I perceived as influential and meaningfully senior to me in the community, and I remember feeling worried about the possibility that Owen would make similar comments to other young women who might feel more uncomfortable. I don\u2019t remember exactly how I responded\u2013 my best recollection is that I told him that that was flattering to hear (pretty sure I said this), but also felt a bit weird (less sure that I said this, but I do remember that he apologized to me, so presumably I communicated this somehow, though it may have been implicit), and that I thought he shouldn\u2019t say this kind of thing to younger EAs in the future (I\u2019m sure I gave him some kind of feedback like this, but I don\u2019t remember how specific it was, e.g. whether I said \u201cyounger EAs\u201d or some other reference class). Owen apologized to me, and we continued the conversation; we remained on good terms afterwards.</li><li>It didn\u2019t occur to me to tell anyone about this at the time (I\u2019m not sure I even knew there was a Community Health team that I could report things to), and I basically forgot about this interaction until a few years later (within the last two years), when Julia Wise emailed me asking me if I had had any experiences with Owen that seemed a little off. (She also gave me some vague, high-level information about a minor-sounding experience someone else had had with Owen, which I won\u2019t share here to protect that person\u2019s confidentiality.) I recounted the incident above to her, and told her I thought it would be good for Owen to receive feedback about how senior he seemed to others in the community, as it seemed to me in our interaction that he hadn\u2019t perceived or internalized this, and wasn\u2019t considering how it could create power dynamics that changed how certain personal interactions came across.<br><br>Edited to clarify: My interaction with Owen happened after the interaction reported in TIME, but before<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9JCkkjKMNL4Hmg4qP/ev-uk-board-statement-on-owen-s-resignation?commentId=vjtEvaxDHFvfTXwBF\"> Owen received feedback about the TIME interaction from Julia</a>.</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "EAForumAnon"}}, {"_id": "vpne8oqkJSCxJcs2i", "postedAt": "2023-03-16T00:21:09.160Z", "postId": "QMee23Evryqzthcvn", "htmlBody": "<p>I knew Owen at university.

I enjoy and appreciate the EA community because, at least up until recently, people here seemed committed to caring about what's true and what will maximally benefit the world, not jumping on the social shaming bandwagon.

I'm now cautiously resuming some of these activities. In some cases (like posting things online) this is just a decision in my court, though I\u2019ll continue to seek advice. In other cases there will be decisions for others to make about how to interface with me<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4ocowrmesj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4ocowrmesj\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(e.g. whether to have me at events) \u2014 in such cases I\u2019d like to cooperate with the relevant parties to help them reach whatever decisions they\u2019d most endorse. I'm making this change after working in-depth with a therapist, integrating more feedback, asking advice from wiser folks, and reflecting to better understand what I did wrong, how it was problematic, and how to act appropriately going forwards.</p><p>If anyone has any bad experiences interacting with me in the future, I want to say \u2014 please share that with somebody if you feel comfortable doing so. I\u2019d love it if you could share with me (and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever thought badly of someone for giving me blunt feedback), but I understand if it would be easier to share with someone else. I know that my colleagues (broadly understood) won\u2019t want to support patterns where I\u2019m doing harm.</p><h3>Advice to people in similar situations</h3><p>Based on my original statement, a few people expressed to me confusion about what had gone wrong. I want to be clear that I wasn\u2019t just unlucky here: my actions would have been ill-judged even absent any power differential, and were decidedly inappropriate when there was one. In particular, I sought increased intimacy \u2014 heavily grounded in misguided emotional angst<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflemm7t27a5p\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlemm7t27a5p\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;\u2014 in ways that were inattentive to romantic communication norms, and sometimes lost touch with what the other person wanted. In case this might reach anyone in a similar position to where I was (and thereby help to avert the pattern playing out again), here is the advice I\u2019d want to give to my past self:</p><blockquote><p>You need to get over yourself. Emotionally, the question of whether you\u2019re bad for feeling attracted to people is crushing. It happens that it\u2019s a misguided question, and not one that other people would be interested in. I recommend \u2014 if you can access it \u2014 just not feeling bad about it. But you\u2019re allowed to be misguided on things. What\u2019s not OK is casting other people as your judge (a role that shouldn\u2019t exist!) without their permission.&nbsp;</p><p>What\u2019s worse is trying to involve the people you feel attracted to in determining whether you're bad. This is a recipe for harm \u2014 both because they should never have to engage with you on that question, but also because its reductive nature doesn\u2019t leave room for their own feelings, and you\u2019re at risk both of not noticing their experience, and even of asking them to be complicit in masking their experience to provide reassurances on your nonsense question. People who have less structural power are at greater risk of not feeling comfortable being direct \u2014 you\u2019re not being respectful by \u201ctaking them at their word\u201d and assuming they\u2019ll say the important things, because it doesn\u2019t really give them room to choose how to engage. Moreover, (1) if you have professional interactions with someone where shame inhibits your ability to think/talk directly about the meta of the relationship, this could make things go wrong, and (2) if you ever hurt someone who regards you in some way as a mentor, that would be a betrayal of their trust.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, think things through in private, or with help. Principally, process your feelings; when it\u2019s no longer painful to think about, if you still feel moved to act, think through how any action may be received. (It\u2019s not bad to think about these things! it\u2019s actually laudable to do so. Na\u00efvety is not a shield. Your sex aversion won\u2019t always stop others from seeing things as about sex.) Journal about it. Talk to friends. Get a therapist.</p></blockquote><p>(If you\u2019re reading this and you feel like this might in some way be talking to you, feel free to reach out \u2014 I could say a bit more, but am also just very happy to listen to anyone who finds it difficult to talk about this.)</p><h3>Personal updates</h3><p>Having spent time working through my angst I now think I know how to seek romantic connection in healthy ways. However, I also now identify as monogamous \u2014 I still think polyamory has a philosophical appeal, but it\u2019s apparent to me that I don\u2019t really want more romance in my life; and it\u2019s now apparent that feeling attraction while monogamous need not involve wronging people. Going forwards I won\u2019t bring these topics up in conversation. Also having taken feedback from folks I\u2019ll avoid some behaviours I wasn\u2019t tracking as potentially problematic (notably, taking meetings in hotel rooms when it was more convenient).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefupzqk1kz8yl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnupzqk1kz8yl\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>I\u2019m conscious that in some cases people might be uncomfortable interacting with me because of my past actions. Navigating this is tricky. I\u2019m quite uncomfortable with the idea that people who don\u2019t want to might feel compelled to interact with me, but I don\u2019t think I can promise never to be present in any spaces where this might occur. I will say that I would like it if people felt affordance to withdraw or to ask me to withdraw. (I can\u2019t imagine holding this against someone, and if I find the experience difficult that\u2019s between me and my therapist.)</p><p>I\u2019m sorry again to everyone. I care deeply about giving people interacting with me good experiences, and strive to be one of the people who proactively contributes to a healthy culture with robust safeguards against harm. I fell well short of that standard. I\u2019ll work hard to do consistently better on this in the future \u2014 I never get to know exactly what my remaining blindspots are, but I\u2019m hopeful that I\u2019ve now understood enough to give the problematic behaviour a wide berth \u2014 and I welcome others helping to hold me accountable in this.<br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn4ocowrmesj\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref4ocowrmesj\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>And in some cases that might take some time; e.g. CEA had said that they wouldn\u2019t talk to me about the issues in-depth or consider having me at their events until the external investigation EV commissioned was complete \u2014 which seemed very reasonable.
