If you can say, who are your initial funders?</p><p>One thing I'd like to see you grapple a bit more with is the politicization of official aid. This may seriously constrain an org's ability to influence (1) top-down aid priorities and (2) in-country programme outcomes. This is based on my experience on the ground rather than a rigorous review, so may be wrong or biased in important ways. But it is my impression that official aid programmes are usually designed and implemented with much closer cooperation with and direction from the host government. I think this means that official aid orgs face more impact-political palatibility trade-offs than do NGOs, for example (though NGOs are constrained in other ways).</p><p>Another trend I think you should be aware of is the apparent pillaging of aid budgets to fund climate finance commitments. Rich countries have promised to finance projects in lower-income countries to mitigate and adapt to climate change, and pledged that they'll do so by providing additional funding on top of their aid budgets. In reality, though, they're falling well short of those taregets AND many are raising much of the climate finance money by reallocating their aid budgets!</p><p>I'd love to see more scrutiny on this decision--for example, some of the folks at CGD are <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/whose-climate-finance-new-and-additional\">doing God's work</a> by working through tedious aid budget details. It's not at all clear that climate finance projects save more lives than traditional aid projects that are more optimized for health outcomes, so I think this trend is probably very bad compared to a counterfactual of just funding the regular aid budget (and almost certainly very bad against a counterfactual of aid funding + additional climate finance).</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Stephen Clare"}}, {"_id": "XZL3YcFHfXHoCjJRk", "postedAt": "2022-12-07T19:16:59.821Z", "postId": "agKFRa5qBApnfLrSh", "htmlBody": "<p>Hey Mathias, I've work in development here in Northern Uganda for 10 years, and I think this is a fantastic idea for an org. I love your examples and I have no doubt that this issue is tractable, although I've failed in my own feeble local efforts here in Northern Uganda ;). Here's a couple of comments off the top of my head :). I could go on and on but &nbsp;it's too much &nbsp;for a comment .</p><ul><li>My experience has been that most government aid projects are terrible, either doing harm or very little good at all. &nbsp;The worst are government-to-government aid, where unfortunately most of the aid money goes as spelled out well in Dambisa Moyo's \"Dead Aid\" book. Here in Uganda there are some great high impact exceptions such as USAID's Pepfar, providing free malaria commodities, and some results based healthcare projects (although these can go both ways) but they are exceptions not the rule. &nbsp;<br><br>We currently have GIZ (<i><strong>German development &nbsp;agency with an unfortunate name</strong></i>) spending millions here in Northern Uganda doing lot's of close to zero impact projects while causing potential harm while they are at it. Their projects are so painfully bad it sometimes makes me feel physically sick, and I've failed completely in my few efforts to talk to GIZ members about what they do. I don't think local lobbying is necessarily very useful because no-one working on the ground wants to even consider the possibility that what they are doing here in Uganda might be useless or harmful, and they don't make many decisions about what they do. This kind of advocacy &nbsp;then needs to happen at a higher level. I <i><strong>understand EA is fairly active in Berlin, and this is the kind of thing that could well be lobbied on successfully.&nbsp;</strong></i><br>&nbsp;</li><li>&nbsp;My experience here in Northern Uganda is that most climate mitigation funding &nbsp;is ineffectual, &nbsp;with a surprising amount of it &nbsp;just funnelled into corrupt official's pockets and a lot of the rest spent on meaningless trainings and meetings. Like Stephen said much of it would be far better spent just on development initiatives - that will be better climate mitigation than the current useless projects. Redirecting he 100 billion of &nbsp;climate funding could be a GREAT area for advocacy, perhaps the most important at the moment. I might write a post on this even...<br>&nbsp;</li><li>I think a key factor to consider will be which governments might be willing to be nudged in the right direction. My instinct is that USAID might be a waste of time to lobby with their rigid policies more concerned with politics and accountability than impact (although they would claim otherwise), while you might be able to get more traction in European countries.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Can't believe your Hans Neiman joke as well.
