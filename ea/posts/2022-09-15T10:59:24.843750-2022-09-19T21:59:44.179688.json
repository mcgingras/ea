One of the reasons she suspects may be driving this is unrealistic expectations of saving the entire future or preventing astronomical waste has become internalized among many EAs. She thinks it leads to ignoring other ways to do good. Conditional on the harm actually happening, I will show the rest of this post.</p>\n<p>My opinion: This is an interesting post, and I agree with this post at least somewhat and provide my own reasons for why this might have happened. I also think this is a clear example of a memetic downside with longtermism, yet I still think it was correct to air longtermism out despite the psychological harm it may have caused. To lay out my agreements first:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>I agree that the vast majority of people have severely miscalibrated notions of how much good they can realistically do, with certain exceptions (Eliezer Yudkowsky, Holden Karnofsky, Ajeya Cotra et al probably do deserve awards for potentially protecting the long-term future.) And that's despite thinking the probability of our century being the hinge of history is probably in the 30-60% range.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>There's still a lot of opportunities to do good, and that matters. Heck, even basic Earning to Give is a good start to impact. This is often not noticed in the buzz over longtermism, but it matters.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>That people should still realize just how much ordinary problems matter.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One larger point: Unlike another post by Denise Melchin on \"My Mistakes on the path to impact\" which is linked here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/QFa92ZKtGp7sckRTR/my-mistakes-on-the-path-to-impact?commentId=4HsQcjhb9B5vWiBC5#comments\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/QFa92ZKtGp7sckRTR/my-mistakes-on-the-path-to-impact?commentId=4HsQcjhb9B5vWiBC5#comments</a></p>\n<p>Where I'd estimate 80% of the problems was due to herself, the opposite occured here, where I'd blame the EA community about 80%. Yes, people unrealistically estimated their impact, but longtermism/AI Safety shifts was the spark here. Now don't get me wrong, I still think it should have been aired, and that it would be unreasonably privileging psychological health when a non-trivial chance of X-risk would happen, but I do think it at least should be mentioned.</p>\n<p>Finally, I think there's another reason this happened, and that has to do with the fact that we prioritize relative over absolute differences. In other words, we don't care nearly as much as a 10x increase of our money as we do about comparing ourselves to those 10x richer. And longtermism/AI Safety, with it being 10-20 orders of magnitude more useful than most other causes, set off our relative status comparison alarms, even though the universe is not obliged to make causes equal or nearly equal.</p>\n<p>So it's not easy for our brains to tolerate that inequality, and yet that is probably the most important thing any EA should know.</p>\n<p>One last point, this time as a link. EA is not a competition.

Will a panel of 15 recognized experts in AI safety expect a proposed alignment solution to make TAI increase human flourishing with an average above X% certainty given no malevolent human intervention if released during the subsequent 5 years?</p><p>We expect this to approximate a model of our uncertainty on what alignment looks like at this stage with the expert judgments that researchers often defer to. However, this is but one way to measure our progress towards alignment. We expect there to be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ybYBCK9D7MZCcdArB/how-to-measure-anything\"><u>many metrics</u></a> to track. Some examples can be seen in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forms.gle/9VCPncvxbkyvTpDX6\"><u>the survey</u></a>.</p><h3>Importance of measuring progress</h3><p>There are several reasons why we would like to measure progress. Some of the most important include:</p><ol><li>Better markers of progress allows us to measure AI safety against AGI, providing further argumentation for when we can safely deploy or stop AGI development.</li><li>Better models of alignment solutions give us better arguments for which solutions should work and which should not. This is relevant both for differential technology research but also for people in policy.</li><li>Benchmarks can push the AI safety field forward (<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/xFotXGEotcKouifky/worlds-where-iterative-design-fails\"><u>with caveats</u></a>): Benchmarks in ML development have guided research immensely, e.g. ImageNet and CNNs and CASP and AlphaFold.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/vavnqwYbc8jMu3dTY/ai-coordination-needs-clear-wins\"><u>AI safety needs more wins</u></a>, and showcasing these wins is important for AI safety to be seen as an attractive and serious field.</li><li>AI safety is missing empiricism<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxkexb8mcuzn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxkexb8mcuzn\">[3]</a></sup></span>: If we get measures of progress and an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EPhDMkovGquHtFq3h/an-experiment-eliciting-relative-estimates-for-open\"><u>effectiveness / dollar spent for AI safety</u></a>, this will integrate the empiricism of effective altruism more and make us better at evaluating the impact of future AI safety projects.</li><li>A case for hope that has not existed until now becomes more tangible. If we understand where we made progress, we might elicit a feeling that we can actually&nbsp;<i>solve</i> alignment.</li></ol><h3>Benchmarks &amp; data</h3><p>There are already a few existing benchmarks for progress on safe AGI that attempt to measure safety or correlates of safety in AI systems. One of the most famous ones (both in ML and alignment) is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA\"><u>TruthfulQA</u></a> which is a dataset that measures the truthfulness of language models given adversarially generated text examples. It seems there are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX8phGhG8VQ&amp;ab_channel=YannicKilcher\"><u>multiple</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efPrtcLdcdM&amp;ab_channel=YannicKilcher\"><u>issues</u></a> with using it as a safety measure (though it is good as a radicalization bug fixer) and it has not&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paperswithcode.com/sota/question-answering-on-truthfulqa\"><u>had many papers that attempt state-of-the-art</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5xrd9tcbhu6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5xrd9tcbhu6\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;despite&nbsp;<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=204624588678524687&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en\"><u>its citations</u></a>. However, it did stir the media on language models when it came out.</p><p>Another is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/safety-gym/\"><u>Safety Gym</u></a>, an OpenAI gym environment for safe exploration experiments in RL. We could&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paperswithcode.com/task/safe-exploration/codeless\"><u>not find any benchmark tracking</u></a>, however it seems to have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=3546576102853818527&amp;as_sdt=2005&amp;sciodt=0,5&amp;hl=en\"><u>substantial amount of citations</u></a> (154) in papers with related projects so maybe it has inspired other benchmarks.</p><p><a href=\"https://partnershiponai.org/safelife/\"><u>SafeLife</u></a> is a benchmark for reducing side effects of goal-oriented environment interaction in complex game-like environments made by the Partnership on AI. It seems to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wandb.ai/safelife/v1dot2/benchmark/leaderboard\"><u>function as a benchmark</u></a>, though it has received limited traction by the community.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/inverse-scaling/prize\"><u>inverse scaling prize</u></a> has a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SGmUh0NbqSrRkWRUcmjg8BS5eU5qvJ0Y\"><u>Google Colab</u></a> that generates the plots necessary to evaluate if there is inverse scaling and the prize itself is given based on reviewer feedback and automatic auditing of the results using private models. This is not scalable as a benchmark but with a bit of tweaking, it can possibly be a fully-automatic process to identify future inverse scaling laws which are relevant for inferring the capability misalignment dimensions of future large models.</p><p>Additionally,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://safe.ai/\"><u>The Center for AI Safety</u></a> and its affiliates have recently released&nbsp;<a href=\"https://safe.ai/competitions\"><u>several competitions</u></a> in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mlsafety.org/\"><u>machine learning safety</u></a>. The benchmark-based ones are the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trojandetection.ai/\"><u>NeurIPS Trojan Detection Challenge</u></a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ood-cv.org/challenge.html\"><u>OOD robustness challenge</u></a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://moraluncertainty.mlsafety.org/\"><u>Moral Uncertainty Competition</u></a>.</p><p>All these seem like good benchmarks for sub-problems in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MskKEsj8nWREoMjQK/introduction-to-pragmatic-ai-safety-pragmatic-ai-safety-1\"><u>pragmatic AI safety</u></a> and from our perspective seem to have good potential. Here follows a short benchmark description of each.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trojandetection.ai/tracks\"><u>Trojan detection challenge</u></a> has three tracks which all relate to the detection, generation, and analysis of neural networks that have been attacked with an adversarial perturbation that is intentionally hidden. The benchmark would consist of a training, test, and validation set of Trojaned and non-Trojaned neural networks which is quantifiable as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cQwT8asti3kyA62zc/automating-auditing-an-ambitious-concrete-technical-research\"><u>automatic auditing task</u></a> on relevant&nbsp;<a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/20-popular-machine-learning-metrics-part-1-classification-regression-evaluation-metrics-1ca3e282a2ce\"><u>ML metrics</u></a>.</p><p>The out-of-distribution generalization in computer vision (<a href=\"http://www.ood-cv.org/\"><u>OOD-CV</u></a>) challenge has three tracks which all relate to image transformation models\u2019 ability to generalize beyond a given training set to images that show significant differences on six different properties in its test set. This also seems like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paperswithcode.com/paper/robin-a-benchmark-for-robustness-to\"><u>good benchmark</u></a> for explicit OOD performance evaluation.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://moraluncertainty.mlsafety.org/\"><u>moral uncertainty competition</u></a> directly rewards performance (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic#Probabilistic_interpretation\"><u>AUROC</u></a>) and therefore seems ideal for a benchmark (which it already is based on its leaderboard).

Although Will writes that \"all historical civilisational collapses to date have been local\" (p. 157), the Bronze Age Collapse seems like an exception because it spanned much of the Mediterranean region.

For instance, building an AI aiming for proxy goals - things slightly different than what we care about, but easier to describe / measure. For instance, we could ask an AI to reduce law enforcement complaints, and it might tackle it via suppressing complaints instead of improving practices. Another pathway is an AI deployed with the capability to improve itself, and access to info to do so eg. the internet.

To me, it was a really inspiring example of the principles of effective altruism in action \u2014 using rationality and curiosity to solve a concrete problem to make people\u2019s lives better.&nbsp;</p><p>I was having a dinner party with some friends last night with a theme of how we could improve indoor air safety, starting with our local community in New York. (Some background <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/j4eTj9dGqzEC5LEzK/cause-exploration-prizes-indoor-air-quality-to-reduce\">here</a> on how my colleagues at 1Day Sooner and i think about the air safety problem). How can we get buildings to clean the air (by filtering it, mixing it with outdoor air, and sterilizing it with ultraviolet light) so that people don\u2019t suffer from pollution and pathogens?</p><p>We were discussing what was feasible to accomplish politically and were struggling because a standard answer to \u201cwhat air safety interventions are optimal for a space to adopt?\u201d doesn\u2019t yet exist. We agreed that it would be uniquely valuable to recruit early adopters (e.g. tech companies, private schools, universities) to try out solutions and test them for effectiveness in reducing disease. If well-designed, this could generate experimental evidence on effectiveness and create a template for later adopters and governments to implement.</p><p>An obvious place to start would be the EA community and trying to get EA spaces to implement air safety measures (like installing filters and upper-room UV light). There are a number of organizations that could fit the bill, and I\u2019m aware of at least one that is exploring doing this in their own office.</p><p>One suggestion that uniquely resonated with me was the idea that the next EA Global (after EAG DC) should make its air safe. (That is, it should have a respiratory infection risk level it tries to achieve, some surrogate targets it aims to measure, and a set of indoor air interventions that are reasonably likely to achieve the intended risk level).&nbsp;</p><p>I don\u2019t think this will be easy and in fact I think it might be more likely than not that we fail. But part of what is valuable about EA is our commitment to learning from failure and improve over time. Trying to implement air safety interventions will teach us about the existing gaps that need to be filled, which will get us closer for the next EAG (and EAGx) until we get to a point where we\u2019re proud of our community for becoming safer and a better model for achieving good outcomes elsewhere.</p><p>I recognize it already takes a tremendous amount of effort &nbsp;to run EA Global, and I appreciate the work CEA does putting these events on. So my intention is not to create additional burden. But biosecurity is a cause many EAs are passionate about, and air safety is one of the most promising interventions to achieve deterrence-by-denial of engineered respiratory biothreats. I feel like making our own spaces safe from pathogens is a challenge that our community can and should rise to and that doing so will have outsized benefits on our ability to accomplish future policy.

We strongly encourage anyone organizing a fundraising campaign at their company to include as many of these factors as possible in order to increase the campaign\u2019s impact and effectiveness.</p><p>The list of key factors includes:</p><ul><li>Timing \u2013 Giving season</li><li>Timing \u2013 Liquidity events</li><li>Setting a personal example</li><li>Being open about your donations</li><li>And more\u2026</li></ul><h3>Timing \u2013 Giving season</h3><p>Picking the right timing is essential for the success of the campaign. The end of the year is usually an excellent time (at least in the EU and in the US); after all, there\u2019s a reason it\u2019s called the \u201cgiving season\u201d. Check if your company has an official giving period \u2013 it could likely be in October, November, or December. If no specific period is defined, December seems to be a good starting point, usually between Giving Tuesday (at the end of November) and the Christmas holidays. Make sure to end your campaign before people leave for the winter holidays instead of at the end of December, otherwise people won\u2019t be around for the final push.</p><h3>Timing \u2013 Liquidity events</h3><p>Another good opportunity for a campaign is to time it around liquidity events, like salary raises, bonuses, or vesting of shares. If people get a 5% raise, for example, they can still be net positive even if they donate 1% of their income. The most successful events seem to have a combination of giving season and a year-end raise/bonus or vesting of shares. Looking for and capturing such opportunities can multiply the impact of a campaign.</p><h3>Setting a personal example</h3><p>We\u2019ve found that campaign organizers\u2019 leading by example strongly determines the total amount of money raised. As a rule of thumb, the more the organizers donate, the more others donate. By their own example, organizers can encourage and inspire other people to donate as well. Moreover, with their donation, the organizers help set the perception of the \u201cnormal\u201d donation amount (10 USD, 100 USD, 1000 USD, etc.), make it relatable, and show that it\u2019s possible. The message being sent is, \u201cI\u2019m a regular person just like you and I can make a significant difference through my donation.\u201d That is the organizer\u2019s influential advantage as an insider at the company.</p><p>As an example, during a campaign we were part of, all the co-organizers announced that they were donating their entire 3000 USD year-end bonus. One colleague was so inspired that he decided to donate his entire bonus as well. Another colleague, who had not originally planned to donate, said that there was no way that he couldn\u2019t donate after seeing the co-organizers\u2019 commitment, so decided to donate himself as well.</p><p>All this goes to show the power you can have by leading by example and setting norms within your company.</p><h3>Being open about your donations</h3><p>Related to the point above, it really helps to openly talk about your donations and encourage others to do the same. Some people might be a bit reticent and think that talking about donations is almost like bragging about how good you are. However, studies have shown that being open about your donations can inspire others to donate themselves. Announcing your own donation can set an example and motivate your colleagues to follow suit.</p><h3>And more\u2026</h3><p>To discover more of the factors that make a successful fundraising campaign, check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/3eNpdOb\"><u>the full detailed list</u></a> here, and contact&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:federico@highimpactprofessionals.org\"><u>Federico Speziali</u></a> to explore&nbsp;what a&nbsp;fundraising campaign could look like at your organization.</p>", "user": {"username": "High Impact Professionals"}}, {"_id": "axHmMXcGdbh7o5FfQ", "title": "Paradox of Hedonism", "postedAt": "2022-09-18T11:46:53.802Z", "htmlBody": "<p>My recent article on the paradox of hedonism.

The\npost separates out different levels of wealth and the qualitative\ndifferences between them, with the four levels being $10-30 million,\n$30-100 million, $100 million-$1 billion, and $1 billion+.</p>\n<p>As with all such analyses, the threshold selection is somewhat\narbitrary, and a lot of nuance is missed, but I still find the\nexercise interesting.</p>\n<p>I thought it would be interesting to do a somewhat similar exercise\nfor levels of donation; this seemed like a good prompt in response to\nwhich I could express several thoughts that have been floating around\nin my mind.</p>\n<p>This post looks at various levels of donation as well as the ways one\ncould level up (if deemed desirable).</p>\n<h2>The levels of donation</h2>\n<h3>Level 1: retail donor (&lt; $1,000)</h3>\n<p>Lower limit for level 1: retail donor: $0</p>\n<p>Upper limit for level 1: retail donor: $500 to $1,000</p>\n<p>Prototypical donor: Low-income person (typically young, such as a\nstudent) donating some money; higher-income person donating 1% of\nincome.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Split between donees?</strong> (no): The <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/why-it-makes-sense-to-pick-one-charity\">one-charity\nargument</a>\nis pretty much definitely true here; it's very hard to imagine a\ncase where the marginal value functions of two donees cross\nwithin this small an amount of donation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Investigate?</strong> (no): It probably doesn't make sense to spend\nextensive resources investigating by yourself or hiring others to\ninvestigate. You should either donate directly to the best endpoint\ndonee, or give money to a reallocator (such as the EA Funds,\nGiveWell Maximum Impact Fund, or GiveWell All Grants Fund) that is\nsufficiently value-aligned with you. It may not even make sense to\nwrite extensively about your decision.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Engage donee?</strong> (no): It probably doesn't make sense to ask a bunch\nof questions of the donee or expect any kind of personalized\nresponse; it's best to rely on information you already have as a\ndonor.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimize for transaction costs?</strong> (no): You should probably just\nuse whatever donation method the donee recommends, rather than\nreaching out to the donee to figure out the best method for your\nparticular case (for instance, if they suggest using PayPal, use\nPayPal, even if you know it has network fees that you'd rather not\nspend).</p>\n<p>As a data point, <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/donate/more-information#supportcharities\">GiveWell's page on how to\ndonate</a>\nsets a threshold for $1,000 for when you should switch from donating\nby credit card to donating by check.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimize for taxes?</strong> (no): Optimizing donation timing and other\ndonation mechanics for tax considerations probably doesn't make\nsense at this level.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Level 2 (four-digit donors)</h3>\n<p>Lower limit for level 2: $500 to $1,000</p>\n<p>Upper limit for level 2: $5,000 to $10,000</p>\n<p>Prototypical donors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Person or couple with median income (by first-world standards)\ndonating a nontrivial percentage of income annually (such as the 10%\nset by the Giving What We Can Pledge).</li>\n<li>Person with higher income donating a smaller percentage of salary or\ndonating at a cadence more frequency than annual.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Considerations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Split between donees?</strong> (conceivable but unlikely): It's\nconceivable (though unlikely) that the one-charity argument starts\nbreaking down here, if the expected <em>best</em> use of your funds also\nhas sharply diminishing marginal value (e.g., helping an organization\nget off the ground, or close a small funding gap). So you might find\nyourself splitting your donation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Investigate?</strong> (yes, a few hours): If you don't have any obvious\nendpoint donee or reallocator with whom you are closely\nvalue-aligned <em>a priori</em>, it may make sense to spend a few hours\ninvestigating the options. It may also make sense to document your\nthinking.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Engage donee?</strong> (maybe, hope for responsiveness but not proactive\neffort from donee): It may make sense to ask questions of potential\ndonees to get information beyond what you already know, especially\nif there isn't a lot of publicly available information. However, you\nshould not expect donees to drop everything to appease you or go\nthrough application processes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimize for transaction costs?</strong> (yes): You should coordinate\nwith the donee on the mechanics of the money transfer to minimize\ntransaction costs, to the extent that the donee has options\navailable.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimize for taxes?</strong> (yes; start thinking about it): Optimizing\ndonation timing and other donation mechanics for tax considerations\nmay start making sense. For instance, you may decide to defer\ndonation by a month or two so that it falls in the next tax\nyear. However, this is most likely going to be a minor\nconsideration compared to other considerations.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Level 3 (five-digit donors)</h3>\n<p>Lower limit for level 3: $5,000 to $10,000</p>\n<p>Upper limit for level 3: $50,000 to $100,000</p>\n<p>Prototypical donors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Person or couple with high income (by first-world standards)\ndonating a nontrivial percentage of income annually (such as the 10%\nset by the Giving What We Can Pledge, or possibly a higher level\nsuch as 30%). See, for instance <a href=\"https://www.patbl.com/misc/other/donations/\">Patrick\nBrinich-Langlois</a> (or\nhis <a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Patrick+Brinich-Langlois\">page on the donations list\nwebsite</a>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Person with significant acquired wealth donating a portion of the\nwealth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Winner of a small donor lottery.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Considerations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Split between donees?</strong> (plausible): There's a high enough\nchance that marginal value functions change enough over the course\nof your donation that you should think about marginal value\nfunctions and not just assume the one-charity argument. If you don't\nwant to be bothered by such considerations, donating to large\norganizations (or reallocators) is probably the way to go.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Investigate?</strong> (yes, and maybe engage others to investigate too):\nIt may make sense to not only spend your time but seek the time of\nothers -- potentially even pay others -- to investigate options and\nfind the most value-aligned option. Whether you do so depends on how\ngood you think the existing options (both endpoint donees and\nreallocators) are. It may even make sense to participate in\nsomething like the\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWivz6KidkI\">S-process</a> with other\nfunders and recommenders, or add one's own funds to an existing\nS-process (the advantage of the S-process over donating to EA Funds\nis that you can input your own weights on different recommenders, so\nit may be better if you are somewhat but not fully aligned with the\nindividual recommenders).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Engage donee?</strong> (yes, seek more proactive response): At this\namount of money, if you're considering giving all or a large chunk\nof it to a specific donee, it makes sense to engage the donee in\ndepth, to understand better how they expect to use the money, how\nit'll interact with the rest of their fundraising plans, etc. This\ngives a clearer picture of the marginal value function. The amount\nof money may even be enough for you or the donee to think of other\nuses for the money beyond what the donee had in mind. But it's still\nnot enough money for you to expect the donee to radically change\ndirection to acquire the money.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimize for transaction costs?</strong> (yes): At this level, it may\nmake sense to do more than just figure out the best of the\n<em>existing</em> money transfer options; it may even be worth setting up a\nnew way to transfer money to reduce the transaction costs.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimize for taxes?</strong> (yes, possibly even encourage the donee to\nget a relevant tax-exempt status): At this scale, the tax savings\nfrom being able to deduct the donation from taxes may be high enough\nto cover the costs for the donee to apply for tax-exempt status, if\nit doesn't have one already but is otherwise eligible for one.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Level 4 (six-digit donors)</h3>\n<p>Lower limit for level 4: $50,000 to $100,000</p>\n<p>Upper limit for level 4: $500,000 to $1,000,000</p>\n<p>Prototypical donors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Person or couple with high income donating a sizable fraction of\nincome annually; see for instance the donor power couple <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/donations\">Jeff\nKaufman and Julia Wise</a>(or their\n<a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donor.php?donor=Jeff+Kaufman+and+Julia+Wise\">page on the donations list\nwebsite</a>). They've\npledged 30% and target 50% of their pre-tax income as donations.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Person or couple who acquired significant wealth and is donating a\nchunk of it; for instance, selling a bunch of cryptocurrency, or\nexercising and selling accumulated stock options.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Winner of a big donor lottery.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Considerations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Split between donees?</strong> (likely): At this point, unless you happen\nto think the most scalable things are also the most high-value, it's\nquite likely you'll either want to split your donation between\ndonees or donate to a reallocator such as the EA Funds. The\nreallocator will effectively use the extra money to donate to\nmultiple additional endpoint donees (note that some reallocators\nsuch as the GiveWell Maximum Impact Fund donate in larger chunks of\nmoney, so if that's where you want to donate then you will probably\nnot effectively be splitting your donation).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Investigate?</strong> (yes, at this point it becomes a matter of due\ndiligence): At this level of money, even if you have the impression\nthat a particular endpoint donee or reallocator is value-aligned,\nyou should investigate in order to seek confirmation of this. Even\nslight misalignments in value would tilt the scales toward running\nsomething like a\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWivz6KidkI\">S-process</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Engage donees?</strong> (yes, you can even set up an application form and\nconduct multiple rounds of grantmaking): At this point, you can go\nto donees or ask donees to come to you. You can write up your own\nrequest for proposals and expect existing or even potential new\ndonees to read it and apply based on what you're looking for. You\ncan reach out to people and suggest they start up organizations that\nyou would like to see.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimize for transaction costs?</strong> (yes): Not much changes from the\nprevious level for this.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Optimize for taxes?</strong> (yes): At this scale, it makes sense to be\nthinking hard about the right financial instruments to use to\nminimize tax obligations over the long term. You may even pay people\nto figure this out and set up the right systems.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Level 5 (seven-digit donors)</h3>\n<p>Lower limit for level 5: $500,000 to $1,000,000</p>\n<p>Upper limit for level 5: $5,000,000 to $10,000,000</p>\n<p>Prototypical donors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Person or couple who is donating a significant chunk of income but chose to\naccumulate it over a period of years rather than donate annually.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Person or couple who acquired a lot of wealth through\ncryptocurrency, stock options, or cashing out on a business owned.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Family foundations of various sorts.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At this level, a bunch of new considerations start popping up.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Split over time, and use initial grantmaking to \"learn\"</strong>: Rather\nthan donating the entire amount upfront, split over time, and use\ninitial grantmaking to learn more about the space.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Build relationships with donees and understand their expectations\nof renewed funding</strong>: When you make grants to donees, talk to them\nabout whether they would need followup grants; communicate clearly\nwith donees if you don't expect to make followup grants. Use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_grant\">exit\ngrants</a> when stopping\nsupport to donees.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Consider quitting your job or hiring somebody part-time /\nfull-time to manage the ongoing grantmaking work</strong>: This is\nparticularly relevant if you're <em>not</em> deferring your donation choice\nto a known reallocator.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Level 6 (eight-digit or more)</h3>\n<p>Lower limit for level 6: $5,000,000 to $10,000,000</p>\n<p>Upper limit for level 6: no limit!</p>\n<p>Why not split this level further? Couple of reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm hitting the limits of my intuition and experience at this level.</li>\n<li>I think constraints imposed by money are low at this level, so the\nway the donor donates is based a lot more on how the donor wants to\napproach the act of donation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Prototypical donors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>At this point, we're talking big foundations (or influencers of\nsuch). Examples in the EA penumbra include Good Ventures / Open\nPhilanthropy, Jaan Tallinn / Survival and Flourishing Fund, and FTX\nFoundation / FTX Future Fund.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Outside the EA community, we're talking of foundations such as Ford\nFoundation, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust,\nMacArthur Foundation, Hewlett Foundation, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A bunch of new considerations start emerging here.</p>\n<p>You become an entity to be feared in the space. Even people whom you\naren't donating to are now stakeholders in the way your money is\naffecting the ecosystem. At this point, it starts becoming important\nto communicate your philosophy and engage with relevant\ncommunities. You get in the hot seat to some extent and start having\nto justify that you aren't distorting the space.</p>\n<p>This is also the level at which you can actually hire a staff\nfull-time to manage the grantmaking operations, if you so choose. Or\nyou can significantly grow the budget of a reallocator which might\nallow that reallocator to invest more resources in staff (you may want\nto explicitly fund the reallocator's operating expenses and\ncapacity-building work rather than earmark your funds to use for\nendpoint donees).</p>\n<h2>Leveling up</h2>\n<p>If you happen to believe that the most scalable interventions are also\nthe most high-value, and that these have already been figured out,\nleveling up doesn't matter that much <em>per se</em> -- your giving won't\nchange qualitatively. For instance, if you think that GiveDirectly is\nthe best use of the next trillion dollars of your money, it doesn't\nmatter too much what level you are at -- you'll keep donating to\nGiveDirectly.</p>\n<p>However, if you think the most high-value interventions are either not\nthat scalable or are still in the process of being figured out or\ndon't exist yet, leveling up changes the qualitative picture in terms\nof what you can accomplish with your money.</p>\n<p>Since the different levels I've identified are separated by factors of\n~10, leveling up is not easy. Let's talk about the three ways of\nleveling up:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increasing your rate of allocating money for donation\n<ul>\n<li>Increasing your income</li>\n<li>Reducing your expenses</li>\n<li>Increasing the proportion of your savings that you allocate for donation</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Accumulating over time</li>\n<li>Pooling with like-minded people</li>\n<li>Donor lotteries</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Increasing your income</h3>\n<p>This is probably the most high-upside way of leveling up. For\ninstance, Sam Bankman-Fried seriously leveled up when he got into the\ncrypto space and started making tens of millions.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting, though, that increasing income while staying within\nthe same kind of job won't usually lead to a leveling up. For\ninstance, getting a 10% raise a the job, or taking a competing job\noffer that pays 30% more, won't get you to level up. If you are\ninterested in seriously leveling up, you need to find some really\nhigh-upside opportunities (and most of these are also high-risk, so\nyou need to see asymmetric benefits in leveling up to be really\nexcited about these opportunities).</p>\n<p>Realistically, I'd say that outside of stumbling upon a successful\nstartup or rising in the ranks in finance, you can probably go up to\nlevel 3 (upper limit of $100,000) and maybe up to level 4 (upper limit\nof $1 million), but not further.</p>\n<h3>Reducing your expenses</h3>\n<p>This is even less effective than increasing your income, because the\neffect of reducing your expenses is bounded; you can donate at most\n100% of your income! Moreover, once your income crosses a certain\nthreshold, the effect of reducing expenses is even smaller.</p>\n<p>The cases where reducing your expenses really allows you to level up\nare probably the cases where you're at level 1 (retail donor) and with\nslight reduction of expenses you can get to level 2 (up to $10,000). It\nseems unlikely that a move from level 2 to level 3 could be facilitated\nprimarily by reducing expenses.</p>\n<h3>Increasing the proportion of your savings that you allocate for donation</h3>\n<p>As with reducing your expenses, the upside here is limited: you can\nallocate at most 100% of your savings to donation (there's some\npre-tax/post-tax nuance but the basic point stands). How much upside\nyou have here depends on how much of your saving you're currently\nallocating for donation. My rough sense is that this can likely get\nyou up from level 1 to level 2, and in some cases up from level 2 to level\n3, but rarely further. But if you're already a billionaire and just\nhaven't thought about donation much, then you have more room to grow.</p>\n<h3>Accumulating over time</h3>\n<p>Instead of donating money every year, you could accumulate the money so\nit grows more. You could also reinvest it and have it grow even faster\n(something something miracle of compound interest).</p>\n<p>However, given that the levels are separated by a factor of ten, we're\ntalking about accumulating over 5-10 years in order to level up one\nlevel, and 25-100 years in order to level up two levels (even\naccounting for compound interest). While this might be worthwhile in\nsome cases, it also needs to be balanced against haste considerations\nand the urgency of various issues. All in all this does not seem like\nan efficient way to level up, but it could be helpful in <em>combination</em>\nwith other things (such as increasing your income).</p>\n<h3>Pooling with like-minded people</h3>\n<p>The simplest example of pooling is within a marriage: you and your\nspouse share similar values, and also share many of the rest of your\nfinancial decisions, so it makes sense to pool together your\ndonations. If your earnings are in the same ballpark, you level up by\na factor of 2.</p>\n<p>You may also pool with other like-minded people you work with; for\ninstance, Sam Bankman-Fried and many of the people he worked with at\nFTX and Alameda pooled together their resources to fund various\nFTX-related philanthropy.</p>\n<p>You can also pool with other like-minded people you are not in a\npersonal or work relationship with.</p>\n<p>Pooling can deliver a multiplier big enough to level up, if the pool\nis big enough! For instance, if you find 9 other like-minded people\nwith similar amounts of money, you can pool and go up one level.</p>\n<p>You could also pool with others who have way more to donate than you\ndo. One example would be to marry somebody of wealth; another example\nwould be to become friends with and seek to influence such a person.</p>\n<h3>Donor lotteries</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://donations.vipulnaik.com/donee.php?donee=Donor+lottery\">Donor\nlotteries</a>\nare another way to level up. Donor lotteries is a bit like pooling\nwith like-minded people, with one key difference: there can be a case\nfor donor lotteries even if the other people <em>aren't</em> like-minded!\n<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/eSoqa8DEhTqyYEfsM/claim-explainer-donor-lotteries-and-returns-to-scale\">This\nexplainer</a>\ngoes over this in more detail.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This post is an attempt to articulate systematically the qualitative\nchanges as one goes up in levels of donation, inspired by past\ndiscussions of levels of wealth. The post is both descriptive\n(especially within the effective altruist penumbra) and prescriptive\nfor the broader world of donation (in the sense that it describes what\nshould happen but doesn't always happen in that broader world). One\nkey crux around the extent to which one believes levels matter, is the\nextent to which you believe that the most scalable, shovel-ready\ninterventions are also the most high-value; if you believes that, then\nleveling up has limited qualitative impact. On the other hand, if you\nbelieve that there is a lot of high-value untapped potential that is\nnot currently scalable or shovel-ready, <em>and</em> that you would be able\nto identify at least some of this potential (directly or by\ndelegating), then leveling up delivers super-linear expected returns.</p>\n<h2>See also</h2>\n<p>If you enjoyed this post, you might also like my previous post <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4R5f4ntM6t3GLoLTw/donor-strategies-for-separating-how-much-from-where-to\">Donor\nstrategies for separating \"how much\" from \"where\" to\ndonate</a>.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "vipulnaik"}}, {"_id": "XmKhYQfnfqb3Z7Dkr", "title": "Aligning AI with Humans by Leveraging Legal Informatics", "postedAt": "2022-09-18T07:43:10.366Z", "htmlBody": "<p>A summer 2022 survey of hundreds of AI researchers estimated an aggregate forecast time of 37 years for a 50% chance of high\u2013level machine intelligence (\u201cwhen unaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers\u201d).<a><sup><u>[1]</u></sup></a> Natural language processing (NLP) is a key domain of AI, so surveys of these researchers are of particular interest. A separate summer 2022 survey of hundreds of NLP researchers found that 73% \u201cagree that labor automation from AI could plausibly lead to revolutionary societal change in this century, on at least the scale of the Industrial Revolution.\u201d<a><sup><u>[2]</u></sup></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We already face significant challenges communicating our goals and values in a way that reliably directs AI behavior \u2013 even without additional technological advancements, which could compound the difficulty with more autonomous systems. Specifying the desirability (<i>value</i>) of an AI system taking a particular <i>action</i> in a particular <i>state</i> of the world is unwieldy beyond a very limited set of <i>value-action-states</i>. In fact, the purpose of machine learning is to train on a subset of world states and have the resulting agent generalize an ability to choose high value actions in new circumstances. But the program ascribing value to actions chosen during training is an inevitably incomplete encapsulation of the breadth and depth of human judgements, and the training process is a sparse exploration of states pertinent to all possible futures. Therefore, after training, AI is deployed with a coarse map of human preferred territory and will often choose actions unaligned with our preferred paths.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Law is a computational engine that converts human values into legible directives. </strong><i><strong>Law Informs Code</strong></i><strong> is the research agenda attempting to model that complex process, and embed it in AI.&nbsp;</strong>As an expression of <i>how</i> humans communicate their goals, and <i>what</i> society values, <i>Law Informs Code</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4218031\"><i><u>Law Informs Code: A Legal Informatics Approach to Aligning Artificial Intelligence with Humans</u></i></a><i>,&nbsp;</i>an article forthcoming in the<i>&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://jtip.law.northwestern.edu/about/about/\"><i><u>Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property</u></i></a><i>,&nbsp;</i>dives deeper into related work and <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/projects/a-legal-informatics-approach-to-aligning-artificial-intelligence-with-humans/\"><u>this upcoming research agenda</u></a><i> </i>being pursued at <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/codex-the-stanford-center-for-legal-informatics/\">The Stanford Center for Legal Informatics</a> (a center operated by Stanford Law School and the Stanford Computer Science Department).</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Similar to how parties to a legal contract cannot foresee every potential \u201cif-then\u201d contingency of their future relationship, and legislators cannot predict all the circumstances under which their proposed legislation will be applied, we cannot specify \u201cif-then\u201d rules that provably lead to good AI behavior. Fortunately, legal theory and practice have developed arrays of tools for goal specification and value alignment.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Take, for example, the distinction between legal rules and standards. Rules (e.g., \u201cdo not drive more than 60 miles per hour\u201d) are more targeted directives than standards. They enable the rule-maker to have clarity over outcomes that will be realized in the states they specify. If rules are not written with enough potential states of the world in mind, they can lead to unanticipated undesirable outcomes (e.g., a driver following the rule above is too slow to bring their passenger to the hospital in time to save their life), but to enumerate all the potential scenarios is excessively costly outside of simple environments. Legal standards evolved to allow parties to contracts, judges, regulators, and citizens to develop shared understandings and adapt them to novel situations (i.e., to estimate value expectations about actions in unspecified states of the world). For the <i>Law Informs Code</i> use-case, standards do not require adjudication for implementation and resolution of meaning like they do for their legal creation. The law\u2019s lengthy process of iteratively defining standards through judicial opinion and regulatory guidance can be the AI\u2019s starting point, via machine learning on the application of the standards.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Toward that end, we are embarking on the project of engineering legal data into training signals to help AI learn standards, e.g., fiduciary duties. The practices of making, interpreting, and enforcing law have been battle tested through millions of legal contracts and actions that have been memorialized in digital format, providing large data sets of training examples and explanations, and millions of well-trained active lawyers from which to elicit machine learning model feedback to embed an evolving comprehension of law. For instance, court opinions on violations of investment adviser\u2019s fiduciary obligations represent (machine) learning opportunities for curriculum on the fiduciary standard and its duties of care and loyalty.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other data sources suggested for use toward AI alignment \u2013 surveys of human preferences, humans contracted for labeling data, or (most commonly) the implicit beliefs of the AI system designers \u2013 lack an authoritative source of synthesized &nbsp;preference aggregations. In contrast, legal rules, standards, policies, and reasoning approaches are not academic philosophical guidelines or <i>ad hoc</i> online survey results. They are legal standards with a verifiable resolution: ultimately obtained from a court opinion; but short of that, elicited from legal experts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Building integrated legal informatics-AI systems that learn the theoretical constructs and practices of law, <i>the language of alignment</i>, such as contract drafting and interpretation, should help us more robustly specify inherently vague human goals for AI, increasing <i><strong>human-AI </strong></i><strong>alignment</strong>. This may even improve general AI capabilities (or at least not cause net negative overall change), which, arguably, could be positive for AI safety because techniques that increase AI alignment at the expense of AI capabilities can lead to organizations eschewing alignment to gain additional capabilities as organizations race forward developing powerful AI.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Toward <i><strong>society-AI</strong></i><strong> alignment</strong>, we are developing a framework for understanding law as <i>the applied philosophy of multi-agent alignment</i>, which harnesses public policy as an up-to-date knowledge base of democratically endorsed values. Although law is partly a reflection of historically contingent political power \u2013 and thus not a perfect aggregation of citizen preferences \u2013 if properly parsed, its distillation offers a legitimate computational comprehension of societal&nbsp;beliefs.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>If others find this research agenda potentially interesting, please reach out to <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/projects/a-legal-informatics-approach-to-aligning-artificial-intelligence-with-humans/\">this project</a> to explore how we could collaborate.</p></blockquote><hr><p><a><sup><u>[1]</u></sup></a> <i>2022 Expert Survey on Progress in AI&nbsp;</i>(August 23, 2022)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/\"><u>https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/</u></a>.</p><p><a><sup><u>[2]</u></sup></a> Julian Michael et al., <i>What Do NLP Researchers Believe?

processing for a while now and discussing mostly with philosophy folks.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite working in philosophy of science for many years now, I've found that (my) epistemological insights are quite rare, if any. Most recently, the question I've been thinking about and asking everyone I meet over and over is how do you speed up scientific research? The most apt answer seems to be the most trivial one: do more empirical work; construct more models; test your models.&nbsp;</p><p>Epistemology is hard. Not only does it require a deep understanding of how the practice of science happens, but it also looks like epistemological insights don't come often and the ones that do, aren't exactly groundbreakingly helpful. Why is that? I'd tentatively argue that it's because of the limited nature of our cognition and the need to have a lot of history of science, i.e., that we need many examples to confidently infer a pattern. At the same time, it seems that what belongs purely to the cognition aspect of the discussion, is entangled with a variety of social factors which make phenomena such as scientific discoveries difficult to interpret solely as products of cognitive excellence. And so, it becomes very difficult to make bold claims like the students of Nobel prize laureates tend to be Nobel prize laureates themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>My current epistemological insight (that is not going to help anybody as far as I understand) is that while alignment might look like it presupposes a \"weird epistemology\" of <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/LLEJJoaYpCoS5JYSY/p/FQqcejhNWGG8vHDch\">solving a problem before it even makes its appearance</a>, it is probably not as peculiar a case as we consider it to be with our present intellectual tools, where \"we\"= all of us working in AI safety, broadly speaking.&nbsp;</p><p>When you're inside a problem, you tend to have a first-person perspective of it which makes you think that this must be a unique situation. The analogy applies to the feeling of uniqueness we all experience when it comes to the idea of the \"self\" and our personal identity. But just like this feeling is challenged once other people share their experiences with us, the uniqueness of alignment might be challenged when juxtaposed with the episodes from the history of science.</p><p>The claim I often defend is that AI safety is at present a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DCtqgsywCRakLvHn6/alignment-s-phlogiston\">pre-paradigmatic</a> field. I'm willing to support that from my current point of view and with the poor epistemological tools that I can employ. The tension I observe, however, is between the perspective of the outsider and the one of the alignment researcher. The former is able to take some distance from the importance of solving alignment and treat it as yet another scientific agenda that is in no epistemological sense different from the agenda of a group of researchers working in a niche sub-area of physics.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, before anyone finds a bunch of objections here, this doesn't suggest that solving the main problem of AI safety, i.e., alignment is qualitatively comparable to a random technical problem in another scientific field. At least not for the future of humanity. But generally, science deals with a lot of uncertainty that in the case of AI safety finds a pique: not even being able to empirically observe the technology all your problem-solving is about.&nbsp;</p><p>I used to be very confident about this claim. But the more I think about it, the more I come to find the reminder that science is way more purely conceptual than we assume it to be necessary. That, in the majority of scientific practice in its history, <i>theory comes first</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>When theory doesn't come first, we don't have science, we have engineering. So here's the division I'm diagnosing: the efforts to just have AGI as fast as possible, are a matter of engineering while the efforts to have <i>safe</i> AGI with all that this entails are a matter of science. Their entanglement is obvious; we won't get safe AGI without the engineering work. This seems to create part of the epistemological trouble I have when thinking about speeding up research.&nbsp;</p><p>This is probably not a very useful insight, if it deserves to be called an insight at all. I've been trying to come up with ways to make philosophy of science and epistemology useful for solving the alignment problem. The more I reflect on it though, the more I notice that what I'm requesting is essentially a shortcut. I've developed an expectation for history in its making to make as much sense as history of the past is calmly studied from the standpoint of the present. Scientific discoveries, however, tend to appear conveniently obvious when they've become available already.&nbsp;</p><p>If epistemology can't substantially help us right now it is because there are no shortcuts to empirical work, at least with our at the moment available human cognition and levels of intelligence. While this might be frustrating, it does inform us about the nature and limits of philosophical examination as well as the nature of scientific problems. It is an invitation to update to the demands of empirical inquiry and prepare for the journey accordingly, knowing that there is no royal road to alignment. &nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "eangelou"}}, {"_id": "LdS8DuExNdAxuckrn", "title": "Political Science Quantitative Methods and EA ", "postedAt": "2022-09-16T23:28:18.757Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Typically, there are five major subfields within political science (as practiced in the US):</p><p>1) American Politics</p><p>2) Comparative Politics</p><p>3) International Relations</p><p>4) Political Theory</p><p>5) Quantitative Methods</p><p>Within quantitative methods, there are two major subdivisions:</p><ol><li>Statistical Methods</li><li>Formal Modeling</li></ol><p>Statistical Methods: This primarily covers applications of probability, statistics, survey research, machine learning, and causal inference to political science.

My only minor suggestion is that there be more graduate student training on the theoretical underpinnings of probability, statistics, machine learning, and causal inference. There is a lot of excellent training for political science graduate students on a) what is in the current probability/statistics/survey-research/machine-learning/causal-inference toolbox, and b) knowing when and how to deploy different tools in the toolbox. This application training is the more important for political science than theoretical training, because political scientists are not typically expected to develop new tools for the toolbox. However, it would be desirable if graduate students were given more training in theoretical foundations, because as the tools in the toolbox change, that theoretical training would allow political scientists to adapt over the decades of their career.

DeepMind can crush any human world champion in these games, not because DeepMind knows optimal play, but because it uses approximation algorithms to improve its play. The vast majority of social games in politics are much more complex than chess or go, so clearly, even agents seeking to maximize expected utility will use approximation algorithms in real world politics. To improve the predictive power of our models of real world politics, getting a better sense of what approximation algorithms are used and the probabilities that they use them in particular cases will significantly improve the predictive capacities of our models. This will entail the greater use of algorithmic game theory in political science formal modelling.</li></ul></li><li>Redistricting Processes<ul><li>In the United States, where governmental districts tend to be constructed by the political party in control of the state government, we have seen the rise of districts that reduce competition and the rise of extremists candidates that don't represent the central tendency of their population of voters. (Note, the central tendency is different from the ideological center. For example, the central tendency of Wyoming voters in 2022 is almost certainly conservative Republican). <a href=\"https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN11618\">Laws and conventions usually dictate that district boundary construction must not needlessly ignore: population equality, racial and language minority protections, compactness and contiguity, political subdivisions and communities of interest, maintenance of existing districts, and other considerations</a>. &nbsp;This is essentially a fair division problem. It would be interesting if well designed standard (relatively objective) procedures were made that make construction of political boundaries less subject to the partisan whims of state legislators. The development of a standard quiver of political boundary construction procedures, would be akin to the quiver of standard election methods (e.g., plurality voting, plurality with top two runoff, ranked choice, approval voting) we currently have, which makes election methods selection much less susceptible to whims than district boundary construction. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Rethinking Mechanism Design for Social Sciences<ul><li>Roughly speaking, given that agents have the capacity to misrepresent their beliefs or to act strategically, mechanism design is the development of mechanisms to produce desirable goals. For example, Vickrey auctions are a mechanism used to prevent overbidding caused by strategic bidding. Mechanism design in the social sciences has drawn a lot from cryptography. In cryptography, there is great importance on making it as computationally intractable as possible to break the code. In a similar vein, there has been great emphasis in social science mechanism design to make it as computationally intractable as possible to figure out optimal strategy. For example, it is claimed that some group decision making algorithms are superior to others because they are computationally intractable for a player to figure out optimal strategy. But the goals of cryptography and social processes can be different. For example, in cryptography, the game is typically zero-sum in the sense that you either break the code or don't break the code. In social games, like group decision making, the goal is not to have optimal strategy, but to have a good enough strategy to beat all your opponents. First a CS example, and then a political one. Consider a mediocre chess player like myself teaming with DeepMind resources to play the human world chess champion unaided, Magnus Carlsen. I would absolutely crush Carlsen, because even though DeepMind resources don't know optimal chess play, they know enough to beat any unaided human player. Similarly in elections, some election method may be computationally intractable for determination of optimal play, but perhaps a coalition of voters aided by Cambridge Analytica resources could be good enough to crush competing coalitions that are at a comparative computational resource disadvantage. The point is, we need new formal metrics for the goals we might have. Saying that such and such a group decision making mechanism is factorial time complex to find optimal strategy in worst case scenario (i.e., a more formal way of saying optimal strategy is computationally intractable) doesn't make a mechanism any better than an other. We need other kind of metrics, useful for social sciences, like a formal version of \"it is easy for all players to find optimal strategy regardless of computational resource equality\" (which would be a way of saying a well trained chicken and DeepMind are on even ground competing in tic-tac-toe), or formal criteria for \"any-given-level-of-optimality-of-play complexity is practically resource invariant\".</li></ul></li></ul><p>Those are just some comments on quantitative methods in political science and EA. &nbsp;I look forward to your comments.

There, I argued that AI safety researchers need to explicitly consider religious values when they think about value alignment. I realized that I should have included an argument about why alignment research should consider distinctive types of human values (e.g. religious values), rather than treating all values as homogenous elements that can be incorporated into some master utility function. This post develops a preliminary argument about the importance of considering many distinct types of human values; it should probably be read before the religion post.</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>I worry that a lot of AI alignment research seems to rely on a dangerously simplistic view of human values, and that this will undermine our ability to safely align AI systems with human values.</p><p>The simplistic view seems to arise from taking expected utility theory too seriously as a model of human values and preferences. It\u2019s true that we can often describe human decisions, post hoc, at a rather abstract and generic level, using the language of utility theory, Bayesian rationality, and statistical decision theory. This rather abstract and generic way of modeling human values has often been useful in the fields of economics, game theory, rational choice, consequentialist moral philosophy, and reinforcement learning theory.&nbsp;</p><p>However, within standard utility theory, there\u2019s no fundamental difference between a consumer\u2019s food preference for a certain flavor of jelly bean and a Muslim\u2019s sacred taboo against eating pork. Utility theory doesn\u2019t distinguish very well between someone who\u2019s a vegan for health reasons, someone who\u2019s a vegan for ethical reasons, and someone who has food allergies to animal proteins. Utility theory doesn\u2019t distinguish very well between someone who\u2019s polyamorous based on libertarian principles, someone who\u2019s polyamorous so they can conform to their Burning Man peer group, and someone who just happened to inherit genes for a high degree of \u2018sociosexuality\u2019. Utility theory can\u2019t even distinguish very well between deontologists, consequentialists, virtue ethicists, and religious fundamentalists.</p><p>With all due respect to utility theory as a normative theory, if we take it as a descriptive account of human psychology, it seems blind to the heterogeneity of human values types. It can\u2019t model the complex architecture of human values. It can\u2019t model the differences between values that are implemented in different psychological mechanisms such as reflexes, emotions, motivations, cognitive biases, learning biases, conscious preferences, implicit preferences, virtue signals, social norms, political attitudes, sacred values, and taboos. It can\u2019t understand that specific human values fit into categories of value types that have different implications for learning, generalization, inference, and decision-making.</p><p>If these differences in types of values matter, at all, in any way, then AI alignment might need a richer model of human values than standard utility theory can offer. Or it might not. We can\u2019t really tell until we think seriously about the heterogeneity of human value types \u2013 the whole range of different types of preferences, emotions, motivations, norms, and goals that we might want AI systems to become aligned with. (Note that I\u2019m not talking about heterogeneity of values across individuals, groups, cultures, or historical eras; I\u2019m talking about heterogeneity of different types of values within each human individual \u2013 e.g. the difference between a food preference, a religious taboo, and a sexual kink.)</p><p>To get a sense of that range of human value types, it might be helpful to start by considering the range of academic disciplines that study different kinds of human values.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How many kinds of human values are there?</strong></p><p>Ever since Herbert Spencer published <i>The principles of psychology</i> in 1855, psychologists have studied human values, preferences, emotions, and motivations. We\u2019ve had more than 160 years of research on these topics, with especially fruitful eras around 1870-1920 (after Darwin, before Behaviorism), and 1970 to now (after Behaviorism gave way to richer new fields like cognitive science, emotion research, and evolutionary psychology).&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, at least 30 subfields of psychology study different types of values, in different domains, that vary across individuals, groups, and contexts in different ways:</p><ul><li>Affective neuropsychology studies the neural basis of values, emotions, and motivations</li><li>Applied behavior analysis studies how values guide learning and reinforce behavior</li><li>Behavior genetics studies the heritability of values, emotions, and motivations</li><li>Clinical psychology studies differences in values and emotions across mental disorders</li><li>Comparative psychology studies differences in values and motivations across species</li><li>Consumer psychology studies consumer preferences</li><li>Cross-cultural psychology studies differences in values across cultures</li><li>Developmental psychology studies changes in values across the life span</li><li>Economic psychology studies economic values and motivations</li><li>Educational psychology studies educational values and learning motivations</li><li>Evolutionary psychology studies evolved values, emotions, and motivations</li><li>Forensic psychology studies behaviors that violates legal values</li><li>Food psychology studies food preferences&nbsp;</li><li>Health psychology studies health values&nbsp;</li><li>Human factors studies values that are important in human/machine interaction</li><li>Industrial/organizational psychology studies work and career preferences</li><li>Judgment and decision-making research studies rationality values</li><li>Media psychology studies how mass media and social media influence values</li><li>Moral psychology studies moral values</li><li>Personality psychology studies differences in values across personality traits</li><li>Psycholinguistics studies communication values and norms</li><li>Social psychology studies social values, emotions, and motivations</li><li>Sex research studies sexual preferences, motivations, and kinks</li><li>Sports psychology studies athletic values and competitive motivations</li><li>Physiological psychology studies the neural and hormonal basis of values and emotions</li><li>Political psychology studies political values</li><li>Positive psychology studies general well-being and flourishing</li><li>Psychology of art studies aesthetic values and creative motivations</li><li>Psychology of religion studies sacred religious values and spiritual motivations</li><li>Psychopharmacology studies how drugs influence values, emotions, and motivations</li></ul><p>Each of these fields includes thousands of researchers, tens of thousands of journal papers, hundreds of academic books, and dozens of textbooks. Each is taught in thousands of psychology courses around the world. And each discovers new things about distinctive types of values.</p><p>Beyond psychology, many other academic fields study human values, preferences, and motivations. These include social sciences such as anthropology, economics, political sciences, and sociology. They include humanities such as philosophy, history, literature, art history, and ethnic studies. They include professional schools such as law schools, medical schools, business schools, and religious schools. Each of these also includes thousands of researchers, classes, and books. In fact, very few academic fields have nothing to say about human values, and nothing to contribute to our understanding of human values.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do AI alignment researchers really need to learn about the heterogeneity of human value types?</strong></p><p>If you\u2019re an AI safety researcher, you might be thinking, dude, do you really expect us to master 30 subfields of psychology and dozens of other academic disciplines just to make sure that our AI systems can align with this alleged variety of human value types? Is this just a stratagem for enforcing a Long Reflection, a grand detour through the social sciences and humanities, that would delay AI research by a couple of centuries?</p><p>You might also be thinking, sure, academic fields often split into more specialized subfields so people can publish stuff and teach new courses to get tenure. There are academic incentives to hype the distinctiveness of one\u2019s field, and to make it seem relevant to students and funders by emphasizing its relevance to understanding human values and concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>Why should we take all this value-scholarship and value-science seriously in AI alignment concerning human values? Why do we need anything beyond the two standard theoretical foundations of Effective Altruism -- normative consequentialist moral philosophy and expected utility theory -- to descriptively understand the variety of human values?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Couldn\u2019t AI systems just extract heterogenous value types from human behavioral data?</strong></p><p>Let me steel-man the case against AI alignment research needing to pay any attention to previous research on human values. Maybe a sufficiently powerful algorithm can reinvent everything that academics have learned about human value types over the last few centuries.</p><p>Imagine AI engineers develop a \u2018deep value learning\u2019 algorithm. You can feed it a firehose of data about human preferences and behaviors. You feed the system every book ever written in any language. Every EA blog. Every 80,000 Hours podcast.&nbsp;Every movie. Every YouTube video. Every PornHub video. Every surveillance video. Every social media post. Every Google query. Every consumer purchase. Every election vote. Every political speech and religious sermon ever recorded.&nbsp;</p><p>Call this the \u2018digital value corpus\u2019. It includes a few thousand exabytes of data. It will serve as the input data for value learning.&nbsp;</p><p>The algorithm does some kind of colossally powerful unsupervised learning that can statistically extract the complex architecture of human values given this value corpus. Maybe it doesn\u2019t need any supervised learning or reinforcement learning. Maybe the heterogeneity of human value types is all there, latent in the data, ready to be extracted, modelled, and used for alignment.&nbsp;</p><p>I suspect that, if human values have causal effects on human behavior, communication, and interaction, then any sufficiently large and rich \u2018digital value corpus\u2019 of human behavior, communication, and interaction will include enough latent patterning that a superintelligent AI could \u2013 in principle \u2013 extract and model the full architecture and heterogeneity of our human values. (This would be functionally equivalent to superintelligent aliens inferred the entire value architecture of humanity just be observing everything that happens on our planet \u2013 including all visible behavior and all electronic traffic.)</p><p>Maybe the AI can reinvent every insight into human values that has ever emerged from scholars and scientists over the last few millennia. So, maybe we can ignore all of their work. After all, the scholars and scientists were just observing and abstracting about human values given the tiny slices of human behavioral data that they could access (including their fallible introspections), given their cultural biases, ideologies, and top-down models. Why would we trust their human insights more than an AI\u2019s statistical model abstracted from a much larger and more comprehensive value corpus? When modelling the heterogeneity of human values, couldn\u2019t an AI out-perform human scientists, in the same way that AlphaGo, fed with a huge historical corpus of previously played go games, could outperform human go masters?</p><p>One problem is, how would we know whether the AI had modelled human values accurately?&nbsp; Could the AI explain our value categories and value architecture to us in a way that we would understand? Would its models of our values be intelligible and interpretable? Could it really fold those values into its own decision-making systems in a way that we could trust? Or would we need to give it a lot more feedback through supervision or reinforcement learning, and a lot more tests to make sure its value architecture was both well-modelled and well-aligned with ours?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why would heterogenous human value types matter to an AI?</strong></p><p>To think more clearly about whether we need to pay attention to the heterogeneity of human value types in AI alignment, we could ask, what computational difference would value type heterogeneity really make to the AI system? Why put specific values into categories that correspond to our human value types?</p><p>Maybe the AI just needs to know how much importance or weight we attach to each value or preference, and that\u2019s all it needs to make decisions aligned with our preferences, using standard expected utility calculations. Apart from the decision weight attached to the value, why would it matter what <i>type</i> of value it is \u2013 e.g. whether the value is a food preference, a religious taboo, a sexual kink, an aesthetic taste, or a career aspiration?</p><p>One simple thought experiment is to imagine a working mother trying to teach a new domestic AI system her values and preferences. She makes verbal statements about things she likes and doesn\u2019t like, and the AI listens and learns. She likes chocolate croissants, she likes cobalt blue silk dresses, she likes for her baby to be safe, she likes promotions at work, she likes shibari ropes, she likes criminal justice reform, and she likes going to Mass on Sundays. Now, would it add any useful information if she said \u2013 or if the AI inferred \u2013 that these \u2018likes\u2019 represent different types of values \u2013 specifically, a food preference, a fashion preference, a parental safety preference, a career ambition, a sexual kink, a political value, and a religious value?</p><p>In other words, would knowing that a specific human preference falls into a particular value type help an AI do more effective learning, generalization, inference, and decision-making? Well, 60 years of cognitive psychology research suggest that <i>doing better learning, generalization, inference, and decision-making is the entire point of putting things into mental categories</i>. Categorization helps computation. Therefore, good categorization of value types should help AI alignment. That\u2019s the general argument for why AI systems should pay attention to value types, and why AI alignment researchers should too.</p><p>But that\u2019s pretty vague. Are there any more specific arguments for why AI systems would work better if they understood different value types? Here are a few specific ways that value types differ from each other in ways that AI systems might find computationally relevant.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Computationally relevant differences across value types</strong></p><p>Tradeoffs. People tend to treat some value types (e.g. religious commandments, wedding vows) as ironclad deontological imperatives that are not open to cost/benefit reasoning or tradeoffs, whereas they treat other value types (e.g. Netflix movie choices, hotel preferences) as relatively trivial, transient, and superficial, and fully subject to tradeoffs against other values. If an AI understands the typical degrees of tradeoff flexibility within each value type, it\u2019s likely to be more aligned with human values.</p><p>Correlations across value types. Some value types allow stronger inference about other values in other categories. For example, many traditional religions have surprisingly strong food taboos that create bridges between religious values and food preferences \u2013 so if the AI knows that someone is an Orthodox Jew or a devout Muslim, it can make inferences about their likely food preferences, but not necessarily about their movie preferences. On the other hand, visual aesthetic preferences (e.g. for Art Nouveau architecture) may not correlate very much with musical preferences (e.g. for Nordic folk metal). &nbsp;AI systems that understand the architecture of correlations across value types might make more accurately calibrated inferences across specific values.&nbsp;</p><p>Virtue signaling. Some value types tend to involve a high degree of authenticity \u2013 a high correlation between stated and revealed preferences, and a low degree of deception, hypocrisy, or virtue signaling. We don\u2019t tend to virtue signal very much about travel logistics, such as whether we prefer a window or an aisle seat on flights, or whether we prefer an ocean or a garden view in hotels. Other value types tend to involve a lot more public signaling of socially rewarded values, but a lot more private hypocrisy. Political and religious virtue-signaling is famously important to humans. AI systems might make better predictions about our values and preferences if they understand the typical degrees, types, and channels of virtue signaling involved in each value type. They might also understand which of our hypocrisies can be quietly noted, but should not be mentioned out loud \u2013 lest we feel embarrassed, angry, and outraged at the AI.</p><p>Heritability. All values studied so far in behavioral genetics show some degree of heritability. Genetic differences between people within a culture account for some of the phenotypic differences in their values within that culture. Siblings tend to be more similar in their values than cousins do, for partly genetic reasons. But different value types tend to have different heritabilities. If an AI understands this, it can make better generalizations and inferences across relatives about their likely values. If the AI also has access to genomic data for the people it\u2019s interacting with, it could use polygenic scores to infer some of their value types more easily than other value types.</p><p>Cultural transmission pattern. Many values are culturally transmitted \u2013 \u2018vertically\u2019 across generations, and/or \u2018horizontally\u2019 within generations. But different value types tend to be transmitted in different ways that allow different predictions about their commonality across people, families, and subcultures, their likely longevity over time, whether people treat them as moral imperatives or whimsical preferences, etc. Compare the spread of food cuisines, art styles, clothing fashions, mating norms, political ideals, and religious rituals. It might help an AI to understand which value types tend to have which kind of cultural transmission dynamics.</p><p>Lifespan development. Some value types tend to change quickly as humans grow up, go through different life stages, and get older; others tend to be more stable over time. Aversions to some \u2018disgusting\u2019 foods might get locked in by age 10, whereas preferences for certain cuisines might continue to develop throughout middle age. Sexual orientation might become relatively stable by age 20, whereas preferences for specific traits in a mate might change year by year. Religious beliefs might go through a period of instability in adolescence, and then settle down after marriage. It might help an AI to understand which value types are likely to change over each life-stage.</p><p>OK. Those are just six kinds of differences across value types that might be computationally (and ethically) relevant to AI systems. There are probably many other differences that could be explored in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>When testing AI alignment, we want to make sure that an AI system is aligned across all relevant types of human values. If we don\u2019t explicitly list the value types that matter, we might overlook some important categories. And if value types involve different kinds of tradeoffs, correlations with other values, virtue signals, heritabilities, cultural transmission patterns, and lifespan development patterns, then an AI that looks aligned on some value types might not be aligned on other value types that haven\u2019t been tested yet. Just because we can train an AI system to learn and embody our food preferences and movie preferences does not mean that it can learn and embody our sexual, political, or religious preferences. (This was one motivation for me to write my EA Forum <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YwnfPtxHktfowyrMD/the-religion-problem-in-ai-alignment\">post</a> on religious values.) So we have to make sure we explicitly test performance and safety across all the value types. This is an important, practical, methodological issue in AI safety.&nbsp;</p><p>For the moment, I hope that this essay has helped make the case that AI alignment needs to take seriously the rich heterogeneity of human value types, the challenges of modeling our value architecture, and the importance of making sure that AI systems are aligned across all the kinds of values that really matter to us.</p>", "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "2xrTTgvosGSsM85RZ", "title": "Katja Grace on Slowing Down AI, AI Expert Surveys And Estimating AI Risk", "postedAt": "2022-09-16T18:00:49.867Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Katja runs AI Impacts and recently published <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/what-do-ml-researchers-think-about-ai-in-2022/\">What do ML researchers think about AI in 2022</a>, a new survey of AI Experts.

He's noticing that lately, various people have been saying that maybe we should slow down AI progress if AI progress is a threat to the existence of humanity. He outlines some reasons you might not want to slow down AI progress.\"</p></blockquote><h2>Are we actually in an arms race?</h2><blockquote><p>\"<strong>The first question is, are you actually in an arms race?</strong> It seems not obvious to me that the AI situation at present is an arms race or likely to be an arms race. <strong>In the classic arms race scenario, it's not the case that when you win the arms race, you get destroyed.</strong> In the very simplified version of this arms race, it's quite unlike a usual arms race. The usual arms race is a prisoner's dilemma, basically. You always have an incentive to build more arms regardless of what the other player does. That's not true if you get killed in the end. Then you can build more complicated models, and sometimes you should race perhaps depending on the details of it, but often, not.\"</p></blockquote><h1>Surveying AI Experts in 2022</h1><h2>Forecasting High Level Machine Intelligence</h2><blockquote><p>\"<strong>[High Level Machine Intelligence is] when unaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers, ignoring things where it's intrinsically advantageous to be a human, for instance, being on a jury</strong> [...] We gave [AI Capabilities Researchers] three different probabilities, 10%, 50% and 90%, and we asked them in what years that amount of probability would've been reached basically. And then, to a different set of people, we gave them years and we asked them what the probability was that we would have high level machine intelligence by those years. And then, a different set of people again, we asked about not high level machine intelligence but full automation of labor, which is when AI can do all of the occupations. Which, to my mind is quite similar to when will AI be able to do all of the tasks. But it turned out to be much later.\"</p></blockquote><h2>ML Researchers do consider extremely bad outcomes</h2><blockquote><p>\"They were all authors at NeurIPS or ICML. We just wrote to 50% of the authors at those conferences [...] I think in the end [the response rate] was maybe roughly 15%. [...] A lot of people who work on AI capabilities do think there are serious concerns with safety. So I think it's very unclear what different people want here, and probably there are a lot of different views. It seems like, among people working on AI capabilities, I guess in this recent survey I worked on, <strong>a lot of them said they thought there was more than a 10% chance of an extremely bad outcome</strong>.\"</p></blockquote><h2>AI Alignment is increasingly becoming a concern</h2><blockquote><p>[...] We describe something the alignment problem and ask, \"Do you think this is an important problem? Is it a hard problem? Is it a valuable problem to work on at the moment?\" And I think, for all of those answers, the distribution shifted toward it being important and valuable and hard[...] They had five options for how important it is, say. For importance, <strong>the top evaluation of importance went from 5% to 20% of people who thought it was the most important. For the value of working on it today, the top category went from 1% to 8%. And for how hard it is, much harder than other things, it went from 9% to 26%.</strong></p></blockquote><h1>Other considerations to estimate AI risk</h1><h2>Katja\u2019s Main Source of Optimism&nbsp;</h2><blockquote><p>\"I think my main source of optimism is probably that the AI safety community is mistaken about how bad this is. AGI is not going to destroy the world for sort of mundane reasons that other things don't destroy the world. [...] People have different views about how likely doom is. <strong>My probability on 'AI destroys the world', is probably something like 7%. So that's a relatively high probability on some other people around being fairly wrong</strong>.\"</p></blockquote><h2>Cognitive Labor will be unequally distributed to Agents</h2><blockquote><p>\"There are two important things happening with sort of human level-ish AI [...] So previously, throughout history, there's been a sort of allotment of cognitive labor per person, sort of like each person has a brain that they can do a certain amount of thinking with [...] So usually, everyone ends up with some decent fraction of what they started out with and things aren't as wildly unequal as they can be for other things. But <strong>with AI, there's going to be just a fire hose of new cognitive labor and it's sort of unclear where it will go. It probably won't be distributed equally among people</strong> [...] It could be very disruptive for large fractions of it to be going to some particular narrow set of goals or either one person or one company or something like that.</p><p>I think <strong>the other thing that is sort of happening at the same time is that there are new agents in the world.</strong> So far they have most of the creatures around with goals, doing things. Many are humans. There are also animals, but they don't have that much power in the world. With advanced AI, it seems like<strong> we'll basically make something sort of like new alien minds.</strong> [...] It seems like <strong>these two different things will happen at the same time, which means that they'll kind of be combined so that it could be that huge piles of cognitive labor go to these new minds and I think that's where the giant risk is</strong>, which the AI safety people are most worried about.\"</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "mtrazzi"}}, {"_id": "7cq4kKNnHbutmNiyv", "title": "[Linkpost] Founders Pledge: how we use (and sometimes don't use) DALYs", "postedAt": "2022-09-16T17:10:43.939Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This blogpost lays out how we think about and use DALY estimates at Founders Pledge. In short: DALYs (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) are one of the most well-used metrics within global health, and are the only metric that quantifies the burden of diseases across countries with a high level of coverage. However, they also present several limitations for conducting charity evaluation and cause area exploration. In particular, DALYs do not necessarily capture wellbeing impact, and we're a little skeptical of the methods that are used to generate disability weights\u2014which may be vulnerable to cognitive biases, and may limit the universality of DALYs. &nbsp;Overall, our approach involves prioritising direct measures of wellbeing where possible. Beyond that, we aim to account for the limitations of DALYs\u2014without neglecting their use completely\u2014to maximise our ability to identify the most impactful ways to do good in the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "RBettle"}}, {"_id": "B2sxxATzHdaGNc5YK", "title": "Advice I Give to People Who Don't Currently Have an EA Job and are thinking of transitioning", "postedAt": "2022-09-16T16:58:32.975Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Extreme risk here of stating the obvious, but I've now had a few conversations like this so I figure it would be useful to have a place to link it all.</p><p>Previously my template for calls <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CmmtKKD84BYhmmxrD/chanamessinger-s-shortform?commentId=yD3ycivrixe67fBik\">was this</a>, I still do a bunch of those things, especially give a feel of the landscape.</p><ul><li>Current opportunities<ul><li>EA Forum has <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DXcg6N6CGvRA2vrCk/who-s-hiring-may-september-2022\">Who's Hiring</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/swcBj4rBC4HvwmwfD/who-wants-to-be-hired-may-september-2022\">Who Wants to be Hired</a> pinned posts<ul><li>I think these are good for obvious reasons but also just to give a sense of what's out there.

And the way it fails will hurt a lot of people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>because say there\u2019s a religious community. It\u2019s fair of them to want a safe space where atheists won\u2019t come in and say \u2018these beliefs make no sense\u2019 and 'have you looked at double-blind prayer tests?\u2019</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And say there\u2019s a person who was raised in an extremely coercive faith community, and now they\u2019ve decided it\u2019s not true, and they\u2019re in the process of angrily rejecting hateful and damaging things that they internalized as religious teachings. (I know several people like this).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These people both need safe spaces. One needs a safe space to practice their traditions without people interrupting to say 'none of this is true\u2019, and the other one needs a space to say 'none of this is true!\u2019 and 'I can\u2019t believe I agreed with this nonsense!\u2019 and 'wow look at these double-blind prayer tests!\u2019 What\u2019s disruptive for one person is healing and important and necessary to another</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The problem is the internet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>like, to be clear, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s morally obligatory to support anorexics. There are a lot of people who, for their own mental health, cannot have a supportive healthy relationship with someone who has disordered thoughts around their weight/the desire to lose weight dangerously/scary beliefs about their own body and habits/whatever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And if you think that it\u2019s just not going to be healthy for you, it\u2019s okay to say to a friend \u201cI can\u2019t be part of those conversations\u201d and if the conversations are turning out to be unavoidable to say \u201cmaybe we need some distance\u201d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What I think is a problem is when people think it\u2019s \u201csupportive\u201d to be there emotionally for your friend only when they\u2019re saying the right things, only when they\u2019re expressing a desire to beat the eating disorder and get to a healthy weight, only when they\u2019re not experiencing distorted thinking. Because that just creates a dynamic where most of our intimate relationships are founded on not admitting (to ourselves or to other people) that we feel conflicted about recovery, that we\u2019ve found mental workarounds that don\u2019t actually challenge our distorted thoughts but which help make us functional, that we actually don\u2019t think of our eating disorder as a separate beast that lunged at us from outside but as a natural outgrowth of our own preferences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you say \u201cI can only support you when you\u2019re working on recovery\u201d, what you get is people who will learn, automatically, to lie and assure you they\u2019re working on recovery, and who will have to seek out the actual hard emotional support from someone else.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And if you say \u201cI can only support you while you\u2019re working on recovery, because you expressing your distorted thoughts is an evil and malicious act on your part\u201d, then, congrats, you\u2019ve just given someone with an anxiety/self-loathing disorder something new to be anxious and self-loathing about!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It\u2019s always okay to say \u201cI can\u2019t listen to this\u201d.

IFS therapy focuses on enabling these parts to \u201ccommunicate\u201d with each other so that inner conflicts can be resolved and reintegration can take place. For brevity\u2019s sake, we won\u2019t discuss IFS in detail here. We recommend <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st\"><u>this post</u></a>&nbsp;for an in-depth introduction.</p><h3>What is \u2018inner multiplicity\u2019?</h3><p>By \u2018multiple parts\u2019&nbsp;or&nbsp;\u2018inner multiplicity\u2019, we don\u2019t mean to suggest that the human psyche comprises multiple conscious agents\u2014though IFS sometimes comes close to suggesting that. By \u2018parts\u2019, we mean something like clusters of beliefs, emotions and motivations, characterized by a (somewhat) coherent voice or perspective. Many forms of self-criticism, for instance, could be described as a dominant part of oneself berating another part that feels inferior. Different parts can also get activated at different times. Most people behave and feel differently during a job interview than with their closest friends.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg2kdrajncv9\"><sup><a href=\"#fng2kdrajncv9\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>This idea is shared by many theorists of various schools, often using different terminology. Examples include \u2018sub-personalities\u2019 (Rowan, 1990), \u2018social mentalities\u2019 (Gilbert, 2000), and \u2018selves\u2019 (Fadiman &amp; Gruber, 2020).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref770e5332hec\"><sup><a href=\"#fn770e5332hec\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Not only new-agey softies espouse this perspective. The related concept of a modular mind is shared by unsentimental evolutionary psychologists (e.g., Kurzban &amp; Aktipis, <a href=\"https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc590Readings/KurzbanAktipis2007.pdf\"><u>2007</u></a>; Tooby &amp; Cosmides, 1992).</p><p>In any case, this is a complex topic about which much more could be written. For a detailed \u201cgears-level model\u201d of inner multiplicity (and for why working with parts can be helpful), see Kaj Sotala\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip\"><i><u>Multiagent&nbsp;Models of Mind</u></i></a>.</p><h3>IFS is popular and seen as superior to traditional psychotherapy</h3><p>IFS is very popular among EAs and especially rationalists. If you were to only read LessWrong and the EA forum, you might think that there are only two therapy schools: IFS and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).</p><p>IFS has its own LessWrong <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/internal-family-systems\"><u>Wiki entry</u></a>. Searching for \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/search?terms=internal%20family%20systems\"><u>internal family systems</u></a>\u201d on LessWrong yields many more results than any other therapy, besides CBT. IFS is even credited with inspiring influential CFAR techniques like <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/x2KrcscqgKDk6pMeD/internal-double-crux-1\"><u>Internal Double Crux</u></a>. Most of Ewelina\u2019s clients (Ewelina is a psychotherapist mostly working with EAs) know and respect IFS; few have heard of other therapy schools besides CBT, IFS or perhaps traditional psychodynamic approaches. Some EAs even believe that IFS&nbsp;can \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dPAnh8YWmfAFqRQo2/the-internal-family-systems-ifs-therapy-model-sociological\"><u>revolutionize</u></a>\u201d psychotherapy.</p><p>IFS is often regarded as superior to standard psychotherapy, i.e., cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), mainly for two reasons. First, while CBT is viewed as treating <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/unnamedelement/posts/10158360650157805\"><u>the psyche as unitary</u></a>, IFS acknowledges that we have <i>multiple</i> <i>parts</i>. Secondly, IFS treats all parts with empathy and understanding, even if they are irrational or problematic, which ultimately allows them to become integrated. In contrast, CBT is seen&nbsp;as taking the side of rational, analytical parts in order to shut down irrational emotions and thoughts which (if done incorrectly) doesn\u2019t work and might <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/i9xyZBS3qzA8nFXNQ/book-summary-unlocking-the-emotional-brain%23Erasure_sequence\"><u>even backfire</u></a>.</p><h3>Other therapy approaches emphasize inner multiplicity as well</h3><p>Overall, we agree that these two criticisms of (many forms of) CBT are mostly accurate and that IFS can offer advantages in both areas. However, there exist several other psychotherapy schools besides IFS which i) emphasize the importance of working with one\u2019s multiple parts (or: \u201cparts work\u201d) and which ii) treat these parts with empathy and understanding, rather than attempting to shut them down with force.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefapicpyfrxi6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnapicpyfrxi6\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Making these approaches more widely known is the main reason we wrote this post. Finding a good IFS therapist can be difficult, especially in Europe. It\u2019d thus be unfortunate if people limited themselves to IFS practitioners in the mistaken belief that this is the only way of finding therapists who skillfully work with inner multiplicity.</p><p>Another reason for writing this post is that IFS can be off-putting to some: it can give off a new-agey vibe, is somewhat disconnected from academic, evidence-based psychotherapy research, and certain concepts like the \u201cTrue Self\u201d are implausible. As long as working with inner multiplicity and IFS are viewed as one and the same, people who don\u2019t like IFS will inevitably be skeptical of parts work. This is a pity because we believe that such work can be very helpful.</p><p>Generally, people are drawn to the aesthetics of different therapies for a variety of reasons. We hope that at least some readers benefit from the therapy approaches described below. Note that we picked the three approaches we like and studied the most; this is not an exhaustive list of all therapy schools working with inner multiplicity.</p><h2>Compassion-focused therapy</h2><p>Developed by Paul Gilbert,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2gbx02ye1pz\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2gbx02ye1pz\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<i>compassion-focused therapy</i>&nbsp;(CFT) views the human mind through an evolutionary lens, as being formed of multiple, often conflicting, emotional, motivational, and cognitive systems. CFT groups these systems into three different clusters, depending on their primary evolutionary function: i) threat/protection, and ii) drive/seeking/acquisition, both associated with the sympathetic nervous system, and iii) rest/soothing/attachment, associated with the parasympathetic nervous system (Bell et al., 2021).</p><p>One important goal of CFT is to balance these three systems, usually by strengthening the rest/soothing/attachment system. Spending too much time in the threat system (e.g., ruminating, feeling anxious) or the drive system (e.g., working hard), and not enough time in the rest/soothing/attachment system seems to contribute to exhaustion and fatigue (e.g., Maslach et al., 2001, p. 411<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefphi3pz5jzcd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnphi3pz5jzcd\">[5]</a></sup></span>; Russell, <a href=\"https://russell-j.com/beginner/COH-TEXT.HTM\"><u>2015</u></a>, ch. 5).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8t1zkia56qn\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8t1zkia56qn\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Overstimulation of the threat or drive system can also make one feel threatened or rushed, which makes it difficult to feel empathy, think creatively, act rationally or make good judgments.</p><h3>Our evolutionary origins, self-deception, and compassion</h3><p>CFT focuses on developing a thorough understanding of our brain\u2019s evolutionary origins and how they have made us vulnerable to (self-)destructive behaviors, thoughts and emotions. CFT emphasizes that they are <i>not</i>&nbsp;our fault.&nbsp;We didn\u2019t choose to design our minds such that they regularly feel jealousy or envy, for instance. It thus makes little sense to feel shame, guilt and criticize ourselves for parts<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbiy2icdanzu\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbiy2icdanzu\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;of our mind we didn\u2019t create in the first place (Bell et al., 2020; Kolts, 2016). Instead, we want to cultivate (self-)compassion.</p><p>This attitude makes it easier to acknowledge and clearly see our \u201cdark sides\u201d, rather than engage in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DSnamjnW7Ad8vEEKd/trivers-on-self-deception\"><u>self-deception</u></a>&nbsp;and rationalize our actions by invoking purely benevolent motives, even to ourselves.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref30gqfwd34vl\"><sup><a href=\"#fn30gqfwd34vl\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;According to CFT, we have a responsibility to carefully examine our real motives and strengthen our compassionate and prosocial inclinations.</p><h3>CFT in practice</h3><p>CFT utilizes insights and techniques from a wide variety of disciplines and therapy schools. Working with one\u2019s multiple parts plays a central role in CFT.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref46q8ztehlp7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn46q8ztehlp7\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;To this end, chairwork in its numerous forms, described in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/w9hKmNvhEnHo2wcr7/many-therapy-schools-work-with-inner-multiplicity-not-just#Chairwork\"><u>more detail below</u></a>, is used frequently, but whiteboard exercises can be incorporated as well (Bell et al., 2020; 2021).</p><p>CFT expands on \u2018parts work\u2019 by introducing the notion of a \u2018compassionate self\u2019 which is developed and cultivated via various techniques throughout therapy. This \u2018compassionate self\u2019 is \u201cused as a \u2018secure\u2019 base from which to engage with, and integrate, various other parts [...]&nbsp;that can become segregated and disowned\u201d (Bell et al., 2020, p. 2).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefamhw5qda4ao\"><sup><a href=\"#fnamhw5qda4ao\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><p>In addition, CFT employs standard cognitive behavioral techniques, more emotions-focused techniques (e.g., expressive letter writing), as well as \u201cmeditational practices, guided imagery, body-focused exercises, and method-acting techniques\u201d (Bell et al., 2021), to name just a subset.</p><h3>Is CFT the right fit for you?</h3><p>CFT emphasizes the evolutionary origins of our minds more than probably any other psychotherapy school. Consequently, CFT has a less panglossian view of human nature, especially compared to therapy schools emerging from humanistic psychology.&nbsp;(After all, natural selection is all about maximizing inclusive genetic fitness, not benevolence.) Likewise, CFT views many of our unhelpful tendencies and problems as at least <i>partly</i>&nbsp;resulting from our evolutionary past. In contrast, most other therapies see mental health problems as almost exclusively arising from distressing experiences in our lives and (early) development, at least in practice.</p><p>If the above doesn\u2019t sound too dark or otherwise mistaken, and you like evolutionary psychology, neuroscience, and are not allergic to secular Buddhism, CFT might be for you. CFT also places great importance on compassion and helping others, which plausibly makes it a good fit for effective altruists. CFT appears to be helpful in alleviating various mental health problems (e.g., Craig et al., 2020) but might be especially effective if you struggle with guilt, shame, and/or self-criticism (Leaviss &amp; Uttley, 2015).</p><p>If you want to read more on CFT, we recommend&nbsp;the overview paper by Gilbert (<a href=\"https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/papt.12226\"><u>2019</u></a>). See Gilbert &amp; Simos (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Compassion-Focused-Therapy-Clinical-Applications/dp/0367476908\"><u>2022</u></a>) for a more in-depth resource, aimed at clinicians.</p><h2>Schema therapy</h2><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_therapy\"><u>Schema therapy</u></a>&nbsp;(ST) was developed by Jeffrey Young in the 1980s. According to schema therapy, we all share certain needs, such as the need for safety, competence, or belonging.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5yx8gfhc66m\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5yx8gfhc66m\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If certain needs are not met, corresponding <strong>maladaptive</strong><i>&nbsp;</i><strong>schemas</strong>&nbsp;are at risk of developing. Maladaptive schemas are pervasive patterns of thought and emotion regarding oneself and others, causing substantial distress, and are usually developed early in life (Young et al., 2003).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsendyxnv7l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsendyxnv7l\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, early experiences with perfectionistic and demanding parents, peers, or teachers whose affection is mostly conditional on achieving high performance might give rise to the \u2018<i>unrelenting&nbsp;standards</i>\u2019 schema, characterized by deriving one\u2019s self-worth from meeting overly demanding standards which can result in a sense of inadequacy, frequent feelings of stress and time pressure, difficulty relaxing, being competitive and overly critical of oneself and others.</p><p>Schema therapists distinguish between more than a dozen distinct types of maladaptive schemas. See Rafaeli et al. (2011, p. 19 to 28) for a full list. (In our view, any such list is somewhat arbitrary.)</p><h3>Modes</h3><p>In schema therapy, one's parts or selves are called \u2018<strong>modes</strong>\u2019. \u201cModes&nbsp;refer to the predominant emotional state, schemas, and coping reactions that are active for an individual at a particular time.\u201d (Rafaeli et al., 2011, p. 47).&nbsp;Modes are <i>transient</i> <i>states</i>, in contrast to schemas, which are <i>stable traits</i>.</p><p>There are four types of&nbsp;modes: <i>child modes</i>, <i>coping modes</i>, <i>dysfunctional parent modes</i>, and the <i>healthy adult mode</i>. Note that these are just broad categories. How these modes manifest exactly can be very different for each person. Schema therapists often encourage their clients to come up with their own names for their own unique constellation of modes.</p><p><strong>Child modes</strong>&nbsp;include the vulnerable, angry, impulsive and happy child (more on this below). The <i>vulnerable child mode </i>can be seen as the \u201cwounded core\u201d of a person (Rafaeli et al., 2011) and is particularly important. In this mode, one feels sad, frightened, and helpless.</p><p>By default, people try to avoid experiencing overly distressing emotions, such as the inherent vulnerability of the vulnerable child mode, by engaging in, usually maladaptive, <strong>coping behaviors</strong>. When doing so, we usually inhabit three different types of coping styles\u2014<i>surrender, avoidance, or overcompensation</i>\u2014corresponding to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response\"><u>freeze, flight and fight response</u></a>, respectively. Surrender may take the form of submissive compliance, avoidance usually involves detachment or distraction, and overcompensation may entail self-aggrandizement or perfectionistic striving. Coping modes often have been adaptive in the past but usually tend to become inflexible and maladaptive.</p><p><strong>Dysfunctional parent modes</strong>&nbsp;take the form of inner critics that denigrate or belittle one when not meeting almost impossible standards. They can originate from having internalized criticism, punishment or abuse by one\u2019s parents, peers, or other role models\u2014including of society at large (the term \u2018<i>parent</i>&nbsp;mode\u2019 can therefore be misleading.) These modes\u2019 voices can be cruel and leave one feeling worthless and useless.</p><p>A core aim of schema therapy is to empower two adaptive modes: <strong>The Healthy Adult</strong>&nbsp;and the <strong>Happy Child mode</strong>. One inhabits the Healthy Adult mode when one feels confident, capable, balanced, and compassionate. Its functions include meeting needs and responsibilities, and handling conflicts between different parts. In the Happy Child mode, one feels care-free, curious and joyful. Regularly inhabiting this mode is relaxing and restorative.</p><h3>Schema therapy in practice</h3><p>In schema therapy, like in CFT, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/w9hKmNvhEnHo2wcr7/many-therapy-schools-work-with-inner-multiplicity-not-just#Chairwork\"><u>chairwork</u></a>&nbsp;(explained below)&nbsp;in its various forms is used frequently to work with one\u2019s multiple parts, aka modes.</p><p>For those interested, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/w9hKmNvhEnHo2wcr7/many-therapy-schools-work-with-inner-multiplicity-not-just#Schema_therapy_and_its_similarities_with_IFS_and_coherence_therapy\"><u>this section in the appendix</u></a>&nbsp;describes in more detail how schema therapy works in practice, as well as its similarities with IFS and coherence therapy.</p><h3>Is schema therapy the right fit for you?</h3><p>Compared to CFT and IFS, schema therapy is arguably most similar to traditional CBT. In fact, Young developed schema therapy in collaboration with Aaron Beck, the father of CBT (Rafaeli et al., 2014). But schema therapy also has much in common with psychoanalytic approaches\u2014e.g., its comparative emphasis on childhood experiences\u2014and attachment theory. If you are put off by that, Schema therapy might not be for you. Schema therapy is well-established within academia and supported by a <a href=\"https://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=schema+therapy+evidence&amp;oq=schema+therapy\"><u>larger amount of empirical evidence</u></a>&nbsp;(e.g., Masley et al., 2012), at least compared to IFS and, to a lesser extent, compassion-focused therapy (cf. the section on CFT).</p><p>If you want to learn more, Rafaeli et al. (<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eshkol-Rafaeli/publication/312779535_Working_with_Modes_in_Schema_Therapy/links/588838134585150dde504078/Working-with-Modes-in-Schema-Therapy.pdf\"><u>2014</u></a>) provides a short overview on how schema therapy works with modes. See Arntz &amp; Jacob (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Schema-Therapy-Practice-Introductory-Approach/dp/1119962862\"><u>2017</u></a>) for a book-length treatment (aimed at clinicians).</p><h2>Chairwork</h2><p>Chairwork is not a therapy school but a technique that works with one\u2019s multiple parts. It was chairwork that introduced Richard Schwartz, the founder of IFS, to the idea of having \u201cinner conversations\u201d with one\u2019s multiple parts (Schwartz &amp; Sweezy, 2019).</p><p>There are many forms of chairwork (Pugh, 2019, ch. 3-5). In multi-chair techniques, the client is asked to sit in and speak from two or more chairs representing different parts, to allow these parts to communicate with each other. In chair one the client might speak as her internal critic, in chair two as her vulnerable side, and in chair three as her \u201cwise and rational part\u201d. In the empty-chair technique, the client speaks to a part of herself (e.g., her inner critic) imagined sitting in an empty chair.</p><p>The term \u201cchairwork\u201d is potentially misleading because there is nothing magical about chairs. Instead of an empty chair, for instance, you could use a puppet or a drawing. The essential ingredients of \u201cchairwork\u201d are not chairs, but rather i) <i>self-multiplicity</i>, ii) <i>personification and embodiment</i>, iii) and <i>dialogue</i>&nbsp;(Pugh, 2018, 2019). A more descriptive name might be \u201canimating and disentangling one\u2019s multiple self-aspects via personification or embodiment, thereby stimulating their interaction, enabling internal dialogue and transforming conflict into integration\u201d-technique though that admittedly doesn\u2019t roll off the tongue quite as smoothly.</p><ul><li><strong>Self-multiplicity</strong>&nbsp;means that the self is conceptualized as being composed of multiple parts, e.g., one\u2019s vulnerable child, compassionate self, or inner critic.</li><li><strong>Personification and embodiment</strong>&nbsp;are two different ways of \u201canimating\u201d these different parts. <i>Personification</i>&nbsp;refers to imagining one\u2019s multiple parts as human-like persons (if possible). <i>Embodiment</i>&nbsp;means acting out a part of oneself. For example, the client might be invited to switch chairs and speak and act as though she was the inner critic herself. Personification and embodiment can help accessing one\u2019s parts and clarify their relationships with each other, among other things. <i>Externalizing</i>&nbsp;distressing thoughts and emotions in this way can also facilitate more rational, reflective processing.</li><li>Behavioral, cognitive, and emotional changes are more likely to occur if different parts can enter into a <strong>dialogue</strong>&nbsp;and communicate with each other. This can help to resolve internal conflicts and enables different parts&nbsp;to start \u201cworking together\u201d.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4v6r11exu6p\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4v6r11exu6p\">[13]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>Like with most specific psychotherapy interventions, there is limited research on the effectiveness of chair work. However, there is preliminary evidence that chairwork decreases mental health problems such as anxiety, depression, and self-criticism as, or possibly more, effectively than other&nbsp;conventional&nbsp;techniques. (e.g.; Stiegler et al., 2017; de Oliveira et al., 2012; Shahar et al., 2012). For an overview, see Pugh (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10608-016-9805-x\"><u>2017</u></a>, p. 13-18).</p><h3>Which therapy schools use chairwork?</h3><p>Several modern&nbsp;schools&nbsp;have incorporated chairwork as a therapeutic technique (e.g., Kellog, 2012; Pugh, 2019, ch. 2). However, most \u201cstandard\u201d CBT therapists rarely use chairwork in their practice (Pugh et al., 2021). Therefore, if you are particularly interested in \u201cparts work\u201d, going to a standard CBT therapist is probably not the best option. As mentioned, Chairwork is especially common in compassion-focused and schema therapy.</p><h2>Other therapy modalities</h2><p>Since the ~1980s, working with inner multiplicity has become increasingly common among many therapy approaches.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffgdms1cds8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfgdms1cds8\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Prominent examples include <i>Dialectical Behavior Therapy</i>&nbsp;(DBT) which distinguishes emotional, rational, and wise mindsets (Linehan, 2014, ch. 7), <i>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy</i>&nbsp;(ACT), which recognises three dimensions of the self:<i>&nbsp;</i>the conceptualized self, the knowing self, and the observing self (Zettle, 2016), <i>Voice Dialogue Therapy</i>&nbsp;(1970s) which describes multiple selves as \u201ddiscrete units of consciousness and ways of being, which possesses a will, emotional spectrum and worldview of its own\u201d (Berchik, Rock, Friedman, 2016), and <i>Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy</i>&nbsp;(MBCT)&nbsp;which also emphasizes working with inner multiplicity; a guiding principle of one of MBCT\u2019s founders, John Teasdale, was: \u201cWe don\u2019t have one mind, but many\u201d&nbsp;(Teasdale, 1997).</p><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>We thank Amber Dawn, Kaj Sotala, and Damon Pourtahmaseb-Sasi for helpful comments.</p><h2>Appendix</h2><h3>Schema therapy and its similarities with IFS and coherence therapy</h3><p>Rafaeli et al. (2014, emphasis ours) describes some important principles of working with modes, much of which seems reminiscent of \u201cparts work\u201d in IFS (note that there is more to Schema therapy than mode work even though mode work is quite essential):</p><blockquote><p>In collaboration with the client, the therapist labels [various] modes, explores their origin, and links them to current problems. [...] A unique aspect of ST is its emphasis on deliberately inviting or activating all of a client\u2019s modes, including the maladaptive ones, in session. Schema therapists seek to give voice to various modes, to differentiate them, and to use experiential techniques to set up deliberate interactions between these normally dissociated self-states. This \u201chot\u201d emotional activation of the client\u2019s neural and cognitive circuitry is seen as essential for affecting change for deeply rooted, long-standing problems.</p></blockquote><p>Noticeably, Rafaeli et al. (2014) explicitly describe similarities between ST and structural (<i>family</i>) therapy:</p><blockquote><p>We use the metaphor of structural therapy here, as it emphasizes the idea that in ST, we view the person as a system, comprising multiple and mutually interacting modes. Our aim is to change the way these parts work together. In broad terms, this requires three key processes: clarifying what the modes are; giving voice to adaptive and vulnerable modes; and creating adaptive boundaries between the modes. One technique often used in ST to facilitate all three of these processes is chairwork (Kellogg, 2004), and in particular, two-chair dialogues [...] but ST mode work may at times involve three, four, or even more chairs.</p></blockquote><p>The following dynamic described by Rafaeli et al. (2014) parallels <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5gfqG3Xcopscta3st/building-up-to-an-internal-family-systems-model%23The_Internal_Family_Systems_model\"><u>IFS explanations</u></a>&nbsp;of how \u201cexiles\u201d (corresponding to child modes) can be suppressed by \u201cfirefighters\u201d or \u201cprotectors\u201d (corresponding to coping modes):</p><blockquote><p>Among many clients, even those with ample reasons for hurt or angry feelings, the Vulnerable and Angry Child modes often sound very muffled or cannot be heard at all. These modes hold most of the client\u2019s distress and negative affect, but are often buffered or obscured by coping modes, or overpowered by internalized parental modes.</p></blockquote><p>Interestingly enough, some prominent coping modes in schema therapy have names like \u201cDetached Protector\u201d or \u201cAvoidant Protector\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>Schema therapy\u2019s approach to healing the vulnerable child mode also seems similar to how IFS (or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/ZbmRyDN8TCpBTZSip/p/i9xyZBS3qzA8nFXNQ\"><u>coherence therapy</u></a>) approach \u201chealing\u201d exiles and traumatic memories, respectively. All three approaches posit that one needs to stop pushing traumatic memories / our vulnerabilities&nbsp;away and in fact experience and <i>activate</i>&nbsp;distressing memories first, then nurture and sooth them/present them with disconfirming evidence in a compassionate manner, in order to integrate/reconsolidate them.</p><p>From Rafaeli et al. (2014, emphasis ours):</p><blockquote><p>The [vulnerable child] mode [...] can often be triggered in an adult\u2019s life. \u201cTriggers\u201d are situations that bear varying degrees of similarity to the originating experience (e.g., aversive or ambiguous interpersonal interactions). When these situations occur, clients essentially reexperience an earlier trauma [...and] concomitant distress (e.g., fear, shame, loneliness). Typically, the client is not aware that the distress is linked to earlier experiences [...] ST aims to help clients make their VC mode present and visible, allow it to receive care (at first, from the therapists themselves), and, over time, learn how to internalize and generalize this care. This process, in which therapists identify and partially gratify the unmet needs of the VC, is the central therapeutic stance within ST, and is referred to as limited Reparenting.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Importantly, the nurturance of the Vulnerable Child mode, and the access to the mode that it requires, are often quite difficult to achieve. The experiences of vulnerability and distress that are inherent to this mode are painful and patients often expend great effort to avoid or combat the mode. Most commonly, the patient would engage in some coping behaviors to escape the mode. Ironically, these maladaptive coping efforts and reactions only increase and prolong the distress. The schema therapist's role is to gently encourage the patient to accept, and participate in, a counterintuitive process of recognizing and <strong>experiencing the vulnerability rather than pushing it away</strong>. If the vulnerability is kept hidden or obscured, no such process can take place [...]. If it is allowed to come to the surface, the slow process of addressing it can occur.</p></blockquote><h2>References</h2><p>Arntz, A., &amp; Jacob, G.

Secondly, speaking from the perspective of self-parts promotes ownership of these experiences: when individuals enact distressing intrapersonal events through chairwork (e.g. self-criticism), they recognise these processes are said and done to oneself (e.g. self-to-self-criticism) [...]. Thirdly, speaking from the perspective of dysfunctional thoughts and feelings allows therapists to assess both the content and the tone of these experiences. In doing so, parallels with other (external) voices are established (Therapist: \u201cDid speaking as your inner critic remind you of anyone in your life?\u201d). Finally, dialogue by its very nature assumes a plurality of perspectives (Perls, 1969), thus challenging singular explanations and responses to events (Therapist: \u201cAlthough you believe this negative thought a great deal, does any part of you view this situation differently? Can you change seats and speak from that perspective?\u201d).\u201d</p><p>Similarly, Dimaggio &amp; Stiles (<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giancarlo-Dimaggio/publication/6627386_Psychotherapy_in_light_of_internal_multiplicity/links/5a2819e64585155dd4276d21/Psychotherapy-in-light-of-internal-multiplicity.pdf\"><u>2007</u></a>) write: \u201cProblems seem to arise not because the self has many parts but because communication between the parts is poor. [...] when there is no dialogue of the various parts of the self, behavior may seem incoherent. Individuals may swing between anger aimed at getting their way, guilt feelings at the idea of harming others, and the idea of not deserving anything. As the positions shift, their actions also change, with the result that none of them is pursued long enough to be effective.\u201d</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnfgdms1cds8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreffgdms1cds8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;In the 1980s, various CBT-related psychotherapy schools emerged, often referred to as the \u201cthird wave\u201d of cognitive therapy. These approaches tend to share two core principles: i) the importance of non-judgmental acceptance and metacognitive awareness (being aware of one\u2019s thoughts and emotions and learning to accept them while not \u201cgetting lost\u201d in them) and ii) a growing emphasis on (various forms of) inner multiplicity.

I was not cold, not shivering, not really feeling anything about the weather except an awareness that it was low thermometer type weather. Given that I was naked and sitting on the very top of a frozen, snow covered mountain top, with gusts of wind blowing around me at tens of miles an hour, and I wasn\u2019t cold \u2014 uh\u2026 that\u2019s&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>how getting cold is supposed to work.</p><p>I could see incredibly clearly, details of brown craggy rocks on other mountain peaks dozens of miles away, snow leopards wandering around, goats, all the birds circling in the sky for a hundred miles.</p><p>I mean&nbsp;<i>wow</i>.</p><p>Once I\u2019d read that Tiger Woods could see better than twenty-twenty after he got laser eye surgery. I suppose that is sort of like what this was like, except at least a thousand times more intense.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Really&nbsp;</i>high up.</p><p>I\u2019d had vertigo in my original life, and it sort of freaked me out a bit that I&nbsp;<i>wasn\u2019t&nbsp;</i>scared of falling off the mountain side. From how far down below me the green valley beneath the mountain was, I shouldn\u2019t be able to even breathe without help.&nbsp;</p><p>Deep breath.</p><p>Something in my brain was&nbsp;<i>aware&nbsp;</i>that there was a low oxygen content to the air, and there was some other process that was automatic as breathing, that I was using to\u2026 maybe multiply, or intensify, or&nbsp;<i>something&nbsp;</i>the sustaining substance in the air so that I was safe at this height.&nbsp;</p><p>What?</p><p>\u2018The sustaining substance in the air\u2019.</p><p>That was the awkward phrase that went through my mind. Not \u2018oxygen\u2019. \u2018The sustaining substance in the air\u2019.</p><p>I think that was when I realized that something much weirder than a hospital fever dream might be going on. I was pretty sure that I\u2019d never invent a made up scientific phrase that was&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>awkward for \u2018oxygen\u2019, even in my weirdest dreams.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, around me, in a very magical mumbo jumbo array was a particularly complicated folded ninth shape runic spell circle.&nbsp;</p><p>And despite the fact that I had&nbsp;<i>no&nbsp;</i>idea what the hell that description meant, or what I was looking at, I&nbsp;<i>felt&nbsp;</i>like I understood the weirdly entangled and braided giant circle drawn in what I also instinctively knew was my&nbsp;<i>own&nbsp;</i>blood around me on a flattened and cleared section of ground.&nbsp;</p><p>The drawing was sort of like a circle with a nonagram \u2014 nine sides \u2014 inscribed in it. The lines were made up of braided circles like Celtic necklaces, or the endless geometric forms of Islamic mosques. And then embedded in this were tiny letterings, symbols, pictograms, and endlessly intricate and fascinating structures that overlapped, and yet each was somehow perfect in its own way.</p><p>My own fucking blood?</p><p>Or anyways the blood of the dude who'd been running this body then \u2014 I was starting to realize that I had memories from this person before&nbsp;<i>I&nbsp;</i>was the one in control.</p><p>The whole \u2018painting the snow with my own blood for a powerful magical ritual\u2019 weirdness made it hard for me to properly appreciate the intricate artistry.&nbsp;</p><p>I mean, objectively impressive. His memories were starting to be available to me. The guy had spent two weeks preparing parts of it in his lab in his mage tower, because of course he had a tall mage tower, built out of a pale marble with pink veins. Then all of the intricate runes and spell work were magically folded into a tiny space, and then splotched out, and infused with his blood \u2014 that he could regenerate arbitrarily fast as a powerful cultivator \u2014 that was what they called magic users in this world \u2014 and then he made his own little mistake that had killed him.</p><p>Funny how we all seemed to be doing that sort of thing.</p><p>His error had been forced by a bad situation. It seemed like this island was going to be invaded by the \u2018Celestial Emperor\u2019, and he planned to kill the dragons that were the symbol of the island, and that everyone really loved. Also strip them of independence.&nbsp;</p><p>It was clear to the fellow that he thus had no choice but to do anything that might give him the power to face him, such as a dangerous ritual to open his fourth dantian, and gain the power of a celestial, even though he thought the ritual would kill him.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>This guy thought he\u2019d had no choices, he\u2019d guessed that there was at best a one in three chance that he would survive this attempt to open his fourth dantian, and to become a celestial like the emperor. But that was the only way to defeat this enemy.</p><p>Even if he\u2019d succeeded, the odds would be against his success, since the emperor had vastly more experience and resources behind him.</p><p>So the man had come here, used materials that I\u2019d guess were worth the equivalent of between a ten million and a hundred million dollars to power the vast ritual, used magic to paint with his own blood the ritual circles, and then blew his mind apart.</p><p>I looked down at the hands. The hands were \u2014 to be honest \u2014 pretty similar to my own hands, except with a weave of extra scars and a faint glow from within a network of tattoos so thin that I would not have been able to see them with ordinary human eyes.</p><p>Poor guy.</p><p>Doubly sad because I didn\u2019t have the slightest intention of trying to fight in his war.</p><p>Risky bets often fail.</p><p>The former owner of this body had made such a failing bet.</p><p>Even if this body had successfully \u2018opened the fourth dantian\u2019, I was pretty sure that a sorcerer who'd spent a thousand years warring and conquering would be better at it than me, and I didn\u2019t have any particular reason to care about the fate of the island, or the survival of the dragons. They weren\u2019t my personal project.</p><p>I mean I&nbsp;<i>do&nbsp;</i>care. I\u2019m unhappy when I hear about anyone suffering, failing to achieve what they want to, and simply not flourishing. But I have no particular reason to care&nbsp;<i>more&nbsp;</i>about helping people in Kenya than people in Singapore \u2014 it just was that I could do more good with the limited amount of stuff I have for people in Kenya, and they also needed more help.</p><p>I figured it was sort of like that here.&nbsp;</p><p>It would be best if I&nbsp;<i>didn\u2019t&nbsp;</i>die. Not dying again\u2026 in a part of my mind that was completely untouched by philosophical concerns, matters of optimizing the world, or even how I looked in front of others, I was&nbsp;<i>desperate&nbsp;</i>not to die again.&nbsp;</p><p>And, fortunately, it didn\u2019t rationally seem like it would be a good idea to stick around here.</p><p>This island was going to lose its war \u2014 with or without me. But I could grab everything that he\u2019d owned that was valuable and easily portable, and then scram, flee, make a cautious withdrawal \u2014 get the hell out of dodge.</p><p>It was not my war.</p><p>I mean I wasn\u2019t a pacifist or anything, but it just wasn\u2019t my war.</p><p>At this point I will freely confess that I had a sense with some part of my mind that I was&nbsp;<i>supposed to&nbsp;</i>despite all of those considerations care about this war and fight in it.</p><p>But I didn\u2019t want to.</p><p>It was scary and I might die, and besides there were lots of things I wanted to do to explore how magic worked, and to help other people now that I was powerful and had a huge range of things that I could do.</p><p>Perhaps there was some reason that simply did not occur to me for why this war was really important, and really mattered in a way that it would be super valuable to everyone, even people who weren\u2019t born here if Yatamo won. If there was something worth me dying to be won, I\u2019d risk it.</p><p>Otherwise I was going to bounce like Han Solo kept planning to..</p><p>Anyway, The guy whose body I\u2019d gotten had been ridiculously rich, and he had a set of epic capabilities that were extremely valuable and with which I could make vast amounts of money \u2014 somewhere suitably far away.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe dying and waking up here wasn\u2019t the worst possible thing that could have happened to me: I\u2019d spent the last years trying to earn as much money as I possibly could, and now I was going to do what I\u2019d always planned to do if I ever got properly rich: Give it all away.</p><p>Well most of it. I certainly would keep some of his hoard around to have fun that had nothing to do with anyone else.</p><p>Without making the effort to recall the details from that fellow\u2019s \u2014 Sesako had been his name \u2014 memories, I got a distinct sense that this world was at least as fucked up as earth was.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe even a bit more.</p><p>There would be plenty of ways here to make the lives of impoverished, unhealthy, and underused human individuals better with the huge pile of gold coins and the giant store of expensive refined pills, power stones, finely enchanted artifacts, magically infused clothing, and just generally expensive&nbsp;<i>stuff&nbsp;</i>that he had \u2014 much of which had no actual purpose at all except to show that the owner could possess \u2018the best\u2019.</p><p><i>Now&nbsp;</i>my heart was beating.</p><p><i>This&nbsp;</i>was more exciting to me than now having magical powers and being immune to the cold, and able to keep my place easily despite the winds that were gusting over the mountain top at probably a hundred miles an hour.</p><p>And what about those other, more uncertain issues \u2014 what were the things that might destroy this world entirely? And what were the ways that it could, slowly and over the very long term, be turned into a true utopia?</p><p>I had a chance to&nbsp;<i>really</i>, and&nbsp;<i>personally&nbsp;</i>make a vast difference for a vast number of other people.&nbsp;</p><p><i>That&nbsp;</i>was better than the eyesight that let me see anything I focused on in detail, a small city far in the distance at the foot of the mountains, the orchards, the fields of wheat around the feet of the mountain, a snow leopard climbing on an icy ridge after the track of a mountain goat ten miles away, the very curvature of the earth underneath the vast oceans.</p><p>Oceans that were bringing a mighty invasion force \u2014 spotted, tracked, detailed by spies.</p><p>Eh, no time to waste, no rest for the wicked, idle hands are the devil\u2019s playthings. Also haste makes waste.</p><p>My mind held a clear map of the whole island, and while I couldn't see the capital city and my, or his\u2026&nbsp;<i>the&nbsp;</i>tower, I knew exactly what direction to go. The capital city was almost five hundred miles away from here \u2014 which was the tallest mountain on the island, and also near the valley where the great dragons made their home.</p><p>It was an hour and a half trip for this guy when he flew and pushed himself, and about two and a half at what he thought was a comfortable pace.</p><p>From memories about warfare, where lots of weapons would be accelerated to super sonic speeds, the sonic boom was clearly a thing here, and thus the speed of sound also was. But it seemed like none of the cultivators were able to move nearly as fast as it.&nbsp;</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure how much of Sesako\u2019s valuable stuff I could actually carry from the storerooms, but I caught from&nbsp;<i>his&nbsp;</i>memories that there were extra dimensional storage systems where anything that wasn\u2019t magically delicate could be stuffed in great quantities.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course the stuff that couldn\u2019t be stuffed in such superdimensional pouches was the most valuable, I\u2019d have to figure out some way to take all of it with me.&nbsp;</p><p>Maybe a big crate that I could hold up while I flew away.</p><p>This guy was big on magical flying, and I could tell that I pretty soon would be too. A large fraction of his memories focused on flight.</p><p>In the air, chasing down birds, outpacing hawks as they swooped down at hundreds of miles an hour to snatch their prey, hurtling through clouds, flying calmly along next to the flapping wings of&nbsp;<i>a fucking gigantic dragon</i>.</p><p>It turned out that leaping off a cliff wasn\u2019t quite as easy as simply knowing that I could safely do it. When I tried to leap off the craggy side of the mountain into the air to fly away from the mountainside, my&nbsp;<i>own&nbsp;</i>instincts stopped me.</p><p>I was&nbsp;<i>so&nbsp;</i>high up.</p><p>I imagined the fall all the way down the ridges and cliffs to the valley far, far below \u2014 broken body tumbling.</p><p>Crack. Crack. Bounce. Crack. Ba-ba-bounce.&nbsp;<i>Crack</i>.</p><p>And then as though it reflected some sort of contempt for ordinary mortals, an instinct from Sesako overroad that anxiety, as though his mind was still there, and still active somewhere in my new brain \u2014 how the fuck did&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>even work? \u2014 and I leapt off the mountain side.</p><p>Wheeeeeeeee!</p><p>With a series of loud whoops I soared higher, and higher, hurtling upwards towards the sun.&nbsp;</p><p>The instincts honed by&nbsp;<i>more than a century&nbsp;</i>of life controlled the motion.</p><p>My stomach leapt. The mountain receded beneath me. Everything became smaller.. I could see further and further, the world curving out beneath me as the point of the horizon went further and further away. The whole path of water around the island, many cities.&nbsp;</p><p>The island itself was shaped rather like Britain, except that the side that reminded me of Scotland was nearly as wide around as the other. There were two giant circular clumps of mountains, and in between was a low fertile isthmus, that was big enough for large cities on either side, separated by incredibly thin roads and thick farmlands.</p><p>And then glancing down at the mountains behind me, I saw the dragon.</p><p>Sleeping, huge, the tail curled around the giant body, and the wings pulled in, but it looked to be at least a thousand feet in length.</p><p>That dragon figured prominently in Sesako\u2019s memories, with a mix of fond affection, religious awe, and actual friendship.</p><p>The dragons were the symbol of his island, they were the gods they worshiped, and whose blessings they begged. They were fed off a fraction of the proceeds of a million farms and a thousand prosperous trading expeditions.</p><p>An odd sensation of guilt rose in me while looking at the dragon sleeping far below.</p><p>It had been the knowledge that the emperor meant to hunt and kill the dragon\u2019s in the mountains of Yatamo after he had reconquered the island which drove Sesako\u2019s reckless attempt to force open his fourth dantian.</p><p>This was his body. It was his wealth I intended to appropriate for my own purposes. His people, and all that he cared for was going to be abandoned by me, and left to be destroyed.</p><p>It did not feel like the right thing to do.</p><p>Selfish.</p><p>There was that difference from the memories in my body that said the fourth dantian&nbsp;<i>was&nbsp;</i>open.&nbsp;</p><p>I might be able to fight this invasion to a stop.&nbsp;</p><p>A proper storybook hero would stay and fight no matter what the odds were.</p><p>If I was in a novel or a web serial, I\u2019d stay and fight.</p><p>I ought to fight, and\u2026&nbsp;</p><p>And if I succeeded, I would kill a lot of people. Most likely I would kill a moderate number of people, and then just die because having the memories and instincts of Sesako was&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>in fact at all the same as me being a great battle cultivator with a hundred years of honed skill and tested brutality?</p><p>So yeah, I&nbsp;<i>could&nbsp;</i>try to kill a lot of people so that food that could feed tens of thousands of humans would continue to be fed to a group of ancient, overgrown lizards \u2014 even if they were sentient lizards that didn\u2019t make it necessarily a good use of resources.</p><p>The thing was, I had always wanted to use an important part of the resources I had in a way that benefit people who weren\u2019t in any way connected to me, just because they were living people who would suffer or be happy, and who fell in love like I did, and perhaps enjoyed stories like I did, and who were deeply fascinated by things that I perhaps had never even heard about.&nbsp;</p><p>In my mind a part of being a good person means doing something for the common good, for everyone alive. Not necessarily doing everything in your power, but something non-trivial.&nbsp;</p><p>By normal standards Sesako was a very good person. He was selflessly focused on what was good for his nation, for his friends, and for those who he personally cared for.</p><p>He was ridiculously brave, hard working, disciplined, and he was generally generous and kind to those beneath him. He took his duties seriously.</p><p>All of these things are extremely important. And I admired him for them.</p><p>But it seemed like Sesako had nothing of that thing in him which I had in me, that made me care about someone, no matter who they were, and no matter whether I would ever even hear about them, just because they were alive and able to think and feel.</p><p>And that thing was a really important thing.</p><p>I could do more for people in general if I left. That was why I wasn\u2019t doing an evil act by turning my back on Yatamo, and on Sesako\u2019s goals, friends and desires.</p><p>This line of thought did not wholly satisfy me. I knew I was thinking in ugly circles. I again and again made excuses for myself and for my plan to abandon the place.</p><p>But whether I felt guilty or not, I was going to leave.</p><p><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter Two</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Flying, fucking flying!</p><p>Wheeeeeeeeeee!</p><p>I\u2019m fucking flying!</p><p>Dying apparently wasn\u2019t too bad.&nbsp;</p><p>I mean, it wasn\u2019t for&nbsp;<i>me</i>. It probably would suck for you as much as expected. But&nbsp;<i>I&nbsp;</i>was one of the lucky few (or maybe most of us are, how would we know?) who was reborn somewhere that I could break the laws of physics.</p><p>The motion of the flight was effortless, controlled by those instincts that I got from the body.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the hurry I felt in, I was having too much fun to really push the pace, so it took a bit more than two hours for me to reach the capital city.&nbsp;</p><p>As I came close, I finally was able to see the enemy \u2018fleet\u2019.</p><p>Shit.</p><p>Wow.</p><p>I can officially say, I was glad that I wasn\u2019t going to be fighting that thing.</p><p>It looked like a floating volcano a mile high, ten miles circumference. It glowed red and huge plumes of smoke and steam were constantly puffed out from the cone.</p><p>How the fuck did the emperor do&nbsp;<i>that</i>?</p><p>All around the base of the&nbsp;<i>mountain&nbsp;</i>that slowly floated towards the city were tens of thousands of what looked like hot air balloons to provide buoyancy. There were a few ships sailing around it, as outer scouts, but the island itself seemed to be sufficient to move the occupying army.</p><p>It was enough land that while they\u2019d still be at a modest disadvantage the emperor\u2019s cultivators would be able to draw on and brace themselves with giant ley lines.</p><p>And I had the thought, \u2018if only it could be destroyed\u2026\u2019. The thought seemed to be dragged out of that part of me that was still the man I\u2019d replaced, an agonized moan of despair.&nbsp;</p><p>With well prepared defenses, it was simply not plausible for a group of external cultivators working from the deck of a ship to overcome a system of warding towers, not without an advantage in power, numbers, and resources substantially greater than twenty to one.</p><p>With the emperor\u2019s giant floating island, and a great deal of patience, even odds of three to one would eventually triumph, and according to the spies in the harbor where the invasion fleet had been assembled, the force here included more than twenty sorcerers who had achieved a profound soul, five thousand with purified cores, and many tens of thousands with golden cores.</p><p>The cream of a continent, gathered together, and thrown into war against a single small island seated in the northern seas.</p><p>Jesus Fucking Christ.</p><p>I was glad it wasn\u2019t going to be&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>job to fight this bunch.</p><p>Sesako probably would have gotten killed bad and been very dead if he&nbsp;<i>had&nbsp;</i>successfully unlocked the celestial rank, the fourth dantian, greater power than anyone but the emperor.</p><p>His tower was set high above the city, and there were thirty other similarly high towers, built similarly out of white marble, with runes etched in entrancing swirls around and around the external surface. The wardings and magic stored in them was an essential part of the defensive structure of the city.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, the walls that were always a central part of fortifications in our world from the beginning of time straight up through world war one were completely absent. They also weren\u2019t anywhere in Sesako\u2019s memories \u2014 not even in his memory of history.</p><p>Walls simply&nbsp;<i>weren\u2019t&nbsp;</i>something they did here.</p><p>Top level combatants had always been able to fly during the evolution of military systems, so combat looked different. Towers were still useful, because they were a place that looked out over the terrain where lots of wardings, equipment and magical batteries could be stored, and thus they provided a force multiplier, but a long fence of stone that anyone who'd awakened their spark and started concentrating their chi could hop over?</p><p>Useless.</p><p>The city was delicately pretty \u2014 tree lined avenues, fine palaces, endless rows of tall brick buildings for the mass of the population.</p><p>The decorative scheme of the city didn\u2019t quite match anything I\u2019d ever seen. The buildings themselves were square and arranged in blocks, though the city as a whole formed a rough triangle inscribed in a circle of twenty great towers \u2014 this was a defensive measure, with one side of the triangle directly out onto the bay. However, the rooftops of the larger and more ornamental buildings had some great horns rising out of them, and a layering of levels that looked vaguely Japanese, but not quite.&nbsp;</p><p>It struck me suddenly as rather obvious that the decoration would not be describable easily in terms of the decorative schemes of earth, just like the Eastern styles in Japan were simply expressing a different vernacular of public architecture than Gothic churches and Baroque palaces of Europe, and once again the architectural schemes of India or the Aztecs were simply&nbsp;<i>different</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The city itself was large and spacious, with a population of one and a half million that was stuck in my head with the tones of an old well memorized figure.&nbsp;</p><p>As I came near the tower I felt a buzz as the wards noted me, and recognized me as \u2018Sesako\u2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Get in. Grab all his stuff. Now my stuff. Get out.</p><p>Simple.</p><p>The power emanating from the tower felt like the heat from a flaming fire in my magical senses. Ancient stores of magical essence bubbled out through the tower. Thickly constructed magical lines connected this tower to the others in the circle, and the ten set in another geometric pattern within the city itself. Like pipelines that could shift the stored power between the different towers to support whichever one was falling most heavily under attack.&nbsp;</p><p>The tower was humming, eager, full of vigor, and ready to fight under the command of its master.</p><p>A master who would not be there.</p><p>And then\u2026 a deeply unpleasant reality met me as I alighted on the top of the tower \u2014 following instinct, that was how he always entered and left his domain.</p><p>A quite pretty girl rushed out of its door onto the circular balcony as I reached it, dark hair, ivory skin, aristocratic nose, lips that made you think of music. She looked by the standards of earth to be college aged, maybe twenty or twenty one.&nbsp;</p><p>The detailed thoughts and memories that Sesako had about this girl flooded my mind.&nbsp;</p><p>She was his apprentice. Among other points: She was actually a little over thirty, so older than I was, or had been before I died. Hinete. She was not particularly powerful, and wasn\u2019t advancing quickly to the point where she could break open her second dantian, but she was beyond brilliant with enchanting \u2014 that was what they called carving runes into objects that could be used to cast spells.</p><p>Sesako seemed to have a bit of a crush on her, but he mostly ignored it, both because he saw himself as mostly an asexual tool of his own deep goals \u2014 at least ever since a disastrous relationship when he was quite young (by which he meant his early forties), and perhaps more importantly, because the Yatamo culture viewed mentorship and apprenticeship relationships as almost sacred.</p><p>Note: They did&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>think that relationships between superiors and subordinates were generally unacceptable, a boss marrying his secretary, or even just sleeping with her on the side as his mistress, would seem perfectly normal to them. It was&nbsp;<i>specifically&nbsp;</i>teaching relationships which they viewed as serious in this way.</p><p>Hinete hurled herself with magically propelled force against the man who she believed to be Sesako, wrapping her arms around me and sobbing. As she buried her face in my shoulder she said, \u201cDead \u2014 I was sure you died. You were going to use&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>ritual \u2014 I thought you died.\u201d</p><p>Ugh. Well.</p><p>This was uncomfortable. And, uh, I didn\u2019t really think it would be terribly politic if I just told her that&nbsp;<i>he&nbsp;</i>had.</p><p>\u201cStupid.\u201d She angrily punched me. \u201cStupid.\u201d Punched me again. \u201cStupid \u2014 don\u2019t ever. Why didn\u2019t you take me with you? \u2014 did it work?\u201d</p><p>Ummmm\u2026 no, totally did not.&nbsp;</p><p>I really didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><p>\u201cTomorrow morning. You cut it close.\u201d She glanced towards the harbor with a flash of fear in her eyes mixed with determination. \u201cThey\u2019ll be here tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><p>I backed away from her awkwardly.&nbsp;</p><p>Hinete looked at me with her heart in her eyes. Of course it wasn\u2019t&nbsp;<i>me&nbsp;</i>who she really was looking at \u2014 I was very aware that I was pretending to be someone who she cared for. A pretty girl hugging me like that made my hormones flood, but it would be&nbsp;<i>wrong&nbsp;</i>to pretend to her that I was Sesako in hopes of\u2026 something.</p><p>Anyway, I had to leave.</p><p>Get in. Get stuff. Get out.</p><p>One should always stick to the plan.</p><p>She started babbling, \u201cI\u2019ve tried to be useful \u2014 improving the wards for the tower \u2014 I had to undo the music creator we made last year. The mana flow into it Interfered with one of the cross stabilization patterns. You\u2019d always been a bit unsure about how it would fit in with the defensive set, so I checked \u2014 I worked on the heavy hurlers for Fitzuki. Oh, and I helped update with more recent spells those old hurlers the council of clans built after independence to send out fighting teams instead of stones.\u201d</p><p>I stared at her.&nbsp;<i>Uh, good job</i>.</p><p>It stood on the tip of my tongue. Sesako\u2019s instincts again. He tended to praise his students effusively when they did well, even though he sort of suspected he might be able to push them further if he became the sort of cold brilliant teacher who the students were desperate to win an occasional, rare, nod of approval from.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cEveryone needs you.\u201d Hinete added. \u201cThey asked, asked and asked where you were. All I said is that it was \u2018important\u2019. Fitzuki came by three times. Himself, not just sending messengers. And I think Kisako suspects that you deserted.\u201d</p><p>The look she gave me was a warm smile full of trust, of conviction, of unshakeable belief in me. As though&nbsp;<i>now&nbsp;</i>that I \u2014 Sesako \u2014 was back, somehow we\u2019d be able to stop that giant floating island.</p><p>\u201cThey all should flee.\u201d My voice was cold and hoarse.</p><p>As the girl blinked at me, I stepped around her and into past the decorative heavy wooden door, painted on every inch with runes into the tower. \u201cI must go to the storehouse, immediately.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhere were you? Was it really that ritual, to \u2014\u201d</p><p>I rushed down the stairs.&nbsp;</p><p>She shouted down after me, \u201cSesako \u2014 let me&nbsp;<i>help</i>. I beg you. Just let me&nbsp;<i>help</i>. I only want to \u2014\u201d</p><p>The whole tower on the inside seemed to be made out of a single piece of some marble, except it was not actually marble. Sort of like a giant hollow tooth.</p><p>Lines of runes curving around the staircase that went through the center of the tower were carved into the walls, and at each flight, the hall went off in two directions, with doors on either side.</p><p>The storeroom, with the vast amounts of gold, potions, pills, swords, armors, ingredients for experiments, and dozens of the music playing devices that Sesako enchanted as a hobby was at the bottom.</p><p>It was guaded by a big fucking door. Layers and layers of steel and a variety of other hard metals with enchantments carved into each bar. The cultivators here had easy access to very high temperatures, so despite not pushing scientific knowledge in general beyond a medieval level, they\u2019d experimented extensively with high temperature metallurgy, and the ways to infuse chi into the metals.</p><p>I kind of suspected this door would be fine if you had a main battle tank pound at it for an hour or two.</p><p>But as I was the \u2018true\u2019 \u2014 ha! \u2014 owner of the tower, the magic recognized me, and with a push of the telekinetic power I\u2019d gotten along with the ability to fly, I instinctually pressed the giant double door \u2014 each side weighing several tons \u2014 open.&nbsp;</p><p>There was an emotion in my gut, like something deep inside me was&nbsp;<i>demanding&nbsp;</i>I go up and hug that girl and tell her that I\u2019d do what it took, and that she should stop worrying because she would be safe. I should do&nbsp;<i>anything&nbsp;</i>no matter how horrifying or dangerous to protect her, to protect the great one, to save the city and\u2026 to defeat that murderous bastard, the emperor.</p><p>These were not my thoughts.</p><p>Some part of Sesako was still alive, and that part desperately wanted me to fulfill his obligations, and to take care of those who he loved.</p><p>I slammed the door to the storeroom closed.</p><p>Was there a way to properly lock it now? I pressed my hand on the doorway by instinct. And instinct called forth a few sentences of gibberish, as I traced a motion with my fingertips over the surface of the door.</p><p>This shaped power, pulling for the third dantian, the profound one in my gut.</p><p>The fourth dantian was present, opened, the crimson power moved through it. I felt that, but could not control it.&nbsp;</p><p>And the door was locked.</p><p>So long as I willed it, no one else could enter this room, without destroying the walls and doors, which task would prove neither easy, nor cheap.</p><p>I had a sensation of panic.&nbsp;</p><p>She is not my apprentice. She is&nbsp;<i>not</i>.</p><p>This is not&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>war.</p><p>This is not&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>city.</p><p>These are not&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>purposes.</p><p>I will not serve&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>values by dying here.</p><p>See it was that simple. I had no duty towards these people, and \u2014</p><p>Hell.&nbsp;</p><p>It was easier before I met the girl. They weren\u2019t really people then, just a mass of individuals. Now I\u2019d met someone who was a specific individual who was counting on Sesako, trusting Sesako, believing that somehow Sesako would magically solve all their problems \u2014 he was famous for his brilliance, his capability, for opening his third dantian and gaining the extremely rare profound soul at a younger age than anyone else in the history of the island.</p><p>Damn, damn, damn.</p><p>It was like that yellow van, with a phone number and a promise of delivery hurtling towards me again.&nbsp;</p><p>I wasn\u2019t going to get hit again.</p><p>There was a desperate panicked readiness to do&nbsp;<i>anything&nbsp;</i>necessary to survive in my guts. Didn\u2019t matter. Fuck her. Fuck them all. I wasn\u2019t going to die again.</p><p>I\u2026 I didn\u2019t really recognize those thoughts as my own either, but I knew they were coming from the \u2018me\u2019 side, not the \u2018Sesako\u2019 side.</p><p>So instead of thinking, I looked around the rich walnut shelves and shelves and shelves, all stuffed with money, and things you could use to buy money.&nbsp;</p><p>I really wasn\u2019t being selfish. I mean I&nbsp;<i>was</i>, but I was also going to act selflessly.</p><p>When I got wherever I was going, the portion of this pile that I\u2019d be able to carry would be able to feed tens of thousands of hungry people for a couple of years, or maybe I\u2019d buy pills to help thousands of people awaken their magical sparks. Or maybe I could hire several healers for years to cure diseases among the very poor.</p><p>Cause neutrality was a principle that I tried to use. My goal was to do the most good for other people, and&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>to do it in any particular way. Feeding the hungry, healing the sick, changing broken governmental systems, engaging in medical research, or working to prepare the world for future pandemics \u2014 I thought that each of these should be judged by the same criteria of what would make the biggest difference.</p><p>Anyway, even if whatever I eventually ended up doing wasn\u2019t a&nbsp;<i>perfect&nbsp;</i>choice, it would be worth doing, because, no matter what cause I spent the money on, it would be better than just having endless piles of stuff sit in a tower.</p><p>Unless I accidentally caused a catastrophe of course.</p><p>I first grabbed the four magical bags that could store objects in some sort of hammerspace.</p><p>No\u2026 they were just bigger on the inside, not a real extra dimensional space. They also were made with heavy metal wiring, because the weight didn\u2019t go away, just the size.</p><p>I opened several big chests pressed against the wall that were made out of a cold gray metal that glittered oddly in the light. In each case there wasn\u2019t actually a physical lock that could be seen, instead there was a line sealed shut with spellwork that only responded to something in my magical signature. I wondered if it was probing DNA, but the memories Sesako had of how the spell worked just told me that it reliably identified the cultivator but he didn\u2019t know in super low level details how it worked. Identical twins however&nbsp;<i>could&nbsp;</i>sometimes get through these wards, so that was a point for the DNA guess.</p><p>It popped open, with a hiss of air escaping</p><p>Whoooooo.</p><p>That was a lot of gold.</p><p>Anyway, there were also hundreds of cut jewels that had not yet been inscribed by enchanters. Bags and bags of them.</p><p>Fucking cultivators, I chuckled to myself. Always trying to get as much money as they could.</p><p>I started to get into the spirit of the thing, it was kind of like being Robin Hood.</p><p>Apparently being one of the greatest cultivators of a powerful trading nation was a good gig.&nbsp;</p><p>I filled up two of the expanding bags with the pile of coins from the chests\u2014 these bags only expanded the space by a factor of fifty, not an infinite amount. And they weren\u2019t that big anyway.</p><p>Handful of gold, shovel it in. Shovel another handful. Another handful.</p><p>Lotsa, lotsa gold.</p><p>For some reason I started humming, \u201cI've got to be a macho, macho man.\u201d</p><p>As I worked I thought about what I would do with the money: It was a core idea in the group that I\u2019d been part of on earth, before I died, that some ways of doing good were vastly more effective than other ways, and that if you&nbsp;<i>actually&nbsp;</i>were focused on changing the life of other people, rather than making yourself feel better, it was important to figure out what approaches to making lives better would help the largest number of people the biggest amount with the limited resources you had.</p><p>When one quarter filled with gold, the first bag weighed nearly a ton. No, really. Two thousand pounds.&nbsp;</p><p>Gold is extremely dense, so there actually was way more room in the bag, but this was close to the maximum weight that the bag could carry without any risk of the fibers snapping.&nbsp;</p><p>I then stuffed in on top of the gold an entire bookshelf filled with rare old books that all looked as fresh as if the manuscript copier had finished scribbling on them yesterday.&nbsp;</p><p>The books took up way more space, weighed way less, and were worth a lot of money, but much less than the gold.</p><p>Magically enhanced strength is very cool. I mean Sesako\u2019s arms didn\u2019t&nbsp;<i>look&nbsp;</i>like he went to the gym. Just firm and healthy. But he could lift a ton without a problem.</p><p>Well that was a start to ransacking the place.</p><p>I supposed the&nbsp;<i>first&nbsp;</i>thing I would do would be to flee to the second big continent. The one without the empire, and that was politically fragmented into five major states and thirty or so smaller units.</p><p>There was a country with lots of trade connections to Yatamo that seemed to be fairly rich due to the trade, but bordering lots of countries that were very poor. I\u2019d go there and spend at least two months just talking to people before I made any large irreversible decisions about what to do with this big gold pile.</p><p>What were the biggest problems in the world? What were the ways that I could use the rare and intense power I now had to earn the most money by doing useful positive sum actions, rather than hiring out my magical ability as a mercenary whose job was to kill, destroy, and in strict static terms make the world a worse place.</p><p>There wasn\u2019t a huge hurry to deploy the resources I\u2019d have as quickly as possible, because while&nbsp;<i>now&nbsp;</i>was the only time I could help someone dying from a curable illness&nbsp;<i>today</i>, there would be someone else dying&nbsp;<i>tomorrow</i>, and while my goal was to stop people from starving, I had no particular reason to care&nbsp;<i>which&nbsp;</i>person was saved, so long as I saved as&nbsp;<i>many&nbsp;</i>people as I possibly could.</p><p>With both bags full I hefted them up.</p><p>In a general way I remembered from Sesako\u2019s memories that these bags were so hideously expensive&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>because of the difficulty of the space expansion enchantments, but because of the difficulty of enchanting the materials so that they could manage the enormous concentrated weight without breaking.&nbsp;</p><p>This was incredibly fun: It felt like I'd just picked up a moderately heavy bag full of groceries \u2014 absolutely no problem to hold.</p><p>Instinct had gotten me this far, and I remembered that when he was carrying these bags, Sesako would loop them on his belt. So I did so, despite knowing that the weight would rip any fabric apart \u2014 and it would this fabric, except I instinctively started cycling some of the purple power in my second dantian \u2014 this was not sufficiently difficult to require the blue coded power of the third dantian, into the belt, so that&nbsp;<i>I&nbsp;</i>felt most of the weight on my hips, rather than the clothes feeling it.</p><p>Awesome.</p><p>After this I went through the rest of the store house, feeling calmer and happier as I went.&nbsp;</p><p>Packages of potions in foam like boxes, carefully designed to keep the glass vials from bumping against each other.</p><p>The bag I was putting them in was different from the other bags, less room in it, but with charms that dampened momentum.&nbsp;</p><p>If someone drank these potions they would get a burst of magical power \u2014 and of course they were blue. The red potions healed wounds, and restored blood. And purple potions did a bit of both.</p><p>Of course the color scheme matched the standard scheme in games.</p><p>Was any of this real \u2014 or was the simulation hypothesis correct, and was my presence here proof of that?</p><p>And should that question change my plans in any way?</p><p>Well&nbsp;<i>cogito ergo sum</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>So&nbsp;<i>I&nbsp;</i>existed.</p><p>And the only reasonable thing to do was to assume that everyone else in this world existed, and had experiences like my own, so whatever the underlying metaphysics of everything it was a worthy goal to try to help them live better, happier, more thriving and satisfying lives. To aid them in achieving their own goals as they understood it. To give them the power to control their own lives.</p><p>Basically to do good.</p><p>Potions, and piles of powder, bags of reagents, several lead boxes filled with what I was pretty sure was enriched uranium based on the memories Sesako had of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Magically modified deep metal. It made those who were not powerful sick, and it had a few weird niche uses, but not many. Sesako had bought some to experiment with a few decades ago, but forgotten about it when his interests had shifted elsewhere.</p><p>Another bag was filled with pills for helping cultivators break through the barriers in their development.&nbsp;</p><p>This bag had been enchanted so that each container with the glowing magical pills would be kept very far away from the others in the bag, no matter how the bag got squeezed or pressed \u2014 apparently if they got too close together they might blow up, or equally bad, lose potency.</p><p>In the end the stuff in that bag weighed less than thirty pounds, but it was probably as valuable in financial terms as the huge piles of gold in the two heavy bags.&nbsp;</p><p>Objects with layered enchantments could not be put in the space expansion bags, because their enchantments would interfere with the complex enchantments on the bag itself. That was also probably why the store room was its real physical size.</p><p>It was a big circular room, and I could feel running around the walls the thrumming of an enormous amount of raw power pulled up from the earth itself, unshaped by having been cycled through the dantians of a human cultivator.</p><p>This big circle of power I knew was directly underneath the leafy gardens around the tower.</p><p>I donned the most expensive \u2014 but not the most useful \u2014 suit of armor in the room, and attached three swords to the belt, and a variety of small, complicated enchanted devices that could sell decently well. I also grabbed to hold in my arms a long rectangular device that was basically a small cannon that used magic instead of gunpowder.</p><p>A phrase echoed through my head about how one must never create an enchanted device that drew directly on the power of the cultivator using it.</p><p>I looked around, scanning the room, trying to think of anything else I should grab. There was a pile of enchanted rings sitting out on a cushion, and I stuffed as many of them onto my fingers as I could manage.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the enchantments on them conflicted, and it required an ongoing effort of magical balancing to keep the whole thing from exploding out. Whatever, I wasn\u2019t planning to fight anyone, just sell this stuff.</p><p>One more look around.</p><p>Nothing else that jumped to mind as something I could successfully carry and sell.</p><p>A damned pity.&nbsp;</p><p>All of this was going to be destroyed or stolen by the emperor that was invading, and go to no good use. It would simply end up in the storehouse of another magically empowered noble who had no particular concern for the ordinary little people, and the lives they led.</p><p>I was doing the right thing.&nbsp;</p><p>Their wars were with each other; my war was with the ways the world itself was flawed.</p><p>I returned to the heavy door, removed the warding I\u2019d placed on it which made it impermeable to anyone but me, and started up the stairs, weighted down only slightly by the two tons of extra weight hanging off of my belt.</p><p>Magic was cool. And I was going to have years, and years, and years to explore and use all the features of it.</p><p>Hinete sat on the stairs at the first landing.</p><p>She looked\u2026 lost. Disconsolate. \u201cSesako\u2026 is this because \u2014&nbsp;<i>is there any way I can help</i>? \u2014 my life is worth nothing if it might save the great ones. If we can defeat that thing \u2014 just&nbsp;<i>talk&nbsp;</i>to me. Sesako, please\u2026\u201d</p><p>The pretty appealing face, rosy lips, and the desperation that arose again.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever was left of Sesako was kicking and screaming at the thought of abandoning Hinete.</p><p>Maybe I could\u2026 invite her to come with me.&nbsp;</p><p>She was a brilliant enchantress already\u2026 The runic structures and devices she made could be sold for large sums, and perhaps she could help figure out some solution to the deeper problems that made the lives of the poor and non-magical miserable. I could \u2014&nbsp;</p><p>I opened my mouth.</p><p>It was like I\u2019d been kicked in the head.</p><p>That bit of Sesako left in me&nbsp;<i>screamed&nbsp;</i>at the thought of telling her that I\u2026 he\u2026 whatever\u2026 was a traitor. Of asking&nbsp;<i>Hinete&nbsp;</i>to be a traitor with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Such words&nbsp;<i>could not be said</i>.</p><p>Well then, I\u2019d leave her behind, as guilty as I felt about leaving her, leaving this whole city, leaving all of this behind.&nbsp;</p><p>Her lips trembled. There were tears in her eyes. She said, \u201cSesako, please tell me. I can bear it.\u201d</p><p>Without saying anything to her, I walked past the girl, and up the stairs to the roof of the tower.&nbsp;</p><p>She did not follow me.&nbsp;</p><p>I was glad.</p><p>Each step felt leaden.</p><p>But I needed to be far away from here before tomorrow morning. The giant island would soon be close enough that the cultivators could use it as their base to bombard the city.&nbsp;</p><p>I just wished I hadn\u2019t met any of them.</p><p>I just wished that I hadn\u2019t had to meet Hinete.&nbsp;</p><p>She made them seem like real people to me, rather than abstractions, statistics and numbers.&nbsp;</p><p>Scope neglect.</p><p>She was one person, I\u2019d be able to help millions. It was like a trolley problem.</p><p>And that triggered my other memory \u2014&nbsp;<i>my&nbsp;</i>least favorite memory from earth.</p><p>Loud car horn. Squealing brakes.&nbsp;</p><p>An instant of realization that I had made a fatal mistake.</p><p>And then nothing.</p><p>I didn\u2019t want to die. If wanting desperately to live made me a coward, it made me a coward.</p><p><i>Anyways&nbsp;</i>I couldn\u2019t save this country from its returning feudal lord, not even if I tried as hard as I could.</p><p>I stepped out onto the balcony at the top of the tower, and I placed my foot on a little ledge in the balcony to leap upwards.</p><p>And I could not do it.</p><p>I tried to leap again.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>I suddenly felt full of anger and rage.</p><p>An anger and rage&nbsp;<i>that was not my own</i>.</p><p>And a voice that was not my own sounded in my own thoughts, \u201cI\u2019ll not! You worthless craven cur! You scum! You cowardly cancerous vermin. YOU. SHALL. NOT. WIN.\u201d</p><p>And suddenly the body I inhabited moved again, stepping away from the edge of the tower rooftop, and turning back to the door down. He stripped off the clashing rings as he stepped, dropping them to clink on the floor.</p><p>I could do nothing.</p><p>Sesako had control of his body again.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter Three</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>The rage that Sesako had used to force the parasitic ghost away from control of his body thrummed in every vein, limb, and artery.</p><p>His heart pounded.</p><p>That despicably cowardly\u2014 That vile. That craven. The gutless. That \u2014&nbsp;</p><p>He\u2019d destroy him, annihilate him, pulverize and expel him.</p><p>Soon as he had sufficient leisure and an absence of other demanding duties, he would torture and torment the parasitic spirit, and then he would destroy it.</p><p>Every last, small, tiny fragment of its residence in his person would be removed like the crabbed cancer it was.</p><p>Control.</p><p>Ensure that this threat never, ever could return \u2014 that he would always keep control over himself.</p><p>But in the beneath of Sesako\u2019s anger was terror.</p><p>Though he was a cultivator of merely a hundred and fifteen years of age, he was one of the great Profound Souls of the world. Sesako was young for one who had opened his fourth dantian and achieved the profound soul, and he was no stranger to fear.</p><p>Sesako was a man whose sole determination was to be worthy, and to succeed against a world that was unkind, and often vicious. But at times he wondered: Was he sufficient?</p><p>He had such tasks placed upon the serving table of life and spread before him. They were difficult. And he feared that he was unworthy of his position, of the friendship which the matriarch of the Great Ones had given him. Those who he had been honored to call mentor had been amongst the great of the world, Akine, Takue, and Fitzuki. Three of the seven had guided his progress to his current talents.</p><p>And yet, was he worthy?</p><p>If another could seize control of his honed mind, how could he be worthy?</p><p>Sesako did not doubt that he was great and talented, but he feared that his talents would not be enough, for the tests of the world did not care to adjust themselves to his skill level. Life might happily hand a man a test he could not master, that where there was no possibility of victory, and then he would be dead.</p><p>Dead and those he loved would have lost their own hopes of victory.</p><p>Firmly and without excessive haste Sesako walked to his meditation room.&nbsp;</p><p>What had happened during the ritual to force open the fourth dantian that had allowed his body to be occupied by another mind?</p><p>Sesako\u2019s expectation when he had begun the ritual had been simple: Death.</p><p>Oh \u2014 he\u2019d judged that there was a fifteen percent chance that he would be able to guide the collapse of this untested and incompletely modeled ritual sufficiently well that he\u2019d survive it\u2019s failure without any crippling losses, and another fifteen percent chance that he would actually open his fourth dantian, like only one other before him ever had.</p><p>Instead he\u2019d been taken control of by a worthless, writhing wraith who intended to abandon his duties, his position, the Great Ones, his nation, and everyone to whom he had promised his faith and protection. All for the sake of spilling his carefully piled up wealth out upon worthless persons to whom he had no connection, no allegiance, and no blood relation.</p><p>Yet\u2026 though Sesako wished to despise, and judge the man as worthless, there was something in him that could not help but respect him.</p><p>He wanted to fix this broken world, to make it unbroken, and he planned to throw whatever he had at the task of helping others simply because they existed and were able to suffer. That was enough reason. It was stupid \u2014 they had no claim on him. But it was impossible to actually, when he thought about it, despise a man who would give up his own resources simply so that others were happier.</p><p>It was open.</p><p>The fourth dantian was open!</p><p>Sesako sat down on the cushion in his meditation room filled with thousands of thin strands of paper on which the formulas for workings that would enhance the flow of chi had been inscribed. Everything about the room had been designed by the work of generations of cultivators with either complete or profound souls to enhance the flow of power.&nbsp;</p><p>He was only vaguely aware of it in his excitement.</p><p>The crimson power bubbled through the dantian, mixing around and around, building up. He tried to draw on it, to infuse it into the rest of his body, so he could begin to develop the fourth foundation.&nbsp;</p><p>It was impossible \u2014 to begin cycling this slowly burbling power could not be done while he kept the power in the blue profound dantian from spilling over madly and possibly fatally.</p><p>Sesako was not worried at first.&nbsp;</p><p>He was no stranger to difficult problems, to the struggle of seeing ways to make power flow that was different from its natural tendency. He had not become the youngest master of a profound soul in many hundred years in an instant.</p><p>Yet after twenty minutes a foul frustration began to build.</p><p>This felt different, as though there was a barrier that was perhaps more than simply conceptual to using all four powers at once.</p><p>So far as the world knew, only one man \u2014 the emperor \u2014 had opened his fourth dantian. And he had within twenty years gone from an obscure cultivator, cultivating in his mountain heights, to the ruler of an entire continent.</p><p>It was possible.</p><p>But not possible before tomorrow morning. He had made no progress.</p><p>There was no time.</p><p>Distant sensations spiked through his stomach, his chest, numbing his fingers and making his cheeks cold.</p><p>Sesako ignored that.</p><p>Power&nbsp;<i>now</i>. Needed.</p><p>But rage did not unlock the dantian. It had taken him three years after he opened his third dantian to fully master it. The fourth by expectation ought to take at least ten.</p><p>He turned his attention to the parasite.&nbsp;</p><p>To the body thief. To the wastrel who intended to spill all that Sesako was and owned away, like precious water into an endless desert.</p><p>It was a simple fact that there would always be poor and starving people, and if you can\u2019t&nbsp;<i>fix&nbsp;</i>the problem, what was the point of destroying yourself to make it slightly better?</p><p>There was a set of barely sensible feelings, hidden thoughts, that&nbsp;<i>existing&nbsp;</i>that ought to have no existence.&nbsp;</p><p>It was there.</p><p>A sort of buzzing or itching that was soft, but it grew in intensity. In just the twenty minutes he\u2019d struggled to access and control the crimson power in his fourth dantian, that itching had grown.</p><p>The problem came when Sesako attempted to set bounds, spells upon himself, enchantments on his own mind to ensure that the discordant note would never sing over his noble music again.&nbsp;</p><p>He worked at it. And worked at it some more.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet again stymied.</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>Like trying to grasp a gusting wind, or make a moonbeam into a physical thing.</p><p>Sesako\u2019s confidence in his eventual success was undimmed. If he spent enough time \u2014 time measured in months rather than minutes \u2014 he could discover a more sure method than the simple superiority of his will over that of the other to lock him away forever.&nbsp;</p><p>No time. Damn. Damn. Damn.</p><p>That floating volcano, a mile high, a constructed thing of vast scope, belching vast clouds of steam.</p><p>This ritual, which had so far given him no addition to his destructive or defensive capacities, took three days of unconsciousness.&nbsp;</p><p>What had happened during that time which allowed this odd, despicable, and damnable creature to take a thankfully temporary control over the person of a grand cultivator?</p><p>The next task before he went out to confer with the Fitzuki upon what his duties were to be during the defense was to talk to Hinete and correct\u2026 whatever misapprehension she was under about his plans.</p><p>She was neither in their shared workshop nor in their private one. Sesako checked the dining room, knocked on her door, and then finally looked in the library \u2014 where she actually was.</p><p>A mournful tune of sitar music played from one of the musical stones they both delighted in enchanting.&nbsp;</p><p>It was the achingly beautiful song of loss and hope that she\u2019d recorded when her uncle, Gakonga had played before the Great Ones for the summer solstice two years prior.</p><p>Sesako\u2019s throat constricted. He remembered&nbsp;<i>why&nbsp;</i>it all mattered once more.</p><p>Her eyes lit up upon seeing him enter the room.</p><p>At first he thought \u2014 hoped \u2014 that she would hurl herself into his arms again, like she had when he had been under the control of the cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead she stood off, and inclined her head. \u201cMilord, have your plans changed, might I help you in some way?\u201d</p><p>Emotion choked Sesako.</p><p>He felt an odd shame, but he still had to tell her.&nbsp;</p><p>She needed to know, in case the thief took control once more over his body. \u201cHinete, something happened to me which \u2014\u201d</p><p>She threw her arms around him suddenly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhatever for?\u201d He rubbed her back.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know \u2014 you looked so odd. So different. But now you\u2026 you look like you. What was \u2014 I saw the scrolls. I know you tried to open the fourth dantian, what \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cSomething went awry during my attempt to achieve a breakthrough, and another spirit took control over my body.\u201d</p><p>Voice quiet. Calm. Clear.</p><p>It took a dozen breaths before Hinete stiffened and drew back from him.</p><p>She looked at him with wide, scared, alert eyes. \u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><p>\u201cNow I am wholly myself. But I fear there is some possibility that the imposter may regain control \u2014 he meant to flee. To steal my wealth and my person, and flee the war.\u201d</p><p>She pressed her hand to her mouth.</p><p>\u201cYou must understand \u2014 I shall need your help to lock away in the store room as much of what I own as possible, so that even if one day, by some slight chance, he steals my body, he will not be able to steal from those I care about that fortune \u2014 come.\u201d</p><p>There was a slight unfamiliar sense of guilt as he led Hinete down to the storehouse that made Sesako angry at himself: There were many tasks which only a cultivator with the third dantian open could achieve, and he was particularly skilled at doing these tasks. The fees from such efforts were great and enormous fortune had been the result. It was&nbsp;<i>his</i>. He had every right to enjoy that which he had worked for. He was&nbsp;<i>not&nbsp;</i>obligated to give it to any one else. If he did not want to, that was his right.</p><p>Sesako knew how to construct a locking enchantment which would key the storage room\u2019s lock to Hinete instead of himself. Obviously he&nbsp;<i>could&nbsp;</i>given time and effort still break through, but it would take at least an hour or two, and he was quite confident the imposter, if he ever gained control again, would flee as quickly as possible \u2014 and anyway, even with shared instincts, that ratlike cancer in his mind was less skilled, and less\u2026 intelligent than Sesako.</p><p>Not that any of this would matter \u2014 the likeliest fate was that he would destroy that which could be destroyed before the city was taken, and that which could not be destroyed would be eventually recovered by the emperor.</p><p>Damnation.</p><p>As they went down the stairs, Hinete asked, half breathless, \u201cBut did it work \u2014 are you a celestial now?\u201d</p><p>Sesako grimaced. \u201cOnly to a half extent. I have opened the dantian, but I cannot access the power, and I have no time to experiment sufficiently to develop the skill to use it in battle. I knew this was likely when I attempted the ritual, but the difficulty is even greater than I expected \u2014 you recall when you fully opened your first dantian, and how simply because the power was there, it took time before you could&nbsp;<i>use&nbsp;</i>it.\u201d&nbsp;<i>Damn, damn, damn</i>. \u201cTomorrow morning. We only have until then. If only\u2026\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>She pressed her hand on his shoulder and squeezed.</p><p>He knew that she believed in him. She believed that he would do his best, and that his best would be enough.</p><p>Sesako only believed that he would do his best.</p><p>They returned to the storeroom, and he just tossed the expanded sacks onto the floor. There was not really time to put everything carefully back where it belonged and undo the mess that the&nbsp;<i>other</i> had done.</p><p>He handed the pouch with the potions to Hinete. He mostly made them for sale, since they were of little use to him, as a profound soul could gather and maintain energies vastly greater than what could be stored and stoppered in a potion.&nbsp;</p><p>But it was only to the seven profound souls of the island that these potions were useless. Those infused with the blue energy of the third dantian were part of his duty to make, because they were strong enough that even a purified core with the second dantian and the purple core fully developed could benefit greatly from the additional power.</p><p>Rings tossed about in no order. The armor shrugged off and was replaced by a more useful piece. Everything in place.&nbsp;</p><p>He\u2019d exhausted an important part of his supplies for the ritual\u2026 had it failed or succeeded?</p><p>\u201cEverything we will give to the general defense,\u201d Sesako said, and then the two of them began to gather amulets, defensive rings, hurlers, and staves..</p><p>\u201cIt seemed so odd. How you\u2026 he\u2026 was acting. But still \u2014 if it is an imposter, why was he able to use your power? He locked me out of the store room, neatly as you could, and\u2026\u201d Hinete shuddered.</p><p>Sesako wished he could hug her.</p><p><i>She hugged</i> him.</p><p>But that was her prerogative, not&nbsp;<i>his</i>.</p><p>\u201cDo not worry. He is full of faults, but not a violent man. I do not think he will seek to hurt you \u2014 I shall not allow him control again.\u201d</p><p>That buzzing, that itch in the back of his mind, where the spectral spirit resided strengthened, minute to minute.&nbsp;</p><p>Sesako feared that it would make a lie of his promise.</p><p>\u201cSo far as it lies within my abilities to prevent,\u201d Sesako amended, \u201cHe shall not gain control once more.\u201d</p><p>Once they reached the door to the storeroom, Sesako ordered Hinete to place her hand on the door, and he then placed his hand over hers. \u201cUse the Tirposian runic line, I will infuse your spell with power as it goes. Pay attention to the intention that you wish to control the door, that it belongs to you.\u201d</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>Her eyes were wide and she nibbled her lip. Hinete was anxious and unsettled. But that was one of the things about her \u2014 she always tried to do what he told her to, and she always tried her best. It made her an excellent aid at work, and a good apprentice.</p><p>The hand motions were not as solid as his own.&nbsp;</p><p>She took joy in working out abstruse enchanting problems that even he could barely follow, rather than the endless cycling and repetitive drilling of magical gestures and incantations that were the central part of the training of a cultivator.&nbsp;</p><p>He should \u2014 for her sake \u2014 force her to practice more.</p><p>Even though she was by no means bad. Her fingers flickered through each meaning filled symbol, tracing them against the door. The hands were always precise, and vastly faster than any ordinary human could move their fingers. It was just\u2026</p><p>She was slower than he\u2019d been the day he unlocked his golden core.</p><p>And something in him had gradually come to want her happiness and success greatly, perhaps more than he had ever wanted anything else.</p><p>With each stage along the magical journey, the natural human process of aging slowed, until with his profound soul unlocked, Sesako aged less than one year for every ten. Though she progressed steadily \u2014 very fast even by the standards of most \u2014 Hinte was no exceptional prodigy. It would be several years more before she had reached a point where she could safely tear open the second dantian, and awaken her nascent soul. Each year of delay now would shorten the total length of her life by a year.</p><p>There was exceedingly little chance that she would ever achieve the rare profound soul \u2014 though how it was achieved was mysterious, even to those who had succeeded in opening their third dantian, and sometimes people who had shown no particular spark in their earlier stages would mysteriously break it open, and most of the most promising prodigies became caught and capped once they had perfected their purified core.</p><p>He should still make her work harder.</p><p>But it was impossible to deny Hinete the joy she found in enchanting.</p><p>And\u2026</p><p>Sesako feared that perhaps his selfishness was harming her. Once she had a nascent soul, the proper period of their apprenticeship would be over.&nbsp;</p><p>He did not want her to leave his tower. The five years since he had taken her as his new apprentice had been oddly happy and fulfilled. They had become close in a way he simply had not with the other apprentices he had taken.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, he thought he\u2019d never been happier than during the last five years.&nbsp;</p><p>When Hinete finished the long array of finger drawn symbols, she pressed her hand against the door, and looked over to smile proudly at him.</p><p>His heart leapt.</p><p>He smiled back at her, and then with a quickly whispered incantation, the spell finished.</p><p>The door now saw Hinete as its primary owner, and it would not permit him to enter the room without her presence.</p><p>Sesako let out a long sigh. \u201cThank you. And\u2026 Hinete, should I\u2026 if I am dead and all hope is lost, promise me that you will take as much of the wealth here as you can, and flee, and go elsewhere and&nbsp;<i>live</i>. Swear to me that you\u2019ll flee rather than dying in a hopeless fight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t\u2026 you know I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t leave you.&nbsp;<i>You&nbsp;</i>mean to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI cannot abandon Her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd I cannot abandon you.\u201d Her face was set and firm. She clenched her hands and jaw, as though she were prepared to endure any sort of tongue lashing or anger or abuse, but on this point she would not budge.</p><p>Sesako sighed. \u201cHinete, please \u2014 I am not being arbitrary, nor\u2026 you&nbsp;<i>know&nbsp;</i>that you can\u2019t\u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am no great fighter. And I will not\u2026 I will not charge some brilliant brute with a purified core and a spear. Even if you die, I will not&nbsp;<i>try&nbsp;</i>to die. But I will not flee. Not even if you have died. Not while the great ones still live.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut \u2014\u201d Sesako wanted to shake her shoulders. To scream at her. \u201cPlease, I would be happier if \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with happiness. We are amongst those blessed by the dragon. We are \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t&nbsp;<i>die</i>. You don\u2019t deserve to die. You don\u2019t \u2014 and remember, everything in here is yours if I die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut your \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI have no children. I have no parents. I have no one but a second cousin who I dislike. But I\u2026\u201d He brushed his hand softly over her cheek. \u201cI care very much for you.\u201d</p><p>Her color was high.</p><p>\u201cI swear I will not risk myself without a chance of some success.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cYou will take what wealth I own. I will have no argument. And now I must go to confer with the council and the others of the seven.\u201d</p><p>She nodded. \u201cShould I continue to work on the wardings, or prepare more of the hurlers, like Fitzuki asked?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe hurlers. Fitzuki knows his business \u2014 he\u2019s more knowledge of warfare than any other ten of us together.\u201d</p><p>She nodded, and then they parted, Sesako to his work, and Hinete to hers.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter Five</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>When Sesako arrived in the vast high ceilinged room in the house of the clans where Fitzuki had established his headquarters, Fitzuki and Kisiko sat there chatting slowly.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cNot dead?\u201d Fitzuki laughed with relief when Sesako approached him and Kisiko. \u201cI\u2019d thought we\u2019d already lost one of us to a crazy nonsense leap. What were you about?\u201d</p><p>\u201cHinete had the impression that you thought I\u2019d decided to abandon us.\u201d</p><p>\u201c<i>You</i>? I know&nbsp;<i>you&nbsp;</i>too well for that. But that new apprentice of yours is a pretty creature. Nervous though \u2014 oh, I did ask her a great deal about what materials you seem to have taken with you. Confirming my hypothesis. Did it work?\u201d</p><p>Before Sesako could answer, Takue entered the room. She had been his master during his apprenticeship when he'd only had a golden core, and he had worked closely with her and Akine once he\u2019d fully developed the purple tinged purified core with the second dantian to get from their conversation hints about how he could achieve a breakthrough to a profound soul.</p><p>Takue looked at him, and for a moment Sesako could see the pure&nbsp;<i>relief&nbsp;</i>on her face. \u201cYou\u2019re still alive\u2026\u201d</p><p>Then immediately she transformed herself once more into the firm and distinguished master of the magical arts. \u201cProfound Sesako, you have been missing during a critical period of days.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI attempted a dangerous ritual to gain a power that might have saved us. However, the effort has not given me anything which might aid us tomorrow.\u201d</p><p>It seemed like a deeply shameful thing to admit that he\u2019d been possessed for several hours by a different spirit.</p><p>That buzz existed in the back of his head, growing slowly stronger, and it scared Sesako. He&nbsp;<i>would&nbsp;</i>triumph. His will had overcome that parasite once before, and it would overcome the will of the cowardly and worthless other every single time.</p><p>\u201cWanted to open the fourth dantian, eh?\u201d Fitzuki rubbed the side of his head. \u201cOught to have brought someone along to see if they could stabilize the ritual as it failed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe pattern I tried to use did not permit that.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmmm.\u201d Fitzuki clapped his hands together twice. \u201cDeuced obnoxious \u2014 thought you\u2019d die and didn\u2019t want annoying speeches of goodbye, arguments about whether the military necessity suggested the risk or staying in the circle of the towers.\u201d Fitzuki\u2019s voice rose, with a flash of anger. \u201cNext time,&nbsp;<i>tell me</i>.<i>&nbsp;</i>No matter how great you wish to be. I have been given command to organize this defense as best we might manage and I&nbsp;<i>need&nbsp;</i>to know who amongst us plans to play games.\u201d</p><p>Sesako flushed.&nbsp;</p><p>He\u2019d spent around twenty years serving under Fitzuki after he\u2019d fully developed his profound soul, in a sort of military apprenticeship now that his power had become great enough to make him an important military weapon. Fitzuki liked war and warfare, and he\u2019d been the perfect teacher in that way. He\u2019d fought endless wars helping those who fought against the emperor for free, and when there wasn\u2019t a war with the empire dripping blood and draining chi, he hired out his talents to whichever king, council of grand cultivators, or master of all that he could survey in Seidne or Eporea was willing to offer the most to gain the services of the man acknowledged by everyone, including the emperor himself, to be the greatest war leader alive.</p><p>Despite his own high position, Sesako always felt a deep respect for Fitzuki. And he was more than two hundred years younger. \u201cI shall.\u201d</p><p>It took a bit of effort for Sesako to keep his voice firm and confident.</p><p>Fitzuki clapped his hand on Sesako\u2019s shoulder, in a familiar yet commanding gesture. \u201cEffort always has its value.\u201d</p><p>Now Kisiko smiled at Sesako, \u201cI too consider myself blessed to see that thou hath not perished. But satisfy my curiosity: With what ritual did you make the attempt?\u201d</p><p>\u201cA ninth level braided circle structure,\u201d Sesako said laconically. He particularly did not want to describe the details to Kisiko.</p><p>\u201cHmmmmm.\u201d Kisiko said. \u201cI confess then to a sensation of the unexpected at seeing and hearing this good news of your undoubted survival. His great majesty, the emperor once discoursed to me upon the methods by which he was confident that others could not \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear about what that murderous bastard told you.\u201d</p><p>Kisiko shrugged and smiled. \u201cI shall respect thy wish.\u201d</p><p>While born almost six hundred years ago in a valley in the mountains of Yatamo, Kisiko had lived most of his life in the court of the emperor, and he had married one of the emperor\u2019s daughters. Even after the emperor killed one of the Great Ones during his visit that started the rebellion, Kisiko had stayed in his court, until his wife who'd aged far faster than he had died. Only after that did he return to Yatamo to offer his services as a profound soul to the nation.&nbsp;</p><p>Sesako despised him for that continued service to the emperor. And he hated that he would have to admit his own failure to Fitzuki in front of Kisiko.</p><p>\u201cI have another report to make that I must tell you.\u201d Voice didn\u2019t waver. Good.</p><p>Fitzuki\u2019s face became serious. \u201cImportant?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI am not reliable at present. When I woke from the failed ritual another spirit had control of my body. He flew back to my tower, and intended to collect as much of the wealth stored in it as possible before fleeing the country.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAh! A second spirit.\u201d Kisiko nodded with interest. \u201c<i>That&nbsp;</i>makes your tale one whose logic matches my own sense of reason and rationality. Thou ought not have made such an attempt without consulting widely upon the matter.\u201d</p><p>Simply because there was a&nbsp;<i>chance&nbsp;</i>that Kisiko had some sort of remaining loyalty to the emperor, Sesako never would have asked him.</p><p>Fitzuki lapped his hands hard. \u201cPossessed? Details.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWell I \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cHow did you regain control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen he went to leap away from the tower, planning to abandon us, betray us, and betray the Great Ones, I was full of rage. In that rage I reached at the power flowing through us, and\u2026\u201d Sesako shrugged. \u201cIt was a sort of pulling, a shoving. And then I had control once more.\u201d</p><p>\u201cHmmm. Hmmmm.\u201d Fitzuki gravely stroked his long beard. \u201cYou are not certain that you can&nbsp;<i>keep&nbsp;</i>control?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, if you think I cannot serve in the line of battle, and \u2014\u201d</p><p>\u201cNonsense. You are a vital asset. We\u2019ll find a place. And in your tower \u2014 but&nbsp;<i>damn</i>. It is the linchpin of the south. And no one else can run the enchantments you\u2019ve placed into it nearly so well. Damn. Hmmmmm.\u201d</p><p>\u201cPerhaps another of the seven?\u201d Takue suggested. \u201cAnd we shall have Akine observe you, and try to purge the other spirit. This is odd, I have never heard of anyone with any significant power being possessed.\u201d</p><p>Sesako flushed.</p><p>\u201cIt is because Profound Sesako strove beyond what was normal.\u201d Kisiko said. \u201cThat brave and ambitious man whose desire is to reach beyond the ordinary will find himself in such a place and in such a situation where that which is not ordinary occurs.\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo,\u201d Fitzuki said. \u201cWe\u2019ll staff the other towers next to you with twice the group \u2014 Sesako, my dear Sesako.\u201d He pressed his hand against his forehead. \u201cYou had some sense that this might work?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYes, though I expected to die.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYeah. Still the odds are so bad against us, that any risk may have been worth taking.\u201d He pulled his hand through his hair. \u201cStill.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt is odd. The vibrations in your soul ought to have driven this possessing spirit off,\u201d Takue crossed her legs under her and started levitating at eye level to the taller cultivators around her.</p><p>\u201cSo this \u2018other\u2019, this second mind, planned to take everything you own, and live as high upon your accumulated wealth as a great cultivator can \u2014 probably somewhere in Parleia?\u201d Kisiko asked.</p><p>\u201cIs that what you would do?\u201d Came Sesako\u2019s snapped reply.</p><p>\u201cI certainly would not maintain myself in a line to die in a war which had nothing to do with me.Thou are a fool to expect that he would. Life is filled with far too much entertainment for it to be thrown away lightly \u2014 but as each of you can see, I am present. I will fight for the Great Ones also.\u201d</p><p>Sesako stared at him. He still had a small suspicion that one day Kisiko would betray them. \u201cNo,\u201d Sesako said at last. \u201cHis actual plan was to try to figure out the best way to help the peasants in Diet Vinh.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe spirit originated in Diet Vinh?\u201d</p><p>\u201cNo, he chose that simply because they seem to be the poorest peasants.\u201d</p><p>Fitzuki laughed. \u201cI suppose if you want to help peasants it makes sense to pick the poorest ones.\u201d</p><p>Sesako grunted. \u201cIt's all pointless anyways. Trying to help them \u2014 the world is organized in such a way that there will always be poor people. If you can\u2019t figure out a way to change the very nature of reality, giving money to the poor is simply pouring a flood of water into an endless desert.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThis fellow got to you a bit?\u201d Fitzuki grinned at him.</p><p>\u201cMy duty is to myself, those who I love, and my nation \u2014 I fulfill my duty, he is a worthless thief who has no right to judge me for not doing something stupid and pointless.\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo you think he should focus on trying to change how the world is organized, so that there are fewer poor people, rather than trying to directly give starving peasants food?\u201d Fitzuki\u2019s voice was sardonic and laughing.</p><p>\u201cThat is not what I said \u2014\u201d</p><p>Kisiko said, \u201cIt certainly is not impossible to make things so that they are better or worse \u2014 Behold: Yatamo is a blessed land where the life of the peasant simply is better than in Diet Vinh, or Paralei. If a man could change those sadly managed nations, or if they could make those whose leadership are honorable and capable be ruled yet better, they would be doing something worthwhile and permanent.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI agree,\u201d Fitzuki said, \u201cI never&nbsp;<i>simply&nbsp;</i>fought for the group who paid me the most money. I always wanted to have a sense that I was on a side which I would honestly prefer to win.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhy are you defending a thief,\u201d Takue said. \u201cBesides, there are already too many people in the world, and especially too many peasants. Simply over the three hundred years I\u2019ve lived, I\u2019ve seen the expansion of farmlands, terracing and the use of deeper plows. Marshes drained, forests cut down, and places full of animals destroyed. I do not wish to help feed them, not unless we can control their numbers. Otherwise the world itself will slowly become a worse place.\u201d</p><p>With a groan Kisiko pretended to flop backwards in a chair that was not there, and he levitated himself so that he looked down on Takue. \u201cPeasants are as worthy of concern as any with an awakened spark. The life of one who tills the ground, his joys, his loves, his children \u2014 that humble life is worth the same as your life. I say unto thee: To live, to be a human, that is a grand and a wonderful thing.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI know that village where you were born. It was the boundary of cultivation then, and now all the way up the mountain side the trees are destroyed, or turned into ordered and sparse forests for fuel and building material \u2014 that is what too many people bring. If I could have my way, we\u2019d keep the population of peasants at a reasonable number.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd this is why&nbsp;<i>I&nbsp;</i>am glad thy way is unlikely to ever rule the fates of men.\u201d Kisiko replied.</p><p>\u201cEnough of this,\u201d Fitzuki said sharply. \u201cSesako, can you hold the tower tomorrow despite your new friend?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI despise him. But I can hold the tower. His will is weaker than mine, and I shall remain in control.\u201d</p><p>\u201cTetchy, eh?\u201d Fitzuki laughed. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you why you dislike this fellow. You are scared that he is right and you&nbsp;<i>ought&nbsp;</i>to be doing something that you just don\u2019t want to, and you don\u2019t like the idea of feeling as though you aren\u2019t perfect.\u201d Fitzuki shrugged his shoulders. \u201cHold the tower, but tell that pretty apprentice to immediately send a message if you disappear, so that a team can quickly be sent to replace you, and manage what can be managed.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe tower is prepared for battle. I always keep it prepared for battle. As a great warrior told me once, a good warrior prepares before the battle, a great warrior rests, because he has already prepared.\u201d</p><p>Fitzuki laughed. \u201cQuoting me back to me. No, we have not informed the Great One of the situation. It was decided it ought to be you who speaks to Her.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOh.\u201d There was that pang in Sesako\u2019s breast. That pain in his stomach. There was no path to victory.</p><p>Everything else was swallowed by this simple fact.</p><p>Even by sacrificing his own life, and all that he might ever be, Sesako could see no path to victory.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "timunderwood"}}, {"_id": "xvsmRLS998PpHffHE", "title": "Concerns with Longtermism", "postedAt": "2022-09-16T05:37:34.409Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I am fairly new to EA, but as I read <i>What We Owe the Future </i>and related topics, the issues here strongly impress themselves on me. I welcome feedback, whether you can clarify why I am wrong, or offer support.</p><p><strong>Discounting future good</strong><br>MacAskill says (p. 11) \"I am not claiming that the interests of present and future people should always and everywhere be given equal weight.\" However, he does not so far as I know talk about a discount rate for future good versus present good, even though economics clearly does discuss this.</p><p>Imagine that I can donate to save a life today for $4000. And imagine that I can invest that $4000 and earn 2% (for example) above the rate of inflation. Then in 35 years, I would have $8000, and could save two lives. If those future lives are worth the same as the life today, then of course I should never save a life today, but invest to save twice as many lives 35 years from now. But by the same logic, I shouldn't save lives then, but keep investing. This leads to the absurd conclusion that I should never donate to save lives, as I could always do more good in the future.</p><p>The logical conclusion is that I should discount future good I might do by at least the real rate of investment return. I should value saving a life today twice as much as saving a life in 35 years, assuming my 2% figure.</p><p><strong>Uncertainty</strong><br>There is another way in which good I plan to do in or for the future should logically be discounted. Assume I know a charity which has a proven track record of saving a life for $4000. I can have a high degree of confidence that my contribution of $4000 will save very close to one life. But instead, I decide to invest my money to save two lives in 35 years. There is no certainty that I can confidently save two lives with my $8000 35 years from now. Opportunities might be better or worse. But uncertainty is not as valuable as certainty when trying to do good.</p><p>This is especially true if I am taking an action (say, donating $4000) today in a way I believe will save two lives in 35 years. The organization to which I donated might collapse, or the problem they are addressing might become harder to solve, or wars might break out rendering them incapable of saving those lives. So even more strongly, the further in the future I am trying to do good by an action now, the less confident I can be that my planned outcome will be successful.</p><p>Imagine a philanthropist 140 years ago planning to make the world better in 2022. In the year 1882, she might decide that cleaning up manure from horse-drawn wagons in city streets would make life vastly better. She has no way of anticipating two world wars, automobiles, airplanes, telephones, computers, the Internet, or many other changes in the world that lead the problems of our time to be very different, or at least need different tools, than the problems she sees as most critical. I think we greatly over-rate our ability to see what the future looks like. Simply read any 50-year predictions from the past and you will see this. As a result, I would suggest that an appropriate discount factor should be applied for uncertainty in the future as well.</p><p><strong>Implications for longtermism</strong><br>Let us assume that I am able to make an intervention of some kind that has a certain benefit, say adds one QALY to some individual, every year from now on as long as people are around. How does my impact change depending on how much longer humanity survives?</p><p>Using just my conservative discount rate of 2%, my intervention this year is worth 1 QALY, when the result for next year adds .98 to make 1.98 QALYs. The third year adds .9604, making 2.9404 QALYs. On year 194, I surpass 49 QALYs. But no matter how far in the future I go, I will never surpass 50 QALYs.</p><p>This simple and practical perspective says to me that while the future is absolutely important to attend to, especially the near future, there is no benefit whatsoever in trying to analyze a good for more than 200 years. In fact, because of uncertainty, it appears to be overoptimistic to assume my actions today can have meaningful impact even at this timeframe.</p><p><strong>Climate Change</strong><br>In the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions document \"Discounting the Benefits of Climate Change Mitigation: How Much Do Uncertain Rates Increase Valuations?\" it is said, \"Underlying existing climate change models is a specific set of assumptions regarding emissions levels, economic growth and flexibility, technological innovation, climate change policies, and the magnitude of climate change damages. Though this set of assumptions varies from model to model, each includes a discount rate, which is used to compare costs and benefits over time. The discount rate tells us how high future benefits need to be to justify spending a dollar today. While there is considerable debate regarding the appropriate discount rate to apply to any cost-benefit analysis conducted across generations, most climate models choose one rate (2-7 percent is a common range) and hold it constant over the time horizon of the model.\" (https://www.c2es.org/document/discounting-the-benefits-of-climate-change-mitigation-how-much-do-uncertain-rates-increase-valuations/#:~:text=While%20there%20is%20considerable%20debate,time%20horizon%20of%20the%20model.) &nbsp;</p><p>Uncertainty is also the reason that while the effects of climate change will be much greater in the 22nd century than they are in this century, analyses almost all only go out to the year 2100.</p><p>The topic of discount rates for climate change is widely discussed, for example in \"The Choice of Discount Rate for Climate Change Policy Evaluation\" (https://media.rff.org/documents/RFF-DP-12-43.pdf) by Lawrence H. Goulder and Roberton C. Williams III.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>My point in the Climate Change example is simply to show that this discounting approach is mainstream and worthy of being considered. Based on any reasonable discount rate, it would appear to me that there is no meaningful way in which considering the good we might accomplish for any time more than 200 years in the future (and realistically, any time more than 100 years in the future) can be meaningful as a basis of making moral decisions.</p>", "user": {"username": "Wahhab Baldwin"}}, {"_id": "5Xio8uECTH3GqYARc", "title": "We\u2019re still (extremely) funding constrained (but don\u2019t let fear of getting funding stop you trying).", "postedAt": "2022-09-16T04:43:21.579Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Lots has been written about this so I wrote a poem instead along with my thoughts and related links at the bottom.

It has been one of the most important growth factors for people like Benjamin Franklin, Ray Dalio, Charlie Munger and Confucius. This way of living is very systematic and has some simple guidelines we can follow.</p><p>We all make decisions by principles - they are our values, biases, habits, methods, mental models; or what we define them as \u201cways of doing\u201d, \u201cways of thinking\u201d, and \u201cways of how to see the world\u201d. When we do not pay attention to the principles we use, we tend to have a hard time distinguishing their impact, and live our life following our old habits and grow slowly. The principles-driven way of growth asks us to be mindful of the principles we use, be intentional about their effects, and be active in iterating and adopting better principles.</p><h1><strong>Curriculum</strong></h1><p>The 3-week Bootcamp will include:</p><ul><li><strong>Training for skills &amp; habits for Principled Living</strong>: Workshops to walk you through the process of and give you a lot of ways and tools to explore on the topic of finding, concluding, iterating, validating and acting on principles.</li><li><strong>Social Accountability + Coaching</strong>: Weekly 1 hour mentor guided&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.notion.so/b05a99a941c34c89bb9b97b68ee96de5\">mastermind group</a>&nbsp;meeting with a team of 3~6 members around helping you live principled life.

For example, in the 2019 <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/eas2019-community-demographics-characteristics\">EA Survey</a>, 86% of Effective Altruists reported being atheist, agnostic, or non-religious. On Facebook, the Effective Altruism group has 21,800 members, whereas the three main religiously-inclined EA groups that I could find (Christians and Effective Altruism, Buddhists in Effective Altruism, Spirituality and Effective Altruism) only have 1,700 members in total. And, out of thousands of posts on EA Forum, less than a dozen include the words \u2018religion\u2019 or \u2018religious\u2019.</p><p>Thus, when we think about aligning AI and human values, we tend to ignore religion entirely, or we discount it as irrelevant, regressive, irrational, retarded, and/or ridiculous. When we envision glorious futures, with our transhumanist descendants or self-replicating superintelligent drones pursuing galactic colonization, we typically don\u2019t think of those futures as including religion at all. We imagine, at most, that future people might preserve some religious traditions as quaint cultural vestiges, or cautionary tales from a less rational era. We don\u2019t take seriously the idea that helping more people enjoying infinite bliss in heaven after they die should be a major cause area. Conversely, when we envision existential risks and global catastrophes, we don\u2019t typically think about people burning in hell forever, or being reincarnated as an insect in a world of wild animal suffering, or being stuck in Sa\u1e43s\u0101ra, the endless cycle of suffering. Our concepts of collective human success or failure are highly secularized. Within that secular context, a highly aligned Superintelligence seems like the best redemptive savior we could realistically hope for, and perhaps the only path towards maximizing total future sentient well-being.</p><p>However, most current humans are religious. Religion has been important throughout human history and probably prehistory. There are pretty good evolutionary psychology theories about the origins and adaptive functions of religions in human groups, as group coordination mechanisms, costly commitment signals of tribal loyalty, sources of mating and reproductive norms, and repositories of miscellaneous life advice, such as taboos against eating foods with high parasite risk, or against reproducing with one\u2019s first cousins.&nbsp;</p><p>So, AI alignment research is focused on promoting alignment between the AI systems that we design and train, and our human goals, values, preferences, and norms. And we know that for most humans, their religions are closely associated with their goals, values, preferences, and norms. Thus, if we take the standard definition of AI alignment research at face value \u2013 as achieving alignment with human values \u2013 a lot of it must concern alignment with religious values.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The continuing popularity of religions</strong></p><p>If you don\u2019t think this is a serious issue, let\u2019s consider the popularity of religions today.&nbsp;</p><p>Many AI researchers and Effective Altruists live in relatively secular countries such as the US, UK, Australia, Canada, and Germany, where religion has relatively limited and declining influence over politics, academia, media, and public discourse. (For example, about <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/eas2020-geography\">69%</a> of the respondents to the 2020 EA Survey lived in these 5 countries, and very few EAs came from countries with high religiosity.) Also, whereas a high proportion of charitable donations globally go to religious charities, EAs typically donate very little money to religious charities, which they usually regard as theoretically incoherent and empirically unsupported.</p><p>However, out of the 8,000 million living humans, <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/religion-by-country\">surveys</a> indicate that about 2,380 million are Christian, 1,810 million are Muslim, 1,160 million are Hindu, and 507 million are Buddhist. Together, these \u2018big four\u2019 religions include about 5,857 million humans, or 73% of our species. Another 500-1,000 million people (it\u2019s hard to count) follow various \u2018folk religions\u2019 (including Shinto, Taoism, African tribal religions, etc.) and/or are influenced by various quasi-religious belief systems such as Confucianism. People who identify as \u2018unaffiliated\u2019 with any religion (including atheists and agnostics) seem to number no more than 1,200 million, or about 15% of humanity.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way to look at human religion is by country. Of the 14 major countries with populations above 100 million, only 2 (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_China\">China</a>, population 1,430 million and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Japan\">Japan</a>, population 124 million) have a majority that are not actively involved in organized religion. Consider the other 12 countries in descending order of population, with just the big four religions considered:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_India\">India</a>: 1,420 million people, 80% Hindu, 14% Muslim&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_States\">USA</a>: 338 million people, 65% Christian</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Indonesia\">Indonesia</a>: 276 million people, 87% Muslim</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Pakistan\">Pakistan</a>: 236 million people, 96% Muslim</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Nigeria\">Nigeria</a>: 219 million people, 46% Christian, 46% Muslim</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Brazil\">Brazil</a>: 215 million people, 81% Christian</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Bangladesh\">Bangladesh</a>: 171 million people, 91% Muslim</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Russia\">Russia</a>: 144 million people, 47% Christian, 7% Muslim</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Mexico\">Mexico</a>: 127 million people, 90% Christian</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Ethiopia\">Ethiopia</a>: 123 million people, 67% Christian, 31% Muslim</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_Philippines\">Philippines</a>: 116 million people, 88% Christian</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Egypt\">Egypt</a>: 111 million people, 90% Muslim, 10% Christian</li></ul><p>Together, these 14 most populous countries include 5,050 million people, or 63% of all living humans. Note that in 8 of the 14 countries, more than 80% of people belong to just one of the four major religions.</p><p>Overall, over 80% of living humans are religious to some degree \u2013 and often to a very considerable degree. Religious people often believe that their most important goals, values, preferences, and norms are dictated by God(s), revealed by prophets, derived from their religion, and are crucial to their long-termist well-being after death (whether in a Christian or Muslim afterlife, a Hindu reincarnation, or a Buddhist liberation from reincarnation).&nbsp;</p><p>Can we achieve AI alignment with humans and human values when over 80% of humans are religious, and when their most important values are closely associated with their religion? I don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s think about it a bit more.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Will religion wither away before AI alignment becomes a big issue?</strong></p><p>Elite intellectuals have been predicting that religion with wither away ever since the 16<sup>th</sup> century Scientific Revolution, the 17<sup>th</sup> century Enlightenment, the 18<sup>th</sup> century Industrial Revolution, 19<sup>th</sup> century socialism, and 20<sup>th</sup> century consumerism. Yet here we still are, 80% religious.</p><p>Many AI researchers and Effective Altruists live in countries such as the US, UK, and Australia where religiosity is quickly declining, and where younger cohorts show rapidly increasing atheism and agnosticism, with political activism on social media replacing organized religion as the key domain of young adult virtue-signaling. For example, in the US in <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/245453/religious-affiliation-in-the-united-states-by-age/\">2017</a>, only 12% of people over age 65 were religiously unaffiliated, whereas 38% of people aged 18-29 were religiously unaffiliated \u2013 a huge generational increase in atheism. This might give the impression that religion is in a general global decline as a human instinct and institution.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this decrease in religiosity is happening mostly in rich countries with low and declining birthrates. In countries with high birthrates, religiosity remains high. Given that religious people are having more kids, and religious countries are having more kids, and religiosity is both genetically heritable and culturally transmitted, religiosity may hold steady or even increase at the global population level. For example, Nigeria is about 92% religious (46% Christian, 46% Muslim), and its population is <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1122955/forecast-population-in-nigeria/\">expected</a> to increase from 219 million in 2022 to 329 million in 2040 and 401 million in 2050. If Nigerian religiosity remains steady at 92%, that\u2019s another 167 million religious people within the next 30 years, just in one country.&nbsp;</p><p>On a longer timescale, by 2100, 8 of the 10 most countries that are <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/10/for-world-population-day-a-look-at-the-countries-with-the-biggest-projected-gains-and-losses-by-2100/\">projected</a> to have the highest populations are ones that currently have very high religiosity, including India (1,450 million people expected by 2100), Nigeria (733 million), Pakistan (403 million), D.R. Congo (362 million), Indonesia (321 million), Ethiopia (294 million), Tanzania (286 million), and Egypt (225 million). Together, these countries will account for at least an extra 1,500 million people (compared to their current populations), and if they remain at least 80% religious, they\u2019ll add an extra 1,200 million religious people in the world by 2100. For religion to suffer a net decrease in popularity, the other countries would have to add an extra 1,200 million atheists \u2013 which seems unlikely, given their declining populations.&nbsp;</p><p>Effective Altruists often seem to assume that religion will decline in poorer, higher-fertility countries as they enjoy better nutrition, health care (anti-malaria bednets, deworming, etc), nootropics, and embryo selection methods to increase average intelligence and openness. In other words, the expectation is that cognitive and moral enhancement will gradually turn more people into atheists \u2013 even if religious people are currently out-breeding atheists. Maybe that will happen, over a multi-decade or multi-generational time scale. But these interventions seems unlikely to have a major effect on religiosity before AI alignment becomes a major issue, given current <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/2022-expert-survey-on-progress-in-ai/\">projections</a> by AI researchers about the likely AGI timelines. In summary, most humans will probably still be religious if AGI is developed any time in the next century.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Common ground between Effective Altruists and religious people</strong></p><p>The likely persistence of human religion may seem alarming or depressing to EA atheists and AI safety researchers. What do we rationalists have in common with religious people? How could they even participate constructively in a dialogue about AI alignment?</p><p>I see at least three major kinds of common ground: moral circle expansion, longtermism, and the Simulation Hypothesis.</p><p>Moral circle expansion. Effective Altruists ever since Peter Singer have sought to expand our moral circle, pushing human instincts for altruism beyond their ancestral limits (self, family, and tribe) to include more humans and other animal species. Most major religions have also preached some form of moral circle expansion, nudging their believers to be nicer not just to people in the same family and tribe, but to everyone who shares the same faith. Often, religions even preach tolerance and altruism towards non-believers, and some degree of concern for other animals (e.g. Hindu and Buddhist veganism). Of course, religious altruism is much more based on deontology and virtue-signaling than on consequentialism, and tends to be far less evidence-based than EA charity evaluation. But religions on average tend to preach altruism over selfishness, and a more inclusive version of tribalism over a less inclusive version.</p><p>Longtermism. Many Effective Altruists have shifted from emphasizing shorter-term goals such as global public health and poverty reduction, to longer-term goals such as reducing existential risks and promoting sentient flourishing in future millennia. Longtermism is the new enthusiasm. But all the major religions have been longtermist for at least a millennium. They just have a different model of the world, where the \u2018long term\u2019 typically includes an extremely long afterlife. For example, Christianity and Islam teach that devout believers will enjoy an eternal heaven in the afterlife, and non-believers will suffer eternal torment (or at least a lamentable alienation from God) in hell. Hinduism teaches that people reincarnate in higher or lower sentient forms according to the karma accumulated in each life; this happens thousands and thousands of times, at a time scale that can be measured in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpa_(time)\">kalpas</a> (units of 4.32 billion years). Buddhism also emphasizes reincarnation, teaching that it may take many cycles of birth and death (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83s%C4%81ra_(Buddhism)\">sa\u1e43s\u0101ra</a>) before a sentient being escapes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Du%E1%B8%A5kha\">du\u1e25kha</a> (suffering) and achieves <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nirvana_(Buddhism)\">nirvana</a>. Religions also generally nudge people to avoid short-term temptations, bad habits, impulsive aggression, and runaway consumerism, and to think about the longer-term consequences of their actions, both in this life and the afterlife.</p><p>Simulation Hypothesis. Many Effective Altruists believe in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis\">Simulation Hypothesis</a>, that we are living in some sort of simulated reality, such as highly advanced computer simulation, virtual reality, or Matrix, that was created by much more advanced forms of sentient life. All major religions agree with this. They just have a pre-computational understanding of how such a simulation works, and of what kind of entities are running it. What we call simulators or programmers, they would call Gods. For example, in Hinduism, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_(religion)\">m\u0101y\u0101</a> refers to the veil of illusion or the tempting magic show that humans perceive as their everyday lives. In Christian theology, our visible, temporal world is a relatively illusory and transient show created by a more substantial and eternal God. Most religions view our lived experiences as somewhat shallow, deceptive, and fleeting compared to an eternal, transcendent realm where immortals live. If you think the Simulation Hypothesis seems likely, but the traditional religions are idiotic, then either you don\u2019t understand the Simulation Hypothesis in a sufficiently humble way, or you don\u2019t understand traditional religions in a sufficiently humble way.</p><p>Of course, to skeptics outside Effective Altruism, our interests in moral circle expansion, longtermism, and the Simulation Hypothesis strike them as quite religious, cult-like, and faith-based. If outsiders think that EA has something pretty deep in common with major religions, maybe we can accept some of those commonalities ourselves, and hold religions is a little less contempt than we\u2019re used to doing?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Distinctive problems that religion raises for AI alignment</strong></p><p>If we take seriously the fact that (1) over 80% of humans are religious, and (2) many human values are closely associated with religions, and (3) AI alignment is supposed to be about aligning human values with AI systems, then where does that leave us? How should we be thinking differently about AI alignment?</p><p>I don\u2019t know. This essay is a preliminary attempt to raise the issue. I look forward to your thoughts and feedback. I don\u2019t have many concrete suggestions so far.</p><p>However, as a preliminary exercise, I can note a few distinctive problems that religion seems to raise for AI alignment. (There might be dozens of other problems that you can suggest.)</p><p>1. AI systems look intrinsically sacrilegious, outrageous, and hubristic to many religious people, and the more powerful the AI system gets, the more outrageous it might seem. All four main religions teach that humans have distinctive kinds of souls that survive our bodily death. Creating systems that show human-level intelligence, but that are soulless, faithless, and atheistic, may seem evil to many religious people. As AI systems grow more advanced, more capable, and more intrusive in our everyday lives, religious leaders will notice, and judge. And some will condemn. The Pope, Cardinals, and Catholic priests will have views on AI. Muslim Imams, Alims, Allamahs, Grand Muftis, Mujtahids, and Ayatollahs will have views on AI. Hindu and Buddhist priests, scholars, and gurus will have views on AI. Those views might be positive, but they might be very negative, or even aggressive.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider the traditional Muslim views on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aniconism_in_Islam\">idolatry</a>, which prohibit depictions, sculptures, or simulacra of sentient beings \u2013 especially humans. If Muslim leaders decide that creating AI systems or anthropomorphic robots is sacrilegious, the <a href=\"https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Butlerian_Jihad\">Butlerian Jihad</a> might become an actual Jihad, and AI researchers might be condemned by serious <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatwa\">fatwas</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Cultural conflicts between religions may create AI safety risks just as serious as geopolitical conflict between nation-states. Historically, religious conflicts have accounted for a high proportion of organized warfare. Even in the last century, a lot of conflict and tension between nation-states has some degree of religious conflict behind it (consider mostly-Hindu India versus mostly-Muslim Pakistan, mostly-Sunni Saudi Arabia versus mostly-Shia Iran, or the Cold War between mostly-Christian USA and mostly-atheist Soviet Union).&nbsp;</p><p>Every major religion proclaims itself the one true religion, whereas no nation-state proclaims itself the \u2018one true nation-state\u2019. Nation-states can play positive-sum games with each based on exchanging resources, products, ideas, traditions, tourists, and talent. Religions seem locked into a more zero-sum competitive situation. Nation-states might find enough common ground that they can avoid AI arms races that sacrifice safety for speed of progress. If religions realize that AI can play powerful roles in recruiting new members, enforcing doctrine, surveilling believers, identifying heretics and apostates, and undermining rival religions, we might face a religious AI arms race just as dangerous as a geopolitical AI arms race.&nbsp;</p><p>Nation-states have a lot of resources they can devote to AI development, but so do organized religions. And many nation-states are highly aligned with particular religions \u2013 e.g. the 13 countries that are officially Christian, and the 26 countries that are officially Muslim. (If you\u2019ve played the <a href=\"https://civilization.fandom.com/wiki/Victory_(Civ6)\">Civilization VI</a> computer game, consider that there\u2019s a \u2018Religious Victory\u2019 condition in addition to the Domination, Diplomacy, Science, and Cultural victory conditions.)</p><p>3. Religious values might be harder to align with AI systems than other kinds of values. For example, when AI researchers talk about teaching AI systems to incorporate human values, the most common examples seem to be (1) super-high-stakes preferences for life over death (e.g. \u2018Please don\u2019t kill me or exterminate all of humanity just to make some paperclips or collect some stamps\u2019), (2) low-stakes preferences for certain consumer goods and services (e.g. \u2018Please deliver pineapple pizza in an hour\u2019, or \u2018Please drive me to the airport without breaking the speed limit\u2019), or (3) low-stakes preferences to avoid inconveniences (e.g. \u2018Please don\u2019t knock over that vase while making tea\u2019).&nbsp;</p><p>However, many religions teach that believers should pursue ascetic or transcendental values that don\u2019t map very well onto life-or-death, consumer, of convenience preferences. For example, Buddhism teaches a doctrine of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonattachment_(philosophy)\">nonattachment</a>, which is basically a meta-preference not to have strong preferences, and not to take one\u2019s preferences too seriously. If an AI system asked a seriously devout Buddhist to teach it their preferences, the devout Buddhist might shrug, and say \u2018Help me to escape from sa\u1e43s\u0101ra and the whole illusion that preferences matter. Oh and maybe remind me in an hour to meditate.\u2019</p><p>For the billions of believers who take seriously the idea of the afterlife or reincarnation (i.e. every member of the four major religions who\u2019s actually devout), the idea that an AI system could incorporate their true preferences and payoff functions is metaphysically impossible, because they\u2019re no feedback or reward signal from beyond the grave. Christian and Muslims want to go to heaven, and if they\u2019re extremely devout, that\u2019s all that matters. There\u2019s nothing that an AI system can do for them in this life that matters even a trillionth as much as getting an eternal reward in heaven. Getting into heaven is the reward signal that they would want the AI to learn, and to help them achieve \u2013 but how will the AI learn where their souls go after death? Where exactly do AI researchers get that training data?</p><p>Can AI engineers invent some clever new \u2018collaborative inverse reinforcement learning algorithm\u2019 or \u2018coherent extrapolated transcendental volition algorithm\u2019 (or whatever) to train an AI that can help a devout Christian or Muslim get into heaven? &nbsp;Can the algorithm train an AI system to help a devout Hindu accumulate enough karma to be reincarnated as a Brahmin, swami, or guru? Can it train an AI system to help a devout Buddhist achieve nirvana?&nbsp;</p><p>These are the human values that religious people would want the AI to align with. If we can\u2019t develop AI systems that are aligned with these values, we haven\u2019t solved the AI alignment problem. &nbsp;</p><p>We could keep ignoring religion, and push on with AI alignment work as if all humans are atheists with atheist values. But then we\u2019d be ignoring more than 80% of humanity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Caveats and notes:</strong></p><ul><li>I\u2019m a Darwinian atheist with only a superficial understanding of religion; I just know some religious friends and family members, and think we should take religion seriously as a human phenomenon.&nbsp;</li><li>I\u2019m no more than 70% confident about any argument I\u2019m making here, and my facts, figures, definitions, and claims could probably be improved in many ways.</li><li>I\u2019m studied human nature since the late 1980s, and I did lots of machine learning research with neural networks in the early 1990s, but I\u2019ve only thought seriously about AI alignment for 5 years, and I\u2019ve only been writing publicly about it for a few weeks, so my understanding of the AI alignment literature is limited.</li><li>Even if everything I say here is true (e.g. that AI alignment with the most important religious values might be impossible), I still think we should invest a huge amount of talent, time, thought, energy, and money into research on AI alignment with people\u2019s secular values.</li><li>These ideas are fairly half-baked, and I welcome any constructive criticism, elaboration, and feedback.</li></ul>", "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "LNdTHkfwJ23seFKyD", "title": "Cryptocurrency Exploits Show the Importance of Proactive Policies for AI X-Risk", "postedAt": "2022-09-16T04:44:06.488Z", "htmlBody": "<p>When technology takes a leap in innovation, such as with cryptocurrency, existing institutions are forced to play catch-up with education and regulations.</p>\n<p>Cryptocurrency and Web3 enable improved privacy, censorship resistance, fewer intermediaries and data ownership. Unfortunately, an increase in privacy and a decrease in censorship make cryptocurrency and Web3 attractive ecosystems for malicious actors. Cryptocurrency has made it easier to profit from activities that create suffering (human trafficking, child abuse materials, terrorist financing) by making money laundering more accessible. Additionally, cryptocurrency has made sanctions less effective, allowing certain nation states to effectively avoid sanctions by leveraging the anonymity cryptocurrency provides.</p>\n<p>The technology comes first, the regulations come second. Because of the lack of regulations and institutional understanding surrounding cryptocurrency, criminals are turning away from traditional banking systems and into crypto ecosystems. To prevent S- and X-Risks arising from new technology, institutions cannot rely on reactivity, but must anticipate what new technologies are possible, the risks of those technologies, and the types of regulations that can proactively mitigate those risks without sacrificing too much individual freedom.</p>\n<p>One lesson that can be learned from observing the emergence of cryptocurrency is that when there are no regulations promoting safety, innovators in technology will make mistakes that can give enormous power to malicious actors, as was seen in the Lazarus (DPRK) Heists that have totaled ~$1.75 Billion<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-1\" id=\"fnref-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-1\">[1]</a></sup>. The world has witnessed Lazarus (a Cybercrime group run by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) quickly learn the cryptocurrency ecosystems and successfully identify opportunities for exploitation. Lazarus has found success in socially engineering<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-2\" id=\"fnref-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-2\">[2]</a></sup> attacks on bridges<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-3\" id=\"fnref-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-3\">[3]</a></sup>, which connect different parts of the cryptocurrency and Web3 ecosystems. Lazarus did not have to be so technologically advanced as to invent cryptocurrency; they only needed to learn enough to be able to find and exploit its vulnerabilities. We must closely observe the response of totalitarian states to technological advancements to anticipate their future responses when the stakes might be considerably higher.</p>\n<p>Observing malicious actors in cryptocurrency can provide insights for the importance of proactive policy in helping emerging technology be resistant to exploits. For example, even if we can build extremely safe Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a totalitarian state or terrorist group would only need to find a single vulnerability to weaponize the technology. We cannot merely build AGI safely; it must also be sufficiently difficult to alter or re-educate the AGI. Therefore, technological innovators should be incentivized to seriously consider exploitation vulnerabilities, especially when the technology touches sources of power, such as money, weapons or infrastructure. Paying attention to how illicit actors manipulate emerging technology for their own gain will be crucial to sufficiently mitigate the S- and X-Risks of future technology.</p>\n<p>Currently, institutions are behind on understanding how emerging technology can be used for malicious activity. This is evident when looking at cryptocurrency and the recent OFAC Sanction of Tornado Cash<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-4\" id=\"fnref-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-4\">[4]</a></sup>. OFAC Sanctions come from the United States Department of Treasury and prohibit anyone in the United States from interacting with the sanctioned entity. The sanction on Tornado Cash is confusing at best, sanctioning just one part of the protocol in one ecosystem. Although Tornado Cash has certainly been utilized by many criminals, including Lazarus (DPRK), the illegality is in the theft and laundering of the crypto, not in the code (Tornado Cash) that was used to accomplish part of the laundering.</p>\n<p>Regulations could be made to force privacy services (mixers, chain hoppers, coin swappers) to have KYC (Know Your Customer requirements) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering requirements) similar to the requirements of Money Service Businesses<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-5\" id=\"fnref-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-5\">[5]</a></sup>. However, at the moment, the standards and regulations for on-chain services are not well defined, making it difficult to see how Tornado Cash, as a smart contract, is an illicit actor. Additionally, the focus on Tornado Cash seems arbitrary, with Lazarus (DPRK) repeatedly using a cryptocurrency ecosystem hopping service called RenVM, as well as swapping services, such as Uniswap, when laundering their stolen funds after a heist. Yet, neither RenVM nor Uniswap have been subject to sanctions.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995190/mirroredImages/LNdTHkfwJ23seFKyD/n10ipc0xttcxwje5kl66.png\" alt=\"\">\nSimplified view of one series of techniques Lazarus used to launder ~$600M from the Ronin Bridge Heist</p>\n<p>It is unclear why the Department of Treasury only sanctioned one contract belonging to Tornado Cash, and why Tornado Cash was the only privacy service sanctioned. The Tornado Cash sanction can be related to attempting to take a stand against gun violence by banning one model of one type of gun, and not the entire gun at that, just the trigger. The Tornado Cash sanction shows that institutions are being reactive to the new risks emerging technology poses to society, and that in those reactions there is a perceived lack of understanding of the underlying technology.</p>\n<p>There is currently a lawsuit that aims to remove Tornado Cash from the OFAC sanction list<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-6\" id=\"fnref-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-6\">[6]</a></sup>, and this lawsuit could set a legal precedent that could undermine future regulations. If we are to control and mitigate the risks of emerging technology, we must be careful with our legal action to not put ourselves in a position where all programming is free speech, therefore making it more difficult to regulate the programming of emerging technology such as AGI.</p>\n<p>Cryptocurrency policy and regulations show how institutions currently are reactive rather than proactive in addressing major threats caused by advancing technology. Cryptocurrency and Web3 are the future, and there will be no stopping the adoption of this technology, just like there will be no stopping advancements in AI. Therefore, institutions must quickly become educated in emerging technology and attempt to predict both future innovations and their possible exploits if they want the best chance at mitigating S- and X-Risk.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Brewster, Thomas. \u201cNorth Korean Hackers Accused of 'Biggest Cryptocurrency Theft of 2020'-Their Heists Are Now Worth $1.75 Billion.\u201d Forbes, Forbes Magazine, 10 Feb. 2021, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/02/09/north-korean-hackers-accused-of-biggest-cryptocurrency-theft-of-2020-their-heists-are-now-worth-175-billion/?sh=3b1236d85b0b\">https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/02/09/north-korean-hackers-accused-of-biggest-cryptocurrency-theft-of-2020-their-heists-are-now-worth-175-billion/?sh=3b1236d85b0b</a>. <a href=\"#fnref-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Lakshmanan, Ravie. \u201cHackers Used Fake Job Offer to Hack and Steal $540 Million from Axie Infinity.\u201d The Hacker News, 11 July 2022, <a href=\"https://thehackernews.com/2022/07/hackers-used-fake-job-offer-to-hack-and.html\">thehackernews.com/2022/07/hackers-used-fake-job-offer-to-hack-and.html</a>. <a href=\"#fnref-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-7Q49ZeMCYNWqDyazW-3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Ryan Browne, MacKenzie Sigalos. \u201cHackers Have Stolen $1.4 Billion This Year Using Crypto Bridges.

The timeframe of predictions that are so far out means that only a tiny fraction of people making those kinds of predictions today have a track record so, if we want to evaluate which predictions are plausible, we need to look at something other than track record.</p><p>The idea behind the approach of this post was to look at predictions from an independently chosen set of predictors (Wikipedia's list of well-known futurists<a href=\"https://danluu.com/futurist-predictions/#fn:W\"><sup>1</sup></a>) whose predictions are old enough to evaluate in order to understand which prediction techniques worked and which ones didn't work, allowing us to then (mostly in a future post) evaluate the plausibility of predictions that use similar methodologies.</p><p>Unfortunately, every single predictor from the independently chosen set had a poor record and, on spot checking some predictions from other futurists, it appears that futurists often have a fairly poor track record of predictions so, in order to contrast techniques that worked with techniques that I didn't, I sourced predictors that have a decent track record from my memory, an non-independent source which introduces quite a few potential biases.</p><p>Something that gives me more confidence than I'd otherwise have is that I avoided reading independent evaluations of prediction methodologies until after I did the evaluations for this post and wrote 98% of the post and, on reading other people's evaluations, I found that I generally agreed with Tetlock's \"Superforecasting\" on what worked and what didn't work despite using a wildly different data set.</p><p>In particular, people who were into \"big ideas\" who use a few big hammers on every prediction combined with a <a href=\"https://danluu.com/cocktail-ideas/\">cocktail party idea</a> level of understanding of the particular subject to explain why a prediction about the subject would fall to the big hammer generally fared poorly, whether or not their favored big ideas were correct. Some examples of \"big ideas\" would be \"environmental doomsday is coming and hyperconservation will pervade everything\", \"economic growth will create near-infinite wealth (soon)\", \"Moore's law is supremely important\", \"quantum mechanics is supremely important\", etc. Another common trait of poor predictors is lack of anything resembling serious evaluation of past predictive errors, making improving their intuition or methods impossible (unless they do so in secret). Instead, poor predictors often pick a few predictions that were accurate or at least vaguely sounded similar to an accurate prediction and use those to sell their next generation of predictions to others.</p><p>By contrast, people who had (relatively) accurate predictions had a deep understanding of the problem and also tended to have a record of learning lessons from past predictive errors. Due to the differences in the data sets between this post and Tetlock's work, the details are quite different here. The predictors that I found to be relatively accurate had deep domain knowledge and, implicitly, had access to a huge amount of information that they filtered effectively in order to make good predictions. Tetlock was studying people who made predictions about a wide variety of areas that were, in general, outside of their areas of expertise, so what Tetlock found was that people really dug into the data and deeply understood the limitations of the data, which allowed them to make relatively accurate predictions.

There might even be further arguments that interrupting a pleasure can lead to longer-term benefits in the form of personal development, if, for example, it increases will power or puts one\u2019s priorities in perspective.</p><p>Extending this to putting the event in its social context: if I were a fan watching the match, my aggravation at the interruption would be more than compensated for by a feeling of relief and rightness-with-the-world upon learning of the reason for it later, and my enjoyment of the match would be subsequently diminished if I learned than someone died to ensure its broadcast.</p><p>Similarly, for all the pleasure a sports fan might derive from this pastime, I also have the sense that we understand these parts of our lives (i.e. entertainment, hobbies, pastimes) as important -- even extremely important and identity-defining for some -- yet nevertheless bracketed, existing on a separate moral plane from something like fatal work-related accidents. In a sports match the overall moral stakes are lower and the consequences steeply discounted because we\u2019ve created a space called \u201cplay\u201d or \u201cgame\u201d for it to exist in. I feel like this distinction is actually important to the enjoyment of the game itself, allowing the fan to become wrapped up in a form of virtual emotion and excitement while protecting some inner emotional stability with the knowledge that this is not the fundamental source of moral value in the world.</p><p>I also recognize that I\u2019m now wandering into speculation on sports sociology, and the examples of own-goal scorers murdered by their home fans suggests I might not be correct about this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019ve been imagining variations on the experiment to try and pick apart some of the effects, such as:</p><p>The Coliseum Effect:</p><p>Would it change anything if at the moment of the accident, Jones\u2019s body completed a circuit which connected the outgoing televised broadcast to the footage from a security camera which was recording his slow and painful death, so that everyone watching the match was now watching him die?</p><p>Naturally, if this causes widespread outrage and trauma among viewers then the scenario likely becomes a lose-lose and the obvious choice is to turn it off. But what if it turns out that audience interest, excitement and pleasure (as measured by our handy LiveWire audience emotional tracking app) is actually significantly greater than when watching the slow, low-scoring match? Do we have an obligation to allow Jones\u2019s suffering to continue so that others might enjoy it?</p><p>Or what if everything described above is true, but the prevailing belief among viewers is that this is some sort of staged slapstick routine inserted by mischievous producers to alleviate the boredom of watching an actual football match and the audience highly enjoys it without realizing at the time what is actually happening.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for reading.

As such, we come across many misconceptions regarding what the criteria should be for a successful brand and try to mitigate the movement from continuously making the same mistakes.&nbsp;</p><p>It is our aim moving forward to not only support organisations with their marketing, branding and communications needs, but to use this platform to bring well-established, robust, industry-standard marketing principles into this space, to ensure that all EA marketing is as impactful as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>As the movement rapidly grows, many new organisations are emerging each month, all in need of a distinctive brand and name. I will use this forum entry to highlight some common mistakes when naming an organisation and share key ways to ensure that your chosen name will work&nbsp;<i>for</i> you, not against you.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The number one job of a brand name is to be distinctive, not descriptive.&nbsp;</h2><p>Think about the biggest and most successful brands out there; Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft - none of which use their name to describe their service or product.</p><p>The brand name isn\u2019t a product description, it\u2019s a mark of identification, a decision simplifier, a way of narrowing down the decision field for your target audience in a way that makes sure you\u2019re the one they think of. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Restorff_effect\"><u>Von Restorff Effect</u></a> (the cognitive bias towards things that stand out) should be considered your best friend when it comes to branding.</p><p>Do you know why Apple was named Apple, and not \u2018Effective Computer Solutions\u2019?* Because it was a distinct and simplistic choice, far more memorable than anything that may have explained the product. It was also Job\u2019s contention that they would benefit from a company name beginning with \u2018A\u2019 as it would&nbsp;appear <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673923/why-is-apple-called-apple.html\"><u>earlier in the phonebook than a competitor</u></a>. Overly simplistic right?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wonkhe.com/blogs/stacks-alphabet/\"><u>Maybe not</u></a>.</p><p>*Comically, Apple was actually initially called, \u2018Apple Computer Co\u2019, but as the only distinct element - Apple stuck and the rest was binned.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Play where you can own the field</h2><p>Okay, so you\u2019re starting a new consultancy organisation, why not call it, for example, \u2018Effective Consultancy\u2019? I\u2019ll use this example as a springboard to both express why this might not be a good idea, and suggest alternative criteria to consider when choosing a name.</p><h3>This name is not distinct or memorable</h3><p>This name will be far less \u2018sticky\u2019 than something more distinct. The primary role of a brand is to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://phvntom.com/mark-ritson-distinctiveness-is-marketers-main-challenge/\"><u>drive top of mind</u></a> and support organisations to&nbsp;<i>win</i> against a huge host of competition for the attention of your target audience. Our brains are misers, they like easy decisions, and often, what comes to mind first or easiest is more likely to be chosen (see more on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow\"><u>system 1 and 2 thinking</u></a>). Sure, this name explains the service, but will it be the first thing that comes to mind when I come to needing this service? It is less likely than if the name was more distinct?</p><p>As this movement grows, and there are more and more organisations using \u2018Effective this\u2019 and \u2018Effective that\u2019, the name becomes increasingly muddied, blurred and entangled in a host of very similar sounding names. This is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thetomroach.com/2020/11/09/the-stupidity-of-sameness-and-the-value-of-difference/\"><u>not helpful</u></a> to either the success of the individual organisation nor the success of the EA movement as a whole.</p><h3>The name is not ownable</h3><p>Not only will this organisation struggle to carve out its own unique place in the mind of the target audience, but equally the organisation will see the same challenge within the brands&nbsp;<a href=\"https://adolab.com/brand-name/\"><u>online presence</u></a>. If all \u2018Effective X\u2019s\u2019 try to optimise their SEO and run Google ads (both of which they almost certainly should be doing), they are competing with each other (and competing directly with central EA products such as this forum and effectivealtruism.org). If they bid on their brand name to ensure it ranks well, they are bidding and out bidding other EA orgs cannibalising movement funds.</p><p>As the name is descriptive, they also attempt to bid on general, vague and well-used terms such as, in my example \u2018consultancy\u2019. There are far bigger beasts, with far greater budgets, bidding on these terms that will outbid this attempt, every time - it\u2019s wasted energy and resource.

Imagine the volume of individuals and new organisations one person typically meets at an EAG. If all organisation names fall into these traps and become muddied and blurred into one, even someone with a great memory would have a hard time finding distinction between your organisation and another.</p><p>Chances are, if it\u2019s an expensive search term, it\u2019s not distinct enough to hook into your target\u2019s head within a space you can own. Choosing something that\u2019s ownable relates both to the online presence and within the mind of your target audience.</p><h3>You\u2019re not (just) marketing to people who need you now</h3><p>One key principle of good marketing that is often overlooked is the difference between in-market targets and out-market targets. Most of the people that use your service, don\u2019t need you right now - they are out-of-market targets. They might need you in six months, a year, and your branding will do you far more favours if it sticks in the mind beyond the initial exposure and ideally long into the future. It\u2019s only with both&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thetomroach.com/2020/11/15/the-wrong-and-the-short-of-it/\"><u>short&nbsp;</u><i><u>and</u></i><u> long term brand building</u></a> that you will see good growth.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Finally, B:INCRTMELD</h2><p>Beware: Initialising Names Can Render Them Meaningless and Even Less Distinct</p><p>Second to the prevalence of \u2018Effective\u2019, and \u2018impact\u2019 as another example, we see a lot of organisations choose a descriptive brand name and then decide to render it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pure.hw.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/25373974/Functional_or_meaningless_A_debate_on_the_use_of_initials_in_brand_names_and_designs.PDF\"><u>meaningless and even less distinct</u></a> by reducing it to a three (or more!) letter initialism. Or worse, actively determine an initialism and then try and retrofit a name to the letters. Unless this initialism becomes&nbsp;<i>more distinct</i> (say it spells something interesting or surprising as an acronym) and will be used as the actual known brand name,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/thegobranding/when-do-acronym-brand-names-work-277b0e4f43ce\"><u>you\u2019re giving yourself a very hard job to implant this brand&nbsp;</u></a>top of mind.</p><p>In my example of \u2018Effective Consultancy\u2019, referring to themselves as EC rolls off the tongue okay, it may be quicker for internal communications, it might look okay in a logo, but its likelihood of success compared to something truly distinct and ownable is dramatically diminished.</p><p>Another crucial consideration here is that Google will rank your website based partially on the frequency of a term used, therefore, if you use the acronym in your web copy, you\u2019re negatively impacting ranking with your actual brand name. Similarly to the wealth of \u2018Effective\u2019 orgs, if we grow the movement with more three letter acronyms, none will be distinctive.&nbsp;</p><h2><br>So should I just call my new org \u2018Banana\u2019?</h2><p>No. Probably not. Sure, being distinctive is the number one job for a brand, however a close second is to provide other positive support to the likelihood of success of the brand.</p><p><strong>After distinctiveness and ownability you should consider:</strong></p><ul><li>Giving a tone/sensibility cue of the brands positioning (informing who this isn\u2019t for, as well as who it is for will save you time and increase your likelihood of attracting the right audience)</li><li>Consider prestige and credibility of the brand</li><li>How will the name be used in common language, a name that\u2019s too long will always be abbreviated. Our agency is called \u2018User-Friendly\u2019 and the amount of times it\u2019s actually used in conversation is a little comical, but does this support cementing our agency front of mind? Possibly.</li><li>Arguably one of the least used and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kantar.com/inspiration/advertising-media/the-advertising-multipliers-that-matter-are-not-what-marketers-think\"><u>most powerful multipliers to a brands success is creativity</u></a>, dare to be creative, it\u2019s not unprofessional or non corporate to be creative in order to capture attention.</li></ul><h2>Yikes, our org is called \u2018Effective, Effective, Effective\u201d and we go by EEE, should we re-brand?</h2><p>Assessing if a rebrand is needed or not is a difficult task. It largely depends on how well you feel the name is serving you, how deeply it is established within your target audience and whether you\u2019re already seeing issues with it. Sometimes sticking with it is the best route, sometimes a change (though scary) can give you a good uplift with a concerted effort to re-communicate who you are.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Let's Talk</h2><p>We\u2019d be more than happy for you to connect with us online or at one of the coming EAGs - we\u2019ll be at both Berlin (Amy) and DC (James).<br>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This is a brief overview of branding and certainly not exhaustive of all the factors that should be considered, but it hopefully goes some of the way to express good thinking processes to follow and what to try and avoid.</i></p><p><i>It is my hope and aim to support the movement in the application of industry knowledge by writing frequent posts on good marketing principles.

This means marketing Glo to individual and institutional investors who use stablecoins, e.g., to facilitate trades on crypto exchanges, for liquidity for market making and trading, and as loans using volatile crypto assets as collateral. Once we achieve parity between Glo and the leading stablecoins on stability, transparency, and availability, we think Glo\u2019s comparative advantages will be that using it lifts people out of poverty.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcxt3q718thu\"><sup><a href=\"#fncxt3q718thu\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Second</strong>, we will encourage altruistic folks to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.globalincomecoin.com/articles/glo-for-savings\"><u>put some of their savings into Glo</u></a>. A sum of Glo on your balance is both stable in value and easily made liquid, like other savings vehicles; the difference is that your Glo balance helps others at no cost to yourself.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.globalincomecoin.com/articles/vision-and-growth-strategy\"><u>Glo\u2019s further stages</u></a> require the sponsoring organization (and its friends and allies!) to do some heavy lifting. Basically, we need to make Glo useful for all the things people currently use money for.&nbsp;</p><p>Our&nbsp;<strong>third</strong> stage is to make Glo a viable substitute for money in a checking account. For this to work, you need to be able to spend Glo at the places you normally spend money, e.g. at the grocery store, for subscriptions, or on utilities. This will require a lot of technical and infrastructure development (i.e. support from payment processors like Stripe and PayPal, or debit card integrations), but we think that the ethical and corporate branding benefits of Glo adoption can provide the needed impetus.</p><p><strong>Fourth</strong> will be corporate cash holdings. The goal here is that when businesses get paid in Glo, they\u2019ll keep it as Glo. They can then pay<i> their&nbsp;</i>bills, and their employees, in Glo, or just keep cash on hand in Glo. This would have a huge impact\u2013converting half of the $1.52 trillion that&nbsp;non-financial S&amp;P 500 companies were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-11/cash-rich-s-p-500-firms-utilize-reserves-as-economy-rebounds\"><u>sitting on in 2021</u></a> would provide recurring basic income for 90 million people\u2013while also helping companies&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/does-esg-really-matter-and-why\"><u>fulfill ESG requirements</u></a>.&nbsp;Plus, if we succeed in marketing Glo as&nbsp;<strong>the ethical currency</strong>, we think that a lot of consumers and employees will actively select for places that use Glo.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>fifth</strong> stage is the culmination of the fourth: the point where most businesses default to using Glo. At all levels, we expect Glo adoption to start with people who are unusually ethically-minded, e.g. effective altruists and mission-driven businesses. But based on the numbers above, to really eradicate extreme poverty, Glo has to be broadly accepted by conventional folks at conventional places. This is, to put it lightly, ambitious, and we\u2019re thinking about decades in the future. But for the kind of scale we\u2019re aiming for, we need widespread mainstream adoption.</p><h2>Conclusion: thinking about helping others in a new way</h2><p>The thrust of this piece was to provide a sense of Glo\u2019s numbers: at X value, we could help Y people, etc., and how we plan to get there. But we hope we\u2019re also providing a more intangible sense of how much good we can do if we shift everyday economic activity onto ethical platforms.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/brad-west\"><u>Brad West</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/boas\"><u>Vincent van der Holst</u></a> call this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WMiGwDoqEyswaE6hN/making-trillions-for-effective-charities-through-the#Why_Prioritize_Guided_Consumption_\"><u>Guided Consumption</u></a>, we think it\u2019s a nice antidote to \u201c<a href=\"https://glasgowguardian.co.uk/2021/10/24/breaking-news-theres-no-ethical-consumption-under-capitalism/\"><u>no ethical consumption under capitalism</u></a>\u201d thinking. But more importantly, we think the potential for impact from putting everyday activity onto an ethical track dwarfs the scope of conventional charity. Put simply, the money people are willing to spend on themselves is probably always going to be bigger than that which they\u2019re willing to spend on others. Glo\u2019s goal is to harness that essential fact and put it to good use by creating and promoting an ethical currency.&nbsp;</p><p>Happy to answer any questions in the comments!</p><p>&nbsp;If this appeals to you, great!<i> Please </i><a href=\"https://www.globalincomecoin.com/articles/how-you-can-help\"><i>see here for <u>ways to contribute</u></i></a><i>.</i></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fneej0o0dxay8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefeej0o0dxay8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;If you read&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AB5QQaqEvA3sLJLTq/glo-a-ubi-generating-stablecoin#fnrefxzxuv5mdng\"><u>our previous post here</u></a>, this section will be familiar.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnsj74h2tnv5j\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefsj74h2tnv5j\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;A stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to keep a tight, consistent value.

I think that both parts are incorrect<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbpqzu9u6m6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbpqzu9u6m6\">[1]</a></sup></span>. I don't think EA requires maximizing, and it certainly isn't about maximizing in the na\u00efve sense that it often occurs.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>In my view, Effective Altruism as a community has in many or most places gone too far towards this type of maximizing view, and it is causing substantial damage. Holden thinks we've mostly avoided the issues, and while I think he's right to say that many possible extreme problems have been avoided, I think we have, in fact, done poorly because of a maximizing viewpoint.</p><h2>Is EA about Maximizing?</h2><p>I will appeal to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9wYa8BqSTMcx9j2tK/defining-effective-altruism\">Will MacAskill's definition</a>, first.</p><blockquote><p><i>Effective altruism</i> is:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(i) the use of evidence and careful reasoning to work out how to maximize the good with a given unit of resources, tentatively understanding \u2018the good\u2019 in impartial welfarist terms, and</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(ii) the use of the findings from (i) to try to improve the world.</p></blockquote><p>Part (i) is obviously at least partially about maximizing, in Will's view. But it is also tentative and cautious, rather than a binary - so even if there is a single maximum, actually doing part (i) well means we want to be very cautious about thinking we've identified that single peak. I also think it's easy to incorrectly think this appeals to utilitarian notions, rather than <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/beneficentrism\">benficentric</a> ones. Utilitarianism is maximizing, but EA is about maximizing <i>with resources dedicated to that goal</i>. It does not need to be totalizing, and interpreting it as \"just utilitarianism\" is wrong. Further, I think that many community members are unaware of this, which I see as a critical distinction.</p><p>But more importantly, part (ii), the actual practice of effective altruism, is not &nbsp;defined as maximizing. Very clearly, it is instead pragmatic. And pragmatism isn't compatible with much of what I see in practice when EAs take a maximizing viewpoint. That is, even according to views where we should embrace fully utilitarian maximizing - again, views that are compatible with but not actually embraced by effective altruism as defined - optimizing before you know your goal works poorly.&nbsp;</p><p>Before you know your goal exactly, moderate optimization pressure towards even incompletely specified goals that are imperfectly understood usually improves things greatly. That is, you can absolutely do good better even without finishing part (i), and that is what effective altruism has been and should continue to do. But at some point <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\">continuing optimization pressure has rapidly declining returns</a>. In fact, over-optimizing can make things worse, so when looking at EA practice, we should be very clear that it's not about maximizing, and should not be.</p><h2>Does the Current Degree of Maximizing Work?</h2><p>It is possible in theory for us to be benefitting from a degree of maximizing, but in practice I think the community has often gone too far. I want to point to some of the concrete downsides, and explore how maximizing has been and is currently damaging to EA. &nbsp;To show this, I will start from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YLaw4xHb39kZCdsAS/ea-is-elitist-should-it-stay-that-way\">exclusivity and elitism</a>, go on to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cvzEpGgmQ8BefiwGt/making-effective-altruism-enormous\">lack of growth</a>, to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bGqPbQeTr2fv47ihb/the-folly-of-eas-should\">narrow vision</a>, and then <a href=\"https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/ea-is-a-fight-against-knightian-uncertainty\">focusing on current interventions</a>. &nbsp;Given that, I will conclude that the \"effective\" part of EA is pragmatic, and fundamentally should not lead to maximizing, even if you were to embrace a (non-EA) totalizing view.</p><h3>Maximizing and Elitism&nbsp;</h3><p>The maximizing paradigm of Effective Altruism often pushes individuals towards narrow goals, ranging from earning to give, to AI safety, to academia, to US or international policy. This is a way for individuals to maximize impact, but leads to elitism, because very few people are ideal for any given job, and most of the areas in question are heavily selected for elite credentials and specific skills. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/znFAeeKk566bCNMNE/keeping-absolutes-in-mind\">Problems with this have been pointed out before.</a></p><p>It's also the case that individual maximization is rarely optimal for groups. Capitalism harnesses maximization to provide benefits for everyone, but when it works, that leads to diversity in specializations, not crowding into the single best thing. To the extent that people ask \"how can I be maximally impactful,\" I think they are asking the wrong question - they are part of a larger group, and part of the world as a whole, and they can't view their impact as independent from that reality.&nbsp;</p><p>I think this is even more unsustainable given the amount of attention EA receives, and also validates an increasingly common, and I think correct criticism, that EA is sometimes pushing against actually important things like fighting climate change, in search of so-called optimal things to focus on. When 1% of college students had heard of EA, directing them towards AI safety instead of climate change might have made sense. When 25% of them have heard of it, we really need to diversify - because we're far less effective with 1% of the population supporting effective goals than we could be with 25%.</p><h3>Self-Limiting EA, and Lack of Growth</h3><p>Maximizing effective altruism is also therefore unfortunately self-limiting, since most people can't, and shouldn't, actually work on the single highest leverage thing. To continue the above example, it is absolutely great for 25% of college students to aim &nbsp;to give 1% of their income to effective charities, and wonderful if some choose to give more, or focus their careers on maximizing impact. But it is absolutely disastrous for the community for people to think of EA as a binary, either you're in, and working on AI safety, biorisk, or working for an EA org, or you are out, and doing something the community seems to disapprove of like working on fighting climate change, or only donating. Because if that happens, we don't grow. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cvzEpGgmQ8BefiwGt/making-effective-altruism-enormous\">And we need to</a>.</p><p>And before people say that we don't need money, no. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5Xio8uECTH3GqYARc/we-re-still-extremely-funding-constrained-but-don-t-let-fear\">Effective altruism is incredibly funding constrained</a>. For example, EA has a nearly-unlimited funding opportunity in the form of Givedirectly, and right now, in 2022, Givewell is still short on donations to fund things that are 8x more effective than that. So the idea that when the movement is growing rapidly, and our funding base is potentially expanding further, we need to save money for later, just in case we might want another billion dollars for AI risk in five years seems myopic.&nbsp;</p><p>A maximizing viewpoint can say that we need to be cautious lest we do something wonderful but not maximally so. But in practice, embracing a pragmatic viewpoint, saving money while searching for the maximum seems bad. And Dustin Moskowitz can't, in general, seem to manage to give his money away fast enough to have his net worth stop increasing. So instead of maximizing, it seems, we could do more things that are less than maximally good, but get more good done.</p><h3>Narrow Visions</h3><p>A narrow vision of what is effective is also bad for the community's ability to work on priorities - even the narrow ones. Even if all we wanted to focus on was AI risk, we have too few graphic designers, writers, mental health professionals, or historians to work on all of the things we think would improve our ability to work on AI safety. There are presumably people who would have pursued PhDs in computer science, and would have been EA-aligned tenure track professors now, but who instead decided to earn-to-give back in 2014. Whoops!&nbsp;</p><p>And today, there are definitely people who are deciding not to apply to PhD programs in economics or bioengineering to work on AI risk. Maybe that's the right call in an individual case, but I'm skeptical that it's right in general. Maximizing narrowly is already leading to bad outcomes in the narrow domains.&nbsp;</p><h3>Premature Optimization</h3><p>Finally, focus on legible and predictable solutions is great when you're close to the finish line, but in most areas we are not. This means that any <a href=\"https://effectiviology.com/premature-optimization/\">optimization is going to be premature</a>, and therefore, perform non optimally.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, we fundamentally don't know what approaches will work for AI safety, we aren't anywhere near eliminating diseases, we haven't figured out how to stop cruelty in factory farming, much less replace meat, and the world isn't yet rich enough that it's possible to give everyone basic needs without needing political debates.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefffup7pwbj2c\"><sup><a href=\"#fnffup7pwbj2c\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We need to explore, not just exploit - and things like the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XBHx9zhAtkiBJnZNu/cause-exploration-prizes-announcing-our-prizes-1\">Open Philanthropy cause exploration contest</a> are great, looking for more immediately exploitable opportunities - but I'd be even happier if it was an ongoing prize for suggestions that lead to funding something. We can and should to be working on picking all the low hanging fruit we find, and looking for more. That's not maximizing, but it's improving<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefspzvnvg3qa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnspzvnvg3qa\">[3]</a></sup></span>.</p><h2>What could success of non-maximizing EA look like?</h2><p>Success, in my view, would make EA look like exercise, or retirement savings. No-one seriously questions them as important parts of the life of people in rich western countries - and there are clear efforts to encourage more people to do it. But very few people are looking to maximize either, and that's mostly good.</p><p>What would Effective Altruism as exercise look like? We still need the equivalent of gyms and parks to encourage people to donate 10% of their income, or think about their career impact. But people could choose whether to work on their cardio, and just give 1%, or be really into exercising, and have debates with friends about the relative importance of animal suffering, mental health, and disease elimination. We would still have sports, for those that are really doing impressive things, and people could care, but not feel like they were wasting their life because they only played pickup basketball twice a week instead of getting into the NBA. The NBA is for maximalists, sports are for everyone.</p><p>What would Effective Altruism as retirement saving look like? Serious people would expect everyone to be donating to effective causes as the obvious thing to do, there would be something like default donation schemes for people to give more easily, and they would direct their donations to any of several organizations like Givewell that allocated charitable giving. Those organizations would pursue maximizing impact, just like investors pursue maximizing (risk-adjusted) returns - but the community would not.</p><p>\"Doing Good Better\" makes the argument that people often aren't doing good well at all, with examples like giving money for playpumps and to give a wish foundation. We should do better, it says, and pay attention to improving the world. That's not maximizing, it's simply moving away from an obvious-in-retrospect failure mode.

I argue that this case suggests high quality access to official decision makers, windows of opportunity for influence over policy, and the development of trusting communities of non-officials are important to the success of track II diplomacy. This case should make us more enthusiastic about using track II diplomacy to reduce risks of great power conflict.&nbsp;</i></p><h1>1. Introduction</h1><h2>1.1 Risks from great power conflict&nbsp;</h2><p>Great power conflict is an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/existential-risk-factor\"><u>existential risk factor</u></a>: the probability of an existential catastrophe grows as a major conflict becomes more likely. There are several pathways by which great power conflict raises existential risk. For example, a war between great powers could cause or accelerate the deployment of weapons with catastrophic potential, including bioweapons and nuclear weapons. Tensions or war between great powers would make it harder to coordinate on the safe development of artificial intelligence and other destabilising emerging technologies.\u00b9</p><p>If, as seems plausible,\u00b2 great power conflict&nbsp;<i>significantly&nbsp;</i>contributes to total existential risk, interventions to reduce the probability of such conflict could significantly decrease existential risk.&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>1.2 Track II diplomacy and great power conflict</h2><p>Track II diplomacy is a potentially-effective intervention to reduce risks from great power conflict. It is unofficial policy discussion, usually between parties from different sides of an international conflict or representing groups that are in tension with each other.\u00b3 Though they are not officials themselves, Track II participants can influence official actions by sharing information and policy ideas, and by advocating for their preferred approach to their contacts back home. Their non-official status distinguishes Track II diplomacy programs from Track I (official) diplomacy. Track 1.5 dialogues are unofficial discussions which include official participants.\u2074</p><p>Philanthropists have funded Track II diplomacy,\u2075 suggesting that, if effective, it could be a good way to use philanthropic funding to reduce risks from great power conflict. However, few formal evaluations of the effectiveness of Track II diplomacy programs exist. In this report, I present a case study of a paradigmatic example of Track II diplomacy: the influence of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugwash_Conferences_on_Science_and_World_Affairs\"><u>Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs</u></a> on the Soviet government\u2019s decision to sign the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\u2076 While a case study approach raises concerns about generalisability, it can be useful when it is not feasible to conduct more systematic evaluations, such as randomised controlled trials. I use this case to test several assumptions about the effect of Track II diplomacy on relations between the countries involved.&nbsp;</p><p>In the rest of this post, I first briefly discuss existing work on the effectiveness and theory of change of Track II diplomacy. I then identify key claims proponents have made about its effectiveness. I then describe the case study and discuss the extent to which it provides evidence to support these claims. I conclude that this case suggests that, at its best, track II diplomacy can have significant positive effects on relations between rival powers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>2. Background on Track II diplomacy&nbsp;</h1><h2>2.1 Theories of change</h2><p>Proponents of Track II diplomacy generally argue that it reduces the risk of conflict by facilitating information flow and building relationships between representatives from rival countries. In a report for Founders Pledge, Stephen Clare, for example, identified several theoretical justifications for thinking that Track II diplomacy could make relations between countries safer.\u2077 I consider two important models of how Track II reduces conflict risk, summarised in the diagram below (figure 1): the \u2018new policy ideas\u2019 theory of change and the \u2018trust building\u2019 theory of change. The first theory of change claims that Track II provides a setting in which new policy options can be explored by participants who understand their own party\u2019s approach to the issues. The second claims that it provides a setting for information sharing and relationship building. I focus on these theories because they are among the most important models for why Track II programmes are effective, and are the most relevant for my case study.</p><p><br><strong>Figure 1. Theories of change for Track II diplomacy</strong></p><h3><br><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1670864583/mirroredImages/ggiCDnYcSKLxwFbBv/bq0g6wy7ezfxwp8ylmgq.png\"><br><br>New policy ideas</h3><p>Some work on Track II diplomacy claims that, particularly in cases of international tension rather than when countries are already at war, Track II dialogues can improve policy by providing a space to generate new options for engagement or for ways to reach agreements.\u2078 Participants in Track II discussions understand the concerns that motivate their government\u2019s current policy positions. In some cases, they also have detailed knowledge of the priorities of official decision makers. But, as unofficial representatives, they are also relatively free to discuss a wide range of possible policy options or new agreements. As a result, according to this view, Track II diplomacy provides an opportunity for participants to generate new policy ideas to resolve key difficulties in the relationship between the two parties. In figure 1, I have made explicit the implicit assumptions that (1) the new policy ideas are passed on to official decision makers, and that (2) official decision makers implement these new ideas.&nbsp;</p><h3>Trust building</h3><p>Another important theory of change for Track II diplomacy focuses on the potential for opposing parties to build trust through information sharing and repeated interaction. For example, Clare argues that Track II diplomacy provides opportunities to share information about policy intentions and military capability (see fn. 8). This could make misunderstandings less likely. It could also increase each party\u2019s confidence that the other party will uphold any agreement reached, by increasing transparency and strengthening individual relationships between negotiators. By building trust between participants and allowing them to share information, Track II diplomacy makes it more likely that parties in conflict or tension will make concessions and enter into agreements to decrease the risk of dangerous outcomes.&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>2.2 Evaluating Track II diplomacy</h2><p>Because it is so difficult to measure the effect of Track II interventions, most proponents rely on theories of change when advocating for their implementation. Clare\u2019s report does identify one empirical analysis which suggests Track II diplomacy has a positive effect on the likelihood of reaching an \u201ceffective outcome\u201d in negotiations.\u2079 However, because the study is non-experimental, not supported by further analyses, and potentially lacks construct validity, he does not put much weight on this finding. Even if we were able to identify and measure outcomes with confidence, endogeneity would be a major concern. Because other factors which influence whether relations between nations improve or armed conflicts are resolved are also correlated with whether Track II diplomacy happens, it\u2019s very hard to identify the causal effect of conducting Track II diplomacy on international tensions.</p><p>However, in a report for Founders Pledge, John Halstead has noted that impact is fat-tailed for many policy interventions (i.e., the probability of the intervention having a very large impact is higher than for a standard normal distribution). In such cases, a large proportion of the total impact of the intervention comes from a small number of big wins.\u00b9\u2070 It is plausible that the impact of Track II diplomacy programs is also fat-tailed. If this assumption is correct, then it is useful to conduct case studies to understand the counterfactual impact of the most successful Track II diplomacy programs, as the value of these successful cases largely determines the value of conducting Track II diplomacy.\u00b9\u00b9</p><p>The influence of the Pugwash Conferences on the Soviet government\u2019s decision to sign the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty is plausibly an example of a big win for Track II diplomacy (see fn. 6). Their influence on limitations on anti-ballistic missiles is particularly important to investigate because this is a case where the Pugwash conferences potentially influenced an important outcome in US-Soviet relations. Professor of political science Matthew Evangelista, an expert on the influence of transnational networks of scientists on Soviet foreign policy, argues that Pugwash participants had a significant influence on Soviet policy in this case.\u00b9\u00b2 Agreeing to limitations on anti-ballistic missiles was also an important outcome for US-Soviet relations.&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>2.3 Key claims about Track II diplomacy\u2019s effectiveness</h2><p>The \u2018new policy ideas\u2019 and \u2018trust building\u2019 theories of change make several assumptions about how Track II diplomacy improves relations between participating countries. I will scrutinise these assumptions. The claims I consider are:</p><p><strong>Claim 1: Track II dialogues allow participants in the dialogue to come up with new solutions to policy challenges.</strong></p><p><strong>Claim 2: Track II dialogues change participants\u2019 policy preferences.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Claim 3: These changes in participants\u2019 policy preferences would not otherwise happen.</strong></p><p><strong>Claim 4: Track II diplomacy can create policy change through participants relaying their ideas to governments.</strong></p><p><strong>Claim 5: Track II diplomacy increases each side\u2019s confidence that the other will uphold an agreement by allowing them to share information and build relationships.</strong></p><p><strong>Claim 6: Track II participants improve policy outcomes by advancing mutually-acceptable solutions to challenges in the diplomatic relationship between participating countries.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the next two sections, I describe the case and show its relevance to these six three claims.&nbsp;</p><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>3. The Pugwash Conferences and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty&nbsp;</h1><h2>3.1 Background on the Pugwash Conferences</h2><p>The Pugwash Conferences convene scientists, experts, and policymakers to discuss strategies for dealing with nuclear risk and weapons of mass destruction. Participants advocate for these strategies to be implemented as policy.\u00b9\u00b3 They began in 1957 as gatherings of elite scientists from the United States, the Soviet Union, each country\u2019s allies, and the non-aligned countries.\u00b9\u2074 The first conference was funded by a single donor, Canadian-American businessman Cyrus Eaton, and inspired by the 1955 Russell-Einstein manifesto, which called for an end to the arms race and highlighted the dangers of nuclear war.\u00b9\u2075 Western scientists who were eager to encourage international cooperation to reduce nuclear risks played an important role.\u00b9\u2076&nbsp; As well as track 1.5 and II dialogues, many other activities have been hosted under the Pugwash umbrella, including events, research projects, and study groups. The Conferences still run today.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>3.2 The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty</h2><p>Pugwash participants worked on multiple issues, but here I focus on their contribution to one arms control outcome: the Soviet Union\u2019s decision to agree to limitations on anti-ballistic missiles, as codified in the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. My source for much of the evidence &nbsp;and argument for the influence of the Pugwash Conferences on anti-ballistic missile limitation is Matthew Evangelista\u2019s&nbsp;<i>\u2018Unarmed Forces\u2019</i>.\u00b9\u2077</p><p>The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty limited the development and deployment of missile defence systems that use anti-ballistic missiles. Anti-ballistic missiles defend against nuclear attack by intercepting and destroying incoming nuclear missiles. The Treaty prevented both the United States and the Soviet Union from deploying a system of anti-ballistic missiles which could defend their entire territory. Each side was limited to just two systems: one around the nation\u2019s capital, and another around an ICBM launch site. In 1974 this was further limited to one each, either around the capital or around a launch site.\u00b9\u2078 Signed as part of SALT I, the first bilateral arms control agreement between the US and the Soviet Union,\u00b9\u2079 the Treaty was in force from 1972 until the US withdrew in 2002.\u00b2\u2070</p><p>The basic argument for the effect of the Pugwash Conferences in this case is:</p><ol><li>American scientists developed concerns about the destabilising effect of anti-ballistic missiles.</li><li>They convinced influential Soviet scientists of these concerns at the Pugwash Conferences and other meetings with Soviet Pugwash participants.</li><li>These Soviet scientists communicated these concerns to political leaders in the Soviet Union.</li><li>This motivated Soviet leaders to agree to limitations on anti-ballistic missiles.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>I call the American scientists\u2019 view&nbsp;<i>the strategic stability argument</i> against anti-ballistic missile deployment. It has two core claims:\u00b2\u00b9<br>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Anti-ballistic missiles would worsen the nuclear arms race (be bad for \u2018arms race stability\u2019). Suppose the opposing country deploys a comprehensive system of anti-ballistic missiles. The simplest and cheapest way to respond to this would be to increase the number of your nuclear warheads until your arsenal is big enough that it can overwhelm the other side\u2019s new defences.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Anti-ballistic missiles make it more likely that moments of crisis will escalate to nuclear war (be bad for \u2018crisis stability\u2019). If both sides have them, the side which strikes first will have an advantage in a nuclear war - their defences will only have to respond to a comparatively ragged and weak second strike. So, in cases where each side fears the other might attack, there is an incentive to strike first.<br>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>In the next section, I assess the extent to which this case provides support for the six key claims about Track II diplomacy. <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/research/publication/pugwash-literature-review\">This article</a> by Paul Rubinson also gives an overview of key claims in the literature about the influence of Pugwash on policy, including in the case of anti-ballistic missiles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>4. Support for claims about the effect of Track II diplomacy</h1><h2>4.1. Claim 1: Generating new policy ideas</h2><p>Some proponents suggest that Track II diplomacy can provide space for dialogue that generates new policy ideas. While this claim may be true, this case does not provide any positive evidence to support it. American scientists independently became concerned about the destabilising potential of anti-ballistic missiles.\u00b2\u00b2 Instead of working to develop new policy ideas, the Americans made concerted efforts to convince Soviet scientists of their own perspective.\u00b2\u00b3</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>4.2. Claim 2: Changing participants\u2019 policy preferences</h2><p>Claim 2 suggests that Track II dialogues can have an impact by changing participants\u2019 policy preferences or strategies for advocating for their preferred policies.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pugwash case provides some strong evidence in support of this claim. It is highly likely that American scientists successfully persuaded some Soviet scientists to change their minds about missile defence. There is specific evidence that this happened in the case of at least one important scientist, mostly identified by Evangelista. Sources on the views of the head of the Soviet Pugwash delegation vary, but suggest that he was deeply sceptical of American scientists\u2019 arguments against anti-ballistic missiles in January 1964,\u00b2\u2074 and more sympathetic to them by later that year after participating in additional, informal meetings with American scientists. Two American scientists who met him before and after his change of mind suggest that these meetings in the interim made him sympathetic to the American position.\u00b2\u2075 Since little has been recorded about Soviet scientists\u2019 views, specific evidence that the head of the Soviet Pugwash delegation was convinced by American scientists suggests that others likely were as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pugwash conferences were not the&nbsp;<i>only&nbsp;</i>opportunity for American and Soviet scientists to discuss arms control and US-Soviet relations. Informal meetings and confidential bilateral Track II dialogues complemented the Pugwash conferences.\u00b2\u2076 In fact, Evangelista's evidence suggests that being able to meet outside of the main conferences was crucially important for providing enough contact to convince Soviet scientists of a new perspective on this arms control question.\u00b2\u2077</p><p>However, these additional meetings were only possible because the Pugwash Conferences helped to create strong connections between American and Soviet scientists.\u00b2\u2078 When the first Pugwash conference happened in 1957, there were either no, or almost no, other opportunities for Soviet and American scientists to have conversations about security policy and nuclear issues,\u00b2\u2079 and personal networks between the scientists did not yet exist.\u00b3\u2070 The Pugwash conferences therefore opened the door to extensive contact which was crucially important for American scientists who wanted to persuade their Soviet peers of their perspective on the anti-ballistic missile issue.&nbsp;</p><p>There are reasons to think that there was initial scepticism about the strategic stability argument among Soviet scientists. Evangelista's evidence indicates this was the case for at least two important Pugwash attendees.\u00b3\u00b9 Additionally, the broader perspective on nuclear strategy which motivated American scientists\u2019 concerns would have been novel for many of the Soviet Pugwash delegation. One part of the argument against anti-ballistic missiles is that they provide an incentive to strike first, but at this time the Soviet military was still focussed on having the capability to preempt an American attack and strike first in a moment of crisis.\u00b3\u00b2 This does not show that Soviet scientists were convinced of the perspective of Soviet nuclear strategists, but it does suggest that the perspective which motivated the argument would have been unfamiliar.</p><p>The case of Pugwash therefore supports the view that extensive contact between non-officials from parties to an international conflict can change these non-officials\u2019 policy preferences. It also provides support for thinking that this kind of contact can be established even when relations between two countries are very strained and existing opportunities for contact between non-officials are extremely poor - over time, Track II diplomacy can build networks of cooperating policy advocates.&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>4.3. Claim 3: The changes in policy preferences are counterfactual</h2><p>If Track II dialogues merely replace other forms of communication which would produce the same changes in policy preferences, they are not useful. However, there are a few obvious reasons to think that, in the case of Pugwash, Track II dialogues and attendant discussions&nbsp;<i>did&nbsp;</i>provide a uniquely good venue for changing Soviet scientists\u2019 minds.&nbsp;</p><p>First, American scientists had unique opportunities to discuss strategic concerns about anti-ballistic missiles from a Soviet perspective, and from the perspective of mutual strategic interests. At the time, the other way Soviet scientists could have accessed the strategic critique of anti-ballistic missiles was through American writings in journals and periodicals and by following Soviet analyses of American political debates\u00b3\u00b3 - these would have discussed concerns about anti-ballistic missiles from the perspective of American strategic interests, and so would have been less persuasive.</p><p>Second, the Conferences led to comparatively trusting relationships between Soviet and American scientists.\u00b3\u2074 As a result, Soviet Pugwash participants would have been more confident that these Americans sincerely believed that it was in the Soviet interest to limit anti-ballistic missiles than if they were uncertain of the intentions and loyalties of the American delegation. They would certainly have been more confident in the scientists\u2019 sincerity than Soviet leaders would have been in the sincerity of American officials who favoured limitations on the technology.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, because of opportunities for extensive in-person dialogue between Soviet and American scientists, American scientists had multiple opportunities to try to persuade their Soviet contacts of this perspective, if they were initially sceptical or unconvinced by the first presentations of the argument.</p><p>There is some evidence that opposition to anti-ballistic missile development was growing among Soviet citizens independently of their meetings with American scientists. Evangelista argues that some Soviet citizens opposed anti-ballistic missiles because of a combination of their own reflections on the technology and reading American arguments - including scientists and non-scientists who never attended Pugwash.\u00b3\u2075 This suggests that Pugwash participants and Soviet leaders may have eventually supported limitations on anti-ballistic missiles even absent the influence of Pugwash. However, he also suggests that those Soviet scientists who were persuaded of the American view outside of Pugwash had unusually independent and critical perspectives on Soviet policy (see fn. 35).&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, it seems likely to me that the influence of the Pugwash Conferences on Soviet scientists\u2019 views was counterfactual. They provided opportunities to discuss security policy at a time when the only other way to engage with Americans on these questions was by reading about their arguments from afar. Thus, the case of Pugwash supports the idea that, when existing opportunities for communication between key non-officials in different countries are poor, Track II diplomacy can be a highly-valuable forum for knowledge exchange and deliberation on important policy questions.&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>4.4. Claim 4: Relaying policy ideas to governments</h2><p>Track II dialogues can only have significant effects if participants affect policy makers' decisions. Therefore, it is important to examine the claim that Soviet Pugwash scientists made a difference to their government\u2019s perspective on anti-ballistic missiles, and if so, how.&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>The advocacy of Soviet scientists</h3><p>Soviet scientists who took part in Pugwash had opportunities to communicate their opposition to anti-ballistic missiles to top political leaders, including the Soviet leader Brezhnev, the Prime Minister, and members of the Commission on Arms Control. As Evangelista argues,\u00b3\u2076 the most significant way scientists could have affected the Soviet stance on anti-ballistic missile limitation is by influencing the attitudes of this small group of political leaders. This group made the decisions that took the Soviet Union from being approached by the US about potential arms control talks to signing the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.\u00b3\u2077</p><p>Evangelista attempts to show that scientists had an influence on the Soviet government\u2019s stance via this route by providing evidence that they had opportunities to communicate their views to leaders and that they took these opportunities at key moments. Scientists who attended Pugwash had personal and institutional connections to leaders and members of the Commission on Arms Control. Some of their scientific higher-ups with whom they would have discussed arms control and conversations at Pugwash were also close with and greatly respected by the top political leadership.\u00b3\u2078 Unfortunately, there is only very limited evidence that scientists appealed directly to leaders.\u00b3\u2079 There is very limited evidence in general about what advice Soviet leaders received on arms control, due to the secrecy surrounding Soviet policy making and the amount of time that has passed. So a lack of evidence of direct communication between scientists and policymakers should not be taken as a strong indication that no such talks occurred.&nbsp;</p><p>In public communications, and in private communications with the Americans, the Soviet government endorsed a strategic rationale for limiting anti-ballistic missiles.\u2074\u2070 As Evangelista argues, this provides further evidence that actors who were concerned about strategic stability had familiarised Soviet political leaders with their arguments. However, I do not think this provides strong evidence that Soviet leaders&nbsp;<i>believed&nbsp;</i>the strategic stability argument against anti-ballistic missiles: it is possible that Soviet leaders talked in terms of the Americans\u2019 strategic concerns to make it easier to communicate their willingness to negotiate.\u2074\u00b9</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Scientists plausibly made a difference</h3><p>Even assuming that scientists conveyed their opposition to anti-ballistic missiles directly to key political decision makers in the Soviet Union, this does not show that their advocacy was&nbsp;<i>necessary&nbsp;</i>to get political leaders to agree to place limits on the technology.&nbsp;</p><p>Suppose scientists had not communicated concerns about the strategic implications of anti-ballistic missiles to the political leadership. In that case, political leaders would still have accessed the strategic argument against anti-ballistic missiles from American officials who were sympathetic to it. It is likely that listening to American officials express such concerns about anti-ballistic missiles, before and during the SALT talks, contributed to Soviet leaders\u2019 support for limiting them.\u2074\u00b2</p><p>Beyond worrying that the further development and deployment of anti-ballistic missiles would be destabilising, political leaders in the Soviet Union had other reasons to want to limit this technology. Evangelista argues none of these other considerations gave leaders decisive justifications to support anti-ballistic missile limitation.\u2074\u00b3 But is he right about that? According to both Kaufman\u2074\u2074 and Evangelista,\u2074\u2075 in the lead up to the bilateral agreement to limit anti-ballistic missiles, the desire to achieve&nbsp;<i>any&nbsp;</i>arms control win was a significant driving force behind Brezhnev and the Prime Minister\u2019s willingness to accept these limitations. That said, it seems unlikely to me that their desire for an arms control agreement to improve relations with the US would have been sufficient to make the Soviet government agree to limit anti-ballistic missiles. If they did not believe in the strategic rationale for limiting the technology, and were optimistic about developing new anti-ballistic missile systems, it is implausible that they would have been willing to give up opportunities to deploy more.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is plausible that by the time they were making decisions about the Soviet negotiating position in the SALT talks, political leaders were convinced that it would be infeasible to create an anti-ballistic missile system which had any strategic relevance. The available evidence makes it unclear whether or not they still had some optimism about this technology.\u2074\u2076 If they had become convinced that effective defence was infeasible, then agreeing to limit the deployment of anti-ballistic missiles would have had next to no consequences for Soviet strategy or military plans. On this account, limiting missile defences was an arms control option which the Soviet leadership could pursue with little cost. Political leaders could simply have been eager to reach an agreement and convinced that anti-ballistic missiles would not be useful anyway.\u2074\u2077</p><p>I think two possibilities are about equally likely. The first is that technical advisors to the political leadership were all pessimistic about anti-ballistic missile technology, and leaders decided to support extensive bilateral limitations on anti-ballistic missiles because this would be a major arms control win and have little effect on military strategy or plans for new weapons developments. In that case, political leaders would have agreed to limit anti-ballistic missiles regardless of whether they were convinced that the technology could be destabilising. The second (which is Evangelista's view\u2074\u2078) is that there was still significant misguided optimism about the technical prospects for anti-ballistic missiles. I think that accepting this second possibility should also lead us to accept Evangelista\u2019s broader view that, other than concerns about strategic stability as raised by scientists, there are&nbsp;<i>no&nbsp;</i>considerations that decisively favoured Soviet leaders supporting limitations on anti-ballistic missiles. Other proposed explanations for the Soviet government\u2019s decision, which I do not discuss in this post, are weak. So the second view suggests that&nbsp;hearing scientists\u2019 concerns would have been&nbsp;crucially&nbsp;important for swaying political leaders to agree to anti-ballistic missile limitations.&nbsp;</p><p>Since there is a good case that Pugwash participants had a counterfactual influence on the policy outcome, I think it is right to treat the effect of Pugwash on the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty as an example of a big win for Track II diplomacy. This study supports the idea that Track II diplomacy initiatives have a high upside, though not as much as if the available evidence allowed us to be more confident that Pugwash participants had an influence on the policy outcome.&nbsp;</p><p>The case of Pugwash suggests that Track II practitioners can make a difference to policy especially when there is a key window of opportunity to do so: an opportunity for policy change arises, and other considerations mean that political leaders are already interested in Track II practitioners\u2019 preferred policy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Scientists\u2019 narrow influence&nbsp;</h3><p>Some evidence suggests that Pugwash scientists influenced the Soviet leadership to favour a perspective on nuclear strategy which can motivate wanting to limit missile defences. Political scientist David Holloway identifies a shift in Soviet nuclear strategy over the course of the 1960s, from a focus on being able to preemptively attack a rival power in a situation where it is planning to launch a first strike, to a focus on deterring the rival from attack by ensuring the ability to launch a devastating second strike is preserved.\u2074\u2079 The strategic stability argument against anti-ballistic missiles is more compelling if you already accept that nuclear forces should be set up to preserve deterrence capability. In particular, worrying about \u2018crisis stability\u2019 makes little sense if you plan to preemptively strike the other side in a moment of crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>The shift in nuclear strategy - to the extent that it affected the views of the top leadership - would have made those leaders more receptive to the idea of limiting anti-ballistic missiles. Pugwash scientists may have contributed to this broader shift in strategy by relaying American ideas about nuclear deterrence to political leaders. We know of one instance where the President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (who would have discussed arms control with Pugwash scientists), argued in favour of focussing on deterrence at a key meeting about&nbsp;<i>offensive&nbsp;</i>forces.\u2075\u2070</p><p>However, it is a lot less likely that Pugwash scientists decisively influenced this broader shift in Soviet strategy than that they tipped the balance on the anti-ballistic missile question in particular. This is because the shift in Soviet strategy was a much broader change, because there are multiple potential explanations for it, and because much of the impetus for this shift came from the military rather than the political leadership.\u2075\u00b9</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Beyond direct communication to the leaders</h3><p>As well as scientists directly sharing their views on anti-ballistic missiles with political leaders, the Soviet government\u2019s interest in closely following discussions at Pugwash likely exposed them to the strategic ideas that were discussed at the Conferences. This is one set of evidence Evangelista draws on to support the impact of scientists on political leaders\u2019 views on missile defence (the others are discussed in the first subsection of 4.4 and the notes to that subsection). Particularly in the early years of the Conferences, the Soviet government hoped that Pugwash would be a tool for spreading propaganda and promoting their own foreign policy agenda. They therefore tried, with mixed success, to closely track and dictate the activities of the Soviet delegation at the conferences.\u2075\u00b2</p><p>By the time Pugwash participants became interested in the anti-ballistic missile issue, the Soviet government\u2019s control over the activities of their Pugwash delegation had weakened.\u2075\u00b3 Nevertheless, they did monitor their activities at this time. Evangelista records some specific examples of the Soviet government taking interest in Pugwash discussions of the anti-ballistic missile issue. Disagreement within the Soviet Pugwash delegation at a 1967 conference (a leading scientist argued in favour of limiting anti-ballistic missiles, whilst a military official opposed limiting them) caught the attention of political leaders.\u2075\u2074 Officials from the Soviet government attended a meeting of the Soviet-American Disarmament Study Group (one of the forums for bilateral US-Soviet track II dialogue which began as a result of Pugwash) in December 1967.\u2075\u2075 Evangelista also argues that a Soviet Pugwash attendee who was a KGB agent could have reported on the meetings directly to the top political leadership.\u2075\u2076</p><p>Overall, this section shows that, while there are multiple ways that Soviet Pugwash participants may have influenced Soviet policy makers, it is difficult to&nbsp;<i>prove&nbsp;</i>they had an influence. Nevertheless, I accept Evangelista's case that because (1) the Pugwash Conferences were well-known, (2) the participants were prestigious and connected to Soviet leaders, and (3) Soviet leaders came to understand the strategic concern about anti-ballistic missiles in the period when Soviet scientists were advocating for this concern, it is likely that the participants influenced policy makers\u2019 attitudes to anti-ballistic missiles. It is similarly difficult to determine whether Pugwash participants\u2019 influence on policy makers\u2019 attitudes was&nbsp;<i>necessary&nbsp;</i>to get them to agree to limitations: it is hard to know how strongly concerns about the feasibility of the technology and the desire to achieve a win on arms control influenced policy makers\u2019 decision. However, there is a plausible case that these considerations were not enough on their own, and that therefore, influence from scientists was necessary for them to agree to anti-ballistic missile limitations.&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>4.5. Claim 5: Information sharing and relationship building</h2><p>Sharing information, for example about policy intentions and military capability, can make it easier to reach agreements on arms control. Information sharing decreases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation. However, in the case of the agreement on limitations to anti-ballistic missiles, the Pugwash Conferences were not an important route for the US and Soviet governments to share information about their intentions and current capabilities. There is no available evidence of the US and Soviet governments using the Pugwash Conferences as a channel to share information about their plans for anti-ballistic missile development or the considerations affecting whether and what limitations on anti-ballistic missiles they would agree to. It would be surprising if they did, as the Pugwash conferences were not closely connected to the official negotiations where the details of anti-ballistic missile capabilities and potential options for limiting them were discussed. This is in contrast to some Track II dialogues which are focussed on helping facilitate the negotiation of specific agreements, and which happen in parallel to and in connection with official negotiations.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, another claim of this theory of change for Track II diplomacy is that participants can use Track II dialogues to build relationships, creating trust in each others\u2019 intentions. I think that the Pugwash conferences provided a venue for this type of trust building and networking between&nbsp;<i>scientists&nbsp;</i>on either side of the Cold War divide. But this probably did not translate into increased trust between officials in the US and Soviet Union. And it did not make it easier to reach agreements <i>by increasing confidence that the other country would uphold them</i>, instead it did so by facilitating discussions about the policy implications of their shared aims of peaceful relations and arms control. &nbsp;</p><p>In light of the pressures on the Soviet Pugwash delegation, it is particularly impressive that they were able to build trusting relationships with Western scientists by establishing a shared set of aims. L\u00fcscher, focussing on Pugwash pre-1960, discusses how the Soviet government wanted the conferences to be a tool to spread their existing foreign policy agenda, and used both their control over which scientists could attend and surveillance to constrain what positions Soviet participants supported (see fn. 52). He argues that the Soviet delegation carefully balanced the risks of losing their position at the conferences by too loudly adopting stances which contradicted those of their government, and of failing to cooperate effectively with Western scientists by not demonstrating that they shared their aims and were in fact interested in compromises between Soviet and Western interests.\u2075\u2077 This balancing act was particularly important as it was reasonable for Western scientists to be concerned about the aims and loyalties of their Soviet peers: at the time, the Soviet government was supporting other international conferences on peace and disarmament with the aim of spreading the Soviet foreign policy agenda.\u2075\u2078</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>4.6. Claim 6: Developing mutually-acceptable solutions</h2><p>Track II diplomacy is worth supporting because it is a potential mechanism for&nbsp;<i>improving&nbsp;</i>policy, not merely changing it. Here, I look at whether and how the policy change in the Pugwash case had positive effects: did the Treaty decrease the risk of US-Soviet conflict? And was limiting anti-ballistic missiles a good focus for proponents of arms control, given what was known at the time?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The signing of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty improved US-Soviet relations. The SALT I agreement, which included the Treaty and an agreement on offensive arms, was the first bilateral arms control agreement between the USA and the USSR. It is widely claimed that this agreement laid the groundwork for future arms control talks between the Soviet Union and the United States,\u2075\u2079 that it made US-Soviet diplomacy easier, and that it contributed to the improvement in US-Soviet relations in the 1970s.\u2076\u2070 Even if the arms controls which are codified in the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty did nothing to directly reduce the risks of and from a nuclear conflict, the Treaty was still very useful.</p><p>There is one particularly interesting way in which the SALT I agreement and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty improved US-Soviet relations and made it easier to negotiate future arms control agreements. The agreement represented and signalled significant alignment between the United States and the Soviet Union about nuclear strategy. In particular, both sides at least&nbsp;<i>outwardly&nbsp;</i>accepted that missile defences could be destabilising, that parity in the size of their nuclear forces was desirable, and that the logic of deterrence made sense.\u2076\u00b9 It is possible that the Soviet Union communicated in terms of Americans\u2019 strategic concerns to demonstrate their willingness to negotiate. Regardless, alignment in the two nations\u2019&nbsp;<i>stated&nbsp;</i>aims for nuclear strategy (whether genuine or feigned) would have decreased each country\u2019s uncertainty about the other\u2019s intentions for their nuclear forces. This would have directly decreased hostility between the US and Soviet Union,\u2076\u00b2 and also made it easier to negotiate future arms control agreements because each side was more confident in the other\u2019s aims for their nuclear forces.\u2076\u00b3</p><p>Therefore, it was valuable for the SALT I agreement to signal alignment between the US and Soviet Union on nuclear strategy. And Pugwash scientists very likely helped Soviet leaders understand the perspective on missile defence which originated in America and eventually guided the Americans\u2019 own approach to anti-ballistic missile limitation. More speculatively, they might also have influenced Soviet leaders\u2019 thinking about nuclear strategy more broadly. To the extent that Pugwash contributed to the alignment between the US and the Soviet Union on ideas about nuclear strategy, it was very beneficial.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I think that in practice, limiting anti-ballistic missiles only had a small&nbsp;<i>direct&nbsp;</i>effect on the arms race and the risk of US-Soviet nuclear war. First, because I find it implausible that the buildup of deployable nuclear warheads would have been significantly worse after 1972 if anti-ballistic missile development had been allowed to continue unabated. Though the US stockpile of nuclear warheads grew and then declined slightly after 1972, the Soviet stockpile continued to grow at pace.\u2076\u2074 Since the buildup of nuclear arms on the Soviet side was rapid in this period, I find it implausible that it would have been much faster in a counterfactual where new anti-ballistic missile systems were allowed.</p><p>Second, I think that by 1972, the Soviet government was relatively pessimistic about the near-term prospects for anti-ballistic missile development, largely because of the failure of existing projects and internal assessments that the technology was unviable. Though there was division in the US about the prospects for limited anti-ballistic missile systems, there were no plans to build a system to defend against a full scale Soviet attack. As a result, the Treaty had few consequences for near term plans to develop and deploy anti-ballistic missile systems in either country.\u2076\u2075 So the Treaty did little to prevent a major proliferation of anti-ballistic missiles in the immediate years after 1972 - this proliferation would not have happened anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I think it is unlikely that the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty prevented deployment of missile defences that would have threatened strategic stability even in the longer term.\u2076\u2076</p><p>Nevertheless, given the information scientists had at the time, limiting anti-ballistic missiles was a good idea. When American scientists began to advocate against the technology, there were already reasons to suspect it would be very hard to build an effective system.\u2076\u2077 However, the Soviet Union and the United States were both pursuing anti-ballistic missile development.\u2076\u2078 It was therefore reasonable to predict that one country might produce an effective system, or at least a system that&nbsp;<i>seemed&nbsp;</i>effective enough for the other to fear that its offensive capability was threatened. Given that prediction, the strategic stability argument provides good reason for favouring limitations on anti-ballistic missiles.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the strategic stability argument was not developed at Pugwash, the Conferences provided a venue for very early adoption and discussion of it. Given what scientists knew about the potential for anti-ballistic missile technology at the time, this argument highlighted an important opportunity for curbing the arms race and preventing future crises from escalating into nuclear war. Additionally, whether they were aware of this or not, scientists ended up advocating against a technology on which leaders were unusually disposed to place severe constraints - because they were pessimistic about whether it would be useful. Pugwash was therefore a mechanism for the adoption of a good proposal for reducing nuclear risk.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>5. Discussion&nbsp;</h1><h2>5.1 Sources of success for Track II diplomacy&nbsp;</h2><p>Overall, the basic case for the importance of the Pugwash Conferences holds. Although it is hard to establish with&nbsp; high-confidence the various reasons for policy shifts and decisions in the Soviet Union in the early 1970s, it seems likely that the Pugwash Conferences (1) provided a venue for bilateral discussion of policy options and potential international agreements, (2) built trust between participants, (3) led to changes in the policy preferences of Soviet participants, and (4) motivated Soviet scientists to advocate for the adoption of limitations on anti-ballistic missiles to high-level decision-makers. That makes the Pugwash case a relatively compelling example of how Track II diplomacy can have a positive effect and reduce risks from great power conflict.</p><p>A summary of my findings with respect to the six key claims is:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Claim</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Evidence from Pugwash</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">1.

Pugwash scientists chiefly influenced the policy outcome via their high quality connections in government. This makes it plausible that, in cases where participants in Track II dialogue lack direct government connections, the potential influence of Track II diplomacy on government policy is much less significant. That said, finding other cases where practitioners did not have direct, high quality access to the political leadership but still made a difference could suggest this tentative conclusion is wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Windows of opportunity for changing government policy&nbsp;</h3><p>If Pugwash participants ultimately influenced the policy outcome in the case of anti-ballistic missiles, it was because there was a window of opportunity for influence. The advocacy of respected scientists gave leaders additional reason to support a policy which they would already have been strongly disposed to favour because of other considerations. As a result, Pugwash participants were able to push the Soviet government towards a policy which was consistent with reducing the risks from anti-ballistic missiles they were most concerned about. They did this without convincing them of the strategic paradigm which most supported implementing that policy.&nbsp;</p><p>This case suggests that Track II dialogues could increase the probability that already-proposed arms control agreements are accepted by great powers. However, this case does little to support the view that Track II diplomacy can improve great power relations by broadly changing leaders\u2019 attitudes to rival powers or&nbsp;<i>generating&nbsp;</i>innovative policies (it does not suggest that Track II dialogues cannot achieve these outcomes \u2013 it just does not provide any evidence for or against this claim).</p><h3>Communities of influential non-officials&nbsp;</h3><p>The Pugwash conferences began at a time when there were very limited opportunities for Soviet and American scientists to meet, and facilitated the development of a transnational community of scientists advocating to reduce international tension and nuclear risk. Personal connections between scientists, frequent contact, and trust in each others\u2019 intentions were crucially valuable when American scientists were trying to convince their Soviet peers of their perspective on the risks from anti-ballistic missile development. Soviet and American scientists were able to build trusting relationships because the Soviets astutely balanced the requirement to further the foreign policy aims of the Communist Party with their commitment to the goals they shared with Western scientists.&nbsp;</p><p>This case therefore makes me suspect that Track II dialogues where contact between participants is infrequent, where there is a lack of trust between participants, and where there are no mechanisms to build personal connections and trust over time, are less promising. This case also highlights how building trusting relationships between Track II participants can be difficult when a government seeks to use a Track II dialogue to further their existing foreign policy agenda. As a result, some participants not being able to speak freely and develop mutual aims with those from other countries due to government interference is potentially a key barrier to the success of Track II.&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>5.2 Limitations&nbsp;</h2><p>There are several potential routes to impact for Track II diplomacy about which this case reveals nothing because they don\u2019t apply to the influence of Pugwash on the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Some key examples are: the use of Track II diplomacy to avoid misunderstandings escalating into war (see fn. 8); using Track II diplomacy as a low cost way to start negotiations with a hostile power, then gradually involving official negotiators\u2076\u2079 and influencing the decisions of the government through changing public attitudes on a particular policy question.\u2077\u2070</p><p>The case study approach also raises concerns about generalisability. In particular, Pugwash is disanalogous with some other examples of Track II diplomacy because participants on the Soviet side had such high quality connections to the political leadership. The fact that Pugwash participants were able to influence an important arms control question tells us little about the potential best-case impact of Track II programs where practitioners have significantly worse access to key decision makers.</p><p>My main resource for the argument that Pugwash had significant influence on anti-ballistic missile limitation, and the routes by which it had that influence, was Matthew Evangelista\u2019s work <i>\u2018Unarmed Forces\u2019</i>. Though I think there are plausible justifications for focussing on the routes by which Pugwash had influence which I have assessed in this report, one reason why I focus on them is arbitrary: they are the routes to impact which have already been discussed and substantiated in the very narrow literature on Pugwash, in particular, Evangelista\u2019s work.</p><p>I have not discussed potential risks from Track II diplomacy or what the case of Pugwash and anti-ballistic missiles reveals about them. It is important to understand the ways in which Track II diplomacy could make policy worse or otherwise increase tensions between great powers. If these risks are few, easy to mitigate, and the worst case outcome is not very bad, then the potential benefit from Track II programs must be much lower for the risks to be worth it, than if they are extensive and very bad in the worst case. As a starting point for thinking about downsides of Track II diplomacy, see Clare\u2019s report.\u2077\u00b9</p><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>6. Conclusion</h1><p>The Pugwash conferences affected the Soviet government\u2019s attitude to anti-ballistic missile limitation, and plausibly made them support limitations on the technology when they would not have done otherwise. This is a proof of concept indicating that Track II diplomacy can have very large effects on policies that are important for great power relations.&nbsp;</p><p>This case largely supports the \u2018new policy ideas\u2019 theory of change for Track II diplomacy, except that it is an example of an idea for policy improvement being transferred rather than created during Track II dialogue.&nbsp;The case of Pugwash does not provide positive support for the idea that track II dialogues can make agreements more likely through information sharing. However, it does provide support for thinking that Track II dialogues can be important for building trust between&nbsp;participants&nbsp;so they can cooperate more effectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Powerful connections in the Soviet government, trust and frequent contact between American and Soviet scientists, and a window of opportunity where the government was already interested in supporting a particular arms control proposal were key to the success of Pugwash in this case. These three factors are therefore potentially important to the success of Track II diplomacy more generally.</p><p>Overall, this case should make philanthropists interested in reducing risks of great power conflict more optimistic about supporting track II diplomacy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Footnotes and bibliography&nbsp;</h1><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1slSyjFxJeZoZyOZB5duzJ_IwMPR2OUT3PjdtPlaLerE/edit?usp=sharing\">See this document.&nbsp;</a></p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p><i>Thanks to Christian Ruhl, John Halstead, and Matthijs Maas for feedback on this report, and to Stephen Clare for both feedback and excellent research mentorship.

Of course, you may split a longer script into two or more parts. You may send an unlimited number of scripts.</p><h2>Are there any more restrictions?</h2><p>Not really.</p><p>So far, we've only published explainers on the YT channel, but you don't have to limit yourself to explainers. Do you want to write a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/cZYNADOHhVY\">Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant</a> style short story? OK. Do you want to write an anime episode? OK. You can do whatever you want.</p><p>You may also adapt or send older work you've written that you think would make a good video for the YouTube channel if narrated as it is or with some tweaks. In that case you'll win the $500 prize, unless you've made a significant adaptation effort.</p><h2>Assorted things that make a good script, in order of importance:</h2><ol><li>For any claim, you should include sources. The script should be as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jbE85wCkRr9z7tqmD/epistemic-legibility\">epistemically legible</a> as possible for the audience.</li><li>Focus on what really matters. If you write about complex topic X, there will be a few core points that are necessary and sufficient to build a solid understanding of topic X. Focus on those points. Yes, I understand this is a bit vague as a suggestion.</li><li>Don't simplify, but explain. Write for a really smart audience that is ignorant about the topic. Some background explanations can be skipped, and some others are required. Recognizing the difference is a bit of an art.</li><li>Be concise, and avoid useless words and filler phrases.</li><li>Telling stories and using concrete details helps with engagement and works better for teaching.</li><li>How you start matters: if the beginning of the script is boring, that's especially bad for engagement on YouTube.</li><li>Challenge the preconceived assumptions a viewer might have about a topic, if the topic lends itself to it.</li><li>See old topics from new surprising angles, but as with point 7, don't force it.</li></ol><h2>How to send scripts</h2><p>Send your scripts to&nbsp;rationalanimations@gmail.com (beware of the spelling, it's \"rationalanimations\", not \"rationalanimation\").</p><p>In addition to sending the script to the YouTube channel's e-mail, you may also publish it as a comment under this post or as a top-level post in the EA Forum or Less Wrong. If you do, link your post in the e-mail.</p><h2>Deadline</h2><p>October 15th, but you may continue to send scripts after the deadline, and I'll see if I can still offer prizes.&nbsp;</p><h2>Prizes and winners&nbsp;</h2><p>Prizes include:</p><ul><li>5000 USD.

I'd estimate I'm about 85% done with the work (90% CI 70-94), which brings the <strong>total time of making Mineralis to around 1200 hours</strong>.</p><p>In that time I've implemented 440 features, written 300 pages of dialogue, designed a deep combat system, created dozens of maps, and made hundreds of events.</p><p>Given a median developer salary of 80 000 USD / year, it's possible to come to the conclusion that the <strong>time cost of Mineralis is equivalent to 50 000 USD</strong>.</p><p>There are also monetary costs. The greatest so far are marketing (~800 USD) and dialogue editing/proofreading (~680 USD). With other miscellaneous work and advertising, the total <strong>monetary budget is close to 2000 USD</strong>. (The project is somewhat funding constrained, due to high uncertainty about its cost-effectiveness and marginal benefit.)&nbsp;</p><p>Although I've been very efficient, there have been significant opportunity costs, and some social costs as well. I am grateful to my friends and partner for their patience throughout this experiment.&nbsp;</p><h2>Benefits:</h2><p>There are numerous \"hints\" towards EA concepts, although the game is not labeled or branded as an \"EA game\". The characters introduce and debate ideas related to cost-effectiveness, wealth inequality, prioritization, marginal effectiveness, opportunity cost, career planning, longtermism, AI risk, nuclear risk, and large-scale conflict.&nbsp;</p><p>There also are potentially relevant non-EA ideas related to e.g. philosophy, sources of wisdom, the nature of existence, mental wellbeing and depression, social anxiety, education, loss of loved ones, transhumanism, diversity, equity, equality, racism, societal structures, decision-making, teamwork, and conflict resolution.&nbsp;</p><p>The specific subset of discussions/ideas depends on the route (which depends on player decisions).&nbsp;</p><p>My hope is that players will be intrigued enough to further explore and learn about some of these ideas.</p><h2>Cost-effectiveness:</h2><p>Let's analyze <strong>possible upsides</strong> first.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on initial feedback, I'd expect the EA ideas to be of interest to around 20% of players (90% CI 2-35%). I'd expect some of them to be interested enough to actually look up more material about a topic outside the game sooner than they otherwise would have. One test player indicated such action, and my best guess for the size of that subset is 25% (90% CI 15-45%). Further, some of those players may stumble upon the EA movement and read an article or two, where they otherwise wouldn't have. My speculative guess for that subset is 10% (90% CI 4-85%).</p><p>A portion of those people may join the movement (defined as joining one event or writing one post here), or take the GWWC pledge, or change to a more effective career, or start a lifelong habit of philanthropy (defined as donating over 1%p of their net income more than their peers). My wild guess is that the conversion rate from an article into actions taken is 20% (90% CI 5-65%).</p><p>Of course, this funnel is full of assumptions. But it's one data point to consider.&nbsp;</p><p>Putting all those estimates together (in Fermi Paradox style), we get the following figures (assuming one can simply multiply CIs like this):</p><ul><li>Total probability to study outside of the game: 5% (90% CI 0.3-20%) - one for every 30 copies sold.&nbsp;</li><li>Total probability to look into EA: 0.5% (90% CI 0.01-17%) - one for every 300 copies sold.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Total probability to participate or make lifestyle changes: 0.1%</strong> (90% CI 0-11%) - one for every 1500 copies sold.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The number of sold copies is higher than number of players. Based on Steam playtime data, I estimate that ~15% of purchased games are never played and ~20% are played for less than 15 minutes. Thus I estimate that three sales will result in two players.&nbsp;</p><p>Some set of players might be inspired to make a one-time donation, but otherwise not change their views or altruistic disposition. I think the overall impact of those players is negligible.</p><p>All in all, a 0.1% conversion rate to lifestyle changes seems like a reasonable ballpark to work with. I've played a few thousand games, and there have been a handful that caused me to update my views and habits.</p><p>What about the <strong>distribution of sales</strong>?&nbsp;</p><p>Based on a data set on Steam sales, a similar game is (very roughly) this likely to sell more than a specific number of copies:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>copies</td><td>&gt;2500</td><td>&gt;10 000</td><td>&gt;50 000</td><td>&gt;100 000</td><td>&gt;500 000</td></tr><tr><td>likelihood</td><td>45%</td><td>30%</td><td>18%</td><td>11%</td><td>3%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Based on the data set, the <strong>expected value is (very roughly) 42 750 sales</strong>. Plugging that into the guesstimate above, we can (in theory) expect ~29 players to make lifestyle changes.</p><p>Given the combined cost of 52 000 USD to develop the game, with the average sales value we get an <strong>expected cost of ~1793 USD for a single lifestyle change or active EA conversion.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>However, you can see that the variance is huge. There is a <strong>55% chance to go practically unnoticed</strong>. Considering the low marketing budget of Mineralis, I fear that the visibility may skew towards the lower end of that range.</p><p>Based on pre-marketing analytics data, I currently expect to have organic monthly averages of around 48 000 impressions, 13 000 page visits, 240 wishlists, and 50 purchases. That would lead to ~1200 sales over the first two years.</p><p>It's very difficult to guess the effect of marketing and events, but we can reasonably use that as a pessimistic lower bound. It would put the<strong> expected cost of a conversion at a maximum of</strong> <strong>~65 000 USD</strong>.</p><p>Fingers crossed.</p><h1>Open questions:</h1><ol><li>Should the game break the fourth wall and direct interested players to an EA resource? Players hate losing immersion and even mentioning the name could be taken the wrong way by someone. Then again, I'd assume that anyone who e.g. clears the game with specific parameters would be interested.</li><li>Would EA benefit from funding the advertisement and marketing costs of the game? It would be particularly relevant right now, due to the opportune timing of the early October Steam Next Fest, which Mineralis is taking part in.</li><li>Although I personally enjoy working on games as a creative medium, it \"feels\" potentially very ineffective compared to, say, improving the UX and marketing funnel/tools of the AMF or GWWC websites or something. Any thoughts? What is the cost-effectiveness of typical EA meta-work?</li></ol><p>If you're interested in Mineralis or want to give it a try, please wishlist it on Steam! <strong>Any feedback on the game or this post would be most welcome.</strong><br><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1948210/Mineralis/\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1948210/Mineralis/</a>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "mmKALLL"}}, {"_id": "np3KfjMadGsRc5qCm", "title": "'Artificial Intelligence Governance under Change' (PhD dissertation)", "postedAt": "2022-09-15T12:10:14.210Z", "htmlBody": "<p><em>This is a link for my PhD dissertation, \u2018<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vIJUAp_i41A5gc9Tb9EvO9aSuLn15ixq/view\">Artificial Intelligence Governance under Change: Foundations, Facets, Frameworks</a>\u2019.

Happily, I've recently had several people in the EA community tell me they think I'm unusually good at this. With some help, I've decomposed the things I think I do quite well, then found a framework that captures most of it and is hopefully easy to remember.</p><p>Most pieces of this framework come from other people.

It's also a way of clarifying what I think and remembering things that seem to work for me.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>Socratic CODES acronym</strong> highlights the characteristics that (I think) make problem-solving conversations likely to be successful. I explore each in a fair amount of detail, so feel free to skip around.</p><p>For easy reference, let's say I'm trying to help&nbsp;<i>you</i>.</p><h1><strong>Summary</strong></h1><p>In problem-solving conversations, I think it\u2019s usually beneficial to be:</p><ul><li><i><strong>Socratic</strong></i>: avoid making statements; instead, ask questions<ul><li>Be curious and want to deeply understand the problem and its causes.</li><li>Use questions to prompt your partner\u2019s thoughts, treating your own hypotheses as tools for learning more from your partner.</li><li>Doubt both that you fully understand the problem and that your partner is being totally rational (so asking \u2018obvious questions\u2019)</li></ul></li><li><i><strong>C</strong></i><strong>oncrete</strong>: be extremely specific and use examples</li><li><i><strong>O</strong></i><strong>pen</strong>: be warm and honest</li><li><i><strong>D</strong></i><strong>riven</strong>: <i>assume</i> a good solution exists; strongly want to help your partner find where it is and implement it</li><li><i><strong>E</strong></i><strong>xpansive</strong>: expand your partner\u2019s option set by generating - or, better still, helping them to generate - a large number of options<ul><li>These options can be on what goals to aim for, solutions to achieve those goals, and how to make sure those solutions are implemented successfully</li></ul></li><li><i><strong>S</strong></i><strong>upportive</strong>: recognise that this is hard and demonstrate that you are on your partner\u2019s side.</li></ul><h1><strong>Socratic</strong>: avoid making statements; instead, ask questions.</h1><p><a href=\"https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/30-debugging-others\">Neel Nanda</a> explains this method best:</p><blockquote><p>[M]y favourite technique by far is the&nbsp;<strong>Socratic method</strong>. Rather than&nbsp;<i>explaining</i> my idea for a solution, I\u2019ll ask leading questions that can lead&nbsp;<i>them&nbsp;</i>through the thought process I went through. If this goes well, then they\u2019ll generate thoughts such that my solution makes sense. And if this goes even better, they\u2019ll give an unexpected answer to one of my questions! And this is awesome, because it shows I misunderstood something, and we can dig into that, with no harm done. So, either we get to the same point, but in a way that feels more intrinsically motivating, or it fails gracefully and I discover that I\u2019m wrong.</p></blockquote><p>When I say&nbsp;<strong>Socratic</strong>, I mean to refer to the combination of three qualities:</p><ul><li><strong>Curiosity</strong>: I deeply want to understand everything about your issue. What is it? What causes it to happen? How might it be solved? And so on. (Of course, it\u2019s important to give people repeated permission not to share.)<ul><li>I agree with Ben Kuhn's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/listen/\">excellent post on listening</a> that much of good listening is about being curious.</li><li>If you're curious, you'll be more likely to probe details and demonstrate that you care.</li><li>I might ask you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/uqcKKTRWcED6y3WFW/questions-that-lead-to-impactful-conversations#Obvious_Man_Questions_\"><u>obvious-seeming questions</u></a> like, \u2018Why do you want ___?\u2019 These can be surprisingly valuable.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Second-person</strong>: I want to prompt&nbsp;<i>you</i> to explain what's going on, rather than just<i>&nbsp;</i>trying to put forward my own guesses. It's both more efficient and more empowering.<ul><li>This doesn't&nbsp;<i>stop me&nbsp;</i>from trying to guess, it's just that I treat the guess as a hypothesis and ask&nbsp;<i>you&nbsp;</i>if it seems correct. The hypothesis is a tool, not a final stance.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Doubting</strong>, in two ways:<ul><li>I doubt that my understanding of your situation and thoughts is complete.<ul><li>You probably do not think and behave as similarly to me as I think you do. The default state is to&nbsp;<i>misunderstand</i>, so one aim is to figure out&nbsp;<i>not if, but where</i> I'm wrong. I try to come in with an open mind and a \u2018scout mindset\u2019.</li><li>Here\u2019s an analogy. My guess is most mathematicians don't assume their first attempt at a proof will be successful, and they have something like perfect information &amp; no need to interpret others' perspectives and feelings! So it is totally expected that my first guesses will be wrong in some important way.</li><li>This has the side-benefit of demonstrating humility and appropriate epistemic uncertainty.</li></ul></li><li>You're human, so I doubt you're being fully rational. I'd like to find out where you might be making a mistake. This isn't a poor reflection on you.&nbsp;<i>Everyone</i> I know has, at some point:<ul><li>done or not done something for a reason they wouldn't reflectively endorse,</li><li>not considered some option that they would believe was worth considering,</li><li>not sought out some relevant information that might be easy to get, or</li><li>not noticed a relevant connection between thoughts or ideas.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h1><strong>Concrete:&nbsp;</strong>be extremely specific and use examples.</h1><p>Being very specific and using plenty of examples, real world or hypothetical, can hugely improve a conversation. I\u2019ll call this pair of virtues \u2018concreteness\u2019. Concreteness can help to clarify a person\u2019s existing claims, ideas, intuitions, or concerns, as well as supporting them in generating new ideas. Here are some concrete examples (oh, so meta!) of concreteness in action:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Clarifying problem and causes</strong>: You say you want to speak confidently to large groups of people but notice that you sometimes feel distressed and stumble. I might ask you:<ul><li>what exactly happens when you stumble;</li><li>for some examples of times when you stumbled and some examples of times you didn't;</li><li>if, when you feel distressed, you always stumble, or if sometimes other things happen;</li><li>what specific reasons you've had for wanting to speak to large groups of people.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Distinguishing between possible views:&nbsp;</strong>You say you think&nbsp;<i>x</i> might be a good idea but are concerned because it seems very socially costly. I might ask if you're concerned because (a) it's&nbsp;<i>actually</i> very socially costly or (b) it's&nbsp;<i>not</i> actually very costly but&nbsp;<i>feels</i> that way (i.e. feels awkward).</li><li><strong>Suggesting a hypothesis:</strong> I think perhaps you're frustrated about a repeatedly procrastinated task, even though you could easily get everything done, so I ask, \"I sometimes find<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff8czhoc1hfw\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf8czhoc1hfw\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;that I keep procrastinating a task I have pushed back and back, then feel slightly awkward after I finally do it and it takes all of 5 minutes! Could something like that be going on here?\"</li><li><strong>Strengthening a plan:</strong> You say you'll definitely get some task done by the end of the week; I am unsure about this. I might ask, \"<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/murphyjitsu\"><u>Suppose</u></a> it's Sunday afternoon and you're sitting at home, looking over your todo list. Suddenly you realise you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-mortem#:~:text=A%20pre%2Dmortem%2C%20or%20premortem,of%20the%20project%20or%20organization.\"><u>didn't</u></a> get that task done. Vividly imagine this situation. How unlikely or shocking does it seem to you?\"</li><li><strong>Visualising costs and benefits:</strong> I think a plan has little downside, but I think you think there's a big downside to it. I might ask, \"Suppose you did this and it went horribly wrong. If you don't mind, could I ask what the worst thing is that you imagine happening? The more detail, the better. \u2026 And what if it went exceptionally well? What would that look like?\"</li></ol><h1><strong>Open:&nbsp;</strong>be warm and honest</h1><p>Without meaning to blow my own trumpet, it seems I sometimes demonstrate a kind of openness that helps people in turn be willing to open up to me about uncertainties, bottlenecks, mistakes, and so on. But what does openness mean? My guess is that it has two main components.</p><p><strong>First</strong>, I like to think I am quite a&nbsp;<strong>warm</strong> person. That is, I am often able to be friendly, empathetic, and caring. I am far from the warmest person I know, and I can sometimes&nbsp;<i>not</i> be friendly, empathetic, or caring at all, but at my best I think I do a decent job. At my best, I hope that my friendliness makes me approachable, my empathy helps others feel safe, and really caring about solving a person\u2019s problem helps that person feel supported and optimistic.</p><p>I think the \u2018caring\u2019 part can be broken down into being&nbsp;<i>driven</i> and being&nbsp;<i>supportive</i>; more on each soon.</p><p>If you would like to be warmer, I\u2019m not sure what to advise. It probably depends on your situation. But here are some off-the-cuff suggestions:</p><ol><li><strong>Find reasons to genuinely care about your conversation partner.</strong></li><li><strong>Practise gratitude.</strong> It is well-documented that thinking of things to be grateful for can make you more happy. Happier people are often also warmer in how they interact with others.</li><li><strong>Take a step back and be excited!</strong> Out of all the possible ways the world could be, you and your conversation partner exist. Not only that, you\u2019re in the same room together and can communicate in a rich way. Your partner has unique and fascinating experiences to share, and you\u2019ve been given this unique moment to get to know them - and, perhaps help them through a tough problem. This is extraordinary, crazy, and cool!</li></ol><p><strong>Second, </strong>I tend to be honest and direct (like many in the Effective Altruism community). This is not always convenient, and probably is not always optimal in terms of helping others feel better. And I can\u2019t say that I\u2019ve carefully weighed the costs and benefits of directness over a more indirect or cautious approach; I just much prefer being direct. But one potential benefit is that directness can build trust. Suppose I tell you something that seems true but unflattering, like, \u2018Yes, it looks to me like that was a poor choice. But you can fix this situation.\u2019 I now provide you with evidence that I am willing to say things that are true but unflattering. To some kinds of people at least, this is a positive thing.</p><p>Another form of honesty is&nbsp;<strong>self-disclosure</strong>: mentioning something private, such as something that I personally struggled with, big or small.</p><p>Self-disclosure can be&nbsp;<i>bad</i>. If, upon learning a person is grieving the loss of their grandfather, you tell them you know how it feels because you remember the enormous difficulty you went through when your father died, you may unwittingly shift the focus onto you and engage in a competition for who has dealt with the toughest situation. (This is, of course, not the only case in which self-disclosure may be inappropriate.)</p><p>However, it can also be a useful tool, because it can show three things:</p><ol><li>A&nbsp;<strong>willingness to disclose</strong>. By making yourself vulnerable in this way, you may both earn the trust of your conversation partner and grant her permission to be vulnerable too.</li><li>A&nbsp;<strong>shared context</strong>. While no two people\u2019s feelings are exactly the same, a former chain smoker can better understand a current chain smoker than can a person who has never smoked</li><li>A&nbsp;<strong>problem-solving approach and reason for hope</strong>, if you solved the problem that you disclose. If you could solve a problem that seemed difficult, perhaps your conversation partner could too, and perhaps they can trust you to help them through.</li></ol><h1><strong>Driven:&nbsp;</strong>we are going to solve this problem</h1><p><i><strong><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667994885/mirroredImages/APYu8MmwfNSiaZ2Ez/d7nhcuci5r3aoeaosai8.png\"></strong></i></p><h2><strong>Assume a solution exists</strong></h2><p>Sometimes, a person does not want to solve a particular problem. Perhaps they want instead to vent about it, because it has been frustrating them. In appropriate amounts, venting can be very useful and I have nothing against it.</p><p>But if I\u2019m talking to a person who is interested in solving a problem, I like to throw myself into the challenge. There&nbsp;<i>is</i> a solution, and we are going to find it together! Then we\u2019re going to do our best to make it work.&nbsp;</p><p>This is&nbsp;<i>not</i> mere wishful thinking. I have noticed that many of my and others\u2019 default behaviours and approaches are far from optimal. Especially when we\u2019re&nbsp;<i>specifically talking about problems</i> - things that seem wrong - it\u2019s very likely that there\u2019s some big improvement to be found, and often the improvement is surprisingly straightforward. When I say \u2018There&nbsp;<i>is</i> a solution,\u2019 I do not necessarily mean that there\u2019s a&nbsp;<i>perfect solution</i>, just that there\u2019s a way of resolving the problem that is significantly better than what you would do by default. Solutions aren\u2019t always beautiful; they are often just a set of next steps to gather information, e.g. \u2018Cold message 10 people in ___ field and ask ___ and ___. If no-one replies, then ___.\u2019 But that could be a lot better than what your partner would otherwise do. All that is left is for us to find it and for you to implement it.</p><p>You might say that there\u2019s not always even a significant improvement. Suppose Bob has carefully considered all his options in a difficult situation and decided on some least-unsatisfactory option. In that case, I might not be able to help him find something much better. This is true in theory, but in practice I have found these cases to be rare.&nbsp;<strong>In practice, I find it is best to doggedly assume the existence of a solution (i.e. significant improvement over default) and set out to find it.</strong></p><p>Why is this helpful? It seems that you are more likely to succeed at most goals when&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mindingourway.com/stop-trying-to-try-and-try/\"><u>success is a background assumption</u></a> than when the question, \u2018Will I succeed?\u2019 is explicit in your mind. If a solution is assumed to exist but you can\u2019t help your partner find it, it\u2019s on you and you have failed. (This happens sometimes, and it\u2019s OK, but you own it.) If instead you\u2019re unsure whether the solution exists, you can always say you tried but there just wasn\u2019t a solution; then it\u2019s the world\u2019s fault, and not yours, and you might not be quite so persistent. Persistence helps you find creative solutions and expand your partner\u2019s perceived option set - more on this in the next section.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsn8nevfwqj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsn8nevfwqj\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>I think I made the shift from asking&nbsp;<i>if</i> there was a solution to asking&nbsp;<i>where</i> it was without even realising it, some time after I noticed that, when I really looked for a solution there almost always was one.</p><h2><strong>Really care about finding a solution</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Apparently, it can feel like I&nbsp;<i>\u2018adopt\u2019</i> my conversation partner\u2019s problem for the duration of the conversation. There are two ways in which really caring about solving the problem is useful for helping your partner reach a solution.&nbsp;<strong>First</strong>, it makes me more likely to ask good questions, probe when it makes sense, and think better in general.&nbsp;<strong>Second,</strong> at my best, I think I give off energy, optimism, and excitement, which may be contagious and help bring that solution to fruition.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to explain what it feels like internally to really care about finding a solution, though one concrete example is given in the&nbsp;<i>Expansiveness</i> section when I introduce the \u2018resolve cycle\u2019 technique. At my best, I see a problem someone is having, see the suboptimal way things are likely to go by default<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefympgw4mekpn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnympgw4mekpn\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and feel an urge to find a better way. My guess is that it\u2019s some combination of wanting to solve a puzzle and defy a challenge, having a taste for solutions and efficiency, empathy and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mindingourway.com/desperation/\"><u>desperation</u></a>. My exact motivation will be different in every case. Of course, this relies on believing there is probably a solution: a better way (above).</p><h2><strong>Make it happen</strong></h2><p>Often, I know that I have a problem, I know roughly what to do about it, yet the problem remains unresolved for some time. This is OK if I\u2019ve deliberately deprioritised implementing the solution - there is only so much effort a person can exert every day - but usually that\u2019s not the case and it\u2019s just a massive waste.</p><p>I\u2019m keen to prevent my conversation partner from suffering in the same way. My aim is not to tell you what to want, or even prescribe what to do; but I care that,&nbsp;<i>IF you want something AND think that some solution is a good and worthwhile way of getting it, you implement that solution.</i>&nbsp;<strong>In general, this will not happen automatically.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>I repeat: this will&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>not</strong></i><strong> happen automatically.</strong></p><p>So I tend to follow something like the following three-step process:</p><ol><li><strong>Double-check that the solution is one my partner actually likes and wants to go for.&nbsp;</strong>This means that they have a clear view of the possible costs and benefits, believe the benefits outweigh the costs, and believe that it is a better approach to solving the problem than what they might otherwise do. While I do my best to help my partner come up with their own solution, occasionally I end up overconfident in my own guesses at solutions or assuming that they want the same things I might want. So I want to be sure I haven\u2019t missed something.<br><br>\u201cDo you really want to go with this solution and make it work? You're allowed not to want that! But if you want to do this, I want to help you figure out how to make it as likely as possible<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref57ia02vgfga\"><sup><a href=\"#fn57ia02vgfga\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;to succeed.\u201d</li><li><strong>Figure out failure modes together</strong>. This often involves doing a pre-mortem - asking my partner to assume that, at a particular future time, this plan has failed, then figure out why, and sometimes suggesting reasons I\u2019m concerned it might fail.</li><li><strong>Ask if they want&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JDpJEX9YaAEqXYPiu/tips-resources-for-getting-long-term-value-from-retreats\"><strong><u>accountability</u></strong></a><strong> or to find ways to make those failure modes less likely.</strong></li></ol><h1><strong>Expansive:&nbsp;</strong>there are a&nbsp;<i>lot</i> of possible options</h1><p>Many people artificially&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chanamessinger.com/blog/building-agency-list\"><u>constrain their options</u></a> on what they can want and how they can get there. That is, they think there are fewer options than there actually are. (Spoiler: there&nbsp;<i>definitely aren\u2019t only two options!&nbsp;</i>But the third, or thirteenth, option can sometimes be hard to see.) To be expansive is to introduce a wide range of possible options for consideration - options for what to aim for, options for potential solutions, and options for ways to make sure a solution happens (e.g. different types of accountability system).</p><p>Expansiveness goes hand in hand with drive, since you are much more likely to do this if you believe there is a solution (i.e. big improvement on default approach to problem) and really care about finding it. Let\u2019s see how they interact.</p><p>One part of being driven is to assume that there is&nbsp;<i>a solution</i>. Being expansive involves assuming that there are a&nbsp;<i>lot</i> of possible solutions. So the expansive person will then suggest - or, better still, help his partner generate - a wide range of possible solutions. Then, being driven to find a solution, he will help his partner figure out which of these solutions is best for her.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefb4qusjj2taa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnb4qusjj2taa\">[6]</a></sup></span><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Concrete examples of expansiveness</strong></h2><h3><strong>Expansiveness in finding a new solution</strong></h3><ul><li>I sometimes like the stimulating effect of caffeine, but I get stomach pain, jitters, and some anxiety when consuming moderate-to-large amounts of coffee.

One person he met arranged an internship for him, and from there he got a job that would otherwise have been inaccessible.</li></ul><p>(My caffeine improvement was clearly less transformative than Reggie\u2019s door-knocking; I include both to show that expansiveness can help solve problems big and small.)</p><h3><strong>Expansiveness in different viewpoints from which to see things</strong></h3><ul><li>I have often found it useful (for myself and others) to think explicitly of benefits and costs.

In particular, there are many psychological biases against taking \u2018upside bargains\u2019: doing things that have a low probability of high upside, but are also quite easy to do and have little downside, and this can be better recognised when thinking probabilistically and aiming to take the best bet with the information you have.</li><li>The Reverend Thomas Bayes had the ingenious idea of flipping probability theory on its head. Instead of interpreting conditional probability as \u2018chance of observing evidence, given hypothesis\u2019, he interpreted it as \u2018chance of hypothesis being true, given observed evidence\u2019, transforming many important models and decision-making processes.</li></ul><h3><strong>Expansiveness in ways to implement a solution</strong></h3><ul><li>By creating video chats in which strangers book video call work appointments, announce their intentions for a session, recount their progress at the end of the call, and have appropriately-timed breaks,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.focusmate.com/\"><u>Focusmate</u></a> has enhanced many people\u2019s ability to complete aversive tasks.</li><li>I wanted to follow a certain work plan for a week, but I suspected that at times I would find this aversive and be tempted to stray for the worse.

You rush to find pen and paper or something to type on, then scribble down as many ideas as pop into your head. You\u2019re not too worried about the quality of your possible solutions, at least at the start, because what matters is that you have some passable ideas; you might later filter out ones that seem especially high-effort or unlikely to succeed, if you come up with more than 15.</p><p>You might start like this (though with each option written in shorthand):</p><ol><li>Check file isn\u2019t backed up anywhere by using multiple search tools and asking friend if he used any backup services.</li><li>Check trash</li><li>Recreate presentation from scratch with him in remaining time</li></ol><p>This is where some people would stop.

This may be true especially, but not only, if I deeply care about their goals. Whether EA-related or otherwise, the attitude I often want to convey is, \u2018You\u2019re on my team. I want you to win.\u2019 If this is felt, it can help, alongside other factors like shared context and problem-solving drive, to create a high-trust environment.</p><p>Many goals, let alone EA goals, are hard to achieve. It\u2019s tough to have a conversation with someone in which you admit to something that is holding you back but don\u2019t know exactly what to do about it. It\u2019s tough to think carefully about root causes; about what solutions will and won\u2019t work. You might have earnestly tried a lot of things and had none of them work for you. You might have worried about this problem but felt powerless to change it. The feeling I get is something like, 'It\u2019s not just that I want your problem to be solved, but that I want you to solve it and your life to become better.'</p><p>For those tougher times, it\u2019s nice to know that there\u2019s someone on your side who cares about you deeply, believes in you, and wants you to succeed.</p><h2><strong>Debugging, not blaming</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>I aim to stick firmly to a \u2018debugging\u2019 framing, both with myself and with others. I find the analogy with debugging code useful. Upon noticing an error in a software program, you could:</p><ol><li>Angrily delete all the code and start from scratch. The coder must be stupid. Why else would there be a bug?</li><li>Find the cause of the bug and fix it.</li></ol><p>Now, (a) sounds \u2013 and is \u2013 harebrained. Clearly, (b) is the better option. The fix needed and cause identified in (b) might be deep, but the commitment is to focusing on finding the best, i.e. most appropriate, cause to target, rather than being emotional and assuming some deep moral failing. When talking to you about your problems, I refrain from blaming you,&nbsp;<i>not</i> because you shouldn\u2019t be responsible but because responsibility isn\u2019t the point; we're simply not in the realm of fault/blame, but in the business of seeing what's wrong and how to fix it.</p><h2><strong>Concrete ways to be more supportive</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Practise empathy.</strong> Think for a moment what it would feel like to be in your conversation partner\u2019s situation.</li><li><strong>Appreciate the gift of your partner\u2019s trust.</strong> They may be revealing to you a deep challenge and trusting you to help them through it.</li><li><strong>Give specific, genuine compliments.</strong> I find myself often saying, \"Honestly, it seems to me like you're insecure about *x* and way underestimating your ability, because...\"</li><li><strong>Remember the absurdity and wonder of it all.</strong> Out of all the world\u2019s possibilities, somehow these 14,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms came together to form two bundles of about 37 trillion cells - you and your partner - that are able to interact and share rich and detailed thoughts to solve problems and reach your goals in this very moment. That\u2019s incredible.</li></ul><p>I\u2019ll end this section by quoting from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mindingourway.com/not-yet-gods/\"><u>Nate Soares</u></a>, who finds that thinking of people as striving monkeys improves his empathy. I have not tried this technique, but nonetheless find this passage inspiring:</p><blockquote><p>We're monkeys, and we're fairly fragile monkeys at that.</p><p>So you don't need to beat yourself up when you miss your targets. You don't need to berate yourself when you fail to act exactly as you wish to act. \u2026</p><p>Don't berate the monkey. Help it, whenever you can. It wants the same things you want \u2014 it's you. Assist, don't badger. Figure out how to make it easy to act as you wish. Retrain the monkey. Experiment. Try things.</p><p>And be kind to it. It's trying pretty hard. The monkey doesn't know exactly how to get what it wants yet, because it's embedded in a really big complicated world and it doesn't get to see most of it, and because a lot of what it does is due to a dozen different levels of subconscious cause-response patterns that it has very little control over. It's trying.</p><p>Don't berate the monkey just because it stumbles. \u2026 The things we're trying to do are hard. So when the monkey runs into an obstacle and falls, help it to its feet. Help it practice, or help it train, or help it execute the next clever plan on your list of ways to overcome the obstacles before you.</p><p>One day, we may be able to choose our cognitive patterns at will, and effortlessly act as we wish. \u2026 But we aren't there yet. We're not gods.
