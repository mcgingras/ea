You mentioned that it may be irrelevant to the broader point I am making, and I would agree with that statement. &nbsp;(The point I am making is that ChatGPT engages in reasoning <i>in the examples I give</i>, and this reasoning would involve the primary aspects of two theories of consciousness). I'll respond to a couple of your individual statements below: &nbsp;</p><p><i>\"<strong>If I slightly change the prompt it appears GPT does have the knowledge and can use it, without needing instruction.\"</strong></i></p><p>The fact that ChatGPT gets the answer correct when you slightly change the prompt (with the use of the word \"order\") only shows that ChatGPT has done what it usually does, which is to give a correct answer. The correct answer could be the result of using reasoning <i>or</i> next-word-probabilities based on training data. As usual, we don't know what is going on \"under the hood.\"&nbsp;</p><p>The fact that ChatGPT can get an answer wrong when a question is worded one way, but right when the question is worded a different way, doesn't really surprise me at all. In fact, that's exactly what I would expect to happen.<strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>***The point of presenting a problem in a way that ChatGPT initially cannot get correct is so that we can <i>tease-out</i> next-word-probabilities and context as an explanation for the appearance of reasoning (which leaves only <i>actual</i> reasoning) to explain ChatGPT's transition from the wrong answer to the right answer.***&nbsp;</p><p>Presumably, if ChatGPT gets the answer incorrect the first time due to a lack of context matching up with training data, then the chances that ChatGPT could get every word correct in its next answer based solely on the training data that were <i>previously inadequate</i> seem likely to be much less than one percent. It could happen by coincidence, but when you look at all the examples in the three sessions, the chances that ChatGPT could appear to learn and reason only by coincidence <i>every time </i>would approach zero.</p><p>What I'm trying to say is not \"ChatGPT gets an answer wrong.\" I'm trying to say \"ChatGPT gets an answer right, after it gets the answer wrong, simply by reasoning (since we teased out next-word-probabilities).\"&nbsp;</p><p>(I address the possibility that the small number of words I supply in the \"lesson\" as additional context could increase the next-word-probabilities slightly, in the \"mimicking learning\" paragraph near the end of my original post.)&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>\"For example that the level of tutoring/explanation you give it isn't really necessary etc., though as I note I'm unsure if this changes how you would interpret the outputs]:\"</strong></i></p><p>Right, the tutoring isn't necessary if the problem is worded one way, but it is necessary if the problem is worded a different way. That's the point of wording the problem in the way that I did (so that we can tease out the training data and next-word probabilities as an explanation for the conversion from wrong to right output). &nbsp;</p><p>--</p><p>In terms of presenting my argument in the original post, I probably didn't explain it clearly, which resulted in confusion. My apologies for that.

This just shows more true reasoning is going on though (in my opinion), since ChatGPT was able to figure out the concept by working backward from the answer.

If anything, this <i>strengthens</i> the case that ChatGPT has periods of consciousness (based on reasoning). While this doesn't change my thesis, it gives me a new technique to use when testing for reasoning, so it's very useful. Again, great idea!
