(My initial description of the internal review is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9JCkkjKMNL4Hmg4qP/ev-uk-board-statement-on-owen-s-resignation?commentId=CRdikDzzK2z92GLSs\"><u>here</u></a>). In general, these changes have been progressing prior to knowing the boards\u2019 determinations, though thinking from Zach and the EV legal team has been an important input throughout.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Changes&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Overall we spent dozens of hours over multiple calendar months in discussions and doing writeups, both internally to our team and getting feedback from Interim CEA CEO Ben West and others. Several team members did retrospectives or analyses on the case, and we consulted with external people (two EAs with some experience thinking about these topics as well as seven professionals in HR, law, consulting and ombuds) for advice on our processes generally.&nbsp;</p><p>From this we created a list of practices to change and additional steps to add. The casework team also reflected on many past cases to check that these changes were robust and applicable across a wide variety of casework.&nbsp;</p><p>Our changes, in rough order of importance:</p><ol><li>Defaulting more often to getting input from more people on the team (especially if a case involves someone with power in the EA community) by having multiple caseworkers on a case and/or involving managers for oversight<ol><li>Specifically, most cases now get seen by more than one person, particularly cases that involve someone with sufficient power in the community (confidentiality constraints may limit how many caseworkers work on a case.)</li></ol></li><li>For the cases we take on, we have a lower bar for proactively reaching out to members to the community in order to get more information. For example, if this same case came up again, we would weigh more highly the importance of getting additional information from the woman Zach mentions above. Our previous approach pointed in this direction as well, but this change will make it less likely we miss an important opportunity.</li><li>We are creating a system that automatically flags to us when complaints about the same person come to different caseworkers, making us more likely to catch patterns of poor behavior (this previously was caught in a less systematic way)</li><li>We have lowered the bar for what\u2019s considered a personal conflict of interest and improved our systems so it is easier to pass a case on to another caseworker. For instance, if the same case came up again, we would have it owned by someone else.</li><li>We\u2019ve added and improved written internal guidelines for considerations to take into account during cases, particularly for cases involving someone with power in the EA community. Previously these were distributed across different documents and tacit understanding; they are now more formalized.&nbsp;</li><li>Automatic reminders for follow-ups on old cases to see if any more action is needed</li><li>An update towards overcommunication and explicitness when giving feedback to people whose behavior we\u2019d like to change; an update against assuming the feedback has been understood and incorporated</li><li>An update towards escalations to boards, legal teams and HR departments where relevant.&nbsp;</li><li>Better systems (reminders, templates in meetings, etc) for making sure balls aren\u2019t dropped based on when or how information comes in<br>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>The casework side of our team meets monthly to check that we are using our systems effectively, that we have implemented these changes with new and existing cases, and to update our internal guidelines as needed.</p><p><strong>Some notes on the changes</strong></p><p>I\u2019m glad we have these changes, though I think it\u2019s worth noting my guess that a big part of what will end up driving change here is also in large part due to CH team members\u2019 individual reflections on the original events (Time article + statement from Owen + original case).&nbsp;</p><p>The list of changes is not exhaustive, since many of the changes stemming from this internal review (depending on your bar for \u201cpolicy change\u201d) are quite small e.g. \u201cadding a consideration to our list of factors that may make a case more serious.\u201d I think those \u201cnudge\u201d type changes are important and useful for incorporating data without over-updating or over-bureacratizing, though they are harder to assess externally. In general I\u2019m trying to convey our high level changes without creating a laundry list. Nonetheless I hope the descriptions of our process changes help people make accurate updates and have accurate expectations about our team.</p><p>There is some broader context, which is that the casework team\u2019s approach in January of 2023 (before the Time article came out) was already in significant ways different than in 2021. For instance, since Catherine joined in late 2021 (and even more so since Charlotte joined in 2023), the casework team has been able to double-check cases more often and have a lower bar for passing on cases where there was a personal connection. The changes as a result of the internal review add on to these previous shifts.&nbsp;</p><p>We\u2019ll be checking in as a team at regular intervals to reflect on the value of these changes at getting better outcomes. This refers both to whether the increased time and effort per case looks like the right call (relative to e.g. handling more cases) and whether the decisions made are overall better (rather than the changes overfitting to this specific instance).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What\u2019s still underway</strong></p><p>In addition to the changes in how we handle personal COIs (with some person one team member has a COI with), we\u2019re still working on a general approach to&nbsp;<i>institutional</i> COIs and what constitutes one, e.g. if a case involves someone in EV leadership. So far our planned approach is to ask for a person external to EV to give an independent view when such an institutional COI comes up in a case we take on, but it\u2019s not obvious that there will always be an appropriate person willing. This will need more work to figure out.</p><p>As Zach indicates above, we\u2019ll be working on a more formalized version of our current processes for escalation, COIs, and anything else the boards ask for.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "ChanaMessinger"}}, {"_id": "xN9ix3Xy6zzwKuQME", "postedAt": "2024-01-29T22:17:22.973Z", "postId": "4CBoJ5jgmGfdMFnAE", "htmlBody": "<p>I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t handle this better in the first place.

I assume one sensible way to make decisions that improve the welcomingness for particular groups is to ask representatives of that group whether a particular decision would make them feel more or less welcome. In the absence of general solicitation to that effect (at least with respect to this decision), I am giving my unsolicited opinion (which obviously introduces bias, but I'm thinking the value is mostly by pointing out that some type of opinion exists rather than thinking that anyone should make strong inferences about the distribution of opinions).<br><br>Here is the information I have that might be useful:<br><br>I have many interactions with Owen, since 2015 or so, originally as a much younger (late teens), new-to-EA, and female person, and in many situations where he had substantial power dynamics relative to me. I found him extremely respectful, kind, supportive, and empowering. He actively increased my intellectual and social confidence and made me feel safe, comfortable and welcome in the community. I think it would have been a big loss to me personally not to have interacted with Owen, and from my perspective he substantially <i>improved</i> the fabric of the community. For me, I expect that having Owen present in a community space would make it feel safer and more welcoming, even if I didn't know him already.&nbsp;<br><br>More specifically with respect to safety and unhealthy power dynamics, there was a particular episode (related to people who are no longer part of the community) where I was in a situation which was pressuring and manipulative and had weird power dynamics. Owen's support and advice was helpful for me keeping my sanity and perspective and avoiding getting sucked in. This was downstream of particular personality traits and ways of interacting with people that would likely be helpful to other people he interacted with too, including: listening intently and taking people very seriously even when they're junior; presenting his opinions in a way that doesn't force them onto others; being generally calm, reasonable and gentle in manner.<br><br>Similar to comments by Emma and Jonas, I want to prevent people taking away what I would consider a misleading picture of Owen's behavior, because I think people having a misleading picture will make it harder to achieve the goal of making the community more welcoming.<br><br>I think people might read from this post that it matches a pattern of predatory or nefarious behavior - which definitely does exist, and which I think should be handled very aggressively by removing people from the community, which I have advocated in other cases. &nbsp;Whereas, I think the pattern in this case is social clumsiness, some misunderstandings, and some psychological hangups around scrupulosity and needing to confess attraction and receive moral validation.&nbsp;<br><br>I think the latter pattern of behavior should be handled differently than the former, and I think it's very important information for people to know when deciding e.g.:<br>- &nbsp;how likely is Owen to cause similar problems in the future?<br>- what is the net effect of Owen's presence in a community space?<br>- in what way do they personally want to interact with Owen?<br>&nbsp;- what interventions could be undertaken to prevent problems like this from occurring in the future?<br>- what warning signs indicate that someone might be at risk of causing similar problems?<br>- what should they take away from this situation as to what their response should be to someone who <i>is</i> displaying predatory behavior? (in particular, I think that if this <i>was</i> part of a pattern of sociopathic or predatory behavior, I think the response is significantly too mild, and I wouldn't want people to reproduce this response in that situation)<br><br>I am also somewhat worried that the accounts as stated might provide a slightly inaccurate picture of the events; I am particularly surprised about the claim that \"Owen did not stop making repeated unwanted attempts at contact after being asked to do so\". Based on my experiences with him, I personally would strongly predict that this was based on misunderstanding or confusion about what the other person wanted rather than Owen knowingly ignoring someone's requests.&nbsp;This is obviously not hard evidence, but if many people had similar reactions it might suggest there was either something wrong with the investigation, or with the framing of the conclusions, or with my and other people's ability to predict people's behavior!<br><br>Again, I obviously can't know how much harm Owen's actions caused other people. But if I was asked to give an overall judgement, in terms of:<br>- harm caused to people from interacting with Owen<br>- benefit to people from interacting with Owen<br>- how inviting vs unsafe community spaces feel for people, if they know that people are excluded on the basis of behavior like Owen's<br>then I would guess that it is substantially better to include Owen in community spaces.</p><p>More generally, I feel subjectively highly confident that Owen is broadly well described as:</p><ul><li>highly morally scrupulous, kind, and careful person</li><li>would hate to cause someone to feel unsafe or uncomfortable</li><li>thinks a lot about other people\u2019s comfort and how to make them feel happy and safe,</li><li>would only ever cause someone to feel uncomfortable by accident</li><li>would make concerted + successful efforts to change if he was told something he was doing was causing problems for someone</li><li>tries hard to view and interact with people how they would want to be viewed and interacted with</li><li>acknowledges his limitations and takes careful steps to compensate for these&nbsp;</li><li>engages deeply and sensitively with different perspectives and understands that good intentions are not sufficient for avoiding causing other people harm</li></ul><p>and is <strong>not</strong> well-described as:</p><ul><li>someone who is callous about other people\u2019s needs and sense of safety</li><li>puts his own needs ahead of theirs</li><li>feels entitled to ask things of them</li><li>isn\u2019t interested in learning about how his actions affected people or changing his behavior</li><li>views or treats people in a sexualized or objectified manner</li><li>doesn\u2019t acknowledge power dynamics, social and societal context, highly subjective nature of social interactions</li><li>thinks that if they weren\u2019t deliberately doing harm, and it seemed fine to them, then everything\u2019s fine and anyone complaining of being harmed is just making a fuss</li></ul><p><br>I am sharing this under a pseudonym for reasons like \"not wanting this content to be something that comes up if someone searches my name in a professional context\".

That is to say, I think most people have done many things that are more blameworthy (in terms of the amount of harm caused, and the effort that would have been required on their part to avoid it) as the things listed here. I think if we banned everyone from the community who had caused this level of suffering with this level of avoidability, I'm not sure there would be anyone left. This kind of justice or proportionality is obviously not the only criteria on which decisions like this should be made, and there are good reasons to have strict policies around particular types of harm even if those policies sometimes lead to locally unjust decisions, but I think it bears acknowledging.</p></div></li></ol>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "lyra"}}, {"_id": "HiLNtxdWWv27AB67i", "postedAt": "2024-01-30T00:57:33.386Z", "postId": "4CBoJ5jgmGfdMFnAE", "htmlBody": "<p>I worked closely with Owen for several years.

I agree that autistics are almost certainly more likely to make innocent-but-harmful mistakes in this context. But I'm a bit worried about overcorrection for that for a few reasons:&nbsp;<br><br>Firstly, men in general (and presumably women to some degree also), autistic or otherwise are already incredibly good at self-deception about the actions they take to get sex (source: basic commonsense). So giving a particular subset of us more of an excuse to think \"I didn't realize I would upset her\", when the actual facts are more \"I did know there was a significant risk, but I couldn't resist because I really wanted to have sex with her\", seems a bit fraught. I think this is different from the sort of predatory, unrepentant narcissism that Jonas Vollmer says we shouldn't ascribe to Owen: it's a kind of self-deception perfectly compatible with genuine guilt at your own bad behavior and certainly with being a kind and nice person overall. I actually think the feminism-associated* meme about sexual bad behavior being always really about misogyny or dominance can sometimes obscure this for people a bit.<br><br>Secondly, I worry that &nbsp;people who are both autistic or at least autistic-coded <i>and</i> predatory can take advantage of a perception that their bad behavior is always a mistake and not deliberate. I <i>strongly</i> suspect SBF, though he is not a diagnosed autistic, deliberately exploited a perception that \"nerds\" are not socially savvy enough to engage in deliberate deception.&nbsp;<br><br>Thirdly, I'm worried about being patronized.&nbsp;<br><br>Fourthly, I'm worried that if the association between \"autistic\" and (even accidental) \"sexual misconduct risk\" becomes too strong in people's heads, this will actually lead to overcorrection in the other way, with people becoming <i>too reluctant</i> to hire autistics. (Probably not an issue in EA to the degree it would be in less autistic communities though.) &nbsp;We don't actually <i>know</i> how much more likely autistics are to behave badly in which particular ways.&nbsp;<br><br>Alas 4 and 1 kind of point in opposite directions.&nbsp;<br><br>*My guess is that feminists who've actually written carefully and at length about sexual bad behaviour have more nuanced views than this, and often when they cite \"misogyny\" as an explanation, they mean something structural, not something in the psychology of people who behave badly.)&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "qHBFSFSMzBAC33KRK", "user": {"username": "Dr. David Mathers"}}, {"_id": "9LDiG4psPeDrn64La", "postedAt": "2024-01-30T12:40:53.512Z", "postId": "4CBoJ5jgmGfdMFnAE", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>[T]here is a certain irony to see these two people coming to defend Owen while the community health head, Julia, admits to a certain level of bias when handling this affair since he was her friend.</p></blockquote><p>Jonas's comment includes statements like \"This obviously doesn\u2019t make his past behavior any less bad and doesn\u2019t excuse any of it\" and \"I think a temporary ban is important, both as an incentive against bad behavior and as a precaution so the harms don\u2019t continue.

This isn't yet a fleshed out argument, but I have the intuition that if we react with all-out outrage at even comparatively more fixable/improvable incidents of harm, we'll do a worse job at having the energy and vigilance to maximally pursue the worst cases of it, which often also involve a lot of deception and \"enemy action\" that distorts the discourse around what's happening and around \"who's the bad party?.\" In those situations, you really want people who can pay attention to lots of subtleties of character and don't fall into outrage traps around whose side is currently winning.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "wD44sbmtegKyckNBL", "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}, {"_id": "8GTpjPYHbwf8aeAd5", "postedAt": "2024-01-30T12:44:49.677Z", "postId": "4CBoJ5jgmGfdMFnAE", "htmlBody": "<p>The post did a great job at describing exactly what is reproached to Owen.

But there's also an issue with not wanting to ascribe to anyone how we think they likely feel, without knowing much about them. Like, maybe at least some of the women who had negative experiences have nuanced feelings that <i>aren't</i> best described as \"I feel bad/invalidated whenever I see someone say positive things about Owen, even if they take care to not thereby downplay that the things he did weren't acceptable.\" Maybe some feel things like, \"this stuff was messed up and really needed to be dealt with, and it sucks that it took so long/seemed like initially it wasn't going to be dealt with, but it seems like things are developing in a good direction now.\" Or maybe not! Maybe they're still super upset and wish that Owen never re-enter the community again. That would be their right and seems understandable, too. In any case, the way I see it, we don't know at this point (at least I don't), and while I agree that it's important to create encouraging incentives so people will be likely to report future instances of misconduct, I don't think this requires a policy of \"avoid <i>at all costs</i> saying things that <i>might</i> make someone who was affected uncomfortable.\" (In fact, there's also a risk of making people less likely to report uncomfortable experiences if they worry that there'll be a community overreaction. That's not the first thing I'd worry about, to be clear; I'm just pointing out that this could happen/be someone's reason to be hesitant about speaking up about something.) Personally, the message I find most important is something like: I want us to take seriously that it's unacceptable for people to predictably be at risk to have bad experiences like that in the EA community, and the community/Community Health takes this seriously and takes appropriate action.<br><br>I expressed support of another person's comment that contained many positive points about Owen. I hope that no one feels like this means I'm \"on Owen's side\" rather than on the side of the people who brought up these complaints. Owen seems to largely agree about the facts of what happened, and he seems genuinely committed to making sure similar stuff doesn't happen again, plus he accepted the consequences (stepping down, two-year ban). These features of the situation IMO make it possible to not have to view this as \"either you support the victims, <i>or</i> you can say a redeeming thing or two about Owen.\"<br><br>This option of \"not thinking of the situation as one where it's about picking sides\" isn't always available. If a person accused of causing harm goes <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARVO\">DARVO</a> and accuses the alleged victims to be malefactors in return who make up false stories, then one is forced to either side with the alleged victims, <i>or</i> with the accused. Similarly, sometimes someone does something that's immediately strong evidence that they are operating without even a desire to respect others (Milena Cenzler's comment originally contained a hyperlink to the case of Brock Turner, who sexually assaulted an unconscious woman, as an example of how comments by supporters can sometimes be re-traumatizing to the victims). In those cases, it also seems to me like one can't say much that's redeeming about the person who caused harm without this being disrespectful towards the victims, both because of the severity of what they faced and because there's not much redeeming you can say about someone who even lacks a basic desire/intent to respect others.

I don't think that's the case, but this would be another situation we want to try to avoid, so I feel like the people who say positive things about Owen have a responsibility to consider the possibility \"am I being manipulated?.\"&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "QtmYtZSaTxy8nD7oJ", "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}, {"_id": "gu6y2Ef6nGZ5kANeu", "postedAt": "2024-02-02T14:58:56.388Z", "postId": "4CBoJ5jgmGfdMFnAE", "htmlBody": "<p>As we got more caseworkers, practices like getting input / sanity-checking from other caseworkers and managers on important cases have been helpful in a variety of situations.</p>", "parentCommentId": "rzYvnLYxi4HqtFPvL", "user": {"username": "Julia_Wise"}}, {"_id": "hMXJ4Ft5GWq86MKcx", "postedAt": "2024-02-02T18:30:25.870Z", "postId": "4CBoJ5jgmGfdMFnAE", "htmlBody": "<p>Sorry, was being somewhat sloppy - I meant to broadly wave at \"I think sexual harassment is bad\".

I think the probability of those things holding for more than 2-3 years is less than even. There's also nothing to preclude future Boards from removing these restrictions on Owen's petition -- in fact, it would be somewhat difficult for the current Boards to bind future Boards to not remove them.

I could say more about this but I doubt it's anyone's crux, and I prefer to not spend too much time on this.</li><li>Next to grandiose narcissism or sociopathy, there are other patterns how people can systematically cause harm to others. I'm mostly thinking of \"harm through negligence\" rather than with intent (but this isn't to say that grandiose narcissists cause all their harm fully-consciously). Anyway, many of these other patterns IMO involve having a bad theory of mind at least in certain domains. And we've seen that Owen has had this. However, I think it only becomes really vexed/hard to correct if someone (1) lacks a strong desire to improve their understanding of others <i>so as to </i>(i.e., with the prosocial goal being the primary motivation) avoid harming them/to make them more comfortable, or (2) if they are hopelessly bad at improving their understanding of others for reasons other than lacking such a desire in the first place.</li><li>On (1), I'm confident that Owen has a strong desire to improve his understanding of others so as to avoid harming them and make people positively comfortable. I don't remember the specifics, but I remember thinking that he's considerate in a way that many people aren't, which suggests that other people's feelings and comfort is often on his mind (edit) <i>at least in some contexts</i>. (E.g., in conversations about research, he'd often ask if what he's been saying so far is still helpful, or if we should move on to other questions. But more importantly, I think I also noticed signs of scrupulosity related to how he picks words carefully to make sure he doesn't convey the wrong thing, which I think is linked with not wanting to be bad socially or not wanting to come to the wrong conclusions about research relevant to the other party's path to impact.) Sure, people who are scared of social rejection can also be hypervigilant like that, and sometimes it's more people-pleasing than sincere concern, but I also felt like I picked up on \"he's sincerely trying to be helpful\" when talking to him. Though this is more of an intuition-based judgment than anything where I can say \"this specific thing I've observed is the reason.\" (Edit: Actually, one concrete thing that comes to mind is that he was among the very few people who said things about s-risks that made my research priorities seem less important, so he was honest about this in a way that exposes him to me thinking less of him if I were the sort of person who would take stuff like this personally.) Lastly, I think the apology really speaks to all this as well. (That said, I guess someone with cynical priors could point out that the apology might have been written in a very different way if it wasn't for showing it to friends \u2013 I doubt that it would be fundamentally different, and in fact I don't even know if he showed it to other people before posting [though I think that would be the wise thing to do]. In any case, I agree it's important to look at whether what people say in their apology is consistent with what we know about them from other situations; anyway, my answer to that is \"yes, feels very consistent.\")</li><li>Regarding (2), I have no doubts that Owen can greatly improve his understanding of others. He seems among the most \"interested in introspection and analyzing social stuff\" men that I've met, and he's very intelligent, so it's not like he lacks the cognitive abilities or interest to improve.</li><li>This leaves us with \"are there other character obstacles that we should expect that would stop him from improving sufficiently?.\" The other negative patterns that I can think of in this domain are:<br>(a.) Extreme entitlement;<br>(b.) being very bad at taking feedback to heart because one \"flinches away\" from bad parts of one's psychology, to the point that all one's introspection is premature and always an exercise in ego protection;<br>(c.) issues with externalizing shame/bad feelings, such as (e.g.) an underlying drive to emotionally control others or \"drag them down to one\u2019s level\" when one is feeling bad;<br>(d.) domain-specific tendency to form strong delusional beliefs, like believing that people who aren't attracted to you are attracted to you, and keeping these even in the light of clear counterevidence.<br>Of the above, I think (c.) doesn't fit the pattern of observed harm in this case here (this would be more relevant in people who make false accusations), so let's focus on (a.), (c.) and (d.)</li><li>Regarding (a.) (\"extreme entitlement\"), I haven\u2019t observed anything that would make me worry that Owen is very entitled. Admittedly, I only know him from a few professional (or semi-professional \u2013 e.g., talking in a small group of people after a retreat) context occasions, and I'm not a woman he's attracted to, so I may not have seen all sides. Still, for further consistency of what I already thought about him before all of this based on my intuitions from meeting him, I note that having extreme entitlement would be in tension with not causing bigger issues after being rejected (and it seems like he faced a lot of rejection in these cases), nor is it consistent with writing an apology where the fault isn't placed on other people.</li><li>Regarding (b.) (\"a pattern of habitually flinching away from self-critical thoughts\"), my best guess is that Owen\u2019s interest in introspection is too deep for a person with this issue. (Edit: Also, he partly felt driven to mention his attraction because there was shame attached to it, and even though this made him maybe not think clearly about everything, it's not like, if I understand correctly, that he flinched away from mentioning or at least noticing the shame altogether.) The people I know who exhibited this \"flinching away\" pattern to a severe degree seemed uncomfortable with serious introspection in the first place. They sometimes were very quick to apologize, but they seemed to distort what they were accused of to a point where they were only apologizing for things that are easy to <i>apologize to</i>. By contrast, I feel like Owen's apology admits a bunch of things about himself that aren't easy to say, so it feels like genuine self-work went into it.</li><li>Regarding (d.) (\"motivated cognition dialed up into proper delusions\"), I get that people are concerned about this when they read the accounts of what happened. I am too, a little bit. However, I think that it's not super uncommon to not pick up on people feeling uncomfortable when they try to hint at this discreetly. I also think the instances where Owen kept talking to someone about topics they expressed they wanted him to stop talking about are at most only one or two instances? I feel like if he were severely deluded in the sense of flat-out not cognitively accepting when his advances are rejected, he'd have kept talking to people a lot more than what he actually did? So, I think the levels of motivated cognition here were most likely \"bad, but not too far out of the ordinary\" (i.e., nowhere near \"stalker levels\"), so I'm not too worried about this for the future. We should also keep in mind how this was a big event in Owen's life he's unlikely to forget, and how much updating he's probably been doing (and he also said he's been discussing this stuff with a therapist).</li><li>&nbsp;Lastly, something that goes into my assessment of (d.) that I could imagine other people missing is that I feel I have a good model of what went wrong. In that model, it's not necessary for (d.) (or anything else that would spell trouble) to be pathological about Owen's psychology. Instead, I think what went poorly is primarily explained by (i) bad theory of mind and (ii) character-related scrupulosity that led to persistently bringing up things that were no longer appropriate (or were never appropriate in the first place, such as with some of the comments or locations where things were brought up).</li><li>[Now describing my model.] When people read Owen's account of why he did what he did, one reaction they might have is the following. \"So, okay, he felt attracted to someone, he worried that this attraction would make him a bad person, he wanted to get feedback to reassure himself that he isn't bad for this. So far, so good. But then, out of everyone he could've picked for that conversation, why on earth would he pick the person he's attracted <i>to</i> to discuss this with? Why not discuss it with <i>anyone</i> else? Doesn't that mean there must be some more sinister underlying motive at play? How could 'wanting to be reassured that he isn't bad' be anything but an excuse to make repeated advances?\" My reaction to that interpretation is \"people who think this are probably missing something about what it's like to have character-related scrupulosity.\"</li><li>&nbsp;I'm only speculating here, but it feels like the sort of thing I'm likely right about at least directionally. Namely, my guess is that Owen, over the five or so years that this is about, confessed his attraction also to the women he was attracted to (instead of only seeking out other people to discuss his feelings with) and sought absolution from them<i> </i>partly because he cared particularly about what these women think about him, which was related to him being attracted to them in the first place (meaning he admired them character-wise).</li><li>[Edit: paragraph added roughly 8h after posting the comment] Owen reached out to me (first time we communicated in several years) after I wrote this comment and said he felt seen by this paragraph (the one right above), but that I was missing a further factor. He felt \u2013 at the time \u2013 like the women in question had moral authority on this topic. Quoting: \"If they didn't mind my attraction, then by their judgement my attraction wasn't bad. If they did mind it, it was bad (and I should take therefore take further internal steps to suppress the feeling).\" Don't take from this that Owen necessarily agrees with all the other descriptions in my long comment, but I wanted to highlight this bit in particular because it sheds more light on why he talked about his attraction to the women directly. I didn't think of this possibility independently, but it seems credible/consistent to me. (I got permission from Owen to share.)</li><li>In some men, it's common to feel like the ultimate judge of your character is a woman with desirable character qualities herself. If you have a strong desire to be trusted and accepted for who you are, not for who others think you are but for who you actually are, it makes sense that you overshare weird details about yourself that you feel the least comfortable about. And someone with obsessive tendencies in that area may make the mistake of doing this too often or in contexts where it isn't appropriate. This is a common motivation (I know because I have the same feelings around some of this), and it IMO explains a lot of what happened, so it's not like we need to postulate other outlier-y things (extreme entitlement, extreme propensity to form delusional beliefs, etc.) to explain why Owen did what he did. (Other than poor theory of mind and common levels of motivated cognition, I mean.)</li><li>Lastly, and ironically, I think part of what caused things to go wrong here is actually protective for avoiding bad outcomes in the future. It makes it so much easier to evaluate someone's character if the person proactively gives you lots of information about it and if one of their primary drives seems to be to help you with that. It serves to rule out a lot of ways someone's character could be, but isn't. (Like, I\u2019m pretty sure if Owen had had any sinister motives besides just having a crush on the women, he'd have confessed those other motives as well to the women in question, and we'd have a bigger scandal.) I think this is a positive thing and one reason I'm drawn to defending Owen here as someone who doesn't know him super well (without saying that he didn't do anything wrong) is because I can easily imagine how other people would react in similar situations, and I want to flag that I like it when people make it easier for others to evaluate them.</li><li>A caveat here is that, as we've seen, a desire to be trusted and act so as to earn trust by proactively doing lots of introspection and sharing negative information by no means implies that someone is free from massive blind spots or self-deception. There's even a hypothesis that people who practice radical honesty and transparency thereby&nbsp;<i>dial up</i> their self-deception \u2013&nbsp;see Holly Elmore\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mhollyelmoreblog.wordpress.com/2018/12/12/on-privacy/\"><u>post on privacy</u></a>, which seems relevant here, though (a) \"making oneself transparent on matters relevant to trust\" isn't exactly the same as \"declining to have any sort of privacy in any context,\" and so, (b), I'm not sure I'd say that self-deception is&nbsp;<i>necessarily</i> dialed up in all instances of trying to do&nbsp;the former. Still, it seems plausible that it could come with that sort of <i>risk</i>.) Anyway, despite the concern that self-deception and blind spots remain very much possible/to be expected, I think that people who try to make themselves transparent to have their character more easily evaluated <i>are in fact</i> easier to evaluate for good character than people who don't do that.</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": "LmRdcxuDxw5YEXx7a", "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}, {"_id": "ZekGKJFLF8ipSdhy3", "postedAt": "2024-02-06T15:05:52.830Z", "postId": "4CBoJ5jgmGfdMFnAE", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for your question, Tiresias.

I have a couple follow up questions. Since this does occur, I think it would be useful for the community to know what risks they are taking if they choose to report to the CH team.</p>\n<p>I am reading what you stated as \"reporting something to us does not mean that we will never take action against the person who reported to us.\" I see two possible scenarios here, so want to get clarification on what you mean.</p>\n<p>One scenario, James reports something to you. You conclude at some point that James has engaged in misconduct, based on reports from people outside of the CH team. Maybe you collected those reports in the process of investigating James's claim. Maybe someone just separately came to you on an unrelated matter about James. Regardless, it ends up that you have some credibly allege James of misconduct, so you act on that.</p>\n<p>Second scenario, James reports something to you. In talking to James, you find him to be abrasive, unreasonable, and generally quite unpleasant to interact with. You grow to have serious concerns about him based on how he's interacted with you. He's not engaged in any misconduct (eg, he's not sexualy harassing you or anything), just generally displaying an unstable personality. You do not receive any reports of misconduct against James.</p>\n<p>Have you taken action against someone like \"James\" in either scenario? Or just in the first scenario?</p>\n<p>My second question is: Would it be possible for you to share the percentage of time you've taken action against a reporter over the last, say, 5 years?</p>\n<p>Thanks again.</p>\n<p>P.S. This whole OCB scenario seems like it would be very hard, Julia, and I really appreciate how forthcoming you have been about it. While you admit to making mistakes, I hope the wider community sees that the real mistakes in the CH's response came from flawed processes more than from any one individual. We all make mistakes in our jobs, and unfortunately yours are publicized more than most.
