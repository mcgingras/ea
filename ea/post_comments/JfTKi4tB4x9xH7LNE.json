While this post is two years old, it's still relevant to my interests as it's something I can forward to a friend of mine who disputes the value of earning to give, is skeptical of what effective altruism can or will generally achieve, and with whom I have an ongoing debate on these issues.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I think effective altruism has generated some stronger responses to these objections. Since your conclusion, Ben, also calls for further development of the defense of effective altruism, I figure it's time to update this article. I can collate some resources I think help, and rally some &quot;more skilled rhetoricians&quot; than either you or I to make this case better. I know debate about earning to give might be more an issue of late 2013 and early 2014, but as I perceive effective altruism as a legacy project regardless, I think it's both interesting and worth our time to generate timeless responses to other perspectives on effective altruism.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}]
