That is, effective altruism <em>is</em> philosophy in action, but it doesn't need to be <em>a</em> philosophy, i.e., complete way of life. i.e., ideology. I still want to write that article in the future because framing effective altruism as a method taking its first steps into discovering what tends to work well in doing good, and what tends to work not as well. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How you framed it in the article is that ideologies answer questions, while effective altruism asks questions. Is another way of saying this the distinction between asking descriptive vs. normative questions, or making descriptive vs. normative claims? I don't think so, but I'm unsure. Either way, I don't believe it makes sense to make effective altruism into something that doesn't ask normative claims, or doesn't ask normative questions. Effective altruism is a community of people as much as it is anything else, so it's not something that exists on its own (yet) as being indifferent to <em>how</em> 'good' is defined, so long as much as possible of it is done.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In the interest of reducing the size of identities for not just myself, but for others, and bunches of individuals, I've taken to referring to 'effective altruism' as if it's a single agent sometimes. This may seem strange, but we do it all the time. In the news, 'The White House' wants all sorts of things; this is to the point that sometimes not only are the decisions of the executive branch conflated with the opinions of the whole federal government, but the position of America as a whole. Of course, that's a problem on the other side that effective altruism doesn't need worry about right now (see what I did there?). Sometimes I'll also use 'the effective altruist community', similar to the 'scientific community'. For example, the effective altruist community has mixed feelings on the efficacy of yet untested charitable interventions. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Again, I was thinking along similar lines with the idea of our actions and suggestions being features of effective altruism as it exists in the present, not the source of what effective altruism means at its core. Even more than people identifying themselves with 'effective altruism', I'm worried that identifying effective altruism with distinct causes permanently may limit the potential of what effective altruism can become, and also dilute it to the point that it doesn't feel different than any other advocacy movement.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "Dzveb79awALDabm3u", "postedAt": "2014-10-17T11:59:19.929Z", "postId": "FpjQMYQmS3rWewZ83", "htmlBody": "<p>How pithy do thousands of us really need be?

If this were the core idea of EA, then I agree that this whole post would be incorrect. </p>\n<p>Is it the core idea though? None of the introductions I linked to above mention anything about what one &quot;should&quot; do. Certainly there are several EA organisations that are linked to spreading the idea of EA &amp; motivating more people to donate, but that seems to me to be easily explained by:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The ease with which resources can be turned into life-improvements (&quot;ease&quot; referring to convenience, speed, low information barriers) compared to just about any other time in human history.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The stable instrumental goal of trying to spread one's own values, to make it more likely they are fulfilled.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My impression is not that the organisations in question (which are made up of aspiring effective altruists, or people interested in Effective Altruism, or whatever) see some kind of terminal value in persuading others to dedicate their lives to helping others. Certainly I find the idea of this (persuade others to do good with their resources) being a core motivating philosophy of my life very off-putting. </p>\n<p>One of the things I love about EA (or perhaps just my interpretation of EA) is that it's driven by curiosity and compassion, not moralising.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>For your second point:</p>\n<p>I think what you've said actually splits into two things:</p>\n<p>a) Should we promote having an EA identity, and\nb) Should people who have that identity call themselves &quot;effective altruists&quot;</p>\n<p>I think you're right about a), and about the huge benefits of community, signalling, self-signalling, commitment etc that come with making Effective Altruism part of one's identity.</p>\n<p>But I don't think it necessarily follows that the name &quot;effective altruists&quot; is the best way to refer to oneself, and one of the reasons I wrote this post was to point out the downsides of using that phrase. </p>\n<p>I particularly care about the first impressions of people who have the potential to have a large impact on the world - who I expect will generally be more analytical, better informed and more sceptical than the typical person. In my experience organising EA Melbourne, this kind of person is often really put off by a group of people who just get together every few weeks to talk about stuff, and who call themselves both effective and altruistic. They are also put off if people in that group claim (as lots do, initially) that maximising your earnings and donating to global health charities is the best way to improve the world. </p>\n<p>I think it's really important that our memes don't get stuck on one object-level strategy like that.</p>\n<p>(I do wish I could think of another identifier that's as pithy as &quot;effective altruist&quot; though.)</p>\n<p>What do you think?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "PqusgAr8oNSPNY2rk", "user": {"username": "HelenToner"}}, {"_id": "qtq9gbJ4awEo6dYJm", "postedAt": "2014-10-18T10:29:42.137Z", "postId": "FpjQMYQmS3rWewZ83", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>You can easily say that Effective Altruism answers a question.

It appears to me that the post not only fails to defend the idea that the three questions don't make sense, but it actually answers them, just as follows:</p>\n<p>&quot;What is the definition of Effective Altruism?&quot;: The action or habit of asking oneself the question of how to do the most good with the available resources, using a particular methodology (as per the author's comment on Robert_Wilbin's reply below).\n&quot;What claims does it make?&quot; :  None, as per the definition above.\n&quot;What do you have to believe or do, to be an Effective Altruist?&quot;: Asking yourself the question above and trying to answer it using the given methodology. I have my doubts on the answer to the first question. The term EA often seems to be denoting a social movement or a philosophy, rather than a habit.</p>\n<p>But more importantly, when the author and some other people in the comments talk about the &quot;definition&quot; of EA, they appear to refer to something akin to a definition in a mathematical theory: a succint but correct and complete statement describing EA that can later be used to draw conclusions in arguments about EA. However (if you have read mathematics textbooks, you may be familiar with this) such definitions are often insufficient in order to get a clear and complete idea of what something is.</p>\n<p>In other words, if somebody asks in good faith what EA is, a much more illuminating reply would not only frame EA as a social movement, rather than a personal habit, but it would note that the general tendency in this movement is to understand the idea of 'a better world' in line with some brand of consequentialism, and it would also describe the kind of &quot;actions&quot; that are typically considered by EAs, such as donating to charities, choosing a career, etc. This can still be done succintly, and yet a much more accurate picture of EA is transmitted. </p>\n<p>My point is: it can be misleading to think of EA as being asking a question; instead, one has a more accurate picture if they think of it as a movement, based on a key question and methodology, but also with its correspoding history and particularities. The post, however, does a good job in reminding any aspiring effective altruist that there is a possibility that particular conclusions about how to do the most good which have been determined by the EA community could, in principle, be wrong, and that the only certain invariant of EA is the question (and methodology) of how to do the most good with the available resources.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "LeahBlake"}}, {"_id": "Bym6sJcXntN6BCoew", "postedAt": "2020-10-11T20:37:21.989Z", "postId": "FpjQMYQmS3rWewZ83", "htmlBody": "<p>But I am an Effective Altruist, Helen -- <strong>&#x1F613;</strong> By definition, as a member of the Effective Altruism community, no matter what I do or what I ask.

I don\u2019t think it necessarily accurately describes what the effective altruism movement is, but more of what it aspires to be. Having this compass on where we want to be helps us nudge the movement towards that.<br><br><i>Why do we want to emphasise values/principles/axioms over conclusions?</i></p><p>The answer to the question \u201chow do we do as much good as possible with our limited resources\u201d (referred to as the EA question for the rest of this review) is an uncertain one: we never have complete information. The answer to the EA question is also a dynamic one: our judgement of the best answer, even if we did have all the information, is likely to be constantly changing with time, as our world changes.&nbsp;</p><p>Reasonable conclusions tend to be context-dependent and should change rapidly as we learn new information and our world changes. &nbsp;Principles/values/axioms can and should remain much more stable over time (though they likely should gain nuance with time too, hopefully, as we've thought more).&nbsp;<br><br><i>How this post (and posts like it) help</i></p><p>We can\u2019t help but be at least a little bit defined by our current conclusions, but posts like this remind us that we aspire to be about the question, not any specific current answer.&nbsp;</p><p>This post's usefulness for communicating to newcomers what effective altruism is aspiring to be about is helped by it being an exceptionally accessible piece of writing. Someone new to effective altruism can read it without reading much other material and still understand it. This makes it particularly useful because it helps newcomers see effective altruism more like how we want effective altruism to be. This helps us bring in more people interested in effective altruism\u2019s question more than effective altruism\u2019s current conclusions. It also helps new people see effective altruism as more about its question than its current conclusions.<br><br>This post certainly helped me to feel like I belonged in the effective altruism community soon after I first came across the movement, while I was still forming my best guesses on the answer to the question \"how do I do the most good?\". It helped me feel like I belonged in the community while my guesses were often very different from those I knew in the community.&nbsp;Why? It brought the emphasis back to values that I completely was on board rather than conclusions I wasn't fully convinced by or didn't fully understand. For me, posts like this one did not act in a vacuum. Reading this was probably only convincing because I &nbsp;also had great conversations with people in the community that emphasised these points.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;If we can make people who are curious about the question \u201chow do we do as much good with our lives\u201d feel more welcome in our community, then we'll attract more curious, more independent thinkers. In the long run, this will probably create a healthier effective altruism movement (even if there are some costs from a loss in cohesiveness from not all having the same conclusions). &nbsp;<br><br>Material like this, along with people in the community demonstrating these ideas in real-time in conversations and their actions, can go a long way to create a movement united by principles instead of one united by (hopefully) transient conclusions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Some follow-up thoughts</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Should we be united around ideas like \u201cAI safety is one of the most important issues of our time\u201d or ideas like \u201call people (and perhaps more than just people) are worthy of moral consideration\u201d? I suspect we want to have a stronger identity around ideas like the latter than the former.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the answer to the EA question is uncertain and dynamically changing, I suspect that we want to be more united by fundamental principles (values/ axioms) like \u201call people (or all sentient beings) are worthy of moral consideration\u201d rather than conclusions like \u201cAI safety is one of the most important issues of our time\u201d.*</p><p>Diversity in conclusions is desirable, as long as we all have clear common ground (that is narrow enough that having a community is still useful). What should that clear and sufficiently narrow common ground be? This is a challenging question, but my guess is that we want to find more principle/value-centric common ground. &nbsp;Posts like this help us map that out right from our first introduction and can help remind us of what we want effective altruism to be many years later.&nbsp;<br><br>Note: lots has been written more recently that is related, but because I am short on time and reviews need to be posted by tomorrow, I am posting this review now (but I might come back and add some links I think are particularly relevant).</p><p>*This is a fuzzy distinction, \u201cfuture lives are worthy of moral consideration\u201d might reasonably be classed as a conclusion or a principle. However, I still think it is a meaningful one, despite the existence of edge cases.<br>&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Sophia"}}]
