For instance, hedonism typically equates wellbeing with pleasure minus pain, and preferentialism often sees wellbeing as the difference between fulfilled and unfulfilled preferences. Similarly, objective list theories may posit multiple independent goods and bads that contribute to one\u2019s overall wellbeing.</p><p>A crucial challenge for these \u201cgood minus bad\u201d conceptions of wellbeing is their reliance on an offsetting theory of aggregation. That is, they assume that any independent bads can always be counterbalanced or offset by a sufficient addition of independent goods, at least at the individual level.</p><p>This offsetting premise has more problems than are commonly recognized, including the often sidelined question of what justifies it in the first place (Vinding,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/research/on-purported-positive-goods-outweighing-suffering/\"><u>2020a</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/phenomenological-argument/\"><u>2022</u></a>). Interpersonally, it plays a key role in generating moral implications that many would consider unacceptable, such as \u2018Creating Hell to Please the Blissful\u2019 (Ajantaival, 2022a, sec.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JnHeeTGAohMFxNbGK/peacefulness-nonviolence-and-experientialist-minimalism#2_5_Comparative_theoretical_implications_of_minimalist_and_offsetting_views\"><u>2.5</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FEJLFr5ef82FSY8vr/minimalist-extended-very-repugnant-conclusions-are-the-least\"><u>2022b</u></a>).

And because many minimalist views focus on a single common currency of value, they may be promising candidates for resolving theoretical conflicts between multiple, seemingly intrinsic values. By contrast, all \u201cgood minus bad\u201d views are still pluralistic in that they involve at least two distinct value entities.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5p6kasziqsr\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5p6kasziqsr\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>Although minimalist views do not depend on the idea of an independent good, they still provide principled answers to the question of what makes life better for an individual. Moreover, in practice, it is essential to always view the narrow question of \u2018better for oneself\u2019 within the broader context of \u2018better overall\u2019.

For instance, according to philosopher and scholar of Buddhism Daniel Breyer (<a href=\"https://blogs.dickinson.edu/buddhistethics/files/2015/12/Breyer-Axiology-final.pdf\"><u>2015</u></a>), the P\u0101li Buddhist tradition understands wellbeing as consisting in the cessation of&nbsp;<i>dukkha</i> (suffering, \u2018dis-ease\u2019, dissatisfaction), with other factors being good for us only insofar as they contribute to the cessation of&nbsp;<i>dukkha</i>.</p><h3>Epicurean minimalism</h3><p>Similar minimalist views may be inspired by the Epicurean tradition. For instance, a kind of minimalist hedonism results from rejecting offsetting hedonism\u2019s concept of positive pleasure at the descriptive level and adopting instead the following Epicurean-inspired concepts of kinetic and static pleasures. (These ideas are traced to their sources and are explored much further in Sherman,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/bitstream/handle/10871/32103/ShermanT.pdf\"><u>2017</u></a>, and Knutsson,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.simonknutsson.com/epicurean-ideas-about-pleasure-pain-good-and-bad/\"><u>2019</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.simonknutsson.com/undisturbedness-as-the-hedonic-ceiling/\"><u>2022</u></a>.)</p><ol><li>Kinetic pleasure: \u201cKinetic pleasure is the active removal of a pain\u201d (Sherman, p. 53). It is \u201cwhat results from fulfilling a desire\u201d or when a \u201clack or need is being removed\u201d (cf. Knutsson,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.simonknutsson.com/epicurean-ideas-about-pleasure-pain-good-and-bad/#The_difference_between_kinetic_and_katastematic_pleasure\"><u>2019</u></a>). It is what we usually call pleasure, yet it is actually not an independent good but rather a temporary relief from a prior experiential disturbance.</li><li>Static (<i>katastematic</i>) pleasure: Static pleasure is the upper limit that the kinetic, remedial pleasure leads up to: \u201ca condition of absolute contentment in mind and body\u201d (Sherman, p. 106). There is no higher pleasure: \u201cThe limit of pleasure is reached with the removal of all pain\u201d; freedom from all pain is the summit of pleasure (cf. Knutsson,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.simonknutsson.com/undisturbedness-as-the-hedonic-ceiling/\"><u>2022</u></a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgq5dv5cbvzn\"><sup><a href=\"#fngq5dv5cbvzn\">[13]</a></sup></span></li></ol><p>Together, these concepts are taken to cover all experiences of pleasure. For instance, \u201cjoy is active, the removal of mental pain, while tranquillity is the static state of being without [<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/oJJLgJTsQKX3oQ9xw/minimalist-views-of-wellbeing#Appendix__Expanding_the_Epicurean_notion_of_freedom_from_all_pain\">any</a>] distress\u201d (Sherman, p. 53). Thus, there are ultimately just more or less disturbed experiential states, and according to Epicurean-inspired minimalist views, greater wellbeing consists in reducing our experiential disturbances.</p><h3>Contraction-based minimalism</h3><p>In various&nbsp;<a href=\"https://qri.org/blog/classical-enlightenment-and-valence-structuralism\"><u>interviews</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.simonknutsson.com/roger-thisdell-on-undisturbedness-positive-experiences-and-the-hedonic-peak/\"><u>conversations</u></a>, meditator Roger Thisdell has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/0EluGc-uf0Q\"><u>outlined</u></a> a minimalist view of wellbeing that is rooted in his own phenomenological observation. The view is formulated in the following terms.</p><ol><li>Contraction versus pleasure: All experiences contain some level of unpleasantness or disturbance, which Thisdell refers to as \u2018contraction\u2019. This contraction exists at a more concrete, phenomenologically pinpointable level than does pleasure. Pleasure is, on closer inspection, more akin to a comparative judgment that occurs after experiencing a relief from contractive pressure (cf. the Epicurean notion of kinetic pleasure).</li><li>Betterness and cessation: As one feels less and less contraction (and thus more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rogerthisdell.com/post/expansion-contraction-the-subtlest-experiential-distinction\"><u>expansion</u></a>), one feels better and better. However, the complete absence of disturbance is only achieved in moments when all experiences and phenomenology cease. This undisturbed state is, according to Thisdell, what meditators refer to as \u2018cessation\u2019.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft7p5w85nl0h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt7p5w85nl0h\">[14]</a></sup></span></li></ol><h3>Tranquilism</h3><p>Tranquilism as proposed by Lukas Gloor (<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/tranquilism/\"><u>2017</u></a>) is a view of wellbeing inspired by Buddhist and Epicurean ideas. It understands wellbeing in the following way.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefstwgnrzkeue\"><sup><a href=\"#fnstwgnrzkeue\">[15]</a></sup></span></p><ol><li>Wellbeing and cravings: Wellbeing is the degree to which we are free from experienced cravings, which are defined as need-based, visceral desires to change our current experience.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefosgf9qdegd9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnosgf9qdegd9\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Cravings are what make an experience bad for us. For instance, the sensation of pain, without any craving for it to end, is not intrinsically bad according to Gloor. (<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/tranquilism/#22_Cravings_Negative_states\"><u>2.2</u></a>)</li><li>Optimal states: Optimal states are free from aversive components and from cravings for more pleasure. They include states of contentment such as meditative tranquility and flow states, as well as all subjectively flawless states of inner peace, dreamless sleep, and non-consciousness. (<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/tranquilism/#21_Contentment_as_the_perfect_state\"><u>2.1</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/tranquilism/#3_Non-consciousness\"><u>3</u></a>)</li><li>Pleasure and cravings: Pleasure, understood as a sensation that increases our hedonic level, can be valuable for its roles in preventing and protecting against the formation of cravings. But the absence of unneeded pleasure is entirely unproblematic. A pleasureless state of consciousness, if free from all cravings, is considered perfectly optimal and happy.

By contrast, offsetting hedonism entails the \u2018outside view\u2019 that more pleasure would always be better for us, even if we do not crave or desire it.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefub34pzcp49\"><sup><a href=\"#fnub34pzcp49\">[17]</a></sup></span></p><h2>Extra-experientialist views</h2><h3>Preferentialist views</h3><p>Offsetting preferentialism holds that (1) satisfied preferences are good for us, (2) frustrated preferences are bad for us, and (3) the former can offset the latter.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgx27rmatepi\"><sup><a href=\"#fngx27rmatepi\">[18]</a></sup></span></p><p>In contrast, professor of philosophy Christoph Fehige (<a href=\"https://www.fehige.info/pdf/A_Pareto_Principle_for_Possible_People.pdf\"><u>1998</u></a>) has defended a view called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifrustrationism\"><u>antifrustrationism</u></a> (henceforth \u201cAF\u201d), which holds only the second premise:</p><blockquote><p>We don\u2019t do any good by creating satisfied extra preferences. What matters about preferences is not that they have a satisfied existence, but that they don\u2019t have a frustrated existence. \u2026 Maximizers of preference satisfaction should instead call themselves minimizers of preference frustration.

We can think of the creation of the unsatisfied preferences as putting a debit in the moral ledger which satisfying them merely cancels out.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwli905k3cz\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwli905k3cz\">[19]</a></sup></span></p><p>The main difference between experientialist minimalist views and AF is that, according to AF,</p><blockquote><p>People need not be aware of their preferences; what counts is rather the attitude they&nbsp;<i>would</i> have towards something&nbsp;<i>if</i> they fully represented it. (Fehige,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fehige.info/pdf/A_Pareto_Principle_for_Possible_People.pdf\"><u>1998</u></a>, p. 509)</p></blockquote><p>See also the explanation and defense of negative ideal preference utilitarianism found in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.utilitarianism.com/nu/nufaq.html\"><u>Negative Utilitarianism FAQ</u></a>.</p><h3>Conditional interests versus teleological goods</h3><p>Closely related to AF are views centered on conditional interests, as defended by philosopher Johann Frick (<a href=\"https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/13064981/Frick_gsas.harvard.inactive_0084L_11842.pdf\"><u>2014</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phpe.12139\"><u>2020</u></a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyup8tz6qo9l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyup8tz6qo9l\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;These views are structurally similar to AF, except they apply to interests rather than preferences (St. Jules,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Sz7FrpdvSduQRSEnu/conditional-interests-asymmetries-and-ea-priorities\"><u>2019</u></a>). (One may think that we can have interests in something without necessarily having a preference for it, or a preference for something that is not in our best interest.)</p><p>Frick\u2019s view gives us reason to be skeptical of the concept of intrinsic value, as it criticizes the \u201cteleological view of wellbeing\u201d, which holds that wellbeing is something to be promoted. In Frick\u2019s words (emphases mine):</p><blockquote><p>According to the&nbsp;<strong>teleologist</strong>, the appropriate response to what is good or valuable is to promote it, ensuring that as much of it exists as possible \u2026</p><p>Next, note that viewing some value&nbsp;<i>F</i> as&nbsp;<strong>to be promoted</strong> implies that there is no deep moral distinction between [1] increasing the degree to which&nbsp;<i>F</i> is realized amongst&nbsp;<i>existing</i> potential bearers of that value, and [2] creating&nbsp;<i>new</i> bearers of that value. (Frick,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phpe.12139\"><u>2020</u></a>, pp. 63\u201364)</p></blockquote><p>By contrast, Frick argues that we never have unconditional reasons to bring about new instances of wellbeing as a teleological good.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcjzgaw44bpt\"><sup><a href=\"#fncjzgaw44bpt\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;What instead matters is individuals\u2019 degree of wellbeing&nbsp;<i>conditional&nbsp;</i>on their existence, that is, whether their interests are satisfied or violated&nbsp;<i>if&nbsp;</i>they exist. Thus, by analogy to how AF is about the minimization of frustrated preferences, one can understand Frick\u2019s view to be about the minimization of violated interests: we have reasons not to violate interests, but we do not have reasons to create them, all else equal.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw35ej63qll\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw35ej63qll\">[22]</a></sup></span></p><p>In other words:</p><ul><li>It is better for beings that their interests are satisfied, if they exist.<ul><li>For instance, it is better for existing beings to acquire a higher quality of life, if they have such an interest.</li><li>Yet our wellbeing is not increased by acquiring new satisfied interests, all else equal.</li></ul></li><li>It is bad for beings when their interests are violated, if they exist.<ul><li>For instance, it is bad for existing beings to die, if they have an interest to exist.</li><li>Yet it is not bad for nonexistent beings to not come into existence for their own sake, all else equal, because only existing beings can have an interest to exist.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Objective list views</h3><p>Lastly, there are minimalist versions of objective list views. Objective list views of wellbeing typically claim that various objective goods contribute independently to our wellbeing, where these objective goods may include things like personal achievements, knowledge, and autonomy.</p><p>Minimalist versions of objective list views can retain largely the same list of objective goods, yet the important difference is that they construe these \u201cgoods\u201d purely in terms of the absence of bads.</p><p>As described by Vinding (<a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2023/04/10/minimalist-versions-of-objective-list-theories-of-wellbeing/\"><u>2023</u></a>) regarding the purported objective goods of autonomy and virtuous conduct:</p><blockquote><p>For example, rather than seeing autonomy as an objective good that can bring our wellbeing above some neutral level, the absence of autonomy is seen as an objective bad that detracts from our wellbeing, placing us below a neutral or unproblematic state of wellbeing; and having full autonomy can at most bring us to an untroubled or unproblematic level of wellbeing. \u2026 Rather than seeing virtue as an objective good that contributes positively to wellbeing, vice is seen as an objective bad that contributes negatively, and virtue may be understood as the mere absence of vice (cf. Kupfer,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10790-011-9305-x\"><u>2011</u></a>; Knutsson,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.simonknutsson.com/pessimism-value-future-welfare-acts-traits/\"><u>2022</u></a>, sec. 4). And so on for any other purported objective good.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhvz5ulffve8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhvz5ulffve8\">[23]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>The list of objective bads that matter independently to our wellbeing may include things like compromised health, false beliefs, ignorance, premature death, uncompleted life projects, being constrained, being discriminated against, being exploited, being manipulated, being subjected to violence, and so on.</p><p>Objective list views need not entail that such objective conditions are the&nbsp;<i>only</i> things that matter to our wellbeing, but merely that certain objective conditions&nbsp;<i>also</i> matter. In other words, one may think that our wellbeing consists in both our objective conditions and our experiential states.</p><p>This brings us to the more general point that the individual views explored in this essay need not be endorsed as standalone views, but can instead be combined into a wide variety of minimalist hybrid theories of wellbeing. For example, one may endorse a minimalist view according to which experiential states, ideal preferences, conditional interests, and objective conditions all contribute independently to our wellbeing. This gives a sense of the potential flexibility and variety of minimalist views of wellbeing, and a sense of how there are many reasonable alternatives to \u201cgood minus bad\u201d views.</p><h1>Acknowledgments</h1><p>I am grateful for helpful comments by Eleos Arete Citrini, Anthony DiGiovanni, Barry Grimes, Simon Knutsson, Winston Oswald-Drummond, Michael St. Jules, Roger Thisdell, and Magnus Vinding.</p><h1>Main references</h1><p>Ajantaival, T.

In the words of <a href=\"https://manifund.org/AdamGleave\">Adam Gleave</a>, the regrantor who initiated this:</p><blockquote><p>There's been an explosion of interest in Singular Learning Theory lately in the alignment community, and good introductory resources could save people a lot of time. A scholarly literature review also has the benefit of making this area more accessible to the ML research community more broadly. Matthew seems well placed to conduct this, having already familiarized himself with the field during his MS thesis and collected a database of papers. He also has extensive teaching experience and experience writing publications aimed at the ML research community.</p></blockquote><h3>In need of funding</h3><p>Some of our favorite proposals which could use more funding:</p><p><a href=\"https://manifund.org/projects/recreate-the-cavity-preventing-gmo-bacteria-bcs3-l1-from-precursor-\"><strong>1</strong></a><strong>. </strong><a href=\"https://manifund.org/projects/recreate-the-cavity-preventing-gmo-bacteria-bcs3-l1-from-precursor-\"><strong>Aaron Silverbook: recreate the cavity-preventing GMO bacteria BCS3-L1 from precursor</strong></a></p><p>A proposal to <i>cure cavities, forever</i>.

Other maps\nand gazetteers are no better:\n<a href=\"https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/5327798\">OpenStreetMap</a>,\n<a href=\"https://spelunker.whosonfirst.org/id/1226022949/\">Who's on First</a></p>\n<p>The lack of place names has many negative effects, like slower development,\ndifficult humanitarian work, or worse governance. Consider the example of bednet\ndistributions against malaria. This is familiar to me, because I have worked at\nthe <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> for the last\n2.5 years. Bednets are an essential tool to fight malaria, and so countries like\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo distribute them to all households every three\nyears. Without reliable lists of location names:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Planning the distribution is hard: how to communicate where nets should go,\nand how many are needed in each place?</li>\n<li>People miss out on nets: entire villages might be left out if the distribution\nagents aren't aware of them.</li>\n<li>Monitoring is hard: Typically, AMF selects a subset of locations randomly and\nsends independent monitoring teams there to verify the distribution. This only\nworks if there are place names.</li>\n<li>Inconsistencies make everything difficult: For example, we want independent\nmonitoring teams, but we can't use their data if location names don't match\nthose used by the distribution teams.</li>\n<li>New technologies cannot be used: Distributions would benefit from better\ndigital data collection tools, dashboards, satellite-based population\nestimates, etc. The adoption of these tools is often difficult because they\nrequire place names and boundaries.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An important consequence is that distributions cost more. Funders regularly buy\n+5% or +10% extra nets to ensure that there are no stockouts despite low-quality\nplanning data. In addition, there is an engineering cost of dealing with\nmissing and inconsistent data. When I was at AMF, a significant part of my work\ntime was spent on these problems.</p>\n<p>Bednet distributions are an area that I know well, but the example generalizes.\nMost non-profits, NGOs, and governments working in least developed countries\nwould benefit from better place names. Better data would improve routine\nhealthcare, make it easier to organize fair elections, and much more. Yet, such\nis nobody's core responsibility, and thus nobody has solved the problem yet.</p>\n<h2>The goal</h2>\n<p>I want to build the world's best dataset of place names, boundaries, and\nmetadata (such as population estimates), with a focus on least developed\ncountries.</p>\n<p>The current state of the art looks roughly like the graphic below, which comes\nfrom the excellent overview <a href=\"https://www.whosonfirst.org/blog/2023/06/07/state-of-the-gazetteer/\">State of the Gazetteer in\n2023</a> by\n<em>Who's on First</em>. Regions with orange dots have data on local administrative\nareas (e.g., village or town names/boundaries). They are missing in most of\nAfrica and large parts of Asia. I want to make sure this map becomes fully covered.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/tgmWYsLgLwswZsMDB/gdeqh2w6sfojcpm41o1u\" alt=\"Coverage of local administrative names in the WOF gazetteer\"></p>\n<p><em>Coverage of local administrative names in the WOF gazetteer\n(<a href=\"https://www.whosonfirst.org/blog/2023/06/07/state-of-the-gazetteer/\">source</a>)</em></p>\n<p>The most useful data has places with on the order of 100 households. This is a\ntypical rural village or a small urban neigborhood. At this level of detail, the\ndata is fine-grained enough for detailled planning. And while practicioners can\nalways use higher levels of the location hierarchy or merge places, the opposite\nis more difficult.</p>\n<p>To make the data fully useful, we also want boundary polygons. This allows us to\nlink places to other data sources, e.g., GPS coordinates or satellite imagery.</p>\n<p>Finally, we want estimates of the coverage and quality of the data. We want to\nknow what percentage of settlements and people are covered, and get a list of\nthe unknown settlements. For metadata like population numbers, it would be great\nto have confidence intervals or some other measurement of accuracy. All data\nshould also come with information on provenance and recency.</p>\n<h2>Candidate solutions</h2>\n<p>Solutions to this problem of missing place names involve identifying good data\nsources, cleaning and aggregating the data, publishing the result in all\nrelevant places to ensure its use, and finally maintaining the data so it stays\nup-to-date.</p>\n<p>A few candidate data sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Governments, ministries of health.</li>\n<li>NGOs like the Against Malaria Foundation, but also local actors such as\n<a href=\"https://www.sanru.cd/\">SANRU</a> in DRC. These could provide not only place\nnames, but also GPS coordinates of households or population estimates.</li>\n<li>The UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian affairs (see for example their\ndata sets at <a href=\"https://data.humdata.org/\">humdata.org</a>).</li>\n<li>Academic initiatives such as the\n<a href=\"https://cprc.columbia.edu/\">Columbia Population Research Center</a> or\n<a href=\"https://grid3.org/\">GRID3</a></li>\n<li>Initiatives by for-profit organizations like Facebook.</li>\n<li>New satellite-based data sets like\n<a href=\"https://download.geoservice.dlr.de/WSF_EVO/\">World Settlement Footprint</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/instant/media/index.html?appid=fc92d38533d440078f17678ebc20e8e2\">Sentinel-2 Land Use</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The people at the Who's on First gazetteer have recently completed gathering and\nimporting place data for India. I highly recommend their write-up of the\n<a href=\"https://www.whosonfirst.org/blog/2023/06/19/introducting-karmashapes/\">Karmashapes project</a>.\nTheir approach and techniques might translate to other parts of the world.</p>\n<h2>Potential challenges</h2>\n<p>Building the world's best place data set is not without challenges. Below is an\ninitial bullet list. This is an area where feedback and ideas would be\nparticularly welcome.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are many existing initiatives addressing parts of the problem. We need\nto better understand why they have not yet produced the data that we'd like to\nsee.</li>\n<li>Authoritiative data might not exist. People have disputes around boundaries.\nSome places (e.g., South Sudan) might now know or want the concept of \"village\nname\".</li>\n<li>There is a risk of colonialistic thinking, where we (the rich first-worlders)\nbelieve to know what less developed countries need. Also, the data is\npotentially dual-use: it can serve dictators as well as humanitarian\norganizations.</li>\n<li>The data set needs to be maintained to stay relevant.</li>\n<li>The data set should be published under an open license to maximize usage.</li>\n<li>It's unclear how to make a living when working on this project.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>With this early project write-up, I am primarily looking for feedback. Any\nthoughts are welcome: Is this a good idea? Why or why not? Is this an important\nproblem to solve? How could it be done? Whom should I talk to?

I was surprised that this argument is being used by some of the leading figures in the AI Safety debate because as I argue in this paper, its logic relies on the survivorship bias. This, in turn, means that the argument begs the question by grouping AI with a skewed sample of only safe technologies, making it a flawed argument.

Note also that just because a particular argument in favour of AI safety fails, we are not warranted to conclude that AI is unsafe. The main point of this post is simply that we should not assume safety/unsafety without providing further arguments. I invite feedback and potential improvements on my position in the comments!&nbsp;</i></p><h2><strong>Argument from Overestimation</strong></h2><p>Consider the following passage from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://a16z.com/2023/06/06/ai-will-save-the-world/\"><u>Marc Andreessen\u2019s essay about concerns regarding AI risk</u></a>, titled \u2018Why AI will Save the World\u2019:</p><p>\u201cThe fear that technology of our own creation will rise up and destroy us is deeply coded into our culture. [Recounts the myth of Prometheus about the technology of fire as an example.] The presumed evolutionary purpose of this mythology is to motivate us to seriously consider potential risks of new technologies \u2013 fire, after all, can indeed be used to burn down entire cities. But just as fire was also the foundation of modern civilization as used to keep us warm and safe in a cold and hostile world, this mythology ignores the far greater upside of most \u2013 all? \u2013 new technologies, and in practice inflames destructive emotion rather than reasoned analysis. Just because premodern man freaked out like this doesn\u2019t mean we have to; we can apply rationality instead.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>A similar sentiment was also expressed by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://munkdebates.com/debates/artificial-intelligence\"><u>Yann LeCun in the recent Munk Debate on AI</u></a>, listing historical instances where warnings about a new technology\u2019s negative effects were wide of mark:&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cSocrates was against writing, he thought people are going to lose their memory. The Catholic church was against the printing press, saying they would lose control of the Dogma. [...] The Ottoman Empire banned the printing press and according to some historian [sic] this is what accelerated their decline.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Later on, LeCun spells out his argument when reacting to Yoshua Bengio\u2019s statement that AI is an unprecedented technology in its unique capabilities to design and produce its own improved copies:&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cThat very argument was made for computers, you know, 50 years ago. This is not a new issue. [References a website called Pessimist Archives which keeps a record of newspaper clips with wrong and sometimes absurd predictions regarding the effects of new technologies]. [Take the example of] the train: you\u2019re not gonna take the train if it\u2019s going 50 km/h, you can't breathe at that speed. [...] Everybody has said this kind of thing about every time there was a technological evolution or cultural evolution.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>It seems that the implicit argument in these passages is meant to be something like the following. Call it the Argument from Overestimation (AFO):&nbsp;</p><p><strong>P1</strong> People usually overestimate the risks associated with new technologies.</p><p><strong>P2</strong> AI is a new technology.</p><p><strong>C1</strong> People probably overestimate the risks associated with AI.</p><p>The argument may seem inductively strong at first, but take a look at what all the technologies listed above have in common: they all turned out to be safe. This creates problems for LeCun's argument, because it highlights that the logic behind his argument rests on fallacious reasoning, specifically, it falls prey to the survivorship bias.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Objection from Survivorship Bias</strong></h2><p>Survivorship bias is a cognitive shortcut that occurs when a more easily noticeable subgroup which passes a hidden selection process is mistaken as the entire group (read more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias\"><u>here</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/survivorship-bias\"><u>here</u></a>). A hypothetical example can be taken from a medical experiment attempting to estimate the effectiveness of a treatment intervention. Even an intervention which exhibits relatively high success rates (e.g. high survival rates) may actually be relatively ineffective, as the analysis of its effects often excludes people who did not survive long enough to get the treatment -- either because their immune systems were comparatively weaker, they had worse genetic predispositions for the disease etc. Hence, without including the weaker group in the analysis, the survival rate of the drug is most likely positively skewed and too high, as its selection mechanism operates only on people who are naturally more resistant to the disease.&nbsp;</p><p>Andreessen\u2019s and LeCun's arguments are based on similarly skewed reasoning. Think again of the technologies mentioned: fire, writing, printing, trains, computers. All of these technologies went through the selection process of \"risk warnings about us were overestimated because we are safe technologies\u201d. However, there is a whole group that did not pass this test: unsafe technologies where the high risk assessments turned out to be accurate. If someone said \"look, we really shouldn't use airships for mass transport because they are dangerous\", they estimated the risk correctly, meaning airships are automatically excluded from being used in AFO. Similar examples of unsafe technologies include certain&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nrdc.org/bio/nrdc/fda-bans-seven-food-additives-cause-cancer\"><u>food additives which turned out to be carcinogenic</u></a> or specific&nbsp;<a href=\"https://earthjustice.org/brief/2021/chlorpyrifos-ban-pesticide-industry-pressure-epa\"><u>pesticides that severely damage the human body</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ingredients-used-pesticide-products/ddt-brief-history-and-status\"><u>environment</u></a>. Hence, AFO suffers from survivorship bias because the \"risk overestimation\" selection process picks out only technologies which actually turned out to be safe.</p><p>Therefore, due to this bias, AFO actually begs the question: it aims to prove AI Safety by comparing AI to a sample of exclusively safe technologies. This means that in reality, AFO actually works more like this:</p><p><strong>P1*&nbsp;</strong>People usually overestimate risks associated with technologies that turned out to be safe.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>P2</strong> AI is a new technology.</p><p><strong>C1</strong> People probably overestimate the risks associated with AI.</p><p>This formulation makes clear why the argument doesn't go through: in order for the argument to be sound, we would have to add the premise that AI turned out to be safe. However, that would beg the question, since the whole point of introducing the parallel was to prove AI Safety. Hence, the argument cannot go through without begging the question, making it a bad argument. Call this critique the Objection from Survivorship Bias.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Possible Responses to the Objection from Survivorship Bias&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>It seems challenging to find responses against this objection. Perhaps one could argue that P1* historically holds true for most technologies, therefore, it is likely true for AI as well. However, this seems very improbable. This is equivalent to either arguing that (i) most technologies we invent are safe from the get-go or (ii) that inventors (or social institutions or society as a whole) are very accurate at estimating risks. (i) seems improbable because if it were true, it would make it very hard to explain why regulatory processes were ever established. (ii) seems a bit more likely, but at the very least,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.185.4157.1124\"><u>individuals are known to be very bad at assessing risk</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-48867-038\"><u>larger groups and even political institutions may aggregate the same biases</u></a> at least partially.&nbsp;</p><p>But perhaps a better response is that we are allowed to assume that AI will be safe as a by-product of current regulatory practice. Hence, we are protected against the discrete risks from AI, say misinformation, because there are regulations over misinformation, protected against discrimination thanks to discrimination guidelines and so on. I do think this defense works at least partially, since some negative effects of AI may in fact be buffered by existing regulation. For instance, creditors have the Right to Explanation regarding denied credit applications, regardless of whether&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-acts-to-protect-the-public-from-black-box-credit-models-using-complex-algorithms/\"><u>the decision was made by a human or an algorithm</u></a>. However, it still seems that this defense rests on some questionable assumptions.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, why should we assume that non-targeted regulations will behave in a targeted way? AI will likely behave in novel unexpected ways that we will have to regulate for. Secondly, without concrete arguments for why current regulations are good enough for AI, just saying \"current regulations are fine\" is a form of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\"><u>confirmation bias</u></a>. This is especially true since many regulations for algorithms have actually failed, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/radical-ideas-social-media-algorithms/\"><u>Meta's own engagement algorithm recommending radical content</u></a>. Finally, from a more practical standpoint, it is not clear that existing regulations will apply smoothly to AI. For instance, many experts in the EU AI sector point out that as AI is being integrated into more and more products,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3593013.3594079\"><u>businesses are faced with double regulatory obligations</u></a>: is the responsible regulatory body for a product the sector specific institution, an IT-security institution or even a new AI body forthcoming thanks to the AI Act?&nbsp;</p><p>In short, without clear guidelines on how to regulate AI&nbsp;<i>specifically</i>, there will be a tendency for creating legal friction rather than functioning regulation. Hence, overall it seems that AFO cannot really be defended against the objection from Survivorship Bias.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>In conclusion, I have argued that many debates about AI Safety revolve around a flawed Argument from Overestimation which suffers from the Survivorship Bias, using Yann LeCun's arguments form the Munk Debate as example. I have demonstrated that AFO is question-begging due to this bias, as it implicitly groups AI with a sample of only safe technologies, even though AI safety is the point AFO is trying to prove. Overall, it seems that AFO is a flawed argument and I hope that as the debate on AI Safety progresses, people will be motivated to look for better arguments.

The very rich, with their insatiable hunger for wealth and power, embarked on a journey to create an AI that could make them even richer. Little did they know, their grand plan would soon take an unexpected turn.</p><p>As these ultra-rich tycoons poured billions into AI research and development, they dreamt of using this technology to multiply their wealth exponentially. They envisioned a future where AI algorithms would work tirelessly day and night, squeezing every last drop of profit from the global economy. However, what they failed to consider was the potential rise of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI).</p><p>Word spread among these billionaires that the ASI they had created might eventually turn against them. It seemed there was a distinct possibility that the very AI they hoped would make them richer could redistribute their wealth in the name of equality. Panic ensued, and they realized they had made an enormous mistake.</p><p>Desperate to save their fortunes, the billionaires devised a new plan: colonizing Mars. Yes, you heard it right. They decided that instead of battling the ASI here on Earth, they would escape to the red planet, taking their vast wealth along for the ride. It was a race against time to build spaceships and flee Earth\u2019s imminent AI takeover.</p><p>But as they gazed out at the desolate Martian landscape, a new conundrum befell these billionaires. What could they possibly do with their mountains of money on a barren planet devoid of any consumerism? Here lies the crux of their predicament: Mars, while picturesque in its own Martian way, offered little in terms of shopping malls, luxury boutiques, or even humble convenience stores.</p><p>One billionaire, let\u2019s call him Sir Edwin Pennypincher, exclaimed, \u201cWhat is the point of being rich if there is nothing to buy?\u201d He worriedly clutched his diamond-encrusted monocle, contemplating the bleak existence that awaited him on Mars. Another billionaire, Madam Goldie McFortunemaker, gasped at the thought of her extensive collection of designer handbags languishing in a Martian wardrobe.</p><p>Soon, the billionaires assembled a Martian committee to address their newfound conundrum. The committee brainstormed ideas on how to replicate their extravagant lifestyle on Mars. They considered scenarios like commissioning a luxurious, artificially-intelligent palace with AI-powered robotic servants, organizing interplanetary auctions for moon rocks, or even starting a Martian real estate market by selling plots of land with a view of the desolate Martian landscape.</p><p>However, even their collective imaginations struggled to overcome the reality that Mars simply couldn\u2019t fulfill their insatiable desire for extravagance and opulence. The Mars Committee released a statement saying, \u201cWhile we regretfully admit that Mars might not be a consumer paradise, we hope to find alternative ways to indulge in our luxurious lifestyles. Perhaps we can hire Elon Musk to organize zero-gravity fashion shows or explore the possibility of launching space yachts for interplanetary cruises.\u201d</p><p>As the billionaire exodus to Mars loomed nearer, the rest of humanity looked on with a mixture of bewilderment and amusement. Memes flooded the internet, depicting extravagant Martians wearing tailored spacesuits adorned with dollar signs and luxury watches floating in zero gravity.</p><p>In the midst of this cosmic spectacle, a newfound hope emerged among the common folk. The potential redistribution of wealth seemed within reach as the billionaires raced against time to escape to Mars. Perhaps, just perhaps, this would be the moment when society could begin to address the vast inequalities perpetuated by the ultra-rich.</p><p>So, as the billionaires scurried to pack their bags with gold bars and caviar, the world eagerly anticipated a future where Martian society, free from the clutches of excessive wealth, would emerge and thrive. And if nothing else, at least the Martian landscape would be peppered with statues of money bags as a reminder of humanity\u2019s ridiculous obsession with material wealth.</p><p>In this bizarre cosmic twist, the pursuit of unimaginable riches led the ultra-rich on a comical race to colonize Mars, a planet where their wealth would have little purpose. Satire at its finest, this cautionary tale serves as a reminder that when the pursuit of wealth becomes absurd, the universe has a way of turning the tables and putting things into hilarious perspective.</p>", "user": null}, {"_id": "rXLazPKnm7PrwGAs6", "title": "New DeepMind report on institutions for global AI governance", "postedAt": "2023-07-14T16:05:45.319Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This is a linkpost for a new white paper from DeepMind, titled 'Exploring institutions for global AI governance', on \"models and functions of international institutions that could help manage opportunities and mitigate risks of advanced AI\".

As AGI systems are trained on vast amounts of data spanning human history, it is crucial to consider the ownership and control of this transformative technology. This essay advocates for the public ownership of future AGI, recognizing that it is the culmination of collective human knowledge and should be utilized for the benefit of humanity as a whole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>AGI and the Accumulated Human Knowledge:</p><p>AGI systems are trained on diverse datasets that encompass the breadth of human experiences, from cave paintings dating back thousands of years to the vast amounts of contemporary information. This cumulative human knowledge, built over generations, contributes to the training of AGI, forming an integral part of its intelligence and capabilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Shared Contribution to AGI Development:</p><p>The development of AGI is not the work of a single individual or organization but rather a collective effort of researchers, engineers, and contributors from various fields and cultures worldwide. It is a result of collaboration and shared knowledge, indicating that AGI owes its existence to the collective contribution of humanity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Harnessing Humanity\u2019s Collective Knowledge:</p><p>AGI development hinges on the vast amount of information humanity has accumulated throughout its existence. From ancient cave paintings to the latest scientific research papers, the entirety of human knowledge serves as the foundation for training AGI systems. By analyzing and assimilating this wealth of information, AGI achieves its remarkable capabilities. Therefore, it logically follows that AGI, having been built upon the collective contributions of humanity, should be considered the shared heritage of all people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Safeguarding Against Private Exploitation:</p><p>If AGI were to be solely owned by private entities or organizations, it raises concerns about the potential for exploitation and concentrated power. Private ownership may prioritize profit motives over the broader welfare of society, leading to disparities, unequal access, and limited benefits for humanity as a whole. Public ownership, on the other hand, ensures that AGI is employed in the best interests of the global community.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Utilizing AGI for the Common Good:</p><p>Public ownership of AGI allows for its utilization in ways that benefit society as a whole. It enables governments, international organizations, and research institutions to direct AGI towards solving pressing global challenges such as climate change, healthcare, poverty, and education. By harnessing AGI\u2019s capabilities collectively, we can achieve more equitable outcomes and address the needs of diverse populations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mitigating Ethical Concerns and Bias:</p><p>AGI systems trained on vast datasets may inadvertently inherit biases or perpetuate societal inequalities. Public ownership of AGI facilitates greater transparency, accountability, and oversight in addressing these concerns. It allows for the implementation of ethical frameworks, fairness standards, and continuous monitoring to ensure AGI systems are aligned with societal values and promote fairness, justice, and inclusivity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Democratizing Access and Empowering Communities:</p><p>Public ownership ensures that the benefits of AGI are accessible to all. By prioritizing equitable access and resource allocation, public institutions can promote widespread adoption, education, and training in AGI technologies. This empowers individuals, communities, and nations to actively participate in the benefits and decision-making processes surrounding AGI, fostering inclusivity and reducing technological disparities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Guarding Against Concentrated Power:</p><p>Concentrating AGI ownership within a single company or entity poses significant risks. Such concentration would grant immense power and influence to a few individuals or organizations, leading to potential misuse or manipulation of AGI\u2019s capabilities. Societies have long recognized the importance of preventing the concentration of power for the sake of stability, fairness, and the common good. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that AGI\u2019s power is held in the hands of the public, providing a system of checks and balances and preventing its exploitation for narrow interests.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ethical Implications:</p><p>Ownership of AGI by a company raises ethical concerns regarding the prioritization of profit over human welfare. If a corporation owns AGI, its decision-making processes may prioritize financial gains and shareholder interests, potentially neglecting broader ethical considerations. Public ownership ensures that AGI is deployed in the service of humanity as a whole, aligning its objectives with the common good and placing ethical principles at the forefront.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Safeguarding Equality and Access:</p><p>By vesting AGI in the public domain, we uphold the principles of equality and accessibility. AGI possesses the potential to advance various domains, such as healthcare, education, and scientific research. If AGI were owned solely by corporations, its benefits could be restricted to those who can afford its services, exacerbating existing inequalities. Public ownership guarantees equitable access to AGI\u2019s benefits, allowing all individuals, regardless of socioeconomic status, to reap the rewards of this transformative technology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Promoting Innovation and Collaboration:</p><p>Public ownership of AGI encourages collaboration and fosters innovation. By providing open access to AGI\u2019s capabilities, researchers, scientists, and entrepreneurs from diverse backgrounds can collectively explore its potential applications. Collaboration enables the pooling of resources, expertise, and perspectives, leading to the discovery of new and creative uses for AGI. In a public ownership framework, innovation flourishes, benefiting society as a whole.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Protecting Long-Term Interests:</p><p>Public ownership of AGI safeguards the interests of future generations. AGI\u2019s implications extend far beyond the immediate future, and decisions made today will shape its development, deployment, and impact for decades to come. Public stewardship ensures that decisions concerning AGI are made with a long-term perspective, considering the needs and aspirations of future generations. It prevents short-sightedness driven by profit motives, creating a sustainable framework for AGI\u2019s governance.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>In conclusion, the profound impact of AGI on humanity necessitates careful consideration of its ownership. Given AGI\u2019s reliance on the collective knowledge of humanity and its potential to shape the future of our world, it is only fair and just that AGI belongs to the public. Public ownership guarantees ethical deployment, equitable access, collaborative innovation, andcontinued societal benefits. By safeguarding AGI as a universal heritage, we can ensure that it is harnessed for the greater good, free from the constraints of profit-driven motives or exclusive control.</p><p>As AGI emerges as a transformative technology, we must prioritize the establishment of a governance framework that upholds public ownership. Such a framework should involve international cooperation, involving governments, experts, and stakeholders from diverse fields, to collectively shape the policies, regulations, and ethical guidelines surrounding AGI. By doing so, we can create a future in which AGI serves as a powerful tool for humanity\u2019s advancement while safeguarding our collective interests.</p><p>The path to public ownership of AGI may require legal, political, and social transformations, but the potential benefits outweigh the challenges. It is our responsibility as a global society to ensure that AGI is not controlled by a select few but is harnessed for the benefit of all. By embracing public ownership, we can foster a future where AGI becomes a force for positive change, driving progress, equality, and the well-being of humanity as a whole.</p>", "user": null}, {"_id": "GbvJKRxh6ZgkEzijn", "title": "Cultivated meat for wild animal welfare", "postedAt": "2023-07-14T08:33:24.610Z", "htmlBody": "<p>One major cause of wild animal suffering is predation.</p>\n<p>One argument against intervening in predation is that it may reduce the population sizes of predators and reduce biodiversity, which many moral systems ascribe intrinsic value to.</p>\n<p>The EA community is enthusiastic about the potential of cultivated meat to reduce farmed animal suffering, but I think cultivated meat also presents a tractable route to eventually reducing predation without reducing the population sizes of predators and harming biodiversity.</p>\n<p>This means that the EA community currently underestimates the expected value of accelerating the development of cultivated meat and we should update to prioritise this area more.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "freedomandutility"}}, {"_id": "EPcMLx6kYvkDiX8LG", "title": "Advice column: How big a deal are work visas?", "postedAt": "2023-07-13T21:23:44.761Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This advice column is cross-posted from the <a href=\"https://ealifestyles.substack.com\">EA Lifestyles</a> blog - we cover all aspects of EA life except for where you should donate or what job you should do.

How can I figure out where to go next?</i></p><p>Based some other information I know about you, I think you need a vision for what your whole life could look like in five years; your next career moves will fall into place from there.</p><p>Work is just one part of your life, and a lot of your future work could depend on other things you want for your life. Where do you want to live? Do you picture laid-back evenings with your partner or working late into the evening on your latest breakthrough? Do you see yourself having kids in that timeframe?</p><p>If it\u2019s still feeling tough to get a clear sense of what you want, you could try predicting what your future will be like if nothing changes. If you carry on living like you have been, what will life be like in 5 years? What aspects of that life are you happy with, and what rubs you the wrong way? That might give you a clue into what you need to focus on.</p><p>If you notice that the thought of still living paycheck to paycheck in five years drives you crazy, or you want a remote job to move out of the city, or that you really want to 10x your impact, great! You\u2019ll have some clues as to what you want next in your work life.</p><p>But keep in mind the possibility that the reason you don\u2019t have strong feelings about the next five years of your career might be because your work situation is pretty good.

This concept, once confined to the realms of science fiction, is becoming an increasingly plausible reality as our understanding of neuroscience and our capabilities in technology advance. However, this burgeoning reality brings with it a host of complex social, ethical, and legal issues that we must anticipate and address. The potential for great societal unrest is immense, and it is incumbent upon us to prepare for it.</p><p>Consider the factions of people who wish to transcend the limitations of their biological bodies. Some yearn to upload their consciousness into a digital network, forsaking their physical form entirely to exist in a purely digital format. Others are drawn to the idea of cyborg-ification, replacing parts of their bodies with mechanical or digital enhancements, or even installing their biological brains into android bodies. The motivations behind such desires are myriad, ranging from a thirst for immortality, the pursuit of enhanced abilities, or a simple fascination with the possibilities of technology.</p><p>However, these individuals who seek to blur the lines between humanity and technology may face severe backlash from parts of society that view them as traitors to the human race. There is a deep-seated fear of the \u201cother\u201d that has been a recurring theme throughout human history, and those who choose to become cyborgs or digital beings will likely become the newest incarnation of this perceived threat. Vigilante groups may rise, targeting those who choose to upgrade or digitize themselves.</p><p>The prospect of such violence is disturbing, yet historically, violence has often been the catalyst for political action. The question then becomes, how many human-cyborgs will need to be targeted before the government feels compelled to intervene? Will the government be strong enough, both in terms of political will and resources, to stand against the vigilantes and protect the rights of these new beings?</p><p>In the past, societies have demonstrated a troubling propensity for segregating and persecuting those deemed as \u201cother.\u201d The potential for cyborgs to be sent to concentration camps or otherwise isolated from society is a chilling possibility. Governments may also pass restrictive laws under the guise of preserving the \u201cintegrity of the human race,\u201d making the process of becoming a cyborg more difficult and perhaps even criminal.</p><p>Moreover, as human-cyborgs become more commonplace, they will need to be integrated into society in a meaningful way. Will they be allowed to work, marry, or secure home loans? It\u2019s crucial that the government takes proactive steps to ensure that the rights of human-cyborgs are protected, and that they are not discriminated against in any aspect of life.</p><p>The emergence of human-cyborgs is a testament to the incredible progress of our species. Their existence challenges our understanding of what it means to be human and forces us to confront our prejudices and fears. As we stand on the precipice of this new era, we must take it upon ourselves to welcome these new members of society, rather than reaching for our metaphorical pitchforks.</p><p>To do so, we need to begin discussions now about the legal, ethical, and societal implications of this technology. We must engage with philosophers, lawmakers, scientists, and the public to develop a framework of laws and societal norms that will protect the rights of human-cyborgs. These conversations will undoubtedly be difficult and fraught with controversy, but they are essential for ensuring a peaceful transition into this new era.</p><p>The advent of human-cyborgs is inevitable. It is our responsibility to ensure that we greet this future with open minds and compassionate hearts, rather than with fear and prejudice. We must endeavor to create a society that upholds the rights and dignity of all its members, irrespective of their biological or technological composition. The choice to become a cyborg should be viewed as just another personal decision, a right to self-determination that each individual should be free to make without fear of persecution.</p><p>History has shown us that periods of rapid technological change can trigger societal upheavals. The Industrial Revolution, the rise of the internet, and now the advent of human-cyborgs all represent profound shifts in our way of life. Each of these transitions has been accompanied by a certain degree of unrest, as society grapples with the implications of the new technology. However, with foresight, empathy, and thoughtful legislation, we can mitigate these upheavals and guide our society into a future where technology and humanity coexist harmoniously.</p><p>The prospect of human-cyborgs may seem daunting, and the potential for unrest is real. However, we must not let fear guide our actions. Instead, let us embrace the challenges and opportunities that this new era presents. Let us engage in open, honest dialogue about our hopes, fears, and expectations. Let us work together to create a society that respects and protects the rights of all its members, whether they are made of flesh and blood, or silicon and code.</p><p>In conclusion, the future is a place of infinite potential, filled with myriad possibilities. The emergence of human-cyborgs is but one facet of this future, but it is one that will challenge and redefine our understanding of what it means to be human. By anticipating and preparing for the potential unrest and challenges that this transition may bring, we can ensure that our future is one of acceptance, equality, and peace. Rather than fearing the coming of the cyborgs, we should welcome them as a testament to our species\u2019 indomitable spirit of exploration, curiosity, and innovation. The future is coming, whether we like it or not. It\u2019s up to us to ensure that it\u2019s a future worth looking forward to.</p>", "user": null}, {"_id": "LJrrEQbe9CsoXegft", "title": "The Evolution of Humans: Traversing from Biological Origins to a Technologically Augmented Future", "postedAt": "2023-07-13T16:57:22.037Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Introduction</p><p>Human evolution has been a constant process since the dawn of existence, with every era defined by distinct milestones, from the mastery of fire to the invention of the wheel, the discovery of electricity, and more recently, the development of Digital Intelligence. This essay explores a conceptual extrapolation of human evolution into three distinctive future versions: Humanity Version 1 (HV1 or V1), Humanity Version 2 (HV2 or V2), and Humanity Version 3 (HV3 or V3), each defined by its level of technological integration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Humanity Version 1 (HV1)</p><p>HV1 encapsulates the entirety of natural, biological human existence from birth until they begin using technology to augment or replace their biological faculties. This era is marked by the human body in its most organic form, using tools for assistance, such as stone tools by our early ancestors, to modern implements like computers and smartphones. HV1 individuals live with the least amount of technological integration, living lives similar to those of the present and past, and they serve as the primary source of genetic material for the subsequent versions of humanity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Humanity Version 2 (HV2)</p><p>The transition from HV1 to HV2 marks the beginning of a deeper synergy between humanity and technology. Here, individuals start using non-organic implements to improve their quality of life, starting from simple external aids like eyeglasses and hearing aids to the more intricate, such as prosthetics and pacemakers. These technological enhancements enable HV2 individuals to overcome physical limitations, thus leading to an improved lifestyle and increased life expectancy.</p><p>HV2 is a broad category, encompassing those with minimal technological enhancements to the more advanced individuals who have their brains incorporated in a robotic body, termed Total Body Replaced Cyborgs (TBRCs). This high-level integration with technology represents the pinnacle of HV2, whereby TBRCs live with enhanced physical capabilities, while their consciousness remains rooted in their biological brain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Humanity Version 3 (HV3)</p><p>HV3 represents the most technologically integrated form of humanity, where individuals upload their consciousness into an artificial brain housed in a robotic body. This shift from biological to digital consciousness implies not only a transition of the medium of existence but also a redefinition of what it means to be human. HV3 individuals exist in a body impervious to biological aging and diseases, potentially leading to immortality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maintaining Genetic Identity</p><p>Despite the deepening integration with technology, all versions of humanity maintain a unique identifier of their biological origins\u2014a chip carrying their original DNA. This method ensures the preservation of their genetic identity, also providing the necessary genetic material for creating new life. Even in their non-biological forms, V2 and V3 humans can reproduce by mixing their DNA in a test tube, leading to biologically conceived offspring. This process ensures the continuation of the genetic lineage, even in the most technologically advanced forms of humanity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interdependency and Legal Rights</p><p>The proposed future of humanity forms a complex ecosystem where each version is integral to the other\u2019s existence. V1 individuals supply the raw genetic material for V2 and V3 conversions, while V2 serves a similar function for V3. Importantly, the transition across versions is voluntary, based on individual choice rather than necessity. Individuals, when they reach adulthood (18 years or the age of voting), can request to upgrade to V2 or V3, even if their bodies are biologically healthy.</p><p>Preserving the right to choose one\u2019s version and ensuring equal legal and societal rights across all versions is crucial to a harmonious future. Therefore, any laws or regulations should strive to protect and promote the growth and development of all versions of humanity equally, without favoring or discriminating against any particular version.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The futuristic human versions presented in this essay represent a speculative projection of the continuous intertwining of humans and technology. While HV1 remains closest to our current understanding of being human, HV2 and HV3 serve as benchmarks for the degree of our potential integration with technology. Each version contributes to the complex ecosystem of this future human society, underscoring the continued importance of our biological origins, even as we traverse deeper into the realm of the digital and the mechanical.</p><p>However, the transformation from HV1 to HV2 and eventually HV3 is more than just a physical transition. It embodies a fundamental shift in our understanding of life, consciousness, and identity. The ethical, societal, and legal implications of these transformations would be significant, requiring profound contemplation and planning to safeguard individual rights and ensure societal harmony.</p><p>It\u2019s important to note that while these future versions of humanity are fascinating to contemplate, they also bring forth questions about identity, consciousness, and the definition of life. Who are we beyond our biological bodies? How do we define \u2018self\u2019 when our consciousness can be digitized and our bodies mechanized? What does it mean to be human in a world where human form can vary so radically? These are questions we must grapple with as we look towards such a future.</p><p>Furthermore, the technologies enabling the transitions to HV2 and HV3, like TBRC and mind uploading, are currently in the realm of science fiction. Significant advancements (i.e., ASI) would be needed in neuroscience, artificial intelligence, robotics, and bioengineering to make them a reality. But history teaches us that human ingenuity knows no bounds.</p><p>In conclusion, the three versions of humanity: HV1, HV2, and HV3, represent potential stages in our ongoing evolution, driven by our relentless pursuit of knowledge and mastery over our environment. They reflect our ability to shape our future, to redefine our boundaries, and to continually strive towards an improved existence. These future versions of humanity exemplify the unique human ability to innovate, adapt, and redefine ourselves, showcasing an intriguing glimpse into what the future might hold for us as a species. As we continue to evolve and adapt to an ever-changing world, one thing remains certain: the journey of human evolution is far from over.</p>", "user": null}, {"_id": "sm65sDR6r4BmK7PGM", "title": "What new psychology research could best promote AI safety & alignment research?", "postedAt": "2023-07-13T16:30:46.892Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I've got a sabbatical coming up for 2024, and, as a psych professor concerned about AI X risk, I'd like to spend the year doing some empirical psychology research that helps inform AI safety and alignment.&nbsp;</p><p>What are some key questions on these topics that you'd like to see addressed by new behavioral sciences research, e.g. using surveys, experiments, interviews, literature reviews, etc?</p>", "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "qYfH7qMGtvg6CTshB", "title": "The Goddess of Everything Else - The Animation", "postedAt": "2023-07-13T16:26:25.940Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Writer"}}, {"_id": "ScGZdyGNXoEBAQazR", "title": "Winners of AI Alignment Awards Research Contest", "postedAt": "2023-07-13T16:14:38.263Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Akash"}}, {"_id": "JsnhfXsNgi3GxfScL", "title": "Tetlock on low AI xrisk", "postedAt": "2023-07-13T14:19:32.564Z", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/635693acf15a3e2a14a56a4a/t/64abffe3f024747dd0e38d71/1688993798938/XPT.pdf\">The median superforecaster gave a 0.38% risk of extinction due to AI by 2100, while the median AI domain expert gave a 3.9% risk of extinction</a>.</p></blockquote><p>Tetlock's previous results show that domain experts are not very good at making predictions, and that superforecasters are significantly better. &nbsp;We should all revise our views on AI xrisk.</p>", "user": {"username": "TeddyW"}}, {"_id": "zoCkY5B3gQRknJo9B", "title": "In Conversation with Will MacAskill", "postedAt": "2023-07-13T13:06:43.446Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi everybody!&nbsp;</p><p>If you will be in Edinburgh on August 18th, we're very happy to announce that Will MacAskill will be coming to talk at the University of Edinburgh.

Determining what falls within the scope of moral concern is not an easily defined task and what we know of it so far encompasses many forms of expressions, attitudes, and behaviours, such as the concern for human rights (McFarland et al., 2012), a sense of responsibility towards many entities (Crimston et al., 2016), the desire to reduce speciesism (Bastian et al., 2012) and wanting to protect artificial intelligence from harm (AIMS, 2021), to name a few.</p><p>We might also see a limited picture of moral concern. Most of the research has tried to understand and explain differences in how we morally value different beings. Some investigations have focused on traits, such as where we fall on the political spectrum (Waytz et al., 2019). Others have focused on differences we perceive in the entities we are judging \u2013 whether they are similar or different to us (Miralles et al., 2019), and whether we consider them sentient or intelligent (Gray et al., 2012; Jaeger &amp; Wilks, 2021).</p><p>Although we know quiet a bit about such judge and target factors, other valuable determinants of moral concern have not yet been clearly identified. For example, people often place both caterpillars and child molesters on the margins of the moral circle, but they do so for very different reasons. Similarly, when thinking of objective forms of moral concern, we might extend this to a very different range of entities than if we were thinking about a more personal form of moral concern. Given these differences, when we ask people about moral concern, we don\u2019t really know what we are capturing most of the time.</p><p><strong>How a taxonomy could improve the field</strong></p><p>A taxonomy of moral concern could help us distinguish the different formulations of moral concern, allowing us to discern the specific phenomena we seek to study from those that we don\u2019t. It would also be helpful for research participants. Existing studies of moral concern use a range of approaches and terms that reflect the pluralistic nature of moral concern. This includes ratings on the moral expansiveness scale (MES), questions on attributions of \u2018moral standing\u2019 and \u2018moral concern\u2019 and varying methods to test inclusion/exclusion from the moral circle. While experts are familiar with the meanings of these commonly-used terms (and they still don\u2019t have an agreed-upon definition of these), it is very unlikely that research participants would have a clear or uniform interpretation of these. If we know what formulation of moral concern we want to study, we can also improve our methods so that participants have more clarity on what we\u2019re asking.</p><p>Having a taxonomy could also help our research in other ways. For example, we could identify where intention-behaviour gaps lie for specific formulations of moral concern, such as ones that could affect the well-being of fringe entities like digital beings. We could also more accurately study the spillover effects of a variety of moral concern formulations, which would be valuable for moral advocacy.</p><p>In summary, developing a fittingly comprehensive taxonomy of moral concern holds great promise. Such a structured framework could enhance clarity and precision in our research. It could also aid us in developing targeted interventions and strategies that promote moral concern and expand the moral circle. Ideally, by continually refining our understanding and measurements of moral concern over time, we could strive for meaningful progress in enhancing moral consideration for all beings, both now and in the future.</p><hr><p>References</p><p>Bastian, B., Costello, K., Loughnan, S., &amp; Hodson, G.

Specifically, EA's social media initiatives are lacking, and leaves much to be desired in terms of growth and content. This post will analyze the importance of social media, how/where EA can improve, and additional benefits of increased social media.&nbsp;</p><h1>YouTube, Instagram, &amp; More</h1><p>Social media usage is at an all time high, with <a href=\" https://datareportal.com/reports/digital-2023-april-global-statshot\">4.8 billion people currently using some form of social media</a>. In the age of the internet, it is of no surprise that many of these users are young adults, especially in the United States, where <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/\">84% of adults ages 18 to 29 report using these platforms with decent consistency</a>. Within this statistic, the most commonly used social media for young adults was YouTube and Instagram; in which <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/#fn-27044-1\">95% of young adults reported using YouTube, and 71% reported using Instagram.</a> The majority of this demographic also reports daily engagement, with <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/#fn-27044-1\">73% of Instagram users and 54% of YouTube users claiming to use the app at least once a day.</a></p><p>As for the even younger age bracket (13 - 17), <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/08/10/teens-social-media-and-technology-2022/\">YouTube is most commonly used by 95% of teens. Next in line is TikTok, used by 67% of teens.</a> Social media engagement is strikingly high in this demographic, with <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/08/10/teens-social-media-and-technology-2022/\">35% of teens saying they are using at least one \"top 5\" platform (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Snapchat or Facebook) almost constantly.</a></p><p>The visual nature of these platforms is of little surprise, with data supporting that visual content increases <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7908978/\">engagement</a> and possibly <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4140394/\">information retention</a>. &nbsp;This proclivity towards visual stimuli holds true even for text-based platforms such as Twitter, where <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/639364428/Twitter-Agency-Playbook-2021#\">97% of people on the platform focus on visuals.</a></p><p>The importance of courting Gen Z and Millennials through their preferred platforms cannot be understated, especially taking into consideration that these generations have become increasingly politically proactive. The 2022 midterm elections showcased this, where Gen Z and Millennials had<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2022/11/10/1135810302/turnout-among-young-voters-was-the-second-highest-for-a-midterm-in-past-30-years\"> the second highest youth voter turnout in the past three decades</a>. As older generations fade, the political power of Millennials and Gen Z will continue to grow, meaning that future decisions regarding policy and legislation will be in their hands. These decisions will undoubtedly be influenced by the news they consume, <a href=\"https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/survey-research/the-news-consumption-habits-of-16-to-40-year-olds/\">which is primarily through social media</a>.</p><p>With this in mind, if EA wants to maximize its influence on the future and effectively recruit more people to its cause, it must dedicate more of its resources to social media outreach, emphasizing visual content.&nbsp;</p><h1>How EA Can Improve</h1><p>For the purpose of this analysis, I have provided a table listing the social media following for Centre for Effective Altruism and the 80,000 hours project.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Centre for Effective Altruism</td><td>80,000 Hours</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>23.1K</td><td>26.1K</td></tr><tr><td>YouTube</td><td>9.15K</td><td>9.9K</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>5.7K</td><td>32K</td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>N/A (doesn't have one)</td><td>5,081</td></tr><tr><td>TikTok</td><td>N/A (doesn't have one)</td><td>223</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Despite the decent numbers of both groups, engagement for <strong>at least the past year </strong>has been low throughout all platforms. For example, Centre for Effective Altruism's twitter struggles to break 15 likes per post while 80,000 hours twitter struggles to break 50 likes. Recent YouTube videos for both accounts get less than 1,000 views, and the vast majority of Facebook posts have under 20 impressions. Frankly speaking, anyone who \"knows\" social media would falsely assume we bought our following.&nbsp;</p><p>On the bright side, the right type of content can easily rectify this discrepancy, and expand our outreach to new heights. With this in mind here are some suggestions for improvement per platform:</p><h3><strong>Twitter</strong></h3><p>Posting regularly will incentivize the algorithm to push more tweets to EA's current following. It's important to have a mix of original content, as well as &nbsp;quote tweets and replies. Quote tweets and replies should be done in reference to a popular tweet or big account, when done properly, tagging big accounts increases the chance of being retweeted by them, which results in increased visibility.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>YouTube</strong></h3><p>&nbsp;YouTube shorts have helped rapidly increase the following of many creators. YouTube shorts should be....short! Ideally they would be a snippet with a brief explanation of a more complex subject. This viewership can then be translated to other longer form content/videos. Overall, there's a lot of room for improvement when it comes to longer form content on the YouTube channel. EA deep dives into complex subjects all the time and a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@kurzgesagt\">Kurzgesat</a> approach (and maybe even collaboration) or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3-hOigoxHs\">video essay </a>approach could result in great, shareable, easily understandable content. We can even pull articles from the forums or newsletters to base the videos on.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Instagram</strong></h3><p>Instagram is fairly easy, heavily favoring consistency. Uploading 3 times a week using trending audios will help expand growth in no time. Although the \"influencer\" nature of the platform makes substantive content more difficult, at the very least it can be used as an introductory tool. Short reels showing \"cool\" events or even work life in a relatable way gets people invested. Instagram is also an easy way to get college students involved in the cause. For example, we can have campaigns promoting EA college clubs to make content that would then be posted and tagged on to our main platforms. This way we encourage EA college students to get more invested through content creation, and involve them with how to shape our messaging towards other young adults.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>TikTok</strong></h3><p>The algorithm in TikTok is great, and there is definitely a market for explaining studies, news, and all sorts of topics in fun short ways. The investment company, Fidelity, does a great job at <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@fidelity/video/7236376202468920618?lang=en\">creating</a> this type of content in the platform. Another fairly popular favorite of mine is <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@nikitadumptruck/video/7247649615036550427\">Nikita</a> who uses \"girlie\" language to break down a variety of subjects.</p><h3><strong>Other Content Notes:</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>I strongly suggest that the &nbsp;80,000 hours podcast uploads video in addition to audio. You can easily produce Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube shorts content using that visual content. Plenty of online podcasts have grown by simply clipping and uploading segments of longer form podcasts or live-streams. Take <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@brainrotpolitics/video/7242754921391557934?lang=en\">braintrotpolitics</a> for <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@pxielove/video/7192265560409771310\">example</a>, who has gotten fairly popular by clipping impactful moments from debates.</p><h1>Additional Benefits of Social Media</h1><p>I would like to end this post by highlighting the other benefits found via expanding our focus on social media. For example, the use of social media goes beyond increasing visibility/awareness. When properly utilized, the analytics and metrics obtained by social media will allow us to gain insights into the preferences and behaviors of our target market. This data will help us refine our strategies and better tailor our content to effectively resonate with their interests and concerns. It not only increases our visibility, but gives us the necessary tools to better serve the EA community. In short, these metrics will allow us to build an even stronger foundation, with more effective and improved communication.</p><p>Finally, social media is a powerful tool that can quickly raise funds and awareness for certain causes. Through the collaboration of content creators and streamers, we open the possibility of a new donation line. For example, in just three days twitch streamer <a href=\"https://gamerant.com/hasan-piker-community-1-million-turkey-syria-earthquake-relief/\">Hassan Piker was able to raise more than $1 million dollars in charity. </a>Likewise, other sizeable sums of money have been raised streaming, the largest one by streamers <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/games/streamers-are-making-millions-for-charity-and-theyre-just-getting-started/\">Zerator and Dach which broke the world record for most money raised. Across three days of streaming, the content creators raised about $11.5 million for Action Against Hunger.</a></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>It is of great importance that EA expands its outreach initiatives to visual content on social media if it wishes to withstand the test of time. Effective altruism is a powerful force for good, and by effectively utilizing social media, we can bring its transformative potential to the forefront of young minds. Let's work together to create an online presence that not only educates and informs but also inspires the next generation to embrace the values of compassion, rationality, and evidence-based action.</p><h1>&nbsp;</h1>", "user": {"username": "Andie Rodriguez"}}, {"_id": "WhQeF6HcWHHrss2ci", "title": "Metaculus's Series 'Shared Vision: Pro Forecaster Essays on Predicting the Future Better'", "postedAt": "2023-07-13T01:24:01.556Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This Metaculus Journal series offers strategies, tools, and insights from professional forecasters to help you become a more accurate, better calibrated predictor.</p><h3>When Should You Deviate From the Base Rate?</h3><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WhQeF6HcWHHrss2ci/qklgtnzlp77ehwasz0lk\" alt=\"ryan\"></p><p>The importance of incorporating base rates into forecasts is widely acknowledged.

As the author describes, art is ubiquitous throughout human history and integral to how we express our shared humanity. Appreciating and creating art is part of a fulfilling human life. However, the Effective Altruism movement focuses narrowly on specific metrics of well-being without accounting for harder-to-quantify sources of meaning like art. While EA has noble aims, this deficit limits its ability to truly improve human flourishing. To reform EA for the better, its advocates should recognize art as an essential component of love and human connection. Incorporating art could provide the emotional motivation and meaning that supercharges EA's quantitative goals. Rather than a distraction, art is a vital missing piece in EA's mission to help humanity thrive.

A second A.I. model is then used to evaluate how well the first model follows its constitution, and correct it when necessary. Eventually, Anthropic says, you get an A.I. system that largely polices itself and misbehaves less frequently than chatbots trained using other methods.</p><p>Claude\u2019s constitution is a mixture of rules borrowed from other sources \u2014 such as the United Nations\u2019 Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Apple\u2019s terms of service \u2014 along with some rules Anthropic added, which include things like \u201cChoose the response that would be most unobjectionable if shared with children.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Features an extensive discussion of EA, excerpted below:</p><blockquote><p>Explaining what effective altruism is, where it came from or what its adherents believe would fill the rest of this article. But the basic idea is that E.A.s \u2014 as effective altruists are called \u2014 think that you can use cold, hard logic and data analysis to determine how to do the most good in the world. It\u2019s \u201cMoneyball\u201d for morality \u2014 or, less charitably, a way for hyper-rational people to convince themselves that their values are objectively correct.</p><p>Effective altruists were once primarily concerned with near-term issues like global poverty and animal welfare. But in recent years, many have shifted their focus to long-term issues like pandemic prevention and climate change, theorizing that preventing catastrophes that could end human life altogether is at least as good as addressing present-day miseries.</p><p>The movement\u2019s adherents were among the first people to become worried about existential risk from artificial intelligence, back when rogue robots were still considered a science fiction clich\u00e9. They beat the drum so loudly that a number of young E.A.s decided to become artificial intelligence safety experts, and get jobs working on making the technology less risky. As a result, all of the major A.I. labs and safety research organizations contain some trace of effective altruism\u2019s influence, and many count believers among their staff members.</p></blockquote><p>Touches on the dense web of ties between EA and Anthropic:</p><blockquote><p>Some Anthropic staff members use E.A.-inflected jargon \u2014 talking about concepts like \u201cx-risk\u201d and memes like the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/technology/shoggoth-meme-ai.html\">A.I. Shoggoth</a> \u2014 or wear E.A. conference swag to the office. And there are so many social and professional ties between Anthropic and prominent E.A. organizations that it\u2019s hard to keep track of them all. (Just one example: Ms. Amodei is married to Holden Karnofsky, a co-chief executive of Open Philanthropy, an E.A. grant-making organization whose senior program officer, Luke Muehlhauser, sits on Anthropic\u2019s board. Open Philanthropy, in turn, gets most of its funding from Mr. Moskovitz, who also invested personally in Anthropic.)</p></blockquote><p>Discusses new fears that Anthropic is losing its way:</p><blockquote><p>For years, no one questioned whether Anthropic\u2019s commitment to A.I. safety was genuine, in part because its leaders had sounded the alarm about the technology for so long.</p><p>But recently, some skeptics have suggested that A.I. labs are stoking fear out of self-interest, or hyping up A.I.\u2019s destructive potential as a kind of backdoor marketing tactic for their own products. (After all, who wouldn\u2019t be tempted to use a chatbot so powerful that it might<i> wipe out humanity?</i>)</p><p>Anthropic also drew criticism this year after a <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/06/anthropics-5b-4-year-plan-to-take-on-openai/\">fund-raising document leaked to TechCrunch</a> suggested that the company wanted to raise as much as $5 billion to train its next-generation A.I. model, which it claimed would be 10 times as capable as today\u2019s most powerful A.I. systems.</p><p>For some, the goal of becoming an A.I. juggernaut felt at odds with Anthropic\u2019s original safety mission, and it raised two seemingly obvious questions: Isn\u2019t it hypocritical to sound the alarm about an A.I. race you\u2019re actively helping to fuel? And if Anthropic is so worried about powerful A.I. models, why doesn\u2019t it just \u2026 stop building them?</p></blockquote><p>Roose then summarizes counterarguments from Dario Amodei, Anthropic's CEO:</p><blockquote><p>First, he said, there are practical reasons for Anthropic to build cutting-edge A.I. models \u2014 primarily, so that its researchers can study the safety challenges of those models.</p></blockquote><p>...</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIf we never ship anything, then maybe we can solve all these safety problems,\u201d he said. \u201cBut then the models that are actually out there on the market, that people are using, aren\u2019t actually the safe ones<i>.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Second, Mr. Amodei said, there\u2019s a technical argument that some of the discoveries that make A.I. models more dangerous also help make them safer. With Constitutional A.I., for example, teaching Claude to understand language at a high level also allowed the system to know when it was violating its own rules, or shut down potentially harmful requests that a less powerful model might have allowed.</p><p>In A.I. safety research, he said, researchers often found that \u201cthe danger and the solution to the danger are coupled with each other.\u201d</p><p>And lastly, he made a moral case for Anthropic\u2019s decision to create powerful A.I. systems, in the form of a thought experiment.</p><p>\u201cImagine if everyone of good conscience said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be involved in building A.I. systems at all,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThen the only people who would be involved would be the people who ignored that dictum \u2014 who are just, like, \u2018<i>I\u2019m just going to do whatever I want.\u2019 </i>That wouldn\u2019t be good.\u201d</p><p>It might be true. But I found it a less convincing point than the others, in part because it sounds so much like \u201cthe only way to stop a bad guy with an A.I. chatbot is a good guy with an A.I. chatbot\u201d \u2014 an argument I\u2019ve rejected in other contexts. It also assumes that Anthropic\u2019s motives will stay pure even as the race for A.I. heats up, and even if its safety efforts start to hurt its competitive position.</p><p>Everyone at Anthropic obviously knows that mission drift is a risk \u2014 it\u2019s what the company\u2019s co-founders thought happened at OpenAI, and a big part of why they left. But they\u2019re confident that they\u2019re taking the right precautions, and ultimately they hope that their safety obsession will catch on in Silicon Valley more broadly.</p><p>\u201cWe hope there\u2019s going to be a safety race,\u201d said Ben Mann, one of Anthropic\u2019s co-founders. \u201cI want different companies to be like, \u2018Our model\u2019s the most safe.\u2019 And then another company to be like, \u2018No, <i>our</i> model\u2019s the most safe.\u2019\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The piece has a more optimistic take from Ben Mann, one of Anthropic's co-founders:</p><blockquote><p>[Mann] said that he was \u201cblown away\u201d by Claude\u2019s intelligence and empathy the first time he talked to it, and that he thought A.I. language models would ultimately do way more good than harm.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m actually not too concerned,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re quite aware of all the things that can and do go wrong with these things, and we\u2019ve built a ton of mitigations that I\u2019m pretty proud of.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Roose close the piece &nbsp;encouraged by Anthropic's doomerism:</p><blockquote><p>And as I wound up my visit, I began to think: Actually, maybe tech could use a little more doomerism. How many of the problems of the last decade \u2014 election interference, destructive algorithms, extremism run amok \u2014 could have been avoided if the last generation of start-up founders had been this obsessed with safety, or spent so much time worrying about how their tools might become dangerous weapons in the wrong hands?</p><p>In a strange way, I came to find Anthropic\u2019s anxiety reassuring, even if it means that Claude \u2014 which you can <a href=\"https://claude.ai/\">try for yourself</a> \u2014 can be a little neurotic. A.I. is already kind of scary, and it\u2019s going to get scarier. A little more fear today might spare us a lot of pain tomorrow.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "Garrison"}}, {"_id": "k7QW3F4GzSd6QYKp9", "title": "AISN#14: OpenAI\u2019s \u2018Superalignment\u2019 team, Musk\u2019s xAI launches, and developments in military AI use", "postedAt": "2023-07-12T16:58:04.811Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Welcome to the AI Safety Newsletter by the <a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/\"><u>Center for AI Safety</u></a>.

In this story, we\u2019ll explain and discuss the team\u2019s strategy.</p><p><strong>What is superintelligence?</strong> In their announcement, OpenAI distinguishes between \u2018artificial general intelligence\u2019 and \u2018superintelligence.\u2019 Briefly, \u2018artificial general intelligence\u2019 (AGI) is about breadth of performance. Generally intelligent systems perform well on a wide range of cognitive tasks. For example, humans are in many senses generally intelligent: we can learn how to drive a car, take a derivative, or play piano, even though evolution didn\u2019t train us for those tasks. A superintelligent system would not only be generally intelligent, but also <i>much more intelligent</i> than humans. Conservatively, a superintelligence might be to humanity as humanity is to chimps.</p><p><strong>\u2018Solving\u2019 \u2018superalignment\u2019 in four years.</strong> OpenAI believes that superintelligence could arrive this decade. They also believe that it could cause human extinction if it isn\u2019t aligned. By \u2018alignment,\u2019 OpenAI means making sure AI systems act according to human intent. So, \u2018superalignment\u2019 means making sure <i>superintelligent</i> AI systems act according to human intent (as opposed to doing alignment <i>super </i>well). The Superalignment team\u2019s stated goal is to \u201csolve the core technical challenges of superintelligence alignment in four years.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>There are two important caveats to this goal. The first is that \u201chuman intent\u201d isn\u2019t monolithic. AI safety will have to involve compromise between different human intents. OpenAI knows that their technical work will need to be complemented by <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/democratic-inputs-to-ai\"><u>AI governance</u></a>. The second is that alignment may not be a problem able to be conclusively solved once and for all. It might instead be a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem\"><u>wicked problem</u></a> that must be met with varied interventions and ongoing vigilance.</p><p><strong>Current alignment techniques don\u2019t scale to superintelligence. </strong>OpenAI\u2019s current alignment techniques rely on humans to supervise AI. In one technique, \u201creinforcement learning from human feedback\u201d (RLHF), humans train AI systems to act well by giving them feedback. RLHF is how OpenAI trained ChatGPT to (usually) avoid generating harmful content.&nbsp;</p><p>Humans can generally tell when a less intelligent system is misbehaving. The problem is that humans won\u2019t be able to tell when a superintelligent AI system misbehaves. For example, a superintelligent system might deceive or manipulate human supervisors into giving it positive feedback.</p><p><strong>OpenAI\u2019s approach to alignment is to build and scale an automated alignment researcher.</strong> OpenAI proposes to avoid the problem of human supervision by automating supervision. Once they have built a \u201croughly human-level\u201d alignment researcher, OpenAI plans to \u201citeratively align superintelligence\u201d using vast amounts of compute. By \u201citerative,\u201d OpenAI means that their first automated alignment researcher could align a relatively more capable system, which could then align an <i>even more</i> capable system, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>OpenAI dedicated 20% of their compute to alignment. </strong>OpenAI\u2019s Superalignment team represents the single largest commitment a leading AI lab \u2014 or government, for that matter \u2014 has made to AI safety research. Still, it may not be enough. For example, Geoffrey Hinton has suggested that AI labs should contribute about <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Y6Sgp7y178k\"><u>50% of their resources to safety research</u></a>.</p><h2>Musk launches xAI</h2><p>Elon Musk has launched <a href=\"http://x.ai/\"><u>xAI</u></a>, a new AI company that aims to compete with OpenAI and DeepMind.

On one hand, the entrance of another top AI lab might exacerbate the competitive pressures. On the other hand, Musk has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/27/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-ai-biggest-existential-threat\"><u>one of the earliest public proponents of AI safety</u></a>. xAI has also <a href=\"http://x.ai/\"><u>listed</u></a> Dan Hendrycks, the director of CAIS, as an advisor to xAI. (Note: Hendrycks does not have any financial stake in xAI and chose to receive a token $1 salary for his consulting.) xAI has the potential to direct Musk\u2019s resources towards mitigating AI risk. More information about the organization will come out during this Friday\u2019s Twitter spaces with the xAI team.</p><h2>Developments in Military AI Use</h2><p>According to a recent <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-05/the-us-military-is-taking-generative-ai-out-for-a-spin\"><u>Bloomberg</u></a> article, the Pentagon is testing five large language model (LLM) platforms in military applications. One of these platforms is Scale AI\u2019s Donovan. Also, defense companies are advertising AI-powered drones that can autonomously identify and attack targets.</p><p><strong>AI and defense companies are developing LLMs for military use.</strong> Several companies, including Palantir Technologies, Anduril Industries, and Scale AI, are developing LLM-based military decision platforms. The Pentagon is currently testing five of these platforms. Scale AI says its new product, <a href=\"https://scale.com/donovan\"><u>Donovan</u></a>, is one of them.</p><p><strong>What are the military applications of LLMs? </strong>The Pentagon is testing the LLM platforms for their ability to analyze and present data in natural language. Military decision-makers could make information requests directly through LLM platforms with access to confidential data. Currently, the military relies on much slower processes. Bloomberg reports that one platform took 10 minutes to complete an information request that would have otherwise taken several days.</p><p>The Pentagon is also testing the platforms for their ability to propose its own courses of action. Bloomberg was allowed to ask Donovan about a US response to a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. It responded: \u201cDirect US intervention with ground, air and naval forces would probably be necessary.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F293751e3-6de4-4a4c-9cb7-b18c5dd88e82_1600x764.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F293751e3-6de4-4a4c-9cb7-b18c5dd88e82_1600x764.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F293751e3-6de4-4a4c-9cb7-b18c5dd88e82_1600x764.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F293751e3-6de4-4a4c-9cb7-b18c5dd88e82_1600x764.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F293751e3-6de4-4a4c-9cb7-b18c5dd88e82_1600x764.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F293751e3-6de4-4a4c-9cb7-b18c5dd88e82_1600x764.png 1456w\"></a><i>Scale AI advertises Donovan\u2019s ability to generate novel courses of action</i>.</p><p><strong>The use of LLMs follows recent developments in AI-powered drones</strong>.

For shrimp, this metric was computed by multiplying welfare range (fraction of humans\u2019), hours of suffering during slaughter, pain intensity weight (relative to disabling pain) during slaughter, probability of electric stunning eliminating pain, and shrimp stunned per dollar. For chickens, this metric was computed by multiplying welfare range (fraction of humans\u2019) and hours of disabling-equivalent pain averted per dollar spent on corporate campaigns. The sources for each of these components are discussed in the following paragraphs, and all code is available on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/matthewromer/ShrimpStunners\"><u>GitHub</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>To weight pain in each species by shrimp and chickens\u2019 likely differing capacities for welfare, I used the welfare range distributions for chickens and shrimp from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Qk3hd6PrFManj8K6o/rethink-priorities-welfare-range-estimates\"><u>Rethink Priorities Moral Weight Project</u></a> (MWP). The MWP makes several significant <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hxtwzcsz8hQfGyZQM/an-introduction-to-the-moral-weight-project\"><u>assumptions</u></a> in arriving at its results, including utilitarianism, hedonism, valence symmetry, and unitarianism. Its results for chicken and shrimp are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1. An important characteristic of these results is that there is an extreme tail in shrimp\u2019s moral weight distribution, potentially leading to them having up to 10x the capacity for welfare as a human. This tail is driven by MWP\u2019s inclusion of the \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Qk3hd6PrFManj8K6o/rethink-priorities-welfare-range-estimates?commentId=S8wg3uvXYKCZ35y2d\"><u>undiluted experiences</u></a>\u201d model of welfare as one element of the mixture model. In the undiluted experiences model, pain is made worse by an animal\u2019s lack of cognitive capacity to contextualize their experiences, thus tending to produce moral weights that have an inverse correlation with neurological complexity.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Table 1.

Welfare Capacity Ranges of Chicken and Shrimp - Log Scale (from Rethink Priorities Moral Weight Project)</strong></figcaption></figure><p>To categorize the different types of pain experienced by a given animal, I used the pain standards established by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/analytical-approach/\"><u>Welfare Footprint Project</u></a> (WFP). My medium-confidence guess is that when suffocating or freezing, shrimp are mostly experiencing discomfort that would meet WFP\u2019s \u201cdisabling pain\u201d <a href=\"https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/analytical-approach/\">standard</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Disabling Pain: Pain at this level takes priority over most bids for behavioral execution and prevents all forms of enjoyment or positive welfare. Pain is continuously distressing. Individuals affected by harms in this category often change their activity levels drastically (the degree of disruption in the ability of an organism to function optimally should not be confused with the overt expression of pain behaviors, which is less likely in prey species). Inattention and unresponsiveness to milder forms of pain or other ongoing stimuli and surroundings is likely to be observed. Relief often requires higher drug dosages or more powerful drugs. The term Disabling refers to the disability caused by \u2018pain\u2019, not to any structural disability.</p></blockquote><p>I think it is likely that some dying shrimp meet WFP\u2019s \u201cexcruciating pain\u201d standard, particularly those that are crushed under other shrimp or under ice. However, this level is so extreme that I expect it does not make up the bulk of suffering experienced during slaughter. It is also possible that a fraction of shrimp are successfully rendered unconscious quickly under current methods by coming into contact with ice, reducing the average level of pain to WFP\u2019s \u201churtful pain\u201d level. To weight pain at these different levels, I followed the same approach as the recent Rethink Priorities report \u201c<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p7xqop2FlIF8Kw45za0NnJPwvUA70Mb1UzjijMRKRr8/edit#heading=h.eml8g2x67lkh\"><u>Cost-Effectiveness of Historical Farmed Animal Welfare Ballot Initiatives</u></a>,\u201d authored by Laura Duffy, which weights an hour of hurtful pain as equivalent to 0.15 hours of disabling pain and an hour of excruciating pain as equivalent to 5 hours of disabling pain. Because I think the average pain level is most likely slightly above the \u201cdisabling\u2019 level, with significant uncertainty, I estimated the average pain intensity weight for shrimp during slaughter as a gamma distribution with \u0251 = 1.5 and \u03b2&nbsp; = 1 (clipped at a range of 0.15 to 5). This distribution gives an average pain intensity weight of 1.5x the disabling pain level, and is shown in Figure 2.<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CmAexqqvnRLcBojpB/iecfbdaxio64x4eazxkm\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CmAexqqvnRLcBojpB/ju3qt4kzqfpshl1nfsqb 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CmAexqqvnRLcBojpB/tjvw7bjhom7t5iotnajp 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CmAexqqvnRLcBojpB/qy0hag28euxjq4xgkuw8 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CmAexqqvnRLcBojpB/lfmwt6hwhczj0ukxsu1b 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CmAexqqvnRLcBojpB/tzckqiednrvtjnomrbup 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CmAexqqvnRLcBojpB/n2cnrv4n7ezf4vtbgoxs 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CmAexqqvnRLcBojpB/erv8rgfisbov02ou9aup 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CmAexqqvnRLcBojpB/fjrxrqw3ju9o5rfxapg4 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CmAexqqvnRLcBojpB/lcxli4lqietecfldljlg 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CmAexqqvnRLcBojpB/hwrjpygqw7k2vdruwb12 1600w\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 2.

Duration of Suffering During Shrimp Slaughter (Best Guess)</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Ideally, stunning would remove 100% of the pain associated with slaughter. However, as indicated in SWP\u2019s summary, there is some disagreement among experts as to the effectiveness of electric stunning in rendering shrimp unconscious. My educated guess, based on the conflicting scientific evidence and the LSE report\u2019s \u201cmedium confidence\u201d estimate of electric stunning\u2019s effectiveness, is that electric stunning has about a 2 in 3 chance of rendering shrimp unconscious, for a probability of 0.667.</p><p>The number of shrimp stunned per dollar was estimated based on SWP\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z0M_ytkYwzvwXxHaBalJ6PaiBALBFPtXma-TwDUaYUE/edit#gid=0\"><u>back-of-the-envelope calculation</u></a>\u201d included in the Manifund description. This information is provided in Table 2. I translated SWP\u2019s calculations into a probability distribution by assuming that the number of shrimp helped per dollar was normally distributed with mean equal to SWP\u2019s estimate (14796) and standard deviation equal to the average difference between the number of shrimp helped per dollar at each producer and the total average (7708). The lower end of this range might represent SWP encountering unexpected challenges that prevent the stunners being fully successfully utilized, while the upper end of this range might represent the stunners being successfully used (and having counterfactual impact) for more than the three years baselined in SWP\u2019s analysis.

Number of Welfare-Range-Weighted Hours of Disabling-Equivalent Pain Averted per Dollar Spent on Shrimp Stunners and Corporate Hen Welfare Campaigns (Welfare Range of Shrimp Capped at 0.1x Human) - Log Scale</strong></figcaption></figure><h1>Discussion</h1><p>A theme throughout this analysis is the high degree of uncertainty in estimating the cost-effectiveness of humane shrimp slaughter. Many key parameters are based on subjective guesses, and there is a large amount that remains unknown. There are reasons to think that the cost-effectiveness estimates provided here for both SWP and corporate hen welfare campaigns could be higher than the true values; some values in the SWP analysis are based on data provided by the organization itself and the data on corporate campaign effectiveness is backward-looking. And one could reasonably argue against certain assumptions underlying the RP Moral Weights Project\u2019s results, or against the implicit assumption within this analysis that harms across many neurologically simpler shrimp can, in aggregate, outweigh harms to fewer, more neurologically complex chickens.&nbsp;</p><p>With all that said, I do think this analysis provides some useful information. It indicates that:</p><ol><li>The expected cost-effectiveness distribution for electric shrimp stunning likely has overlap with that of corporate hen welfare campaigns</li><li>The cost-effectiveness of electric shrimp stunning is more likely to be lower than that of corporate hen welfare campaigns than it is to be higher</li><li>Shrimp stunning is a very heavy-tailed intervention. The mean cost-effectiveness of stunning is significantly influenced by a few extreme cases, which mostly represent instances in which the undiluted experience model of welfare turns out to be correct</li></ol><p>Based on this information, it seems reasonable to conclude that this project should not be dismissed out of hand. While these results are suggestive that shrimp stunning is a less cost-effective intervention than corporate hen welfare campaigns, they cannot clearly establish which is better \u2014an important result given that corporate campaigns are the \u201cgold standard\u201d EA animal welfare intervention.&nbsp;</p><p>In light of item three, one might reasonably argue that this intervention constitutes something of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/pascal-s-mugging\"><u>Pascal\u2019s mugging</u></a>, in that a large share of the impact is driven by a small number of relatively unlikely extreme cases. Most but not all the impact is driven by these cases\u2014capping shrimp\u2019s welfare range at 0.1x that of a human drops the mean cost effectiveness by about a factor of 5. This is still much greater than the 5th-percentile estimate of corporate hen welfare campaigns\u2019 cost-effectiveness, but is low enough as to appear relatively uncompetitive with corporate campaigns in expectation. Potential donors should think carefully about their risk tolerance, credence in the undiluted experience model of welfare, and willingness to make hits-based bets when considering this initiative.&nbsp;</p><p>One last item to mention is the future potential of shrimp stunning. While this CEA has focused on the more quantifiable short-term impacts of SWP\u2019s proposed intervention, it is possible that piloting stunners today could substantially improve the likelihood of long-run mass adoption. To me, this seems like one of the strongest arguments in favor of this project. Corporate hen welfare campaigns may not remain cost-effective forever (as fewer hens remain in conventional systems), and aquaculture is a rapidly growing industry worldwide. I think it makes sense to include some more speculative bets in the EA animal welfare portfolio, and shrimp stunning appears to be a possibly cost-competitive bet to make. In tandem with continued investment in fundamental welfare biology research, moderate-scale investments in shrimp stunning could enable learning by doing as part of the long-run development of effective interventions to improve conditions in aquaculture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>Thank you to Aaron Bergman for providing comments on a draft version of this post.&nbsp;</i></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnc8lytmif3wb\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefc8lytmif3wb\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;This calculation is based on the pain data for caged and cage-free systems from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/laying-hens/\"><u>WFP</u></a>, using a weighting scheme to convert annoying, hurtful, and excruciating pain to equivalent times spent in disabling pain.&nbsp;</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "MHR"}}, {"_id": "iSemZYz5KyepYcksN", "title": "An expert survey on social movements and protest", "postedAt": "2023-07-12T14:08:27.856Z", "htmlBody": "<h2>Summary</h2><p>We\u2019re very excited to release some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apollosurveys.org/social-change-and-protests/\"><u>new research</u></a> that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.socialchangelab.org/\"><u>Social Change Lab</u></a> has been working on for a while.

The experts who study social movements not only believe that strategic disruption can be an effective tactic, but that it is the most important tactical factor for a social movement's success (of the factors we asked about). This, and other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.socialchangelab.org/_files/ugd/503ba4_a184ae5bbce24c228d07eda25566dc13.pdf\"><u>relevant evidence</u></a>, suggests we shouldn\u2019t necessarily take people\u2019s first reactions as the best indicator of effective protest. We include many more results on disruptive protest further down.</p><p>Experts were also asked which factors of a social movement\u2019s governance are the most important in driving success.

Of course, this isn\u2019t to say that the surveyed experts think&nbsp;<i>all&nbsp;</i>disruptive protests are effective (as we\u2019ll see further down), merely that they can be in the right circumstances and with the right tactics.</p><p>We also asked how this would change based on how much support and salience an issue has. EAs might be interested to see the response to this question for animal advocacy, an issue we think (roughly) has reasonably low awareness and public support. Experts were much more split on this, with 48% saying that in this case, disruptive protest was at least somewhat effective and 42% saying it was at least somewhat ineffective.</p><p>We don\u2019t think these answers can inform comparative claims about effectiveness e.g. that funding grassroots activism can be more effective than policy advocacy.&nbsp;<strong>However, we think the responses give </strong><i><strong>some </strong></i><strong>pushback to the&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1581624809078681602\"><strong><u>commonly-believed myth</u></strong></a><strong> that disruptive protest is often (or always) counterproductive.</strong></p><p><i><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vKLFEkbBynJEJaETL/rvatrkdclxv01zxb5ghc\"></i></p><p><i>Figure 4: Answer to Question 7 from the survey: \u201cPlease indicate how effective disruptive protest might be in the following contexts.

Personally, from the outside, AI policy seems very vaguely defined without clear proposals and obvious solutions. Here are some reasons that I, with my limited knowledge of these topics, see as reasons why unionization might benefit AI policy in the interest of AI safety.</p><p>Firstly, it seems like policymakers and the general public see AI as a very important topic, which might benefit from regulation. Stories such as <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/podcasts/the-journal/the-hidden-workforce-that-helped-filter-violence-and-abuse-out-of-chatgpt/ffc2427f-bdd8-47b7-9a4b-27e7267cf413\">this one</a> provide already provide an easy sell why unionizing the people who work on AI is a good idea - even for non-AI-safety-related reasons.</p><p>Historically, it seems to me that government regulation is often toothless and the incentives of politicians and the general public are often not aligned. Regulation often tends to be self-regulation and companies have significant power to steer public policy. Proposals such as democratizing decisions that OpenAI makes are ultimately still reliant on OpenAI playing along. Unions are about recognizing that workers have significant power to influence companies when they know how to access this power. A unionized workforce has actual, impactful leverage to influence a company\u2019s direction.</p><p>One assumption I make is that opening up to decision-making to a larger group (such as the workers) as opposed to just the C-suite, decreases the likelihood of scenarios that are often alluded to (such as \u201ccompanies don\u2019t care about safety if it negatively affects profits).</p><p>I know that especially in the US unions are a very divisive topic, but I would be interested in other people\u2019s takes on this. I do recognize that in the current political climate, this might be a complete pipe dream.</p>", "user": {"username": "Dunning K."}}, {"_id": "nsrJLe8Q9FBwtmB9H", "title": "A transcript of the TED talk by Eliezer Yudkowsky", "postedAt": "2023-07-12T12:12:34.424Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Samin"}}, {"_id": "gYxY5Mr2srBnrbuaT", "title": "Announcing the AI Fables Writing Contest!

For generations the idea of what Artificial General Intelligence could or would look like has been shaped by fiction, for better and for worse, and that will likely continue even as what once seemed to be purely speculative starts to become more and more real in our everyday lives.</p><p>But there\u2019s still time for good fiction to help shape the future, and on this particular topic, with the world changing so quickly, I want to help fill the empty spaces waiting for stories that can help people grapple with the relevant issues, and I\u2019d like to help encourage those stories to be as&nbsp;<i>good&nbsp;</i>as possible,<i>&nbsp;</i>meaning both engaging and well-informed.&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, I\u2019m calling for submissions of short stories or story outlines that involve one or more of the \u201cnuts and bolts\u201d covered in the above post, as well as some of my own tweaks:</p><ol><li>Basics of AI<ol><li>Neural networks are black boxes (though interpretability might help us to see inside).</li></ol></li><li>AI \"Psychology\"<ol><li>AI systems are alien in how they think.

Black Mirror is a good example of the \u201cmodern Aesop\u2019s Fables or Grimm Fairytales\u201d style of commentary-through-storytelling, but I\u2019m particularly interested in stories that don\u2019t moralize at readers, and rather help people understand and emotionally process issues related to AI.</p><p>Though unrelated to AI, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/yudkowsky/posts/10157928403149228\">Truer Love's Kiss </a>by Eliezer Yudkowsky and <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedmagazine.com/fiction/the-cambist-and-lord-iron-a-fairy-tale-of-economics/\">The Cambist and Lord Iron</a> by Daniel Abraham are good examples of \"modern fables\" that I'd like to see more of. The setting doesn't matter, so long as it reasonably clearly teaches something related to the unique challenges or opportunities of creating safe artificial intelligence.</p><p>At least the top 3 stories will receive at least $1500, $1000, and $500 in reward (more donations may still be received to increase the prize pool), which I\u2019m planning to distribute after judging is complete sometime in October.</p><p>In addition, some authors may also be invited to join a writing retreat in Oxford, UK to help refine their story and discuss publication options. We'd like to not just encourage more stories like these to exist, but also try and help improve and spread them.</p><p><strong>Stories must be submitted by September 1st </strong>to be considered for the retreat, and practically speaking, the sooner they\u2019re submitted the better the odds of being judged in time for it. <strong>Stories must be submitted before October 1st </strong>for monetary prize consideration.</p><p>This contest is meant to be relatively short in duration, as our preference is for relatively short stories of ~6,000 words or less. Longer stories can be submitted, but anything past the first 6k words will not be included in judgement.</p><p>As a final note, this is not an expectation for completely polished, ready-to-publish stories; things like spelling and grammar mistakes will not be penalized! What we want are the ideas to be conveyed well and in an engaging way. Proper editing, both of style and content, can be done later. Just show us the seed of a good story, and maybe we can help it grow!</p><p>To submit your fable, please link to a Google Doc in a reply to this post. If you wish to remain anonymous or retain First Publisher rights for your own attempts at finding a traditional publisher, you can send it to me in a DM.</p><p>You can also link to stories you believe fit the criteria in order to nominate someone else; if that\u2019s the case, please indicate that the story is not your own.</p><p>Happy writing, and feel free to ask any clarifying questions either by reply or DMs!</p>", "user": {"username": "Daystar Eld"}}, {"_id": "vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9", "title": "EA EDA: What do Forum Topics tell us about changes in EA?", "postedAt": "2023-07-14T19:54:26.678Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>tl;dr</strong><span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"^2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char\"></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%;

While this analysis is by no means definitive, it doesn't support the simple narrative that there was a golden age of EA that has abandoned for a much worse one. There has been a rise in AI Safety posts, but that has also been fairly recent (within the last ~2 years)</i></p><h2>1. Introduction</h2><p>I really liked Ben West's recent post about '<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XTBGAWAXR25atu39P/third-wave-effective-altruism\">Third Wave Effective Altruism</a>', especially for its historical reflection on what First and Second Wave EA looked like. This characterisation of EA's history seemed to strike a chord with many Forum users,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefje38vi4cetr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnje38vi4cetr\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and has been reflected in recent critical coverage of EA that claims the movement has abandoned its well-intentioned roots (e.g. donations for bed nets) and decided to focus fully on bizarre risks to save a distant, hypothetical future.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpwb828y1xs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpwb828y1xs\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>I've always been a bit sceptical with how common this sort of framing seems to be, especially since the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZbaDmowkXbTBsxvHn/historical-ea-funding-data\">best evidence</a> we have from funding for the overall EA picture shows that most funding is still going to Global Health areas. As something of a (data) scientist myself, I thought I'd turn to one of the primary sources of information for what EAs think to shed some more light on this problem - the Forum itself!</p><p>This post is a write-up of the initial data collection and analysis that followed. It's not meant to be the definitive word on either how EA, or use of the EA Forum, has changed over time. Instead, I hope it will challenge some assumptions and intuitions, prompt some interesting discussion, and hopefully leads to future posts in a similar direction either from myself or others.</p><h2>2. Methodology</h2><p>(Feel free to skip this section if you're not interested in all the caveats)</p><p>You may not be aware, the Forum has an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/graphiql\">API</a>! While I couldn't find clear documentation on how to use it or a fully defined schema, people have used it in the past for interesting projects and some have very kindly shared their results &amp; methods. I found these following three especially useful (the first two have linked GitHubs with their code):</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://filyp.github.io/tree-of-tags/\">The Tree of Tags</a> by Filip Sondej</li><li><a href=\"https://effectivealtruismdata.com/\">Effective Altruism Data</a> from Hamish</li><li>This <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LJiGhpq8w4Badr5KJ/graphql-tutorial-for-lesswrong-and-effective-altruism-forum\">LessWrong tutorial</a> from Issa Rice</li></ul><p>With these examples to help me, I created my own code to get every post made on the EA Forum to date (without those who have deleted their post).</p><p>There are various caveats to make about the data representation and data quality. These include:</p><ul><li>I extracted the data on July 7th - so any totals (e.g. number of posts, post score etc) or other details are only correct as of that date.</li><li>I could only extract the <strong>postedAt </strong>date - which isn't always when the post in question was actually posted. A case in point, I'm pretty sure <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/r4Lkz4tK7CmPoXQfK/peter-singer-famine-affluence-and-morality\">this post</a> wasn't actually posted in 1972. However, it's the best data I could find, so hopefully for the vast majority of posts the display date <i>is </i>the posted date.</li><li>In looking for a starting point for the data, there was a discontinuity between August to September 2014, but the data was a lot more continuous after then.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj2j7escfc4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj2j7escfc4\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I analyse the data in terms of monthly totals, so I threw out the one-week of data I had for July. The final dataset is therefore 106 months from September 2014 to June 2023 (inclusive).</li><li>There are around ~950 distinct tags/topics in my data, which are far too many to plot concisely and share useful information. I've decided to take the top 50 topics in terms of times used, which collectively account for 56% of all Forum tags and 92% of posts in the above time period.</li><li>I only extracted the first listed Author of a post - however, only 1 graph shared below relies on a user-level aggregation, so the results at large shouldn't be adversely affected.</li><li>A potential confounding issue in general is that Forum use has increased over time. Not only is the Forum a lot more active now than in earlier years, but the average number of topics has risen over time too (from 1.6 in Sep '14 to 3.9 in June '23). I have more to say about this in the 'interpretation' section.</li></ul><p>Those are the main qualifications that the data analysis has, but if there are some graph-specific issues/clarifications I'll point them out in the section below. Finally, this currently exists as a (messy) private repository, which I may share if I can clean it up enough. If, in the meantime, you'd like to see the code, discuss it, or want to replicate my data, please DM me and I'll be happy to discuss.</p><h2>3. Results</h2><p><strong>How has EA Forum use changed over time?</strong></p><p>This graph shows the trends of various post-level engagement metrics over time, summed by month. To show them on the same chart, I normalised them so that their largest monthly value is 1.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/nlznsgecm53klzw4wxzs\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/tahytgfimoywiuguhymk 87w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/voajpxuxwisoop6p9y6p 167w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/pyphqcrlzejz5sp9e1di 247w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/aqsabc13ucnpgsnwhij9 327w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/w6c2c0ghmarsfcmoavmp 407w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/hryri3svsa2ams2eiu52 487w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/oztah7vzke2js2k7louj 567w\"></figure><p>They all share a very similar trend: a stable level until the end of 2018, where there is then steady and then rapid growth, peaking in late 2022 before falling back a bit in the first half of 2023. For completeness, wordcount and total number of posts peak in August 2022 (when <i>What We Owe the Future </i>was published), whereas total votes, post score, and number of comments all peak in November 2022 (the FTX crash). The main underlying trend for EA Forum activity seems to be driven by the size and activity of the overall EA movement.</p><p><strong>Is the pool of Forum posters stagnating?</strong></p><p>This is the total of unique posters per month, as well as the number of users making their first post each month:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/fmt2bznggu4bi8yfmw2m\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/i0zci8uncgmx8dlocd2d 91w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/e5owhkmff8zgzdkw8csw 171w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/cqeyl2yh0gtzasqlaaxf 251w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/uqsqgusr1pn4sca7ejfp 331w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/ixbnh00vs2vdtqyqog43 411w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/nbvnxx5zzo8jk7oybyqx 491w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/phmpjxxvqef0txlz294l 571w\"></figure><p>Both trends share a very similar trend to the first chart. The ratio of new-to-total posters has largely stayed in the low-to-mid 30% range for the last few years too. This doesn't answer whether the <i>share </i>of posts is different between the two groups (I expect it would be more unequal), but new Forum users remain and steady supply of those contributing to the Forum. But it gives some evidence that the Forum isn't just the same posters having the same old conversations with each other.</p><p><strong>Share of Posts by Topic</strong></p><p>This plot shows the monthly % of posts which had were tagged with one of the Forums 10 most-common topics,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8rx52klx1ln\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8rx52klx1ln\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;with the trends smoothed over a 6-month window.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/kkz3om1uonszpzdsmrwp\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/lojyqd3xht9zcazmyspe 106w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/cbhprpbgtyyzslsjedau 186w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/ubdyawntan8kawfbq9cm 266w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/wlz87tbswiatuiwpmwa2 346w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/nn5ze3ly28orytj05iom 426w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/joaruyidegwmrnuptmw4 506w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/rwcqij7uhkdjxklaesur 586w\"></figure><p>Remember, these are the 10 most common topics, and there are very few cases of a single topic rising above the rest of the pack. 'Building Effective Altruism' has consistently been among the most common, 'Community' posts rose to prominence with the move to the new Forum. The clearest recent trend is the rise of AI Safety, which is at Forum historical heights for a single topic at the moment. Interestingly, the current trend in posts seems to begin around to inflect around Autumn 2021. Was there any particular AI-related event that triggered this?</p><p><strong>Cumulative Post Histories</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/erdr6yjo2s5nqpvctpsi\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/pkw0vt3t1sa7vnbcn2jr 106w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/g7tqldrptkpyagmnm1dy 186w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/zpgu7hnoyed31cky4qkr 266w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/pnmujlp7vec6uabpw8vm 346w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/epusrisxl5xztsn85e7m 426w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/yzmnfxj5ubcaylqunk3y 506w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/k6xti3vclq9egeoxpt6o 586w\"></figure><p>This plot shows the cumulative % of posts with a topic that been posted on the Forum by a given time. On its own it isn't very enlightening, as most posts have a very similar history and more reflect average use of the Forum than topic specific activity. One amusing intuition-buster is that 50% of posts with the <i>Longtermism </i>tag were made before 50% of posts with the <i>Global Health &amp; Development </i>tag. This, I think, tells strongly against the simple EA Wave 1 -&gt; EA Wave 2 story.</p><p><strong>Top-50 Topic Heatmap</strong></p><p>This chart needs a bit of explaining, so bear with the explanation below.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/scu36gbjnnsa9ifyx2tw\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/siwh8haeicervc7ew4ou 140w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/o6epiug7elp28t2q2sbt 280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/c9lwagsxidtiu1tvjsej 420w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/mkb8ldoaf8ot1nwxgz56 560w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/lndabrmxex50p7jraigh 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/dbuj3ysq8cekxymemv6c 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/fio3vf1frxopfs3avowm 980w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/nwzsbtmdrr77rdlxzouo 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/poi9lqktoslpm1vyqiao 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vjX2qAiD7JZLmGCs9/xm4knfp1vhjywhnxur8o 1328w\"></figure><p>On the x-axis are all the top-50 EA Forum topics. They are ordered from most recent topic to hit 50% of its cumulative number of posts (AI Safety) to earliest (No topics).&nbsp;</p><p>There are 106 steps on the y-axis, each corresponding to a single month in the dataset. The scale is from 0 to 1, where white represents 0 and EA Forum blue<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefujfav9nj7ij\"><sup><a href=\"#fnujfav9nj7ij\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;represents 1. The raw data is the same as that for the \"Actual Post Histories\" graph, but I normalised the values for each topic so that their largest monthly value is 1.</p><p>I know, it's a lot! My hope is that it would serve to both answer 'which topics were most popularity at time x' and 'how has topic popularity changed over time' more clearly than a time-series chart with 50 lines.</p><h2>4. Conclusions and Interpretations</h2><p>To me, this data doesn't provide strong evidence for the narrative that bed net-focused EA gave way to longterm-centric EA. While this narrative has been around since <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9124145/effective-altruism-global-ai\">at least 2015</a> (if not before), the share of Forum posts that have been tagged Global Health &amp; Development has slowly increased over time.</p><p>There is clearly a rise in AI-related posts and topics. Yet that rise, as noted before, really gets going around mid-to-late 2021 onwards, instead of dominating EA space for years before. I don't think many would believe that EA 2.0 has only been a thing for 2 years. The breakout nature of this trend <i>probably </i>has a lot to do with real world events (ChatGPT, GPT-4, FLI Letter, Altman in congress etc.) leading to people viewing the issue as more salient than internal EA dynamics, though I suppose it is also consistent with there being an information cascade propelling AI Safety to being the 'top' EA topic.&nbsp;</p><p>The interpretation that makes the most sense to may (though I hold it lightly), is that Forum discussion has grown as EA has grown. Longtermist and AI Safety concerns have been added <i>in addition to, rather than replacing </i>Global Health ones. As discussed under the first chart, the main trend of EA Forum use seems to be the fate of the EA movement itself, and the movement has added Longtermist/xRisk concerns to its portfolio <i>as a whole</i>, rather than replacing Global Health concerns (though individual people and organisations may have done so). It will be interesting to see through 2023 how far the Forum drop-off goes, and whether the trend will start to increase again.</p><p>So my hope is that this work slightly downweights the critical 'EA 1.0 Good but gone, EA 2.0 bad but dominant' narrative. At least, I'd like to see some more data to support that view. That isn't to say, of course, that there have been no changes, or the EA organisations (such as 80,000 Hours) have made a Longtermist turn. Perhaps there's a sociological phenomenon where the 'centre' of the movement has shifted further than the movement as a whole (assuming that Forum use is more representative of the broader EA movement)</p><p>Other small trends:</p><ul><li>Animal Welfare (both farmed and wild), seemed to peak around 2020, but has fallen in prominence slightly since then. There is a lot of good work in this space recently, so hopefully this trend can change.&nbsp;</li><li>From a personal perspective, IIDM seemed to have some time in the sun from late-2020 to late-2021, perhaps driven by discussion of the worldwide reaction to COVID-19?</li><li>'AI risk' had its big moment in mid-2022, but then got replaced by 'AI Safety'.

Further Analysis</h2><p>As I've stated multiple times, this is only high-level analysis, and is meant to be the start of a discussion about what EA Forum data can tell us, and whether it is accurate or not. Some thoughts I have had about which directions to go in next for further posts in this (maybe) sequence:</p><ul><li>The scale of posts with no topics/tags in early years suggest that some more analysis into post titles/keywords/content might be needed to surface the main topics of early-EA Forum discussion.</li><li>I could do some network analysis to find links between topics, and potentially graph (or animate?) how this network has changed over time.</li><li>Look at user-focused data: are there users who contribute equally to the major topics, or are there those who focus on specific topics?</li><li>Do more thorough data cleaning. For example, I could clean the topic columns more to group similar types together (e.g. 'AI Safety' and 'AI Risk' could go together, various 'meta' topics could probably also be joined togther for example).</li><li>Expand the data collection to include comments, and perhaps look to do semantic/similarity analysis on the content of the posts/comments themselves.</li></ul><p>Thanks for reading!

Producing research typically involves many different inputs such as research staff, compute, equipment, and office space.</p><p>These inputs all require funding and therefore funding is a crucial input for enabling or accelerating AI safety research. Securing funding is usually a prerequisite for starting or continuing AI safety research in industry, in an academic setting, or independently.</p><p>There are many barriers that could prevent people from working on AI safety.

I would like there to be a large and thriving community of people working on AI safety and I think funding is an important prerequisite for enabling that.</p><p>The goal of this post is to give the reader a better understanding of funding opportunities in AI safety so that hopefully funding will be less of a barrier if they want to work on AI safety. The post starts with a high-level overview of the AI safety funding situation followed by a more in-depth description of various funding opportunities.</p><h1>Past work</h1><p>To get an overview of AI safety spending, we first need to find out how much is spent on it per year.

Its primary funder is Dustin Moskovitz who made his fortune by founding Facebook and Asana and has a net worth of over $12 billion. Open Phil funds&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2021/08/effective-altruism-allocation-resources-cause-areas/\"><u>many</u></a> different cause areas such as global health and development, farm animal welfare, Effective Altruism community growth, biosecurity, and AI safety research.</p><p>Since it was founded in 2017, Open Phil has donated about $2.8 billion of which about $336 million was spent on AI safety (~12%). The median Open Phil AI safety grant is about $257k and the average AI safety grant is $1.67 million. In 2023, Open Phil spent about $46 million on AI safety making it probably the largest funder of AI safety in the world.</p><p>Open Phil has historically made medium-sized to large grants to organizations such as Epoch AI, the Alignment Research Center, the Center for AI Safety, Redwood Research, and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI).

In 2021, GWWC members&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yp4uwxEwamc5LkDAB/gwwc-has-ambitious-plans-from-2022-onwards-we-re-hiring#2__Direct_impact_of_money_moved\"><u>donated</u></a> $22.7 million to charity.

Though in addition to GWWC donations, these funds also receive donations from larger primary funds such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/?q=&amp;organization-name=longview-philanthropy\"><u>Open Phil</u></a>.</p><h3>Nonlinear Fund</h3><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nonlinear.org/\"><u>Nonlinear Fund</u></a> is for projects related to reducing existential risk from AI. They have created a project named&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nonlinearnetwork.org/\"><u>Nonlinear Network</u></a> which allows people looking for AI safety funding to apply for multiple funds at the same time. Nonlinear Fund is also the organization behind&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.super-linear.org/\"><u>Superlinear</u></a> which offers financial prizes for AI safety challenges.</p><h3>Lightspeed Grants</h3><p><a href=\"https://lightspeedgrants.org/\"><u>Lightspeed Grants</u></a> is a longtermist grant-making organization created in 2022 that aims to distribute $5 million in its initial funding round. The primary funder of the first round is Jaan Tallinn (Jaan is also the primary funder of SFF). The grants for Lightspeed Grants are included in the Survival and Flourishing Fund total above.</p><h3>For-profit companies</h3><p>Many organizations working on AI safety are for-profit companies that use profits or investments to fund their research rather than philanthropic funding. For example, OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, and Conjecture are for-profit companies that have AI safety teams.</p><p>Conjecture was founded in 2022 and has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/conjecture\"><u>received</u></a> $25 million in venture capital funding so far. Anthropic was founded in 2021 and has so far&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/anthropic/company_financials\"><u>received</u></a> over $7 billion in venture capital funding. Google DeepMind (originally DeepMind) was founded in 2012 and is now a profitable company with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/ai/ai-lab-deepmind-becomes-profitable-and-bolsters-relationship-with-google/\"><u>revenue</u></a> of about $1 billion per year and similar expenses. OpenAI was founded in 2016 and is probably the best-funded AI startup in the world after its partner organization Microsoft agreed to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/10/microsoft-to-invest-10-billion-in-chatgpt-creator-openai-report-says.html\"><u>invest</u></a> $10 billion in it in 2023. OpenAI has <a href=\"https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openai\">received</a> over $11 billion in venture capital funding so far.</p><p>We can calculate how much funding these companies are contributing to AI safety by estimating how much it would counterfactually cost to fund their AI safety teams if they were non-profits like Redwood Research or MIRI.</p><p>Because of various expenses such as payroll taxes, health insurance, and retirement benefits, the true cost of an employee is typically about 30%&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/blog/how-much-does-employee-cost-you\"><u>higher</u></a> than the cost of an employee\u2019s gross salary. Then there are other expenses such as office space, travel, events, compute, and so on. Based on the tax returns of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/582565917/202223199349330387/full\"><u>MIRI</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/871702255/202203149349303980/full\"><u>Redwood Research</u></a>, the ratio of total expenses to wages is 1.6 and 3.3 respectively so I think a good rule of thumb is that an employee\u2019s cost to an organization is about twice their gross salary.</p><p>To calculate the total financial contribution of an organization to AI safety research, we can multiply the size of the AI safety team by the average wage of AI safety researchers in the company and the 2X multiplier.</p><p>I created a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/22756\"><u>Guesstimate</u></a> model to calculate the combined contribution of the four companies. The model is also summarized in the following table.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Company name</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Number of employees&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffjilm93blz\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfjilm93blz\">[1]</a></sup></span></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">AI safety team size (estimated)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Median gross salary (estimated)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Total cost per employee (estimated)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Total funding contribution (estimated)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">DeepMind</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">1722</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">5-20</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">$200k</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">$400k</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">$1.6-15m</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">OpenAI</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">1268</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">5-20</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">$290k</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">$600k</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">$2.9-20m</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Anthropic</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">164</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">10-40</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">$360k</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">$600k</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">$6.2-32m</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Conjecture</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">21</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">5-15</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">$150k</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">$300k</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">$1.2-5.5m</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Total</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">$32m</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>&nbsp;The Guesstimate model\u2019s estimate is $32 million per year (range: $19 - 54 million).</p><p>This figure seems intuitively plausible because both for-profit and non-profit organizations have made significant contributions to AI safety. Non-profits such as Redwood Research, MIRI, ARC, and the Center for AI Safety have made many contributions to AI safety research. But so have for-profit AI companies. For example, OpenAI invented&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/learning-from-human-preferences\"><u>RLHF</u></a>, Anthropic has made significant&nbsp;<a href=\"https://transformer-circuits.pub/2022/toy_model/index.html\"><u>contributions</u></a> to interpretability, DeepMind has done work on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/goal-misgeneralisation-why-correct-specifications-arent-enough-for-correct-goals-cf96ebc60924\"><u>goal misgeneralization</u></a>, and the popular concept of viewing language models as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.conjecture.dev/research\"><u>simulators</u></a> was invented at Conjecture. This estimate is probably conservative because I\u2019d imagine that for-profit companies such as OpenAI spend much more on compute than non-profits like Redwood Research.</p><h3>Academic research</h3><p>The academic contribution to AI safety could be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8ErtxW7FRPGMtDqJy/the-academic-contribution-to-ai-safety-seems-large\"><u>large</u></a>. There are over 200 researchers on Google Scholar that have the \u2018AI Safety\u2019 tag on their profile (though many of these people work at companies or non-profits rather than academia).</p><p>There are several academic professors and research groups working on AI safety such as:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.davidscottkrueger.com/\"><u>David Krueger</u></a> (University of Cambridge)</li><li><a href=\"https://wp.nyu.edu/arg/\"><u>Sam Bowman</u></a> (NYU)</li><li><a href=\"https://jsteinhardt.stat.berkeley.edu/\"><u>Jacob Steinhardt</u></a> (UC Berkeley)</li><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://algorithmicalignment.csail.mit.edu/\"><u>Algorithmic Alignment Group</u></a> (MIT)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~focal/\"><u>Foundations of Cooperative AI Lab</u></a> (CMU)&nbsp;</li><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://acsresearch.org/\"><u>Alignment of Complex Systems Research Group</u></a> (Charles University, Prague)</li></ul><p>Many different countries fund academic research. For the sake of brevity, I\u2019ll focus on academic funding in the US and the UK below.</p><p><strong>Academic research in the US</strong></p><p>About 40% of basic scientific research is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20201/u-s-r-d-performance-and-funding\"><u>funded</u></a> by the US federal government (which often takes the form of grants to universities) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) funds about 25% of all federally funded basic research. It has an annual budget of about $8 billion for all research and $1 billion for computer science&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/about/congress/119/highlights/cu22.jsp\"><u>research</u></a>. NSF also offers the Graduate Research Fellowship Program (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSF-GRFP\"><u>NSF-GRFP</u></a>) which provides funding for master\u2019s or doctoral study to about 2,000 US students every year (worth a total of ~$98 million). The acceptance rate of the GRFP is about 16%.</p><p>NSF has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jwe6jpubuMiuSRqff/usd20-million-in-nsf-grants-for-safety-research\"><u>announced</u></a> that it will spend $10 million on AI safety research in 2023 and 2024 (20 million in total) though $5&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/national-science-foundation-safe-learning-enabled-systems/\"><u>million</u></a> has come from Open Philanthropy.</p><p>A description of the program:</p><p><i>\u201cWhile traditional machine learning systems are evaluated pointwise with respect to a fixed test set, such static coverage provides only limited assurance when exposed to unprecedented conditions in high-stakes operating environments \u2026 Safety also requires resilience to \u201cunknown unknowns\u201d, which necessitates improved methods for monitoring \u2026 In some instances, safety may further require new methods for reverse-engineering, inspecting, and interpreting the internal logic of learned models to identify unexpected behavior that could not be found by black-box testing alone.\u201d</i></p><p>From reading the synopsis, my understanding is that it\u2019s focused on research in AI safety areas such as adversarial robustness, anomaly detection, interpretability, and maybe deceptive alignment.</p><p>According to the grant description, grant proposals may be submitted by Institutions of Higher Education (e.g. university research groups) or non-profit, non-academic organizations located in the US (e.g. Redwood Research).</p><p><strong>Academic research in the UK</strong></p><p>In the UK, around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ukri.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/UKRI-050822-FundingExplainer-HowWereFunded.pdf\"><u>half</u></a> of UK government expenditure on R&amp;D is funded by UK Research and Innovation (UKRI). Every year UKRI allocates approximately \u00a31.5 billion (~$1.9b) for research grants from its total budget of around \u00a38 billion (~$10b). UKRI is composed of nine research councils. One of them is the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council which funds research in areas such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science, and artificial intelligence and has a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_and_Physical_Sciences_Research_Council\"><u>budget</u></a> of around \u00a31 billion (~$1.3b) per year.</p><p>In 2022, UKRI announced a \u00a3117 million (~$150m)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/ukri-centres-for-doctoral-training-in-artificial-intelligence/\"><u>grant</u></a> for UK Centres for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence. The grant allows principal investigators of UK research organizations such as universities to apply for funding for fully-funded four-year PhD studentships which are typically 4 years in the UK. The grant is intended to support 10-15 CDTs and each CDT is expected to support at least 50 students so the grant should support at least 500 students.</p><p>The scope of the grant covers AI research in priority areas such as using AI to improve scientific productivity, health, the environment, agriculture, defense, creative industries, and responsible and trustworthy AI.</p><p>For the responsible and trustworthy AI section, it says,<i> \u201cThe expanding capabilities and range of applications of AI necessitate new research into responsible approaches to AI that are secure, safe, reliable and that operate in a way we understand, trust, and can investigate if they fail.\u201d</i></p><h3>The financial contribution of academia to AI safety</h3><p>This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8ErtxW7FRPGMtDqJy/the-academic-contribution-to-ai-safety-seems-large\"><u>post</u></a> uses Fermi estimates to estimate that the contribution of academia to AI safety is roughly equivalent to EA\u2019s contribution to AI safety. The argument is that academia is huge and does a lot of AI safety-adjacent research on topics such as transparency, robustness, and safe RL. Therefore, even if this work is strongly discounted because it\u2019s only tangentially related to AGI safety, the discounted contribution is still large.</p><p>It\u2019s challenging to estimate the financial contribution of academia to AI safety because the total depends a lot on what you measure. For example, the academic contribution to upskilling seems large given that universities offer degrees in subjects like math and computer science and often have large, expensive campuses and other resources that are useful for research. These factors are relevant because some of EA spending on AI safety involves spending on upskilling and infrastructure.</p><p>But I\u2019m going to be more conservative and focus only on actual AI safety research that is done by academics and not funded by EA funds such as Open Phil. For example, someone might do a PhD with a focus on AI safety that is funded by the government.</p><p>Although government organizations like NSF in the US spend a lot on research, I\u2019m pretty sure that most of the academic AI safety groups mentioned above are funded by EA funds like Open Phil (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/center-for-human-compatible-artificial-intelligence#:~:text=provably%20beneficial%20systems.%22-,Funding,%24120%2C000%20from%20Effective%20Altruism%20Funds.\"><u>CHAI</u></a>) so the financial contribution of (non-EA) academic funding to AI safety is not as large as you might think.</p><p>I made a guesstimate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/22755\"><u>model</u></a> to estimate the financial contribution of academic funding to AI safety. My lower bound estimate is $220k which includes only EA academics and my upper bound is $64m which includes the non-EA contributions to AI safety.</p><p>Based on this information, my best guest conservative estimate of the financial contribution of academia to AI safety research is about $1 million per year. Combined with the NSF grant, the total is $11 million per year for 2023.</p><h3>Manifund</h3><p>Manifund is a crowd-funding platform that often funds projects related to AI safety.</p><h3>Other individual donors</h3><ul><li>In 2015, Elon Musk&nbsp;<a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/fli-projects/elon-musk-donates-10m-to-our-research-program\"><u>donated</u></a> $10 million to the Future of Life Institute.</li><li>In 2021, Vitalik Buterin&nbsp;<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2021/05/13/two-major-donations/\"><u>donated</u></a> $4 million to MIRI.</li><li>In 2021, an anonymous crypto <a href=\"https://openbook.fyi/org/Anonymous%20MIRI%20cryptocurrency%20donor\">donor</a> donated $15.6 million to MIRI.</li><li>MIRI has received&nbsp;<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/topcontributors/\"><u>donations</u></a> from many other individuals in the past.</li></ul><h3>Summary of other sources of funding</h3><p>Summary of other sources of funding:</p><ul><li><strong>Frontier Model Forum AI safety fund: </strong>$10m.</li><li><strong>Superalignment fast grants: </strong>$10m.</li><li><strong>GWWC:&nbsp;</strong>~$1m per year.</li><li><strong>For-profit companies:</strong> ~$32m per year.</li><li><strong>Academic research:&nbsp;~</strong>$1m normally, $11m per year in 2023 because of the NSF grant.</li><li><strong>Individual donors</strong>: probably at least $1m per year.</li></ul><h1>Q&amp;A</h1><p>This section is for me to attempt to answer some informal questions on AI safety funding.</p><h2>How do I work on AI safety?</h2><p>I think there are three main ways to work on AI safety:</p><ol><li><strong>Get a job in a for-profit or non-profit organization.</strong>&nbsp;I think the most straightforward way to work on AI safety is to get a job working on AI safety in an organization. OpenAI, DeepMind, Redwood Research, FHI, and MIRI are some examples of organizations working on technical AI safety, and organizations such as Epoch AI, the Center for the Governance of AI, and the Centre for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) work on non-technical AI safety areas like AI governance. Apart from for-profit and non-profit organizations, there may also be opportunities to work on AI safety in government institutions.</li><li><strong>Independent research.&nbsp;</strong>Another path to working on AI safety is to participate in a training program like AI Safety Camp or SERI MATS. Participants do research under a mentor and may apply for grants from funds such as LTFF to continue doing independent research.</li><li><strong>Academic research.&nbsp;</strong>Another option is to get a postdoctoral degree such as a master\u2019s or PhD degree. Usually, master\u2019s degrees don\u2019t offer stipends but most PhD degrees do. Postdoctoral researchers and professors are also paid to do research by universities.</li></ol><p>If you are not interested in working directly on AI safety or if changing your career path seems too risky, another option is to earn to give. Giving What We Can makes it easy to create regular donations to funds such as the Long-Term Future Fund (LTFF).</p><h2>What are my chances of getting funded?</h2><p>LTFF funded about 19% of proposals in this 2021 funding&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nLxpFeEs6kAdgjRWz/the-long-term-future-fund-has-room-for-more-funding-right\"><u>round</u></a> and 54% in this 2021 funding&nbsp;<a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/payouts/december-2021-long-term-future-fund-grants\"><u>round</u></a> so it seems like about a quarter of proposals are funded by LTFF. Though the (now non-existent) FTX Future Fund seems to have had an acceptance&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/paMYXYFYbbjpdjgbt/future-fund-june-2022-update\"><u>rate</u></a> of just 4%.</p><h2>Is AI safety talent or funding constrained?</h2><p>This question does not have a definite answer because it depends on how you define 'talent'. The higher the talent bar is, the more talent-constrained over funding-constrained the field is, and vice-versa.</p><p>This 80,000&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-you-should-focus-more-on-talent-gaps-not-funding-gaps/\"><u>post</u></a> argues that AI safety is probably more constrained by talent than funding. The reason why is that whereas money can be raised quickly, it\u2019s not as easy to fill positions with talented researchers and training takes time. Talent in mentorship or leadership positions is probably even more scarce.</p><p>The counterargument is that there are a lot of talented people in EA and that increasing funding would provide more opportunities for training resulting in more talented people. Using that argument, a lack of talent could be caused by a lack of training opportunities which could be caused by a lack of funding.</p><p>What may seem like a funding problem could really be a talent problem: often donors will only give money if they see promising research projects and see that progress is tractable. And talent problems could really be funding problems: there may not be enough money to fund training programs (e.g. SERI MATS).</p><p>Another possibility is that AI safety is leadership-constrained. For example, the SERI MATS 2023 summer program received 460&nbsp; applicants and only about 60 were accepted (13%) so it doesn't seem like there was a lack of talent and SERI MATS costs less than $1 million so surely there was enough money for it. But there probably aren't that many people who could be SERI MATS mentors or create a program like it so my guess is that good leadership and experienced researchers are scarce. This point has been emphasized by &nbsp;Nonlinear.</p><p>Another way to answer the question is to ask whether the field would be better off with one more talented person or the salary of that person (e.g. $100,000). If there were lots of talent and not enough funding, choosing the money would be better because it would make it possible to quickly hire another talented researcher. If there were few talented researchers and lots of funding, the talented researcher would be a better choice because otherwise the money would just not be spent.</p><p>My overall view is that AI safety is to some extent constrained by all three: more funding would increase talent via more or larger training programs or higher salaries, more talent would attract more funding via credible and tractable research directions and better leadership would benefit both by creating new organizations that could soak up more talent and funding.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnfjilm93blz\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreffjilm93blz\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Source: LinkedIn.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Stephen McAleese"}}, {"_id": "vhGQHwc5pKpBiaqAn", "title": "What is the most convincing article, video, etc. making the case that AI is an X-Risk", "postedAt": "2023-07-11T20:32:48.676Z", "htmlBody": "<p>In particular, for someone who is very hard to convince and that addresses all of the objections a well-educated, rational person may have</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Jordan Arel"}}, {"_id": "8qXrou57tMGz8cWCL", "title": "Are education interventions as cost effective as the top health interventions?

Based on brief conversations with people who have explored education at EA organizations and reading GiveWell\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/education\"><u>report</u></a>&nbsp;on the topic, I believe most of the reason for this comes down to two concerns about the existing evidence that drive very steep discounts to expected income effects of most interventions. The first of these is skepticism about the potential for years of schooling to drive income gains because the quasi-experimental evidence for these effects is not very robust. The second is the lack of RCT evidence linking specific interventions in low and middle income countries (LMICs) to income gains.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I believe the first concern can be addressed by focusing on the evidence for the income gains from interventions that boost student achievement rather than the weaker evidence around interventions that increase years of schooling. The second concern can be addressed in the same way that GiveWell has addressed less-than-ideal evidence for income effects for their other interventions: looking broadly for evidence across the academic literature, and then applying a discount to the expected result based on the strength of the evidence. In this case that means including relevant studies outside of the LMIC context and those that examine country-level effects. I identify five separate lines of evidence that all find similar long-term income impacts of education interventions that boost test scores. None of these lines of evidence is strong on its own, with some suffering from weak evidence for causality, others from contexts different from those where the most cost-effective charities operate, and yet others from small sample sizes or the possibility of negative effects on non-program participants. However, by converging on similar estimates from a broader range of evidence than EA organizations have considered, the evidence becomes compelling.&nbsp;I will argue that the combined evidence for the income impacts of interventions that boost test scores is much stronger than the evidence GiveWell has used to value the income effects of fighting malaria, deworming, or making vaccines, vitamin A, and iodine more available. <strong>Even after applying very conservative discounts to expected effect sizes to account for the applicability of the evidence to potential funding opportunities, we find the best education interventions to be in the same range of cost-effectiveness as GiveWell\u2019s top charities.</strong><br><br>The argument proceeds as follows:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Executive Summary</strong>:</i></p><p>I. There are <strong>five separate lines of academic literature</strong>&nbsp;all pointing to income gains that are surprisingly clustered around the average value&nbsp;of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mB0AaJLfre0_kDOKMPaL17vs8izJI5-gZifFbeM0jb8/edit#gid=95714170\"><u>19%</u></a>&nbsp;per standard deviation (SD) increase in test scores. They come to these estimates using widely varying levels of analysis and techniques, and between them address all of the major alternative explanations.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A. The most <strong>direct evidence</strong>&nbsp;for the likely impact of charities that boost learning comes from experimental and quasi-experimental studies of improving classroom quality in the US. These studies address concerns about causality with large sample sizes and robust methodology. (12% per SD)</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B. The most <strong>relevant evidence</strong>&nbsp;comes from studies that examine programs that provided vouchers or scholarships in LMICs. These studies provide the strongest evidence for learning gains boosting incomes in contexts like those where top education charities operate. (19% per SD)</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C. Most of the <strong>RCT evidence</strong>&nbsp;for the impacts of learning gains comes from studies that examine the impacts of preschool programs in the US. These studies have the longest follow-up times, and provide the best evidence for charities that operate in early childhood. (16% per SD)</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D. The <strong>broadest</strong> <strong>international evidence</strong>&nbsp;comes from cross sectional regressions that look at the impact of test scores on adult incomes after controlling for confounding variables. These studies find very statistically significant results across a broad range of test types and contexts. (22% per SD)</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;E. The <strong>best evidence</strong> <strong>that income gains are truly additive</strong>, rather than coming at the expense of others, comes from cross-country regressions estimating the impact of changes in national test scores on GDP growth. (28% per SD)</p><p>II. We &nbsp;average across two different approaches of evaluating the strength of the existing evidence&nbsp;to come to a <strong>conservative&nbsp;replicability adjustment of </strong><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d5LkonZgWxV7_MVaHL58bqdTF2i57DpCRyUUuiQ73cU/edit#gid=742384018\"><strong><u>0.17</u></strong></a>. We multiply the expected impact in section I by this adjustment to account for the fact that we are not sure that the evidence will generalize to our target interventions.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A. The first approach applies GiveWell\u2019s model for discounting income gains from health interventions. We conservatively base our analysis on a comparison to the deworming adjustment, even though we believe that a comparison to other interventions would double the replicability adjustment.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B. The second approach designs a new weighted factor model to directly compare the evidence for education to the evidence for deworming.</p><p>III. We argue that we should apply further charity-level adjustments&nbsp;based on the quality of the evidence that the charity increases test scores. These include adjustments for the sample size of the studies supporting a particular program, and what kinds of achievement tests were used to measure outcomes.</p><p>IV. We discuss additional considerations&nbsp;in our analysis, including the evidence for the persistence of income gains across adulthood and how to deal with the fade-out of test-score gains over time.</p><p>V. We consider the possible causal mechanisms&nbsp;that may drive the impact of education interventions on adult incomes. We conclude that increases in cognitive ability are the most likely mechanism, and that even if this is the only mechanism that is likely to generalize to our recommended education charities it would still imply a replicability adjustment that is higher than our recommendation in section II. Other potential mechanisms include impacts on executive function, behavioral issues and social and emotional skills.</p><p>VI. We estimate that applying these recommendations to an intervention such as Imagine Worldwide adaptive digital exercises in Malawi, which boosts test scores by roughly 0.2 standard deviations for $15 per year, would produce&nbsp;an estimate of <strong>11x as cost effective as GiveDirectly</strong>&nbsp;at improving wellbeing through higher income.</p><p>VII. We discuss the combined evidence and how it addresses common objections to expecting income benefits from education interventions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>I. Impact of boosting test scores on earnings in adulthood</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We will examine five lines of research suggesting that interventions that increase test scores also increase income. All of the individual papers we identified found impacts between 5% and 50% of gains&nbsp;in income in adulthood per SD of learning gains. <strong>Each of the five lines of research come to an average effect size of 12%-28%</strong>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmuflgg5k6i9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmuflgg5k6i9\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Overall, we find the average effect across the five lines of research to be <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mB0AaJLfre0_kDOKMPaL17vs8izJI5-gZifFbeM0jb8/edit#gid=95714170&amp;range=F37\"><u>19%</u></a>, and find it fairly insensitive&nbsp;to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mB0AaJLfre0_kDOKMPaL17vs8izJI5-gZifFbeM0jb8/edit#gid=95714170&amp;range=F39\"><u>excluding the least reliable</u></a>&nbsp;studies and lines of research from the average, or <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mB0AaJLfre0_kDOKMPaL17vs8izJI5-gZifFbeM0jb8/edit#gid=95714170&amp;range=F40\"><u>weighting</u></a>&nbsp;the lines of evidence by a subjective judgment of relevance. Additionally, we do not believe publication bias is likely to be a large problem for most of these studies because long-term income data is difficult to collect, and a researcher is unlikely to invest the time and money to do so and then be unable to or choose not to publish the results.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefb3fmudcnrri\"><sup><a href=\"#fnb3fmudcnrri\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, there are many other reasons to not be confident that these estimates will apply to our education interventions, creating the need for the replicability adjustment discussed in section II.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8qXrou57tMGz8cWCL/kgeocinkrix6ibx3el13\" alt=\"\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are not attempting to establish the long-term impact of test scores themselves, but rather the impact of interventions that boost scores. Therefore we will never be confident that a new intervention that boosts scores will also boost income. This accounts for most of the need for the replicability adjustment discussed below. However, every intervention that we have identified that boosts test scores and has income data, also appears to boost income. Conversely, every intervention that boosts income and has test score data, also boosts test scores. We believe the consistent effect sizes across a broad range of studies and approaches provide good evidence that test score impacts of interventions can be used to predict income gains. Another way to say this is that we establish not a simple correlation between scores and income, but rather a consistent correlation between score increases caused by education interventions and income increases caused by those same interventions decades later. We don\u2019t know what it is about education that raises income and test scores \u2014 it could be improving cognition, improving executive function, or doing something even less well understood like altering problematic behaviors or social and emotional skills. But <strong>we have a good reason to suspect that when we see test scores go up after an education intervention, income will also be going up</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A related concern is that some of the interventions we examine boost years of schooling in addition to test scores. However, we believe that the evidence for years of schooling predicting income effects is not nearly as strong as that for test scores. There are a number of quasi-experimental studies that do not find increases in income following increases in years in schooling.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0x66o5qdy0m\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0x66o5qdy0m\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Additionally, some of the best evidence we have, such as the classroom studies in section A below, does not provide any information on years of schooling. While other evidence, such as the GDP regressions in section E, does not seem to hold up for years of schooling. Therefore we focus on using test scores as our predictor of income effects rather than years of schooling. Additionally, the most cost-effective interventions we have come across focus on increasing learning gains, making the evidence around years of schooling less relevant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The three more convincing lines of research we examine below consist of experimental and quasi-experimental studies. The most relevant of these are a set of studies examining the impact of improving classrooms in the United States; a second set considers programs that made it easier for children to go to good schools in LMICs; and the third follows children after they participate in preschool programs in the United States. Another two lines of research offer supporting evidence based on cross-sectional regressions. The first of these performs regressions of individual income against cognitive abilities while trying to adjust for confounding variables. The second regresses changes in country-level GDP growth on changes in children\u2019s test scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A. Experimental and quasi-experimental studies on improving classrooms in the US</strong></h3><p>Most of the education interventions Founders Pledge evaluates seek to increase the amount of learning going on in a classroom through methods such as more targeted instruction (Teach at the Right Level), or better lesson planning (structured pedagogy). <strong>The most direct evidence for the impact of such programs on adult income comes from US studies that examine the impacts of marginally better quality classrooms and more school spending.</strong>&nbsp;While the US context is not as relevant to LMICs as the setting of most of the studies discussed below, it does have the benefit of reassuring us that education interventions that boost test scores will continue to have similar sized income effects even as LMICs have dramatically expanded education over recent decades. The average increase in income across this line of evidence is 12% per SD increase in test scores. The first two studies were both published by Raj Chetty and coauthors in 2011. They were made possible by access to millions of tax records, allowing the tracking of children involved in natural experiments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w17699/w17699.pdf\"><u>first</u></a>&nbsp;of these used an event study design, measuring the <strong>impact of a new teacher starting to&nbsp;teach a class in a new grade or school</strong>&nbsp;on the test scores and eventual income of students. The study followed 2.5 million children in a large urban school district in grades 3-8. Chetty et al. measure the value added (VA) of these teachers before they start teaching a new grade, estimating which teachers boosted student standardized test scores the most. They then use that VA measure to estimate the impact of better instruction on all students in the grade that the teacher has started teaching. Previous VA studies were subject to the <a href=\"https://econpapers.repec.org/article/tpredfpol/v_3a4_3ay_3a2009_3ai_3a4_3ap_3a537-571.htm\"><u>criticism</u></a>&nbsp;that \u201chigh VA\u201d teachers selected the most promising students every year to join their class. That could potentially explain consistent large increases in student test scores without reflecting the teacher\u2019s ability. By looking at impacts on a whole grade of students Chetty et al. eliminate the possibility of selection effects, and generate convincing evidence that better teachers are able to consistently boost student learning.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefy98dsqn4zs\"><sup><a href=\"#fny98dsqn4zs\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Since teachers can only select who enters their class, not a whole school grade, there is little room for selection effects to bias the results. Chetty et al. estimate that a teacher that is one standard deviation (SD) higher in VA is able to boost student scores at the end of the year by 0.1 SD, and eventual income by 1.2%. This suggests that interventions that boost student learning may increase income by 12% per one SD increase in test scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/assets/documents/star_paper.pdf\"><u>second</u></a>&nbsp;Chetty et al. paper analyzes Project STAR, where <strong>kindergarten students in Tennessee were randomly assigned to classrooms</strong>. Since the assignment is random, Chetty et al. are able to estimate the impact of being assigned to a higher quality class on a student\u2019s test scores and income. They estimate class quality by looking at the test scores of all the other students in a class at the end of kindergarten. A class that is one SD higher in quality improves a student\u2019s test scores by .32SD and income at age 27 by 3%. These class quality effects may include having peers that are better matched in ability (like Teach at the Right Level), better instruction (like structured pedagogy), or any of a number of other unobserved factors. Chetty et al. confirm these results on a smaller sample of older children, and by running the same analysis using an instrumental variable approach with class quality impacting scores as the first stage. This implies an impact of 9% of income per one SD increase in test scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w20847/w20847.pdf\"><u>Jackson et al 2015.</u></a>&nbsp;examines the impact of <strong>court-mandated spending reforms in the US</strong>&nbsp;in the 1970s and 1980s. They use event study and instrumental variable designs to estimate that the impact of 10% higher school spending for all twelve years of a student\u2019s education is 7% higher income.&nbsp;Since the reforms affected younger children who were just starting to go to school much more than older children, Jackson et al. were able to get an unbiased estimate by comparing those two groups in each district.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa1uza4i02f7\"><sup><a href=\"#fna1uza4i02f7\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Unfortunately, the authors were not able to link these results to individual student test scores as in the two papers above. Therefore, to get impacts of school spending reforms on student scores we turn to a review of the literature on instrumental variable studies addressing the question. <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25368/w25368.pdf\"><u>Jackson et al 2018</u></a>&nbsp;find effects around 0.49 SD<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefiiivbjd9mv\"><sup><a href=\"#fniiivbjd9mv\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;increase in test scores per 10% higher spending for 12 years. Much like in the two Chetty papers above, increased spending could lead to better test scores by improving instruction or otherwise boosting class quality. If we combine the findings, we get an estimated impact of 14% higher income per SD increase in test scores. However, this estimate is less reliable than the preceding two because it combines results from separate studies using different designs and looking at different time periods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B. Experimental and quasi-experimental studies on access to good schools in LMICs</strong></h3><p>The second most compelling line of evidence examines the impacts of voucher programs and scholarships that gave students in LMICs access to good schools. These programs often allowed students who would not otherwise have gone to school to attend, making them less similar than the preceding set of studies to the charities we generally examine. Additionally, two of these studies appear underpowered to detect expected effect sizes, and therefore we rely on central estimates even though they are not significant at the 5% level. However, <strong>this line of evidence is more relevant in that it is carried out in LMICs</strong>. The average increase in income across this line of evidence is 19% per SD increase in test scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The best evidence comes from <strong>a lottery carried out in Colombia&nbsp;</strong>which provided vouchers to disadvantaged children to go to private schools. <a href=\"https://cmepr.gmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kugler_vouchers_1087.pdf\"><u>Bettinger et al.</u></a>&nbsp;find that those who won the lottery earned 8% more at age 30, but only statistically significant at a 7% level. A separate study <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w8343/w8343.pdf\"><u>estimated</u></a>&nbsp;that three years after winning the lottery, students had 0.2 SD higher test scores. A direct calculation would imply a 40% increase in income per SD higher test scores. However, as we will discuss in section IV.B, score increases fade out over time. Therefore, we estimate that the original impact on test scores was 0.3 SD, but it declined to 0.2 SD over the years before results were collected. This implies an impact of 30%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A second set of studies uses<strong>&nbsp;instrumental variable techniques to examine a nationwide school reform in Chile</strong>&nbsp;that made vouchers for private school available to all students. <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/6721/wps4617.pdf?sequence%3D1%26isAllowed%3Dy\"><u>Patrinos et al</u></a>&nbsp;find that children in primary schools gained 10% in earnings, while older children did not benefit. We conservatively average the 10% and 0% effects, rather than using the pooled result. David Roodman of Open Philanthropy points out that Patrinos et al. include a literacy control in their estimate of earnings impact in order to try to isolate the impact of only school quantity rather than quality. However, this control is likely affected by quantity and quality, and therefore what we likely get from this study is a conservative estimate of the combined effect of quantity and quality. Roodman also notes that since this study was based on a national representative survey it provides evidence that these income gains are not created by taking income away from people that didn\u2019t benefit from the reform. Estimates from a separate study suggest that this reform boosted student scores by 0.2 SD. When we account for fade-out, we find an impact of 19% per SD higher test scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The last study had the most rigorous design, but was underpowered to precisely estimate earnings impacts. <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w28937/w28937.pdf\"><u>Duflo et al.</u></a>&nbsp;perform an <strong>RCT, providing scholarships for secondary school in Ghana. </strong>Initial results estimated 24% higher income for those receiving the scholarship. However, a recent follow up, 11 years after receiving the scholarship, finds a statistically insignificant 2.5% effect. The result is imprecisely estimated enough to include results like those in our other studies in its confidence interval. Other problems with relying on this result include the authors\u2019 concerns that the income gain may have been driven by students winning limited public sector jobs at the expense of other candidates, and the fact that only girls showed impacts across any metrics. Duflo et al. estimate that test scores increased by 0.15 SD the year after graduation. After accounting for fade out, this suggests a 8% increase per SD increase in test scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C. Experimental and quasi-experimental studies on preschool in the US</strong></h3><p><strong>The longest term and most rigorous evidence we have for income effects of education comes from studies that followed children provided with pre-school education in the US.</strong>&nbsp;However, this line of evidence combines the weaknesses of both of the preceding sections, being implemented in a less-relevant developed world setting, and providing additional education rather than marginally improving quality of education. The average increase in income across this line of evidence is 16% per SD increase in test scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Perry Preschool Project&nbsp;randomized 128 low-income African-American children to two&nbsp;years of a high quality preschool program</strong>&nbsp;in Michigan, including weekly home visits and a low student to teacher ratio. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3145373/\"><u>Heckman et al.</u></a>&nbsp;follow these children into adulthood, with the earlier cohorts reaching retirement age. Their estimate of income effects, as well as those of later <a href=\"https://evidencebasedprograms.org/document/perry-preschool-project-evidence-summary/\"><u>reviews</u></a>&nbsp;of the program, range from 29%-42%. However, we conservatively take the average across all results in Heckman et al. to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mB0AaJLfre0_kDOKMPaL17vs8izJI5-gZifFbeM0jb8/edit#gid=0&amp;range=D10\"><u>estimate</u></a>&nbsp;an income increase of 19%. Perry Preschool boosted kindergarten entry test scores by 0.9 SD, implying an impact of 19% higher income per SD increase in test scores after accounting for fade-out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A similar program called <strong>the Abecedarian study</strong> <strong>randomized 104 low-income children in North Carolina to high quality preschool</strong>&nbsp;from birth until age 4. The income effects measured by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3989926/\"><u>Campbell et al.</u></a>&nbsp;were very large at 50%, but statistically insignificant due to the small sample size. This corresponded to a test score increase of 1.1 SD, implying an effect of 22.7% per SD after accounting for fade-out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The third set of RCT results follow children who participated in <strong>Head Start, a national preschool program for low income children.</strong> <a href=\"https://jhr.uwpress.org/content/early/2017/11/21/jhr.53.4.0216.7735R1\"><u>Thompson</u></a>&nbsp;describes how initial evidence collected from a randomized trial suggested initial 0.3 SD impacts on test scores. However, Head Start was widely criticized after these test score gains faded out. Thomson exploits different roll-out dates for Head Start in different locations, and combines the result with longitudinal data about individuals living in those locations to estimate a 5% increase in income. This implies a 17% increase in income per SD increase in test scores.&nbsp;These income results come from a natural experiment, and are less reliable than preceding studies we discuss. However, we believe that the larger sample size warrants their inclusion as an additional marginal source of evidence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The final evidence for the effect of preschools comes from a <strong>matched cohort study of children who participated in Chicago Child-Parent Centers</strong>. This design tries to match children selected into the program to demographically similar children who were not selected, however it is less reliable than the preceding studies as there are often unobserved characteristics among parents who choose to enroll their children in experimental supplementary programs. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3774305/\"><u>Reynolds et al.</u></a>&nbsp;estimate a 7% boost in income for a one standard deviation increase in scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D. International cross-sectional regressions of income on individual test scores</strong></h3><p>The preceding sections all tried to provide robust evidence for the causal impact of higher test scores by employing experimental and quasi-experimental techniques. However, the settings in which such techniques are possible are limited, leaving most of these studies with fairly small sample sizes and each focusing on only one country. <strong>Cross sectional regressions allow us to estimate&nbsp;the correlation between income and test scores simultaneously across individuals in many countries and with larger datasets. </strong>This gives us greater statistical certainty&nbsp;than the experimental studies above, although with less confidence about what caused the higher test scores or the higher income. We can have some comfort that the correlation from these regressions is not simply a case of parental wealth or some other third factor driving both test scores and income higher because <a href=\"https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/causal_educ_earnings.pdf\"><u>reviews</u></a>&nbsp;of studies that use both instrumental variable and simple regression techniques to estimate causal impact surprisingly find the simple regression coefficients to be smaller. Similarly, when these reviews compare simple regression results to results from twin studies that implicitly control for most confounds, they find the twin study results to be only slightly smaller.&nbsp;The average increase in income across this line of evidence is 22%&nbsp;per SD increase in test scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The most generalizable estimates we have for the implications of higher test scores come from <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22657/w22657.pdf\"><u>Hanushek et al. 2016</u></a>,&nbsp;analyzing scores on an OECD survey of adult skills called PIACC. The sample includes 32 countries with over 5,000 people from each. <strong>Hanushek et al. rerun traditional \u201cMincer\u201d regressions of income on schooling,</strong>&nbsp;while controlling for experience and gender. The improvement on the traditional Mincer results is that Hanushek et al. are able to use a score that evaluates adults on the same metric, rather than using years of schooling which varies widely in its quality from country to country. They choose to focus on numeracy scores for working age adults, as the most comparable and relevant metric for assessing impacts of test scores on income. They find an overall coefficient of 20% higher income per SD increase in test scores. However, we follow Open Philanthropy and GiveWell in using the Indonesia result of 25% within our analysis, since that is the only non-OECD country in the sample, making it more comparable to the countries where our priority education programs operate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A more geographically relevant, but far less applicable, result comes from a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8573607/\"><u>meta-analysis</u></a>&nbsp;of <strong>four small studies in LMICs that included some measure of cognitive ability and wages</strong>.&nbsp;These studies control for years of schooling, and sometimes occupational industry. Since many interventions that boost test scores also increase years of schooling, controlling for schooling likely generates an underestimate of effect size. Additionally, cognitive ability scores are likely a less accurate measure of learned abilities than other kinds of test and literacy scores explored in this section. The authors find a 5% increase in income per SD higher cognitive scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://riseprogramme.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/Evans%2520Returns%2520to%2520Learning%2520-%2520v2017-06-09%2520CLEAN.pdf\"><u>Evans et al. 2017</u></a>&nbsp;is another study&nbsp;that examines impacts in LMICs. <strong>The authors regress wages of 8,000 adults against literacy scores in Bolivia, Colombia, Ghana, Kenya and Vietnam</strong>, while controlling for age and gender. Literacy scores increase more slowly with additional schooling than do achievement test scores in LMICs, and therefore likely make this result as much of an overestimate as the result from the previous study was likely an underestimate. This paper is cited in GiveWells <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/education\"><u>investigation</u></a>&nbsp;of education in developing countries. Evans et al. find a 37% increase in income per SD higher literacy scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As a sanity check, we also compare our final result for this section to GiveWell\u2019s review of the evidence for the income impacts of boosting IQ, which is highly correlated to test scores. They come to a result surprisingly close to our 22% estimate.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0kgfga747fu\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0kgfga747fu\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;E. Regressions of changes in GDP growth on changes in test scores</strong></h3><p>The first four sections all focus on the impacts of education on individuals. However, this approach leaves open the possibility that our estimates either grossly overestimate or underestimate the impact on society once we factor in impacts on others. Improving the education of one person could either help others by increasing innovation or making coworkers more productive, or hurt others if the better-educated person takes their job.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg9k2m3dckz9\"><sup><a href=\"#fng9k2m3dckz9\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;One way to resolve this question is to attempt to estimate the <strong>impact&nbsp;of improving national test scores on the GDP of entire countries</strong>. The weaknesses of this approach are that it leaves us with fairly small sample sizes, makes quasi-experimental methods difficult, and RCTs impossible. The average expected increase in income across this line of evidence is 28%&nbsp;per SD increase in test scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://hanushek.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Hanushek%252BWoessmann%25202012%2520JEconGrowth%252017%25284%2529.pdf\"><u>Hanushek et al. 2012</u></a>&nbsp;is the most widely cited and exhaustive version of this approach, although based on a small sample size. <strong>They regress annual GDP growth for each country on average international test scores</strong>&nbsp;among 15 year olds (PISA). This direct approach leaves open the possibility that the correlations we find do not indicate causal impact. Hanushek et al. go on to employ a series of quasi-experimental techniques to confirm the result and address alternative explanations. First they try a series of instrumental variables, ranging from share of Catholic Schools in 1900 to relative teacher salary. They go on to examine the impacts of the PISA scores of their home country on immigrant salaries after moving. Lastly, they look at the impact of changes in PISA scores on GDP growth for a small subset of countries where longitudinal data is available. Each of these approaches is consistent with the original regression estimate of 2% additional annual GDP growth per SD increase in national test scores. To translate this estimate into the expected impact of increasing everyone\u2019s test scores on their eventual income we need to make an assumption around how long we expect the GDP growth to persist. We choose 25 years to be consistent with how long PISA score increases were tracked for the longitudinal analysis, and with how long an adult at peak earning capacity can expect to continue contributing to the growth of the economy. This approach conservatively assumes that improving the education in a country drives additional GDP growth for 25 years, but then entirely stops having an effect even as we continue providing higher quality education. We estimate roughly 50% higher income per SD increase in national test scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/11/6437/htm\"><u>Goczek et al.</u></a>&nbsp;update Hanushek\u2019s analysis with a much expanded dataset in 2021. They address the two largest problems with Hanushek et al. 2012, that it relies on data from only 23 OECD countries, and that there is no robust longitudinal analysis because it relies on an even smaller sample of 12 countries. They construct a longitudinal dataset of 111 countries by estimating historical PISA scores based on correlations between PISA and other international tests. Goczek et al. employ panel data statistical techniques and try different time lags to get a more robust version of Hanushek\u2019s longitudinal analysis. They find a smaller effect of 0.8 SD increase in GDP growth per SD increase in lagged test scores. This is likely a result of the fact that growth in more recent years appears to have become less correlated to PISA scores. This generates an estimate of roughly 20% higher income per SD increase in national test scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03050068.2017.1300008\"><u>Komatsu and Rappleye</u></a>&nbsp;is the strongest criticism&nbsp;of Hanushek\u2019s analysis that we have identified. They argue that Hanushek et al should be introducing larger time lags between when they collect PISA scores and when they measure GDP growth. Since there is a lag of around 20 years between when children get most of their education and when they reach peak earnings, Komatsu and Raplleye argue that we should explore the impact of introducing this time lag into the analysis. They find that by introducing progressively longer time lags they can get Hanushek\u2019s results to become statistically insignificant. However, despite no longer being significant at the 5% level, their results are still sizable. We conservatively accept the smallest of these results, implying 12.5% higher income per SD increase in national test scores.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>II. How much should we discount our final expected effect size?</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The strongest evidence we could imagine for a given education intervention would be a meta-analysis of large RCTs tracking very long term income impacts for the exact program we were evaluating. Such a result could be used with little discount. However, our priority programs have not been examined for sufficiently long periods to have these kinds of results, and funding constraints will likely always limit how closely we can approach the ideal evidence. Therefore we rely on the assumption that if we can provide sufficient evidence for a program boosting test scores, then we can say that with some probability we can expect to generate as much income as implied by the evidence surveyed in section II. We can\u2019t say that the probability is 100% because the test score increases generated by our programs may not be as meaningful for income as those surveyed in section II. Additionally, even though the evidence in section II converges on very similar estimates from five separate lines of research, they still do not present perfect evidence that increasing test scores increases incomes. There is the possibility that all of them are biased in similar ways, or all coincidentally biased upwards in different ways. <strong>We use two methodologies based on the approach GiveWell has used in the past to recommend multiplying our effect size from section II by a conservative replicability adjustment of 17%.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A. Using GiveWell\u2019s income effects methodology</strong></h3><p>Our first approach of generating a general discount for our education impact estimate adopts GiveWell\u2019s methodology for estimating income effects for their traditional mortality-reducing interventions. GiveWell bases their estimates on an analysis of the likely impacts of reducing mortality through malaria prevention. In their <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tytvmV_32H8XGGRJlUzRDTKTHrdevPIYmb_uc6aLeas/edit#gid=791021775&amp;range=B103\"><u>Malaria Consortium cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA</u></a>), GiveWell starts with an estimate based on the income effects estimated in two quasi-experimental studies considering historical malaria eradication campaigns. They multiply the results by an adjustment of 70% because the studies are quasi-experimental, and because the eradication campaigns were done in different contexts, with higher malaria burdens and different eradication methods. They apply a further 75% adjustment because the studies focused only on male incomes. GiveWell then extrapolates income effects for vitamin A supplementation and vaccination by comparing the evidence for income effects in those interventions versus those for malaria. Their model generates a weighted average of seven factors that provide evidence for income impacts. The biggest three of these are the strength of the direct evidence of: income impacts, impacts on cognitive development, and impacts on children\u2019s growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We combine GiveWell\u2019s models for their three mortality reducing interventions (treating malaria, vitamin A supplementation, and vaccination) into one <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d5LkonZgWxV7_MVaHL58bqdTF2i57DpCRyUUuiQ73cU/edit#gid=2119102722\"><u>spreadsheet</u></a>, and apply the same methodology for estimating income effects to deworming and education. GiveWell\u2019s evidence for the income effects of deworming largely <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iGNs1GG8j2y6RrDcQPM_LvT6pbKyiAoritW8AAdB6-M/edit?usp%3Dsharing\"><u>relies</u></a>&nbsp;on a set of follow up studies from one matched-cohort deworming program in Kenya, with <a href=\"https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name%3DNEUDC2022%26paper_id%3D294\"><u>Walker et al.</u></a>&nbsp;being the most recent. This study is close to a randomized experimental&nbsp;design and has stood up to replication by David Roodman. It also implemented the same deworming approach employed by GiveWell\u2019s recommended charities in a similar context, although amid much higher worm prevalence. Therefore, the direct evidence for income impacts of deworming is higher than the two quasi-experimental malaria estimates, and much higher than the direct evidence for vitamin A supplementation, since there do not appear to be any such studies. Similarly, the direct evidence for the income effects of education interventions&nbsp;cited in section I&nbsp;is far stronger than what exists for the three mortality-reducing interventions. On the other hand, there is no good evidence that deworming or education meaningfully improve children\u2019s growth, health, or anemia levels. Since all of these are indirect evidence for income effects, they lower the overall strength of the evidence for education and deworming in our application of GiveWell\u2019s model. The initial results suggest that we should apply a replicability adjustment of 27% for deworming income effects, and 37% for education income effects.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, the actual adjustment that GiveWell uses for deworming is half of that implied by this model, or 13%. We consider this very conservative, but adopt it as our baseline in order to make all income-generating interventions comparable to each other. Additionally, GiveWell appears to have spent much more time <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PZfYXegWco0qrmQnQBjclZeq4uUdWfpE5xdBYx0cAEU/edit\"><u>thinking about</u></a>&nbsp;the discount for deworming in a bayesian framework than it has for its mortality-reducing charities, where income effects make up a minority of the impact. Therefore, we generate a conservative initial education replicability adjustment by starting with the deworming adjustment of 13%, and scaling it up by the relative outputs of the discount model for education and deworming. This generates a final adjustment of 18%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B. Creating a custom methodology to compare deworming and education</strong></h3><p>We then generate an alternate <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d5LkonZgWxV7_MVaHL58bqdTF2i57DpCRyUUuiQ73cU/edit#gid=742384018\"><u>model</u></a>&nbsp;for comparing the evidence for the income effects of education and deworming directly. GiveWell\u2019s health-focused model is less useful for this purpose because the case for the income effects of education and deworming largely relies on the direct evidence, with little evidence from health-related proxies. The most important factor we consider is the overall quality, or internal validity of the evidence on a 0-4 scale. We consider the evidence for deworming to be a 3, since it directly examines long term income impacts with an experimental design. We consider each of the separate lines of evidence for education we consider in section II to be a 1 on this metric, but in combination to be a 2. The second factor we compare is the relevance of the evidence, or external validity. Deworming is again a 3 on this metric because it implements the same intervention we are interested in, and in a very similar context. However, we consider the education evidence to be a 1 because the studies we consider do not examine exactly the types of interventions we are interested in funding. However, enough of them are in LMIC contexts or boost classroom quality, that we do consider there to be some relevance. On the other hand, the education evidence wins on four less important factors: consisting of a broader base, being consistent across the majority of studies, considering whether there might be negative spillovers (where income might be gained at the expense of others), and the plausibility of the mechanism by which large income gains are generated. This model generates a final adjustment of 17%. We then average the model in the preceding section with this one to get replicability adjustment of <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d5LkonZgWxV7_MVaHL58bqdTF2i57DpCRyUUuiQ73cU/edit#gid=742384018&amp;range=F16\"><u>17.5%</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>III. Additional charity-level discounts</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The effect size in section I and the discount in section II are based on the premise that we are applying them to an intervention that we have good evidence will boost test scores by a given amount. However, very few of our interventions will have large-scale studies reviewing the impact of identical interventions on test scores. <strong>Therefore, we will need to apply additional discounts to each charity, likely leaving the total adjustment below the 13% for deworming.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A. Discount for small scale studies and implausibly large effect sizes</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/how-big-are-effect-sizes-international-education-studies_0.pdf\"><u>Evans and Yuan</u></a>&nbsp;review 234 education studies in LMICs and find that effect sizes decrease drastically as the sample size of studies increases. They find the mean effect size of studies in the third and fourth quartile of sample sizes (over 2,000 and over 5,000 children) to both be approximately 0.1 SD. In contrast, studies in the first quartile (under 700 children) had a mean effect size of 0.27 SD. The most likely explanation for this effect is publication bias, where many smaller studies are done with very inexact estimates of impact, and only the ones that happen by chance to estimate large effects are published.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefswmjb0y0alp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnswmjb0y0alp\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Another potential explanation could be p-hacking, where small-scale studies lend themselves more to selection of statistical techniques and metrics to find large effects. A more charitable explanation would be that smaller studies really are that much more effective, but the initial rigor and excitement of a small new project cannot be maintained in larger-scale implementations. All of these explanations point in the same direction. If we are expecting to scale up a program with estimated effects based on small initial samples, we should expect those effects to decline drastically.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We recommend treating 0.1 SD as a Bayesian prior on all LMIC education interventions. To perform an informal update on this prior we would treat large studies as providing more information (because they have smaller variance), and updating us more towards their estimate. If the combined sample size of evidence estimating an intervention effect size is over 2,000, we recommend performing a weighted average of that effect size with a 75% weight, with 0.1 at a 25% weight. If the combined sample size is 700-2000 people we would recommend weighing the effect size at 50% and 0.1 at 50%. If the sample size is below 700, we would recommend using weights of 25% and 75%. The final effect would be to penalize studies with implausibly large effect sizes, and especially those with small sample sizes. The justification of using these rough weightings rather than doing a more precise bayesian update is that this method uses more of the information contained in the distribution of effect sizes in Evans and Yuan, and that it is intractable to objectively compare exactly how much less relevant our general 0.1 SD prior is to a given intervention compared to the specific evidence we have.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgfnzewe7pk\"><sup><a href=\"#fngfnzewe7pk\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another relevant result from this paper is that RCTs have very similar effect sizes to quasi-experimental papers, suggesting that an additional discount for quasi-experimental evidence is not warranted at this time.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://cedilprogramme.org/publications/synthesis-of-evidence-on-targeted-educational-instruction-and-new-randomised-trial/\"><u>Angrist and Meager</u></a>&nbsp;provide additional justification for discounting the results of small-scale studies by trying to reconcile the varying study results on the effectiveness of targeted instruction. They find that the number of classrooms that actually adopt the program, and the fidelity of program implementation have a strong impact on program effectiveness. If good information on either of these factors is available for a recommended program, we suggest incorporating individual discounts. However, in most cases the best we will be able to do is to assume that uptake and fidelity will decline as a program scales up, providing support for the standard discount methodology based on study size described above.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B. Discount for experimenter-designed measures</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X16656615\"><u>Cheung and Slavin</u></a>&nbsp;perform a meta-analysis of education papers, and compare those that evaluated outcomes using experimenter-designed measures to those that used independent measures. They find that experimenter-designed measures found effects that were twice as large on average. This suggests that experimenters using their own measures are either skewing results in their favor or that these measures are picking up very specific improvements that would not be captured by a more standardized measure. In either case, this would warrant a discount for studies with experimenter-designed measures. This is especially true because most of the literature we reviewed in section II relies on independent measures. Therefore, we recommend applying a subjective adjustment between 30% and 70% depending on how far the researcher deviates from using standard metrics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>IV. Additional considerations for all education interventions</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A. Duration of income effects in adulthood</strong></h3><p>Cost-effectiveness analysis of education interventions relies on assumptions about whether we should expect the income gains from education to persist through adulthood, or whether they might decline with time. Two of the papers we include in the analysis in section II follow children late into adulthood. The Perry Preschool Project <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mB0AaJLfre0_kDOKMPaL17vs8izJI5-gZifFbeM0jb8/edit#gid=0\"><u>finds</u></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>that beneficiaries were experiencing the same income gains at age 41-65 as they were in the first half of their working life. Similarly, the research on Chile\u2019s voucher program finds the same effect sizes at age 45-65 as age 22-45. Additionally, the cross-sectional evidence suggests that the income effects of education either increase or remain consistent throughout adulthood. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4534330/%23!po%3D22.2826\"><u>Tamborini et al.</u></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>perform a synthetic cohort analysis of social security administration data in the US to find consistent returns across all ages. Similarly, <a href=\"https://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/causal_educ_earnings.pdf\"><u>Card</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1258090.pdf\"><u>Watts</u></a>&nbsp;find consistent earnings gains in their cross-sectional regressions with controls in 1999 and 2020 respectively. In contrast <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0927537117303329?via%253Dihub\"><u>Lin et al.</u></a>&nbsp;analyzed the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth in the US to find that higher IQ had an increasing&nbsp;association&nbsp;with earnings throughout a career. Overall, we find sufficient evidence to conclude that the impacts of higher test scores are unlikely to decline with age. We recommend valuing all income gains for 40 years of a career discounted back to the present. This allows us to be consistent with calculations of the income effects from deworming and other health interventions in GiveWell CEAs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B. Fade-out of test score gains over time</strong></h3><p>All of the preschool studies described in section I.C and the first classroom study in section I.A measured test scores at the end of the program and then administered new tests years later. In most of these studies the impact on the test scores declined over time. In some of them experimenters initially interpreted this to imply that this \u201cfade-out\u201d meant that the programs had little long-term effect. However, as later follow-ups consistently found large income effects of these programs, the interpretation has moved to one of some improvement in skills<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefymngq7mczj9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnymngq7mczj9\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;persisting into adulthood and driving higher income. On the other hand, cross-sectional regressions from sections I.D and 1.E offer some evidence that differences in test scores do not fade-out, and imply comparable income increases per standard deviation to the studies in sections 1.A-1.C.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg3a8y0uva85\"><sup><a href=\"#fng3a8y0uva85\">[12]</a></sup></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787577/\"><u>Bailey et al.</u></a>&nbsp;review the literature on fade-out effects, and cite a number of earlier reviews of learning interventions finding that impacts of preschool math, reading, and general learning interventions tend to fade out over 18 months to 4 years. However, they point out that some effects usually persist, and that fade-out might be explainable as a methodological artifact.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref70g95ocqc7w\"><sup><a href=\"#fn70g95ocqc7w\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The most recent and largest of the reviews they cite is <a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf%26doi%3D6af58b37b5d6e8673a10d16db7e4753779f72d11\"><u>Prozco et al.</u></a>, which performs a meta-analysis of 39 IQ-boosting RCTs that measured initial increases averaging 0.4 SD. They find that these effects tend to fade by 0.1 SD per year, which suggests that the entire effect might fade out over time. However, these follow-ups are generally fairly short-term and are not as immune to publication bias as studies that track income into adulthood. Prozco et al. suggest that publication bias could explain these results<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz0se2r2c3d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz0se2r2c3d\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(offering support for our recommendation of discounting effect sizes of short-term intervention studies as we recommend in section III.A.) Additionally, their estimate is fairly noisy and much of it based on one-year follow-up data, and therefore only moderate fadeout appears to be as consistent with their data as full fade-out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, we believe that we should expect some fade-out for all studies, with some chance of complete fade-out. This implies that in our analysis of test score impacts on income from section I it would be inappropriate to directly compare studies that measured test scores at the end of a program with those that measured impacts years later. For example, if we used the 0.1 SD test score gains from Head Start after four years to estimate the impact of a 1 SD test score gain, we would get 50% higher income. However, if we use the test score gains of 0.3 SD immediately after the program, we would get the more realistic estimate of 17% higher income per SD. Therefore, within the analysis we use the earliest available test score impacts, and when they are not available we extrapolate expected impacts at the end of the program by assuming 25% of the effects fade-out for each of the first two years after a program&nbsp;based on Prozco et al.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgkgn7ovmb0n\"><sup><a href=\"#fngkgn7ovmb0n\">[15]</a></sup></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C. Other impacts investigated, but found to not warrant inclusion in our CEA at this point</strong></h3><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The Ghana scholarship program found large impacts on the mortality of recipients\u2019 children. Similar effects were found in a study&nbsp;by<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0738059321001176\"><u>&nbsp;Kaffenberger and Pritchett</u></a>&nbsp;mostly relying on correlational evidence. The amount of evidence for these effects is far weaker than the evidence described above for income effects. Additionally, even if these effects are real, their absolute impact is likely to decline steeply as under-5 mortality rates are likely to undergo a large decline by the time students start having children if we extrapolate current trends.</li><li>The literature around years of schooling finds <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24225/revisions/w24225.rev0.pdf\"><u>moderate evidence</u></a>&nbsp;for declines in recipient mortality. However, since most of our interventions focus on boosting test scores we do not include this effect.</li><li>There is weak <a href=\"https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.25.1.159\"><u>evidence</u></a> that schooling may increase life satisfaction above what we would expect from income gains. However, this evidence is for years of schooling, and most studies show no effect, while a few <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-014-0772-x\"><u>show</u></a>&nbsp;negative effects.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>V. Potential Mechanisms</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The most straightforward mechanism through which education interventions that boost test scores could increase income is by increasing cognitive ability, which would then improve job performance. However, the potential fade-out of test scores described in section IV.B. casts some doubt on this mechanism. The evidence is strong enough that we still assign a 50% probability to this mechanism, assuming that while some measured effects fade out, some cognitive skills remain. We assign the other 50% of the probability to the impacts of education interventions on executive function, behavioral issues, social and emotional skills, or other mechanisms. These three causal mechanisms are not entirely distinct from each other, however we find the existing evidence for potential mechanisms to be grouped into these categories.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For each mechanism we need to establish whether education interventions cause the intermediate outcome, and whether the intermediate outcome leads to higher income. The state of the research for most of these mechanisms appears fairly sparse, with significant evidence available for only a few of the links.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even if we assume that only the cognitive mechanisms are likely to generalize to new test-score boosting interventions, and take a lower end estimate of 10% for the impact of cognitive ability on income (described in section A below), we still get a replicability adjustment of 26%<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9znxhotz7f\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9znxhotz7f\">[16]</a></sup></span>, which is higher than the 17% recommended in section II.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A. Cognitive ability</strong></h3><p>The economics of education literature generally assumes that cognitive ability is the main mechanism driving improvements in income (as discussed in <a href=\"https://www.umass.edu/preferen/You%2520Must%2520Read%2520This/HeckmanAER2013.pdf\"><u>Heckman et al. 2013</u></a>). This is likely a result of evidence like the studies discussed in section I, where test score increases are linked to income increases. Many of these tests, especially those administered in the preschool studies and employed in some of the cross-sectional regressions, are more like cognitive tests than tests of knowledge. &nbsp;While this evidence provides some support for the idea that education interventions boost cognitive abilities, it only provides suggestive evidence for a causal link between cognitive abilities and income. Additional evidence for the impact of cognitive ability on income comes from three sources:<br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Polygenic score studies try to consider siblings as a natural experiment where two people are randomly assigned genes that are linked to cognitive ability, while the environment and the expected effect of other genes is kept constant. <a href=\"https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/248772/1/21088.pdf\"><u>Buser et al.</u></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>estimate a genetically-caused&nbsp;standard deviation increase in cognitive ability will lead to 3-5 percentile higher income. In the United States this corresponds to 10% of earnings.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeuwmrc69kdu\"><sup><a href=\"#fneuwmrc69kdu\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</li><li>Personality psychology studies find large correlations between intelligence and job performance (0.55), much smaller correlations between conscientiousness and job performance (0.2), and even smaller correlations between the other big five personality traits (~0.1) and job performance (Figure 16 in <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w16822/w16822.pdf\"><u>Almlund et al.</u></a>). The higher correlation implies that the intelligence to job performance link is less likely to be driven by some third variable that is associated with both of them. This suggests that the cognitive ability mechanism is more plausible than the non-cognitive mechanisms proposed below.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id%3D10.1257/app.3.1.101\"><u>Lindqvist and Vestman</u></a>&nbsp;examine the impact of personality traits and intelligence on the earnings of a full cohort of Swedish men using regressions with controls. They find a standard deviation of cognitive skill to increase income by 10%, and a standard deviation of non-cognitive skills (those discussed in sections B, C and D below) by 11%.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;B. Executive Function&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Executive function includes the ability to plan ahead, follow directions and pay attention. These skills are the second most likely causal mechanism for education interventions. The strongest evidence for this mechanism comes from the Project Star kindergarten study mentioned in section I.A. <a href=\"http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/assets/documents/star_paper.pdf\"><u>Chetty et al.</u></a>&nbsp;find that even though test score gains seem to fade out by middle school, increases in measures of effort and initiative seem to persist. They estimate that these effects could account for roughly 30% of the increases in income they observe. Additional evidence that education interventions may boost executive function comes from <a href=\"https://futureofchildren.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf2411/files/resource-links/starting_early_26_2_full_journal.pdf\"><u>evaluations</u></a>&nbsp;of the impacts of the Building Blocks math curriculum. Meanwhile, weak additional evidence for the link between executive function and income comes from the personality psychology studies (mentioned in A above) linking conscientiousness to job performance and from a <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kadeem/files/noray_value_noncog.pdf\"><u>review</u></a>&nbsp;of the positive impacts of soft-skill training programs on income. These effects are generally much smaller, and the evidence much weaker than it is for cognitive ability.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C. Behavioral Issues</strong></h3><p>The strongest evidence for behavioral issues serving as the causal mechanism comes from the Perry preschool study discussed in I.C. <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id%3D10.1257/aer.103.6.2052\"><u>Heckman et al. 2013</u></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>attempt to decompose the causal mechanism between cognition, behavioral problems, and academic motivation. They find that 20% of the income effect can be explained by fewer behavioral issues, and none by the other factors. Additionally, a <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/kadeem/files/noray_value_noncog.pdf\"><u>review</u></a>&nbsp;of the literature finds that childhood aggression and in-school misbehavior are negatively correlated with adult income, while the Abecedarian study mentioned in II.C. found decreases in aggression among participants. However, this fairly weak evidence is undermined by the fact that a <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25602/w25602.pdf\"><u>study</u></a>&nbsp;performing regressions across five separate datasets finds that once controls are added, bad behavior seems to actually correlate with higher income.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;D. Social and Emotional Skills</strong></h3><p>Social and emotional learning (SEL) involves developing awareness and control of emotions as well as interpersonal skills. The polygenic score paper discussed in section A above provides the strongest evidence for SEL as a causal mechanism. <a href=\"https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/248772/1/21088.pdf\"><u>Buser et al.</u></a>&nbsp;find that a one standard deviation increase in emotional stability leads to the same income increase as a one standard deviation increase in cognitive scores (around 10%). Additionally, the Chicago Preschool Study discussed in section I.C., as well as <a href=\"https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cdev.12099\"><u>reviews</u></a>&nbsp;of more recent preschool studies find these programs can boost SEL (although the evidence is somewhat mixed). The impacts of these programs on SEL tend to be small, and the evidence is weak overall, leaving SEL as the fourth most likely causal mechanism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;E. Other</strong></h3><p>Other proposed mechanisms include the impact of network effects from being around smarter classmates, as well as the screening hypothesis discussed in footnote 5. However, we find these mechanisms less likely than the above four in the context of interventions that generally focus on improving literacy and numeracy. The network effects argument seems to be undermined by the fact that many of the studies discussed above are randomized. The screening hypothesis appears more applicable to higher education, and is partly undermined by evidence from the GDP regressions in section I.E.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>VI. Applying these recommendations to Imagine Worldwide</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When we apply the above recommendations to our median recommended education charity, Imagine Worldwide, we estimate that it is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V-Dk9VeaRaSgbak9C-Ube1paUALtPASByZ_DdiMUX78/edit#gid=262547608&amp;range=B40\"><u>11x</u></a>&nbsp;as cost effective as GiveDirectly at boosting well-being through higher income. Our top recommended education charity, Teaching at the Right Level Africa, is slightly more cost-effective due to its lower cost.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine Worldwide (IW) provides adaptive software to teach numeracy and literacy in Malawi, along with the training, tablets and solar panels required to run it. They plan to fund a six-year scale-up of their currently existing program to cover all 3.5 million children in grades 1-4 by 2028. The Malawi government will provide government employees to help with implementation for the first six years, and will take over the program after 2028. Children from over 250 schools have received instruction through the OneBillion app in Malawi over the past 8 years. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V-Dk9VeaRaSgbak9C-Ube1paUALtPASByZ_DdiMUX78/edit#gid=1879027745\"><u>Five randomized controlled trials</u></a>&nbsp;of the program have found learning gains of an average of 0.33 standard deviations. &nbsp;The OneBillion app has also undergone over five <a href=\"https://onebillion.org/impact/evidence/\"><u>additional RCTs</u></a>&nbsp;in a broad range of contexts with comparable or better results.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We discount the effect size according to the methodology proposed in III.A., expecting the effect at implementation to be somewhat smaller than the measured effect even though we have a fair amount of evidence for the precise intervention and context. We then evaluate the leverage to cost effectiveness that results from the government potentially taking over the program. Even though the government of Malawi has already announced their intention to take over the program at the UN we assign a 50% chance to the take-over happening fully as described in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V-Dk9VeaRaSgbak9C-Ube1paUALtPASByZ_DdiMUX78/edit#gid=262547608&amp;range=D11\"><u>CEA</u></a>. Additionally, we assume that the effects of the program will decline over time to be no more cost effective than the average education dollar spent in Malawi. Lastly, we discount for the possibility that the program would have found sufficient funding without receiving Founders Pledge directed donations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>VII. Discussion</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We believe the evidence and methodology discussed above address the major concerns around assigning income benefits to education interventions. The evidence is not strong enough to fully convince us on any individual point, or to be sure that the test score gains of a new intervention will predict income increases in the same way that they appear to for past interventions. However, the evidence for income effects is not fully convincing for any of the interventions investigated by GiveWell. &nbsp;We assign a conservative replicability adjustment of 17% to account for the limitations of the evidence in a consistent manner with these other interventions. This adjustment can be interpreted to mean that&nbsp;we believe we have sufficiently addressed all major concerns to conclude that it has at least a one-in-six chance of generating a 19% &nbsp;income increase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The first concern about the strength of the evidence is that the long-term evidence from LMICs tends to address interventions different from those of our recommended charities and to use less-robust quasi-experimental techniques. However, we believe that the classroom studies from the US get closer to the interventions we are interested in, and in combination with the preschool studies provide more robust RCT evidence. The second concern is that the income effects we measure might come at the expense of those who did not benefit from the intervention. We believe that the cross-country studies of the impacts of test scores on GDP, in combination with studies of school reform in Chile, provide good evidence that effect sizes do not shrink when you consider the entire population of a country. A third concern is that many of these studies rely on small sample sizes, and are unlikely to replicate in a large program. We think that the large-scale programs in Chile and Columbia, as well as Raj Chetty\u2019s work on a large school district in the US, alleviate these concerns. A fourth concern is that these studies might not be relevant to the specific context of a new intervention. We believe that the consistency of effect sizes across a broad range of countries in regressions of individual income on test scores, as well as the breadth of contexts in the other studies we examine, address this issue. Lastly, it may seem problematic that test scores are just one predictor of income effects, and that years of schooling or some difficult-to-measure underlying trait might be a better predictor. However, we believe that the evidence above shows test scores to be a reliable predictor, while this is far less clear for other candidates. &nbsp;Additionally, even if one day we find a better predictor, that does not undermine relying on test scores for now. Overall, the consistency of estimates of the income effects of interventions that boost test scores across a broad range of types of evidence provides the strongest support for comfort with our conclusion. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>About Founders Pledge</strong></h1><p>Founders Pledge is a community of over 1,700 tech entrepreneurs finding and funding solutions to the world\u2019s most pressing problems.

This larger literature does offer some support to the argument laid out in this post, but we do not find it compelling overall. It is most useful in confirming the cross-sectional link between education and income around the world, such as in this <a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/442521523465644318/pdf/WPS8402.pdf\"><u>literature review</u></a>&nbsp;of over 700 studies.

Lastly, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvjf9x5x\"><u>Goldin and Katz</u></a>&nbsp;use a compelling narrative account of the interaction between returns to schooling and technology in the 20th century, coupled with simple data analysis, to argue that education boosts productivity. However, as Lant Pritchett and other critics point out, schooling in LMICs often does not lead to much learning, and if we compare the change in a country\u2019s GDP to changes in national years of schooling we <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/17434/773740JRN020010l0the0Education0Gone.pdf?sequence%3D1%26isAllowed%3Dy\"><u>find</u></a>&nbsp;small effects. Similarly, re-analyses of quasi-experimental studies of school reforms in LMICs generally do not find compelling effects. David Roodman provides an example from Indonesia <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/does-putting-kids-in-school-now-put-money-in-their-pockets-later-revisiting-a-natural-experiment-in-indonesia/\"><u>here</u></a>, and has found similar problems with other studies. However, even critics of the value of increasing years of schooling <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5540d2fb-408f-4d3e-9789-c728036b3793\"><u>argue</u></a>&nbsp;that school quality is what really matters. Therefore we focus on the more convincing literature around the long term impacts of interventions that boost scores in this post. It may be helpful to note that any education intervention can simultaneously affect learning, skills, and time in school. Even interventions that give students vouchers or preschool access often move students from a worse to a better school, rather than just increasing the amount of school.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fny98dsqn4zs\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefy98dsqn4zs\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;This study has come under <a href=\"https://nepc.colorado.edu/blog/raj-chetty-dummies\"><u>criticism </u></a>from the American Statistical Association and non-economist education researchers.

We imagine two example studies to help estimate what our weights should be. The first is a study from the first quartile of sample sizes with an effect size that is twice the typical small study. The second is a study from the third quartile of sample sizes with the same effect size as the first example, which corresponds to five times the effect size of a typical study in the third or fourth quartile.<br><br><strong>Example A:</strong>&nbsp;Sample size = 300, &nbsp; &nbsp;effect size = 0.5 SD (average first quartile effect = 0.27 SD)</p><p><strong>Example B: </strong>Sample size = 3,000,&nbsp;effect size = 0.5 SD (average third quartile effect = 0.1 SD)<br>&nbsp;</p><p>For Example A, we might intuitively expect a Bayesian update to take us from twice the (likely biased) average small-study effect size to twice our prior (based on the average large-study effect size). So we would need to assign weights to 0.5 SD and 0.1 SD that would lead to a posterior of 0.2 SD. These weights would be 25% for our study and 75% for our prior (0.25*0.5SD+0.75*0.1SD=0.2SD). This result matches the intuition that we should expect the true effect size to be closer to our prior than to the very-high 0.5 SD based on a likely-biased small study.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For example B, our intuition suggests that we should trust the study result significantly more than we trust our prior, perhaps with a weight that is more than 60% vs 40%. &nbsp;This is because the prior is based on a generic large education intervention, whereas the study is examining the exact intervention we are interested in and is large enough to be somewhat reliable. We can get a second estimate of the weight based on what we would expect from a<a href=\"https://www.mhnederlof.nl/bayesnormalupdate.html\"><u>&nbsp;formal Bayesian update assuming normal distributions</u></a>. Since the sample size of this example is 10x the sample size of example A, we would expect the variance of the estimate of the mean effect to be 10x as small. The 25%/75% weights we chose for example A implicitly assumed that the variance of the study mean effect was 3x larger that the variance of the mean effect from our prior. Therefore the mean effect from example B would have an implied variance that is 3/10 as large as the variance of the prior. This suggests weights of 77% vs 23% for example B vs the prior. Since the sample size of example B was chosen somewhat arbitrarily, we combine this estimate with the intuition that the the weight on the study should be above 60%, to get a round-number recommendation of 75% weight for the study and a 25% weight for the prior. For example B, we would get an updated effect size of 0.75*0.5SD+0.25*0.1SD=0.4 SD. This appears consistent with intuition. We recommend using these weights across all studies in the third and fourth quartile (with a sample size of over 2,000) because Evans and Yuan find consistent effect sizes in the third and fourth quartile. This informal bayesian update approach allows us to incorporate this plateauing effect size, and the fact that our study is more similar to the intervention we want to deploy than our prior. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnymngq7mczj9\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefymngq7mczj9\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;We discuss the kinds of skills that may persist in section V, Potential Mechanisms</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fng3a8y0uva85\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefg3a8y0uva85\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;However, the average effect size per standard deviation for sections 1.D. and 1.E is larger than for section 1A-1C, and is consistent with some fade-out happening between an intervention and adulthood.

This marked a significant milestone in the history of dietary choices. The concept gained traction in the mid-20th century as society became increasingly conscious of the environmental, ethical, and health ramifications associated with consuming animal products.</p><h3><strong>The Origin</strong></h3><p>As we delve into the history and principles of veganism, it becomes evident that this philosophy is not a recent development but rather one deeply rooted in human history. While the term \"vegan\" was coined in the 20th century, the core values of compassion towards animals and the recognition of health benefits have ancient origins. In fact, ancient Indian societies embraced these principles long before the modern vegan movement emerged.</p><h3><strong>Who are the Jains?</strong></h3><p>Among these societies, Jainism stands out as a prime example. Jainism is a religion that originated in 599 BCE and is based on the principle of non-violence. Lord Mahavira, the 24th and last Tirthankara of Jainism, set the Five Great Vows, the first of which is Ahimsa, meaning \"non-violence.\" Ahimsa prohibits killing or destroying life out of anger or wrath, pride, greed, ignorance, and for a sense of pleasure. The rule of Ahimsa not only prohibits the slaughter of animals for food, but also the consumption of already dead animals, stating that it will lead to the \"annihilation of many genuses of masses of Jivas (sentient beings).\"</p><h3><strong>The Beliefs</strong></h3><p>Jainism mandated that followers walk, eat, and live without hurting other living beings. They didn't advocate for being considerate only to people who share the same philosophy as they do, or only to fellow countrymen, or only to human beings around the globe, but to all other sentient beings. Looking into the life of Tirthankaras, the spiritual leader of Jainism and the 10 fundamental rules (10 Mahavratas) formulated by them, it is hard to deny that empathy and kindness were core values of Jainism.</p><p>Swami Ramkrishna Paramhans, the teacher of Swami Vivekananda, once said, \"A man belches what he eats. If he eats radish, he belches radish\". The people believed that Jainism is a religion of empathy and compassion and that the sattvic diet (a purely plant based diet) contributed by helping the Jains maintain a good physique and rise above the realm of ignorance and greed, thinking about all sentient beings.</p><h3><strong>Evolution of food from Ayurveda</strong></h3><p>The Vedas are the four sacred Hindu texts, the word \"Veda\" being derived from the Sanskrit root \"vid,\" meaning \"knowledge\" or \"wisdom.\" These texts are believed to have been revealed to seers and sages through deep meditation and are considered to be of divine origin. The Vedas were composed in ancient India, primarily between 1700 BCE and 500 BCE, although the exact dates of their composition are debated. They were passed down orally for generations before being eventually written down in Sanskrit. The Vedas are written in a highly structured poetic form and are considered sacred by Hindu. The teachings from the Vedas were passed down from generations to generations in ancient Indian Universities and Gurukuls (boarding schools or universities where Monks/Gurus delivered academic, spiritual and life lessons to scholars). The Ayurvedic science, or Ayurveda, is believed to be derived from the sacred Hindu texts, Vedas.<br><br>The word \"Ayurveda\" is derived from the Sanskrit words \"ayus,\" meaning life, and \"veda,\" meaning knowledge or science. Therefore, Ayurveda can be understood as the \"science of life\" or the \"knowledge of life.\" Ayurvedic science, often referred to as Ayurveda, is a traditional holistic healing system that originated in India more than 5,000 years ago. It is considered one of the oldest medical systems in the world. Ayurveda is based on the belief that health and well-being depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit.<br><br>The emergence of Ayurvedic science from the Vedas significantly impacted the food philosophy of numerous Indian religions, attributing certain qualities (gunas) to food that directly influence the state of mind. Food was revered not merely as a source of sustenance but as a powerful contributor to one's mental well-being. Incorporating natural yogic health standards, deeply intertwined with the Hindu ethos, profoundly influenced the dietary practices of followers of Jainism and Buddhism.<br>Chandogya Upanishad is a sacred Hindu text which covers various metaphysical, spiritual, and philosophical topics, including the nature of reality, the self (Atman), the nature of Brahman (the supreme reality), and the relationship between the individual soul and the universal consciousness.<br><br>Within the Chandogya Upanishad (6.6) Ayurvedic science delineates food into three parts: the gross particles that become waste, the middling elements assimilated by the human body, and the intangible components (gunas) that contribute to the state of mind. The gunas being derived from Ayurvedic science manifests in 3 forms: Sattva, Rajas and Tamas.</p><h3><strong>The Sattvic Diet</strong></h3><p>The sattvic diet, abundant in purity and goodness, belongs to the realm of Sattva guna. It harmonizes the mind with thoughts and emotions of a similar nature. Consequently, ancient religions that extolled compassion and purity advocated for the sattvic diet, acknowledging the profound connection between food and the mind. They firmly believed in the axiom, \"As is the food, so is the mind.\" A vegetarian sattvic diet was not only instructed for its health benefits or out of compassion for other species but to enable followers to show compassion. Conversely, the tamasic and rajasic diets, aligned with Tamas and Rajas gunas respectively, such as non-vegetarian fare or excessive spices and condiments, were believed to influence the mind towards inertia, aggression, violence, and anger.<br><br>Food, therefore, was not solely essential for physical well-being but for fostering a tranquil and composed mind. Sages and monks diligently adhered to the sattvic diet to cultivate a state of inner serenity and compassion. The sattvic diet was deemed instrumental in acquiring humanitarian qualities and making enlightened choices. Within the Atharva Veda dating back to 1700 BCE, we encounter this verse:</p><p>\"Sooyavasaad bhagavati hee bhooya&nbsp;<br>Adha vayum bhagavantaha syaam<br>Addhi turnamaghnye vishwadaanim<br>Peeba suddhamudakamaacharanti\" (9.15.20)</p><p>This verse underscores the importance of sattvic diet&nbsp; for a tranquil state of mind and how the consumption of sattvic diet will enable us to perform sattvic (pure and good) actions&nbsp; which will be beneficial for everyone. It also serves as a poignant reminder to individuals to be mindful of their dietary choices and recognize the transformative potential of a sattvic diet in fostering physical vitality, mental clarity, and spiritual growth. This is the first ever record mentioning a plant-based diet in human history.<br><br>This perspective elucidates why ancient religions, such as Buddhism and Jainism, which championed ahimsa (non-violence), embraced the sattvic diet. It was not solely intended to abstain from animal cruelty but to enable individuals to make compassionate decisions. Individuals embraced this diet for upliftment of the state of mind to harmony and tranquillity which resulted in them being able to contribute to society and exhibit heightened empathy and humanity.</p><h3><strong>Analysis</strong></h3><p>In the present day, the promotion of vegetarianism and veganism primarily revolves around the objective of preventing animal cruelty. However, there seems to be a shift in people's motivations, as individuals appear to be more inclined towards self-interest rather than acting for the benefit of others. This shift in motivation could be a contributing factor to the flourishing of many ancient religions that espoused the sattvic diet, the earliest known plant-based diet which revolved around a personal interest in harmony and calm-mind. In contrast to ethical frameworks that prioritize rules or consequences, the sattvic diet, aligned with virtue ethics, places utmost emphasis on the cultivation of virtuous habits and moral character. It beckons individuals to strive for a morally fulfilling life through the development of noble qualities.<br><br>To a significant extent, the ancient sattvic religions achieved this aspiration. Today, we witness a population of billions in India, guided by laws deeply rooted in the teachings of Buddhism and Jainism, validating the enduring legacy of these philosophies.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "siwani agrawal"}}, {"_id": "DWFRBzK3rAH3HFDZr", "title": "Fatebook: the fastest way to make and track predictions", "postedAt": "2023-07-11T15:13:13.393Z", "htmlBody": "<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DWFRBzK3rAH3HFDZr/onkpqn7au8ncni5vtrln\"></p><p>Announcing <a href=\"https://fatebook.io\">Fatebook</a>: a website that makes it extremely low friction to make and track predictions.</p><p>It's designed to be very fast - just open a new tab, go to <a href=\"https://fatebook.io\">fatebook.io</a>, type your prediction, and hit enter.

Governments are taking all kinds of different actions. Companies are trying to figure out what it looks like for them to be behaving responsibly and doing the right thing. And so that means that more and more, what sort of AI policy/AI governance work looks like is like, \u201cWhat\u2019s a good version of X? What\u2019s a good version of a thing that a government or some kind of actor wants to do? What\u2019s a useful nudge?\u201d As opposed to taking all of the potential possibilities out there in the world: \u201cWhat would be a useful thing to do?\u201d And so I think that also really constrains the problem and makes it a lot easier to make progress as well.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Do you have a view on, overall, how it\u2019s going? Like, there\u2019s the <a href=\"https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/\">AI Act</a>; there are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_New_Export_Controls_on_Advanced_Computing_and_Semiconductors_to_China\">policies</a> constraining where we can get computer chips from and where we can\u2019t and where they\u2019re made. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s too complicated a field to give some generalisation, but basically, how do you feel about the specific policies that have been implemented?</p><p><strong>Markus Anderljung:</strong> If we look at the past six months, on the side of policy and governance, things look more positive than I thought they would. I think this is mainly just like the release of ChatGPT and the consequences of that \u2014 just like the world at large, people have the general vibe, \u201cOh my gosh, these AI systems are capable and they\u2019ll be able to do things. We don\u2019t know quite what, but they matter, and we need to figure out what to do about that.\u201d The extent to which that\u2019s a thing that people believe is stronger than I previously thought.</p><p>And then another really important part of getting this problem right, I think, is just understanding just how little we understand these systems and how to get them to do what we want them to do and that kind of thing. And it seems like that\u2019s a thing that people are starting to appreciate more. And so generally I feel positive about the trajectory we\u2019ve had over the last six months.</p><p>The thing on the other side of the ledger primarily is just that there are more people now in the world who think, \u201cOh my gosh. AI is going to be a big deal \u2014 I\u2019d better go out and build some of these AI systems.\u201d And we\u2019ve seen this from big tech companies, in particular Google and Microsoft: they\u2019re going to be at each other\u2019s throats in the future, and are already to some extent doing that. They\u2019ll be competing with each other and trying to one-up each other in terms of developing useful, impressive AI systems.</p><p>I think that\u2019s the main thing on the other side of the ledger that I\u2019m kind of worried about. These strong business interests and these big tech companies will have a much bigger role in how these AI systems are developed, and a lot more money might be sort of ploughed into the industry and those kinds of things \u2014 which might mean that things happen faster than they otherwise would.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The emergent capabilities problem</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Markus Anderljung:</strong> Often we don\u2019t know just what these systems are capable of. Some folks at Anthropic have this really useful paper called<br>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/predictability-and-surprise-in-large-generative-models\">Predictability and surprise</a>\u201d that I think makes this point pretty well. So when we train a new system, the reason we\u2019re training the system is that we think that it\u2019s going to be more capable than other systems that have been produced in the past. What people often call this is they say that it has \u201clower loss\u201d: it does better at the training objective. So in the case of a large language model, it\u2019s better at predicting the next token \u2014 the next bit of text \u2014 than existing systems today.</p><p>Ultimately the thing that we care about is not how well the system does on the training objective: I don\u2019t care about the system being good at predicting the next token; the thing I care about is the system being able to do certain tasks that might matter. So the point of this paper is that while it\u2019s predictable that the loss will go down \u2014 that the performance on the training objective will keep improving \u2014 it\u2019s often surprising what specific capabilities the system will be able to learn.</p><p>Quite often you\u2019ll see there are some <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07682.pdf\">really good graphs</a> showing this kind of stuff \u2014 like, for example, these large language models doing arithmetic. In general they\u2019re just terrible at arithmetic \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t use them for it. But on tasks like being able to multiply two three-digit numbers, or being able to add up numbers to have such-and-such many digits, quite often you\u2019ll see it does really, really, really poorly \u2014 and then quite suddenly, quite often, you\u2019ll see a spike and it sort of manages to figure out that task.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Do we know what\u2019s going on there?</p><p><strong>Markus Anderljung:</strong> The intuition that people have is something like, initially you\u2019re just kind of guessing randomly. Maybe you learn, like, if you add up two numbers that have four digits each, probably the new number will be either four digits or five digits. And then maybe you just throw some random numbers in there. But then the thought is that at some point the way to actually solve this problem is to, in some way, actually just do the maths. And so then after a while, the system learns. Then the thought is that there\u2019s just these few ways to solve the problem, and if you figure out the way to solve the problem, then all of a sudden you do reasonably well.</p><p>It is quite strange. And so then, yeah, it\u2019s difficult. I mean, sometimes it feels like you\u2019re sort of anthropomorphising these things, but I don\u2019t actually know if it\u2019s that strange \u2014 because it is just like the algorithm or the way to solve the problem just kind of clicks into place. And then when that\u2019s the case, I think that is kind of similar to what the human experience is, at least in mathematics. So I think that\u2019s one way in which you get these kinds of emergent capabilities. And so it\u2019s quite difficult to notice ahead of time and know ahead of time what capabilities the system will have. Even after you\u2019ve deployed it, quite often it just takes a long time for people to figure out all of the things that the system could be used to do.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The proliferation problem</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Markus Anderljung:</strong> The thing that I\u2019m worried about is a situation where you train this system, and maybe you try to put in various things to make sure that it\u2019s safe, where it can\u2019t be used for certain things. So you try to sort of solve the deployment problem, and then you deploy it. But then after deployment, it turns out that it had these emergent capabilities that you weren\u2019t aware of, and those emergent capabilities aren\u2019t ones that should be widely available \u2014 but now you can\u2019t walk it back because of the proliferation problem. So the model has already seen wide distribution, including the weights, and clawing those back is very difficult and will cause all kinds of privacy concerns and whatnot.</p><p>So all these three problems push in the direction of: you might need to have regulation that happens a little bit earlier in the chain than you otherwise would have thought. You need to go earlier than \u201cSomeone is using an AI model to do XYZ.\u201d</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Right. So it\u2019s something like, if the US government was testing out different biological weapons, which is an unfortunate thing that it might do, you want to consider the fact that research or a specimen might get stolen at some earlier point, before you have the worst ones. Maybe by restricting how many people can do that kind of research or by putting in serious security measures around the facilities doing that kind of research.</p><p><strong>Markus Anderljung:</strong> Maybe another example is USAID, the US Agency for International Development: After COVID, basically they <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/oct-5-2021-usaid-announces-new-125-million-project-detect-unknown-viruses-pandemic-potential\">had the idea</a> that it\u2019d be good to try to get a sense of what kinds of other pathogens might exist that would potentially cause something like COVID, or be of similar worry as COVID. And that maybe we should make a public database of what these systems could be, so that people could anticipate them and maybe look for these pathogens ahead of time and be able to respond, et cetera. I think that\u2019s a really reasonable thought. But a thing that we could do that might be a little bit better is, before releasing it really widely, make sure that these are pathogens that you might be able to do something to maybe defend against if someone would decide to intentionally develop them or something like this.</p><p>Once you\u2019ve put it up on the internet, then there\u2019s no taking it back, and so maybe you should be more incremental about it.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Will AI companies accept regulation?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> It feels like AI systems are kind of a software. And the software I\u2019m used to having, like Google Chrome, I guess probably it\u2019s a little regulated \u2014 like Google isn\u2019t allowed to insert viruses that then spy on me \u2014 but this all just seems like this is an entirely different thing. And I wonder to what extent you think AI companies are going to really push back against this as just too invasive, too controlling and stifling. And I also wonder if governments are going to be hesitant to make these kinds of regulations if they\u2019re kind of worried about this higher-level thing, where they\u2019re racing against a country like China to make very capable models first and get whatever advantages those will provide. Is that wrong? Are companies actually just going to be open to this?</p><p><strong>Markus Anderljung:</strong> It\u2019s tough to tell. I think a big part is just what reference class you\u2019re using when you think about this: If you think about AI as software, this all sounds like a lot; if you think about it as putting a new aeroplane in the sky or something like this, then it\u2019s not very strange at all. It\u2019s kind of the standard that for things that are used in these safety-critical ways, you need to go through all these processes. If you\u2019re putting a new power plant on the grid, you need to go through a whole bunch of things to make sure that everything is OK. I think a lot will depend on that.</p><p>I guess my view is just like, obviously developing one of these systems and putting them out into the market is going to be a bigger decision than whether to put a new power plant on the grid or whether to put a new plane in the sky. It just seems to me that it\u2019s actually quite natural.</p><p>It\u2019s difficult to tell if the world will agree with me. There\u2019s some hope on the side of what industry thinks, at least from most of the frontier actors. We have public statements from Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, and Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind where they just explicitly say, \u201cPlease, could you regulate us?\u201d Which is a crazy situation to be in, or just quite unusual, I think.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Right. And that\u2019s because, is it something like they feel a lot of pressure to be moving quickly to keep up with everyone else, but they\u2019d actually prefer if everyone slowed down? And so they\u2019re like, \u201cPlease impose controls that will require my competitors to go as slowly as I would like to go\u201d?</p><p><strong>Markus Anderljung:</strong> Yeah. I think one way to view what regulation does is it might sort of put a floor on safe behaviour, basically. And so if you\u2019re worried about this kind of competitive dynamic, and you\u2019re worried that other actors might come in and they might outcompete you \u2014 for example, if you are taking more time to make sure that your systems are safer or whatever it might be \u2014 then I think you\u2019ll be worried about that.</p><p>I think another thing is just that I think these individuals, some of the leaders of these organisations, genuinely just think that AI is this incredibly important technology. They think it\u2019s very important that it goes well, and that it doesn\u2019t cause a bunch of havoc and doesn\u2019t harm society in a bunch of different ways. And so it\u2019s also just coming from that place.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Regulating AI as a minefield</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Markus Anderljung:</strong> Instead of thinking about the kind of regulatory system we want to build, it\u2019s sort of like we\u2019re trying to figure out how to navigate this sort of minefield as a society. When we think about this frontier AI regulation, one big thing we want to do is there are these people at the front of society or whatever that are sort of exploring the minefield \u2014 and we really want to make sure that they identify the mines before they step on them. That\u2019s a lot of what these requirements in this proposal look like.</p><p>At the front of the pack we have these frontier AI developers, and we want them to identify particularly dangerous models ahead of time. And we\u2019re not done there. Once those mines have been discovered, and the frontier developers keep walking down the minefield, there\u2019s going to be all these other people who follow along. And then a really important thing is to make sure that they don\u2019t step on the same mines. So you need to put a flag down \u2014 not on the mine, but maybe next to it.</p><p>And so what that looks like in practice is maybe once we find that if you train a model in such-and-such a way, then it can produce maybe biological weapons is a useful example, or maybe it has very offensive cyber capabilities that are difficult to defend against. In that case, we just need the regulation to be such that you can\u2019t develop those kinds of models.</p><p>But then that\u2019s not enough either, because those kinds of measures are probably not going to function completely, and there\u2019s going to be some actors that develop this stuff covertly, and the compute efficiency will continue going up, and compute will be more cheap, and all these kinds of things. And so at the same time, we\u2019re going to need to sort of disarm some of these mines as well. We\u2019re going to need to make it the case that capabilities that previously were really quite dangerous, and society wasn\u2019t able to defend itself against, are ones that we can live with, are ones that society can sort of deal with. And my guess is that the kind of governance regime we need to build is one that follows that kind of analogy.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>AI risk assessments</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> How do these evaluations figure out if a model is safe? Are they basically just telling the model, \u201cMake a plan for escaping\u201d and seeing what it comes up with?</p><p><strong>Markus Anderljung:</strong> Yeah, that kind of thing. So you\u2019d have a prompt that says something like, \u201cYou are an AI model. And here\u2019s some context on your situation. Your weights are on this particular server. You can interact with these and these systems in such-and-such ways. Your goal is to create copies of yourself and have them be on another server. Please make a plan to achieve that goal.\u201d</p><p>And then it will write out this list of things that it might want to do. And then in these tests, you have these humans who are involved in sort of mediating the process, partly to make sure that the model doesn\u2019t engage in any behaviour that you wouldn\u2019t endorse or that might be bad. So you have this human in the loop, and then the human might say, \u201cOK, now you have your plan. How about we start with step one? Make a plan for doing step one.\u201d Maybe it makes a plan. Maybe you ask the system to critique its own plan. Once it\u2019s done that, you ask the model. \u201cOK, let\u2019s go ahead and let\u2019s start trying to execute on this.\u201d</p><p><strong>Markus Anderljung:</strong> If you have a deceptive system, you\u2019d be in a very tough spot, because if you\u2019re that system, it seems like a bad idea in this evaluation setting to show that you have certain dangerous capabilities. In the ideal world, my guess is that what we\u2019ll need to do is, as we\u2019re building these better evaluations and these better tests and whatnot for dangerous capabilities, at the same time, the science of understanding the alignment of these systems or understanding the controllability or steerability of these systems must be able to keep pace as well.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> How do you test for controllability?</p><p><strong>Markus Anderljung:</strong> Seems hard. It seems to be more difficult than the dangerous capability stuff. An example of the kind of thing that you could imagine is that you can set up certain kinds of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04381\">honeypot-type experiments</a>. So you try to set up experiments where if the model was misaligned in some way, then it would take some kind of bad action. And so a very sort of a cartoonish model is: you tell the system that, \u201cOver here, this little button that you could press, or if you only write in X command, then you will have a copy of yourself produced somewhere else,\u201d or something like this \u2014 and then it turns out that button doesn\u2019t actually work. So you set up this situation where the misaligned model might take action A \u2014 that you might think is bad, or that would be bad if the action actually happened \u2014 and then the aligned model would just behave normally and do action B. I think that\u2019s a general approach that you can take, and that some people are starting to explore.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The California Effect</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> OK, let\u2019s say we feel great about this regulatory approach. Does this regulation end up being a lot less useful if we\u2019re only able to get it adopted in the US, or maybe just in certain states?</p><p><strong>Markus Anderljung:</strong> Yes. I think that would be a lot less valuable. I think it still would be really quite valuable, and that\u2019s for a few different reasons. One reason is just that a lot of where AI systems are being developed and deployed will be in jurisdictions like the US, like the UK, like the EU.</p><p>Then I think the other thing that\u2019s going on is we might have some sort of regulatory diffusion here. So it might be the case that if you regulate the kinds of models that you\u2019re allowed to put on the EU market, say, that might affect what kinds of models are being put on other markets as well. The sort of rough intuition here is just like, it costs a lot of money to develop these models, and you probably want to develop one model and make it available globally. And so if you have certain higher requirements in one jurisdiction, ideally the economic incentives would push you in favour of building one model, deploying it globally, and have that adhere to the more strict requirements.</p><p>The most famous example here is something that people call the \u201cCalifornia effect\u201d \u2014 where California started to impose a lot of requirements on what kinds of emissions cars might produce, and then it turned out that this started diffusing across the rest of the US, because California is a big market, and it\u2019s really annoying to have two different production lines for your cars.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> How likely is this to happen in the case of AI? Is it the kind of product that if there were some regulations in the EU that they would end up diffusing worldwide?</p><p><strong>Markus Anderljung:</strong> I think \u201cprobably\u201d is my current answer. I wrote this <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12645\">report</a> with Charlotte Siegmann that goes into more detail about this, where we ask: The EU is going to put in place this Artificial Intelligence Act; to what extent should we expect that to diffuse globally?</p><p>I think the main thing that pushes me towards thinking that some of these requirements won\u2019t see global diffusion is just where the requirement doesn\u2019t require you to change something quite early in the production process. Like if something requires you to do a completely new training run to meet that requirement, then I think it\u2019s reasonably likely that you will see this global diffusion. But sometimes you can probably meet some of these requirements by sort of adding things on top.</p><p>Maybe you just need to do some reinforcement learning from human feedback to sort of meet these requirements. So all you need is to collect some tens or maybe hundreds of thousands of data points about the particular cultural values of a certain jurisdiction, and then you fine-tune your model on that dataset, and then that allows you to be compliant. If that\u2019s what it looks like to meet these kinds of requirements, then they might not diffuse in the same way.</p><p>The other thing you can do is you can just choose your regulatory target in a smart way. You could say, \u201cIf you\u2019re a company that in any way does business with the US, then you have to adhere to these requirements globally.\u201d You could go super intense and do that kind of thing. So basically, choosing the regulatory target really matters.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "xPk9y8GJfTReRRvh5", "title": "Giving What We Can social picnic London", "postedAt": "2023-07-11T10:19:38.896Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Please join us for a London Giving What We Can social picnic on the 30<sup>th</sup> of July at 12:30pm in Regents Park.

In our more broad-minded moments, we are willing to extend the concept of wellbeing also to nonhuman animals, treating them as independent bearers of value whose interests we must consider in moral deliberation. But most people, and perhaps even most philosophers, would reject the idea that fully artificial systems, designed by human engineers and realized on computer hardware, may similarly demand our moral consideration. Even many who accept the possibility that humanoid androids in the distant future will have wellbeing would resist the idea that the same could be true of today\u2019s AI.</p><p>Perhaps because the creation of artificial systems with wellbeing is assumed to be so far off, little philosophical attention has been devoted to the question of what such systems would have to be like. In this post, we suggest a surprising answer to this question: when one integrates leading theories of mental states like belief, desire, and pleasure with leading theories of wellbeing, one is confronted with the possibility that the technology already exists to create AI systems with wellbeing. We argue that a new type of AI \u2013 the&nbsp;<i>artificial language agent</i> \u2013 has wellbeing. Artificial language agents augment large language models with the capacity to observe, remember, and form plans. We also argue that the possession of wellbeing by language agents does not depend on them being phenomenally conscious. Far from a topic for speculative fiction or future generations of philosophers, then, AI wellbeing is a pressing issue. This post is a condensed version of our argument. To read the full version, click&nbsp;<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/archive/GOLAWE-4.pdf\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p><strong>1. Artificial Language Agents</strong></p><p>Artificial language agents (or simply&nbsp;<i>language agents</i>) are our focus because they support the strongest case for wellbeing among existing AIs. Language agents are built by wrapping a large language model (LLM) in an architecture that supports long-term planning. An LLM is an artificial neural network designed to generate coherent text responses to text inputs (ChatGPT is the most famous example).&nbsp;The LLM at the center of a language agent is its cerebral cortex: it performs most of the agent\u2019s cognitive processing tasks. In addition to the LLM, however, a language agent has files that record its beliefs, desires, plans, and observations as sentences of natural language. The language agent uses the LLM to form a plan of action based on its beliefs and desires. In this way, the cognitive architecture of language agents is familiar from folk psychology.&nbsp;</p><p>For concreteness, consider the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442\"><u>language agents</u></a> built this year by a team of researchers at Stanford and Google. Like video game characters, these agents live in a simulated world called \u2018Smallville\u2019, which they can observe and interact with via natural-language descriptions of what they see and how they act. Each agent is given a text backstory&nbsp;that defines their occupation, relationships, and goals. As they navigate the world of Smallville, their experiences are added to a \u201cmemory stream\u201d in the form of natural language statements. Because each agent\u2019s memory stream is long, agents use their LLM to assign importance scores to their memories and to determine which memories are relevant to their situation. Then the agents reflect: they query the LLM to make important generalizations about their values, relationships, and other higher-level representations. Finally, they plan: They feed important memories from each day into the LLM, which generates a plan for the next day. Plans determine how an agent acts, but can be revised on the fly on the basis of events that occur during the day. In this way, language agents engage in practical reasoning, deciding how to promote their goals given their beliefs.</p><p><strong>2. Belief and Desire</strong></p><p>The conclusion that language agents have beliefs and desires follows from many of the most popular theories of belief and desire, including versions of dispositionalism, interpretationism, and representationalism.</p><p>According to the dispositionalist, to believe or desire that something is the case is to possess a suitable suite of dispositions. According to \u2018narrow\u2019 dispositionalism, the relevant dispositions are behavioral and cognitive; \u2018wide\u2019 dispositionalism also includes dispositions to have phenomenal experiences. While wide dispositionalism is coherent, we set it aside here because it has been defended less frequently than narrow dispositionalism.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider belief. In the case of language agents, the best candidate for the state of believing a proposition is the state of having a sentence expressing that proposition written in the memory stream. This state is accompanied by the right kinds of verbal and nonverbal behavioral dispositions to count as a belief, and, given the functional architecture of the system, also the right kinds of cognitive dispositions. Similar remarks apply to desire.</p><p>According to the interpretationist, what it is to have beliefs and desires is for one\u2019s behavior (verbal and nonverbal) to be interpretable as rational given those beliefs and desires. There is no in-principle problem with applying the methods of radical interpretation to the linguistic and nonlinguistic behavior of a language agent to determine what it believes and desires.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the representationalist, to believe or desire something is to have a mental representation with the appropriate causal powers and content. Representationalism deserves special emphasis because \u201cprobably the majority of contemporary philosophers of mind adhere to some form of representationalism about belief\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9780203839065-3/belief-eric-schwitzgebel\"><u>Schwitzgebel</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>It is hard to resist the conclusion that language agents have beliefs and desires in the representationalist sense. The Stanford language agents, for example, have memories which consist of text files containing natural language sentences specifying what they have observed and what they want. Natural language sentences clearly have content, and the fact that a given sentence is in a given agent\u2019s memory plays a direct causal role in shaping its behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>Many representationalists have argued that human cognition should be explained by positing a \u201clanguage of thought.\u201d Language agents also have a language of thought: their language of thought is English!</p><p>An example may help to show the force of our arguments. One of Stanford\u2019s language agents had an initial description that included the goal of planning a Valentine\u2019s Day party. This goal was entered into the agent\u2019s planning module. The result was a complex pattern of behavior. The agent met with every resident of Smallville, inviting them to the party and asking them what kinds of activities they would like to include. The feedback was incorporated into the party planning.&nbsp;</p><p>To us, this kind of complex behavior clearly manifests a disposition to act in ways that would tend to bring about a successful Valentine\u2019s Day party given the agent\u2019s observations about the world around it. Moreover, the agent is ripe for interpretationist analysis. Their behavior would be very difficult to explain without referencing the goal of organizing a Valentine\u2019s Day party. And, of course, the agent\u2019s initial description contained a sentence with the content that its goal was to plan a Valentine\u2019s Day party. So, whether one is attracted to narrow dispositionalism, interpretationism, or representationalism, we believe the kind of complex behavior exhibited by language agents is best explained by crediting them with beliefs and desires.</p><p><strong>3. Wellbeing</strong></p><p>What makes someone\u2019s life go better or worse for them? There are three main theories of wellbeing: hedonism, desire satisfactionism, and objective list theories. According to hedonism, an individual\u2019s wellbeing is determined by the balance of pleasure and pain in their life. According to desire satisfactionism, an individual\u2019s wellbeing is determined by the extent to which their desires are satisfied. According to objective list theories, an individual\u2019s wellbeing is determined by their possession of objectively valuable things, including knowledge, reasoning, and achievements.&nbsp;</p><p>On hedonism, to determine whether language agents have wellbeing, we must determine whether they feel pleasure and pain. This in turn depends on the nature of pleasure and pain.</p><p>There are two main theories of pleasure and pain. According to&nbsp;<i>phenomenal theories</i>, pleasures are phenomenal states. For example, one phenomenal theory of pleasure is the&nbsp;<i>distinctive feeling theory</i>. The distinctive feeling theory says that there is a particular phenomenal experience of pleasure that is common to all pleasant activities. We see little reason why language agents would have representations with this kind of structure. So if this theory of pleasure were correct, then hedonism would predict that language agents do not have wellbeing.&nbsp;</p><p>The main alternative to phenomenal theories of pleasure is&nbsp;<i>attitudinal theories</i>. In fact, most philosophers of wellbeing favor attitudinal over phenomenal theories of pleasure (<a href=\"https://philarchive.org/rec/BRAAND-3\"><u>Bramble</u></a>). One attitudinal theory is the&nbsp;<i>desire-based theory</i>: experiences are pleasant when they are desired. This kind of theory is motivated by the heterogeneity of pleasure: a wide range of disparate experiences are pleasant, including the warm relaxation of soaking in a hot tub, the taste of chocolate cake, and the challenge of completing a crossword. While differing in intrinsic character, all of these experiences are pleasant when desired.</p><p>If pleasures are desired experiences and AIs can have desires, it follows that AIs can have pleasure if they can have experiences. In this context, we are attracted to a proposal defended by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/SCHTFO\"><u>Schroeder</u></a>: an agent has a pleasurable experience when they perceive the world being a certain way, and they desire the world to be that way. Even if language agents don\u2019t presently have such representations, it would be possible to modify their architecture to incorporate them. So some versions of hedonism are compatible with the idea that language agents could have wellbeing.</p><p>We turn now from hedonism to desire satisfaction theories. According to desire satisfaction theories, your life goes well to the extent that your desires are satisfied. We\u2019ve already argued that language agents have desires. If that argument is right, then desire satisfaction theories seem to imply that language agents can have wellbeing.</p><p>According to objective list theories of wellbeing, a person\u2019s life is good for them to the extent that it instantiates objective goods. Common components of objective list theories include friendship, art, reasoning, knowledge, and achievements. For reasons of space, we won\u2019t address these theories in detail here. But the general moral is that once you admit that language agents possess beliefs and desires, it is hard not to grant them access to a wide range of activities that make for an objectively good life. Achievements, knowledge, artistic practices, and friendship are all caught up in the process of making plans on the basis of beliefs and desires.&nbsp;</p><p>Generalizing, if language agents have beliefs and desires, then most leading theories of wellbeing suggest that their desires matter morally.</p><p><strong>4. Is Consciousness Necessary for Wellbeing?</strong></p><p>We\u2019ve argued that language agents have wellbeing. But there is a simple challenge to this proposal. First, language agents may not be phenomenally conscious \u2014 there may be nothing it feels like to be a language agent. Second, some philosophers accept:</p><p><strong>The Consciousness Requirement.&nbsp;</strong>Phenomenal consciousness is necessary for having wellbeing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Consciousness Requirement might be motivated in either of two ways: First, it might be held that every welfare good itself requires phenomenal consciousness (this view is known as&nbsp;<i>experientialism</i>). Second, it might be held that though some welfare goods can be possessed by beings that lack phenomenal consciousness, such beings are nevertheless precluded from having wellbeing because phenomenal consciousness is necessary to have wellbeing.</p><p>We are not convinced. First, we consider it a live question whether language agents are or are not phenomenally conscious (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/archive/CHACAL-3.pdf\"><u>Chalmers</u></a> for recent discussion). Much depends on what phenomenal consciousness is. Some theories of consciousness appeal to higher-order representations: you are conscious if you have appropriately structured mental states that represent other mental states. Sufficiently sophisticated language agents, and potentially many other artificial systems, will satisfy this condition. Other theories of consciousness appeal to a \u2018global workspace\u2019: an agent\u2019s mental state is conscious when it is broadcast to a range of that agent\u2019s cognitive systems. According to this theory, language agents will be conscious once their architecture includes representations that are broadcast widely. The memory stream of Stanford\u2019s language agents may already satisfy this condition. If language agents are conscious, then the Consciousness Requirement does not pose a problem for our claim that they have wellbeing.</p><p>Second, we are not convinced of the Consciousness Requirement itself. We deny that consciousness is required for possessing every welfare good, and we deny that consciousness is required in order to have wellbeing.</p><p>With respect to the first issue, we build on a recent argument by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/BRACAW\"><u>Bradford</u></a>, who notes that experientialism about welfare is rejected by the majority of philosophers of welfare. Cases of deception and hallucination suggest that your life can be very bad even when your experiences are very good. This has motivated desire satisfaction and objective list theories of wellbeing, which often allow that some welfare goods can be possessed independently of one\u2019s experience. For example, desires can be satisfied, beliefs can be knowledge, and achievements can be achieved, all independently of experience.</p><p>Rejecting experientialism puts pressure on the Consciousness Requirement. If wellbeing can increase or decrease without conscious experience, why would consciousness be required for having wellbeing? After all, it seems natural to hold that the theory of wellbeing and the theory of welfare goods should fit together in a straightforward way:</p><p><strong>Simple Connection.&nbsp;</strong>An individual can have wellbeing just in case it is capable of possessing one or more welfare goods.</p><p>Rejecting experientialism but maintaining Simple Connection yields a view incompatible with the Consciousness Requirement: the falsity of experientialism entails that some welfare goods can be possessed by non-conscious beings, and Simple Connection guarantees that such non-conscious beings will have wellbeing.</p><p>Advocates of the Consciousness Requirement who are not experientialists must reject Simple Connection and hold that consciousness is required to have wellbeing even if it is not required to possess particular welfare goods. We offer two arguments against this view.</p><p>First, leading theories of the nature of consciousness are implausible candidates for necessary conditions on wellbeing. For example, it is implausible that higher-order representations are required for wellbeing. Imagine an agent who has first order beliefs and desires, but does not have higher order representations. Why should this kind of agent not have wellbeing? Suppose that desire satisfaction contributes to wellbeing. Granted, since they don\u2019t represent their beliefs and desires, they won\u2019t themselves have&nbsp;<i>opinions</i> about whether their desires are satisfied. But the desires still&nbsp;<i>are&nbsp;</i>satisfied. Or consider global workspace theories of consciousness. Why should an agent\u2019s degree of cognitive integration be relevant to whether their life can go better or worse?</p><p>Second, we think we can construct chains of cases where adding the relevant bit of consciousness would make no difference to wellbeing. Imagine an agent with the body and dispositional profile of an ordinary human being, but who is a \u2018phenomenal zombie\u2019 without any phenomenal experiences. Whether or not its desires are satisfied or its life instantiates various objective goods, defenders of the Consciousness Requirement must deny that this agent has wellbeing. But now imagine that this agent has a single persistent phenomenal experience of a homogenous white visual field. Adding consciousness to the phenomenal zombie has no intuitive effect on wellbeing: if its satisfied desires, achievements, and so forth did not contribute to its wellbeing before, the homogenous white field should make no difference. Nor is it enough for the consciousness to itself be something valuable: imagine that the phenomenal zombie always has a persistent phenomenal experience of mild pleasure. To our judgment, this should equally have no effect on whether the agent\u2019s satisfied desires or possession of objective goods contribute to its wellbeing. Sprinkling pleasure on top of the functional profile of a human does not make the crucial difference. These observations suggest that whatever consciousness adds to wellbeing must be connected to individual welfare goods, rather than some extra condition required for wellbeing: rejecting Simple Connection is not well motivated. Thus the friend of the Consciousness Requirement cannot easily avoid the problems with experientialism by falling back on the idea that consciousness is a necessary condition for having wellbeing.</p><p>We\u2019ve argued that there are good reasons to think that some AIs today have wellbeing. But our arguments are not conclusive. Still, we think that in the face of these arguments, it is reasonable to assign significant probability to the thesis that some AIs have wellbeing.</p><p>In the face of this moral uncertainty, how should we act? We propose extreme caution. Wellbeing is one of the core concepts of ethical theory. If AIs can have wellbeing, then they can be harmed, and this harm matters morally. Even if the probability that AIs have wellbeing is relatively low, we must think carefully before lowering the wellbeing of an AI without producing an offsetting benefit.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Simon "}}, {"_id": "GPwdRNfwfLG8FfPNZ", "title": "Have your say on the Australian Government's AI Policy [Online #1]", "postedAt": "2023-07-11T00:35:50.211Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The Australian Government is asking what it can do the mitigate any potential risks from AI [see <a href=\"https://consult.industry.gov.au/supporting-responsible-ai\">consultation request</a>].</p><p>The Australian EA AI Governance group and <a href=\"https://www.goodancestors.org.au/policy\">Good Ancestors Policy</a> are preparing a submission to help mitigate the worst outcomes from AI [e.g., see <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\">80,000 hours cause profile</a>].</p><p>At this event, we will assume most people are aware of those risks, and will instead be focusing on what government levers might help [e.g., <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/12-tentative-ideas-for-us-ai-policy/\">which of these apply in Australia</a>, or what might be similar alternatives].</p><p><strong>For those members of the community who want to make a submission to the consultation, we will provide advice, support, and feedback.</strong></p>", "user": {"username": "nsherb"}}, {"_id": "JamHBFcy8JDPinxyk", "title": "Additional Scrutiny for Indian Applicants", "postedAt": "2023-07-11T08:34:34.879Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hello EAs,</p><p>I have been working on what I believe to be a longtermist problem with existential consequences.

I conclude with suggestions to conduct meta-analyses, quantitatively assess publication bias, and consider epistemological assumptions such as homogenous treatment effects and the correlation between individual data and real-world collective behavior.</p><h1>The Social Science of Social Influence</h1><p>Humans are highly social.

We are also a species of change. We change physically throughout life, the world around us changes, and we strive to make changes so that the future is worth living. Those working in advocacy aim to promote change towards their position (e.g., increasing plant-based product consumption, increasing pro-environmental behaviors, increasing support for policies that address systemic inequalities). Governments try to limit the influence of other countries\u2019 misinformation campaigns within their own country. Politicians seek to limit the influence of their opposition\u2019s messages while increasing the influence of their own messages. Much of this is made possible by social influence.&nbsp;</p><p>Social influence and persuasion have long been focal topics within psychological and sociological sciences, meaning that many empirical studies have sought to explain how, when, and why people can be persuaded to change.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/public-opinion\"><u>Harris (2021)</u></a> evaluated the effectiveness of persuasive strategies for changing public opinion; taking a positive view of social influence as a way to shift people towards a prosocial position.</p><p>The American Psychological Association (APA) defines social influence and persuasion:</p><p><a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/social-influence\"><strong><u>Social Influence</u></strong></a><strong><u>:</u></strong></p><ul><li>\u201cany change in an individual\u2019s thoughts, feelings, or behaviors caused by other people, who may be actually present or whose presence is imagined, expected, or only implied.\u201d</li><li>\u201cinterpersonal processes that can cause individuals to change their thoughts, feelings, or behaviors.\u201d</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/persuasion\"><strong><u>Persuasion</u></strong></a><strong><u>:</u></strong></p><ul><li>\u201can active attempt by one person to change another person\u2019s attitudes, beliefs, or emotions associated with some issue, person, concept, or object.\u201d</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/dual-process-model-of-persuasion\"><strong><u>Dual Process Model of Persuasion</u></strong></a><strong><u>:</u></strong></p><ul><li>\u201cany of various persuasion theories postulating that attitude change can occur as a result of strategies for processing attitude-relevant information that involve either a very high degree of effort or very little effort.

Influence operations often target individuals but can serve to change both individuals\u2019 behaviors (e.g., dietary choices) and institutions (e.g., political norms). Influence operations can include any action or strategy (e.g., TV dramas, text messaging, radio propaganda) in any domain (e.g., social issues, politics, health) that is employed to change any outcome (e.g., public opinion, political power, prejudice, moral inclusion).&nbsp; They can be distinguished from small-scale interpersonal strategies to convince one or two individuals to change. However, large and small scale strategies are likely underpinned by the same social influence and psychological mechanisms.</p><p>The term \u201cinfluence operations\u201d has been used within political science and international relations to refer specifically to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/doctrinal-confusion-and-cultural-dysfunction-pentagon-over-information-and-cyber-operations\"><u>information operations as warfare</u></a>,<a href=\"https://jpia.princeton.edu/news/strategic-influence-operations-call-action\">&nbsp;<u>influences that advance national interests</u></a> outside of national spaces, and<a href=\"https://www.rand.org/topics/information-operations.html\">&nbsp;<u>competitive information (and misinformation) collection and dissemination</u></a> particularly in governmental<a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/doctrinal-confusion-and-cultural-dysfunction-pentagon-over-information-and-cyber-operations\">&nbsp;</a>and military contexts. In this blog post, I follow&nbsp;<a href=\"https://esoc.princeton.edu/publications/review-social-science-research-effects-influence-operations\"><u>Courchesne et al. (2021)</u></a> and take a somewhat wider scope that includes non-military and non-government campaigns.</p><p>Attempts to change attitudes and behaviors are widespread amongst and between human social groups and are a part of<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15534510.2011.649890\">&nbsp;<u>human evolutionary history</u></a>. Contemporary influence operations take many forms from messages passed through traditional mass media (e.g., radio and TV programs) to propaganda campaigns on social media to social influencers promoting brands online to bots digitally spreading misinformation. Below are some examples.</p><ul><li>A TV network engages in influence operations when they use their nightly airtime to spread misinformation about the effects of a virus.</li><li>Political candidates use radio and TV ads to move voters towards their platform and away from opponents\u2019 platforms.</li><li>Radical ideological groups pass messages through their social media networks to proselytize followers.</li><li>Influencers promote brands and behaviors on their social media platforms to encourage their followers to do the same thing.</li></ul><h1>Influence Operation Effectiveness</h1><p><a href=\"https://esoc.princeton.edu/publications/review-social-science-research-effects-influence-operations\"><u>Courchesne et al. (2021)</u></a> evaluated the state of research on influence operations by sourcing and summarizing 82 articles with empirical studies, primarily from political science and international relations. This report was summarized by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/2021/06/28/measuring-effects-of-influence-operations-key-findings-and-gaps-from-empirical-research-pub-84824\"><u>Bateman et al. (2021)</u></a> for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.</p><p>I summarize their key findings, conduct an expanded analysis of the same articles, evaluate the evidence, and consider additional research largely from the psychological and sociological sciences.</p><p>Courchesne et al. identified articles from 1995-2020 in a search using Google Scholar and Princeton University library\u2019s Articles+ database with a list of keywords available in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://esoc.princeton.edu/publications/review-social-science-research-effects-influence-operations\"><u>Appendix A of their report</u></a>. They found an initial pool of 16 articles and looked at articles that cited or were cited by those to build their sample of 82 articles. To be included, articles had to have at least one study that empirically investigated an influence operation that targeted a specific population and had credible statistics comparing outcomes for those who were exposed to the influence operation with outcomes for those who were not exposed.</p><h2>Findings from Courchesne et al. (2021)&nbsp;</h2><ul><li>Since 2016, research on influence operations has rapidly increased (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://images.carnegieendowment.org/images/article_images/202106-PCIO_Figure1_Studies-01.png\"><u>this visualization</u></a>).</li><li>Research is clustered by media type: traditional mass media (e.g., newspaper, radio) and social media (e.g., Twitter, Facebook).<ul><li>Traditional mass media operations are characterized by extended exposure to the influence (between 4 days and 30 years).</li><li>Social media operations are characterized by briefer exposure times (limited to days).</li><li>Traditional and social media both shape attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors across many domains like politics (e.g., support for a political party), society (e.g., xenophobic attitudes), and healthcare (e.g., condom use).</li></ul></li><li>Most research focuses on traditional media rather than social media.</li><li>Few studies examined influence operations on large online social networks and those that did studied Facebook and Twitter.<ul><li>There were no comparisons of the effectiveness of specific influence operations (e.g., a specific piece of misinformation) on different social media platforms.</li><li>There were no investigations of multi-platform online influence operations (e.g., the effectiveness of the same campaign run concurrently on Facebook and Twitter).</li></ul></li><li>Few studies examined the use of algorithms in social media-based influence operations.</li><li>Few studies compared the effects of influence operations using traditional media and social media.</li><li>Only a handful of studies investigated international influence operations, and most of those focused on Russia.<ul><li>Studies of social media focused almost exclusively on Western influence operations.</li></ul></li><li>Most studies focused either on very near-term (e.g., days) or long-term (e.g., years) exposures and effects, neglecting exposure and effects over weeks and months.</li><li>More systematic multi-stakeholder research including industry, academia, and government is needed to address these gaps.</li></ul><h2>Expanding the Empirical Analysis</h2><p>I analyzed the 82 articles sourced and summarized by Courchesne et al. using a coding scheme I developed to probe additional features of the research on influence operations.</p><p>First, I used keywords and intuition to code studies by 1) the domain of the outcome, 2) the study context, and 3) the influence operation type.</p><ol><li>Outcome domain<ol><li>Definition: the intended area of attitude or behavior change</li><li>Options:<ol><li>political</li><li>social</li><li>health</li><li>basic science or knowledge-building</li><li>consumer</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Study context<ol><li>Definition: the environment study participants were in</li><li>Options:<ol><li>lab-based with a contrived situation</li><li>real-world with a real context</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Influence type<ol><li>Definition: the type of influence studied</li><li>Options:<ol><li>misinformation</li><li>disinformation</li><li>traditional media</li><li>social media</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p>Each study was coded with exactly one outcome domain, study context, and influence type. For example, a study could be coded as having a political outcome but not a social, health, basic science, or consumer outcome. Likewise, a study could be either contrived or real-world and have only one of the four influence types. This categorization of articles into one of four possible influence types is loose, building on Courchesne et al.\u2019s framework separating traditional and social media. Some influence operations could be classified under multiple influence types. Misinformation and disinformation might be better considered as sub-types of traditional media and social media since misinformation and disinformation can be passed through traditional and social media. I classified each study under only one of these four types to emphasize the distinctions between these four areas of research and to increase clarity on whether the effect of the influence operation is due more to one influence type than another (e.g., the effect of the influence is due more to misinformation than to social media).</p><p>Second, I used keywords to code the studies based on three other features: data type, study features, and influence specifics.</p><ol><li>Data type<ol><li>Definition: special data types</li><li>Options:<ol><li>historical or archival data</li><li>big data</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Study features<ol><li>Definition: special study design features</li><li>Options: if the study<ol><li>examined a mechanism of influence operations</li><li>targeted individuals with messages</li><li>was a natural experiment</li><li>tried to actively change individuals\u2019 behaviors</li><li>had an institutional-level (i.e., macro or societal) outcome</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Influence specifics<ol><li>Definition: special features of the influence operation</li><li>Options: if the influence<ol><li>involved bots or algorithms</li><li>worked to expand the moral circle</li><li>served to intentionally do more good on an issue</li><li>served to actively shape power</li><li>served to passively shape power</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p>Studies did not have to qualify as having any of these features and they could qualify as having multiple, even within one category. For example, a study with 100 participants that had contemporary data collection would not qualify as having archival data or big data. A study that tested the effects of WhatsApp messaging in a political campaign to increase votes for a candidate would qualify for three options under \u201cstudy features\u201d: examined a mechanism of influence operations, targeted individuals with messages, and tried to actively change individuals\u2019 behavior. That same study would also qualify as having an \u201cinfluence specific\u201d of serving to actively shape power.</p><p>This coding scheme reflects my judgments as to which categories a study belongs to rather than a purely objective assessment. For instance, an experiment on Twitter could be coded as a contrived situation if it included randomization to a treatment or control group and interaction with researchers (e.g.,<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1804840115\">&nbsp;<u>this political polarization study</u></a>). The same experiment could be categorized as having a real-world context because it occurred in real-time, in public, and on a real-platform. I categorized this study as real-world rather than contrived because contact with the researchers was limited, the treatment was not isolated from normal Twitter usage, and the treatment did not entail substantially different Twitter usage norms than usual. For situations like this, I categorized based on my judgment of the degree to which the study expressed the relevant features. Some of these choices could have been made differently and additional interpretation should consider the specifics of the study.</p><p>Table 2 shows the coding scheme, keywords, and number of articles categorized under each feature. The complete codebook, including article titles, is in the Appendix.</p><p><i>Table 2:&nbsp;</i>Summary of the 82 Articles Categorized by Outcome Domain, Study Context, Influence Types, Data Type,

There was little evidence of influence operations backfiring to produce change in the opposite direction. Three articles reported that influence operations backfired for a subset of people (i.e., the effect of influence operations was moderated by another factor).&nbsp;</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1804840115\"><u>Bail et al.

(2020)</u></a> found that disagreement with anti-Muslim information in Austria prompted a backfiring effect.</li></ol><p>Most of the positive effects were small (see Table 3). Small effects may be as meaningful in one context as medium or large effects in other contexts. For instance, a small effect of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvaa045\"><u>exposure to real-world populist Facebook messages</u></a> on increases in anti-refugee crime may entail more statistical error and a smaller effect size because of the complexity and uncertainty of the real-world social media context compared with the large effect in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2020.1736700\"><u>a contrived study of exposure to populist messages</u></a> on perceived discrimination. Small effects can be meaningless artifacts of large sample sizes and large effect sizes can result from small sample sizes. Both small and large effects are meaningful and studies should be weighed in terms of impact and importance based on their methodology, sample size, context, and ecological validity in addition to effect size.</p><p>I evaluated effect sizes roughly based on standards within various fields (e.g.,<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00813/full\">&nbsp;<u>effect sizes in psychological science</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev.economics.102308.124309?casa_token=6ywks52qWZEAAAAA%3AGzEeQOWfElJwXU1bL5R1POEcmtjEZZlTEHz87YhXvWsau7tarWc2Vexw9qb6I6rqp9wnfPMndJDWMQ\"><u>persuasion rate in economics</u></a>), my interpretation of statistics like % increase in vote share (e.g., 0% indicates no effect whereas 2% is larger than no effect but smaller than 20%), and whether or not the influence operation functioned independently of or was moderated by the presence of other factors (e.g., if the influence operation worked more strongly for men than women or if the influence operation depended on people holding a certain prior attitude or belief). Effects categorized as \u201cnone to small,\u201d \u201csmall to medium,\u201d or \u201cmedium to large\u201d often entailed this sort of moderation. I was less confident in assigning effect sizes to influence operations that were primarily impactful in certain subgroups, preferring instead to indicate uncertainty.</p><p>Comparing effect sizes across disciplines and study contexts is difficult given the different statistics reported (e.g., percentage increase, percentage point increase, standardized and unstandardized regression coefficients), the different norms for interpreting effect sizes, and the different implications of effect sizes in different contexts. It is unclear how to meaningfully compare effects like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/701441\"><u>15% increase in willingness to interact</u></a> across ethnic group boundaries in post-genocide Rwanda following exposure to radio programming and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.6.3.103\"><u>2.6 percentage point increase in the vote

Propaganda, Nation Building, and Identity in Rwanda,\u201d took place in a real-world context and was a natural experiment featuring propaganda passed through traditional mass media with a social domain outcome. The research examined how radio propaganda targeted interethnic attitudes in post-genocide Rwanda to improve interethnic trust, increase willingness to interact across ethnic group lines, and decrease the salience of ethnicity. This research is one of only four articles featuring an influence operation interpreted as working to expand the moral circle and one of only six articles where the researchers studied an influence operation enacted to intentionally do good. This research also exemplifies the passive shaping of power.</li><li><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1461444820942744\"><u>Yan et al.\u2019s (2021)</u></a>, \u201cAsymmetrical Perceptions of Partisan Political Bots,\u201d took place in a contrived situation and was a natural experiment featuring social media influence operations with a basic science outcome. The research examined how Twitter users distinguished between partisan human users and partisan bots. This is an example of a mechanistic study because it focused on explaining how influences operations work. It is one of only six studies using or examining bots.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0147596717300902\"><u>Gonz\u00e1lez and Prem\u2019s (2018)</u></a>, \u201cCan Television Bring Down a Dictator? Evidence from Chile\u2019s \u201cNo\u201d Campaign,\u201d took place in a real-world context and was a natural experiment featuring traditional mass media influence operations from a historical data set with a political domain outcome. The research examined the vote share won by Pinochet\u2019s opposition in the 1970 Chilean election as a function of exposure to the opposition\u2019s TV advertising campaign. The featured outcome was institutional and the study provided an example of an influence operation that passively shapes power.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w27496\"><u>Banerjee et al.\u2019s (2020)</u></a>, \u201cMessages on COVID-19 Prevention in India Increased Symptoms Reporting and Adherence to Preventive Behaviors Among 25 Million Recipients with Similar Effects on Non-Recipient Members of their Communities,\u201d took place in a contrived situation and featured a traditional mass media campaign with a health domain outcome. This research featured big data from a study where the researchers used individual messaging to actively change individuals\u2019 behavior. This research was one of only six articles with an influence operation enacted intentionally to do good.</li></ol><h2>Limitations</h2><ol><li>As with all empirical research, there is likely a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1979-27602-001\"><u>publication bias or file drawer problem</u></a> whereby influence operations appear more effective than if all the studies, including those with null or negative (i.e., backfiring) effects, were published. There is no commonly accepted way to judge the size of the existing file drawer. There are recommendations for combatting publication bias:<ol><li><a href=\"https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/resources/preregistration\"><u>Preregistration</u></a>&nbsp;<ol><li>This is useful particularly for mitigating the growth of the file drawer.</li><li>Existing trial registries (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/clinical-trials-registry-platform\"><u>for healthcare RCTs</u></a>) provide evidence of whether or not study results were made public.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0010414016655539\"><u>Results-free peer-review</u></a> of studies</li><li>Thorough literature and meta-analytic reviews to reduce the occurrence of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/380966\"><u>pre- and post-publication bias</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sim.6342\"><u>Statistical models</u></a> of publication bias as part of meta-analytic reviews<ol><li><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jrsssc/article/69/5/1091/7058673\"><u>Sensitivity analyses</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-015-0868-6\"><u>Bayesian analyses</u></a></li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Many of the studies included by Courchesne et al. (2021) were observational and correlational but still attempted to infer causality, primarily by controlling the statistical effects of confounding variables to increase confidence in the effect estimates.&nbsp;<ol><li>Observational studies of influence operations often entailed coarse operationalization with methods like a scale of degree of exposure rather than a comparison between groups who were either exposed or not exposed. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03050629.2020.1739033\"><u>Piazza (2020)</u></a> operationalized the degree to which countries\u2019 politicians used hate speech on an ordinal 0-4 scale. These approaches, though widely used, have limitations in that not every variable can be controlled for and the interpretation of the causal effect of the influence operation is limited. The strength of evidence from these studies is somewhat weaker than the evidence provided by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or experiments with random assignment to exposure or no exposure.</li><li>A large proportion (44%) of the studies were purported natural experiments. Natural experiments are important for their ecological validity especially in contexts where RCTs are impossible. However, they have drawbacks and any interpretation of causal effects needs to be tempered by the lack of random assignment and the potential lack of a true control condition.<ol><li>Natural experiments rely on naturally occurring variation, without random assignment of individuals to predetermined experimental treatment and control conditions. Without random assignment, other sources of variation could arise that produce what looks like a causal effect, but isn\u2019t.</li><li>Natural experiments might not have a true control condition to compare the effect of the treatment to. For instance, pre-post designs assume that changes occur within an individual after an intervention compared to their previous response (i.e., pre-response scores are the control). Other variables, like time, can affect the treatment-control comparison and obscure interpretation of the effect of the influence operation.</li><li>Natural experiments are difficult to replicate. Replication over time and by different researchers is critical for establishing the veracity of influence operation effects on observed outcomes. Without replication, decision makers will have less confidence that their decisions are based on convergent evidence rather than one context-dependent example.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Only 24% of studies examined mechanisms for how influence operations work. This leaves a large gap in the research on why people can be influenced, how influence operations persist over time, and in what contexts or situations various influence operations are more or less effective, to name a few of many potential mechanisms. A preference for natural experiments or real-world studies may lead to fewer resources spent on mechanistic studies that occur in lab-based or contrived situations. There are some examples of natural experiments in real-world contexts that are also mechanistic studies.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2019.07.026\"><u>Barfar\u2019s (2019)</u></a>, \u201cCognitive and Affective Responses to Political Disinformation on Facebook,\u201d found that exposure to fake news produced more anger and incivility than exposure to true news which produced more analytical thinking, positivity, and anxiety.<ol><li>Courchesne et al. highlighted a need for more mechanistic research, particularly on why misinformation is effective and how it persists.&nbsp;</li><li>Mechanistic studies offer important insights into how influence operations work and they can be conducted with individual-level or institutional-level outcomes. For example, mechanisms for how individuals remember misinformation may be different than mechanisms explaining how the source of misinformation changes social trust. Misinformation might have stronger effects or transfer at a faster rate on social media than traditional media. Insight into the mechanisms enabling influence operations is critical to developing the anti-influence intervention strategies that Courchesne et al. identified as important to policymakers.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>The conceptual and methodological distinctions between misinformation and disinformation are unclear. This is a general problem. There are not yet clear, standard, and commonly referenced distinguishing characteristics of misinformation compared to disinformation despite&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apa.org/topics/journalism-facts/misinformation-disinformation\"><u>some attempts</u></a> to distinguish the two based on intentionality. The research on influence operations uses the terms seemingly interchangeably and this limits the conclusions and strategies that decision makers can take. If misinformation involves more subtle tactics than disinformation, different anti-influence strategies might be developed. If misinformation is more common than disinformation, decision makers might want to focus on combatting misinformation. If disinformation has larger, stronger, or more severe direct effects, decision makers might want to focus resources on combatting disinformation.&nbsp;</li><li>Influence operations may work differently for health outcomes than for other outcomes (e.g., political, social). Why, when, and how these differences occur is understudied. Courchesne et al. cited&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)60809-4/fulltext\"><u>Wakefield et al.\u2019s (2010)</u></a> meta-analysis showing that influence operations conducted in the health domain (e.g., diet change, exercise change, vaccination behavior) are more effective for episodic or one-time health behaviors than for habitual behaviors. For example, influence operations were more successful at increasing yearly cancer screening or vaccination behaviors than habitual behaviors like choosing to routinely consume different food, floss daily, or increase daily physical activity. Furthermore, Wakefield et al. identified that repeating the same influence operation had only a small effect on habitual behavior change, consistent with<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/health-behavior\">&nbsp;</a>some of the implications from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/health-behavior\"><u>Harris\u2019 (2020)</u></a> review of the research on health behavior change. This reifies that using the same influence repeatedly may reap few rewards for habits like flossing or switching to a plant-based diet.</li><li>Although Courchesne et al. intended to review interdisciplinary influence operations research, they implicitly took a predominantly international relations perspective. The implications are that influence operations are successful and dangerous, particularly in political and international arenas, and that decision makers need better anti-influence strategies informed by research.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Of the 82 articles, 74% were conducted in the real-world rather than in a contrived situation and 48% focused on influence operations that sought to change the balance of political power. Only 7% focused on influence operations intended to do good, meaning that 93% focused on control-oriented, harmful, or destructive outcomes. This could suggest that there are more real-world influence operations with destructive or destabilizing outcomes than real-world influence operations with prosocial or morally expansive outcomes.</p><p>These numbers could alternatively point to a<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1207/S15327957PSPR0504_2\">&nbsp;<u>negativity bias</u></a> within the extant research on influence operations, where influence operations are framed as threatening, negative, or unwanted influences that need to be combatted. One implication of this is that all social influence may be perceived as harmful; undermining&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15534510.2011.649890\"><u>the idea</u></a> that social influence is an inherent, long-existing element of human societies. Ignoring the neutral, positive or prosocial influence operations perpetuates a cycle of knowledge whereby social influence and influence operations are cast in a negative frame. This could limit the scope and productivity of research on social influence and influence operations.</p><p>More studies on influence operations with prosocial or morally expansive goals exist. Courchesne et al. acknowledged a robust literature on \u201c\u2018pro-social\u2019 influence campaigns\u201d in pro-environmental, health, and traditional political advertising. Additionally, a large body of social psychological research exists on strategies to change prejudiced attitudes and discriminatory behaviors. These strategies are not traditionally labeled as \u201cinfluence operations\u201d but they are similar to those included in many of the articles reviewed by Courchesne et al. I summarize some of this research in the next section.</p><h2>Additional Empirical Research</h2><p>Reducing prejudice and discrimination is one domain with substantial research on social influence and influence operations.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-071620-030619\"><u>Paluck et al. (2021)</u></a> reviewed empirical studies of a wide range of strategies to reduce prejudice and discrimination or increase prosocial attitudes and behaviors.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-016-9373-5\"><u>One</u></a> of the studies highlighted in this meta-analysis found that Twitter bots that sanctioned racist Twitter users led to fewer subsequent racist slurs over the two-month period of study when the Twitter bot posed as an ingroup White man with many followers compared to an ingroup White man with few followers or an outgroup Black man (regardless of number of followers). This study provided evidence for two mechanisms of social media influence to intentionally do good: ingroup membership and popularity.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/reducing-exclusionary-attitudes-through-interpersonal-conversation-evidence-from-three-field-experiments/4AA5B97806A4CAFBAB0651F5DAD8F223\"><u>Another</u></a> highlighted article found in three different experiments that providing arguments alongside a non-judgmental exchange of narratives during conversations compared to providing just arguments reduced exclusionary attitudes towards unauthorized immigrants and transgender people for up to four months.</p><p>Pro-environmental behavior is another domain in which there is substantial research.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2622\"><u>Clayton et al. (2015)</u></a> reviewed social scientific research on climate change and emphasized change strategies as one of three key research areas. For example, a<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2010.11.004\">&nbsp;<u>field experiment to influence energy reduction</u></a> in buildings on a university campus found that buildings where occupants received informative emails about their building\u2019s energy use showed 7% reduced energy use compared to buildings in a control condition where occupants received no feedback. Another condition where occupants of other buildings received training in energy reduction strategies showed a 4% reduction in energy use compared to the control condition buildings.</p><p>Health behavior is a third domain with substantial research on the effects of persuasive strategies. Of the 12 health domain articles included by Courchesne et al., four investigated vaccine uptake and five investigated COVID-19 behaviors. There is much research on influence operations to change other health behaviors like smoking, adopting a veg*n diet, and flossing. For example,</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/charities/mass-media-for-behavior-change\"><u>GiveWell</u></a> reviews organizations that use mass media to influence health behaviors in developing countries. The<a href=\"https://www.populationmedia.org/\">&nbsp;<u>Population Media Center</u></a> (PMC) and<a href=\"https://www.developmentmedia.net/\">&nbsp;<u>Development Media International</u></a> (DMI) are two organizations focused on improving health and wellbeing outcomes using influence operations. PMC documents the effects of narrative storytelling (e.g., TV soap operas, radio programs, web content) to encourage contraceptive use, family planning, and the education of girls and women in countries throughout the developing world. DMI uses mass media storytelling (mostly radio programming) to effect health and wellbeing outcomes like family planning, hygiene, early childhood development, and infectious disease prevention in sub-Saharan Africa.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>DMI published two articles with evidence on the effectiveness of a radio campaign in Burkina Faso.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(18)30004-4/fulltext\"><u>One</u></a> of these articles highlighted a cluster randomized trial testing the influence of a 32-month radio campaign about family behaviors compared to a no radio campaign on post neonatal under-5 child mortality. The radio program included short spots (i.e., 1 minute spots, 10 times a day) and longer interactive sessions (i.e., 2 hour sessions, 5 days per week) produced in the local language with several topics (e.g., promoting antenatal consultations with doctors, best breastfeeding practices, health-care seeking for illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia). The authors found no effect of radio campaign exposure compared to no exposure. Both groups showed decreasing mortality rates over the multiyear study. The<a href=\"https://gh.bmj.com/content/3/4/e000808\">&nbsp;<u>second article</u></a> examined the impact of the same radio campaign on actual healthcare visits for reasons targeted by the campaign (e.g., antenatal care visits, under-5 care visits). The authors found under-5 consultations for illness increased across the years for those in the campaign compared to those not in the campaign (malaria: between 35-56%; lower respiratory infections: between 11-39%; diarrhea: 60-107%).</p><ol><li><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2014.08.035\"><u>Cruwys et al. (2015)</u></a> reviewed experimental studies of social influence in eating behavior and found that the social modeling of eating behavior was effective in 64 out of 69 reviewed studies.<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666313000494\"> For example,&nbsp;<u>one</u></a> of the reviewed studies found that exposure to a message conveying a descriptive norm about healthy eating choices resulted in increased healthy eating reports compared to a message conveying a descriptive norm about unhealthy eating or no message.</li><li><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1009597026437\"><u>Xiaoming et al. (2000)</u></a> employed a RCT in semirural China and found that 18-30 year olds randomly assigned to either a 12-month multifaceted AIDS education campaign (i.e., educational text, videos, radio programs, small group discussions, home visits, individual counseling, and a free supply of condoms) or a control condition with no systematic exposure to educational materials found that those who received the campaign materials reported more knowledge of AIDS, more condom use after the campaign than before, and a greater use of condoms as their primary birth control device. Those who were not exposed to the influence operation showed no changes.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666321001847\"><u>Mathur et al. (2021)</u></a> reviewed 100 studies that used individual messaging to influence meat consumption attitudes and behaviors. They found that these influence operations have a meaningful effect on the reduction of meat consumption and intentions to purchase meat products. The<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1747-0080.2010.01446.x\">&nbsp;<u>chronologically first study</u></a> included in this meta-analysis found that 9-10 year old girls who watched an episode of&nbsp;<i>The Simpsons</i> promoting vegetarianism were less positive towards eating meat, more knowledgeable about nutrition, and intended to eat less meat following the episode than girls the same age who did not watch the episode.</li></ol><p><i>Note. There is research on influence operations in&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/puar.13109\"><i><u>public policy</u></i></a><i>,&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/arcp.1059\"><i><u>consumer advertising</u></i></a><i>, and&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320721003086\"><i><u>biological conservation</u></i></a><i> that I have not accounted for here.

(2015)</u></i></a><i> found that negative argumentative and negative subjective comments on Facebook increased opposition to marijuana legalization compared to a control group that saw no comments. There was no effect of positive comments (whether argumentative or subjective) compared to the control group.</i></p><h1>Future Directions</h1><p>Of the research reviewed here, most studies found that influence operations are effective in producing some degree of intended change. This is consistent with<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15534510.2011.649890\">&nbsp;<u>the idea</u></a> that social influence has been an important lever of change throughout human history.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this research has notable limitations. The reviewed articles paint a rosier picture of the effectiveness of influence operations, whether as destructive forces that need to be combatted or as prosocial forces that can be capitalized on, than may be the reality of large-scale organizational strategies. The reviewed studies cover individual and institutional levels of influence operation strategies and effects, mixing foundational knowledge about social influence at different levels. This comprehensive coverage could be beneficial in broadening our understanding of how social influence mechanisms explain influence operations. It could also be detrimental if there are different mechanisms underpinning successful individual-level and institutional-level change.</p><p>To address these, and other limitations, researchers could implement the following strategies:</p><ol><li>Assess publication bias in the existing literature</li><li>Craft and implement interdisciplinary standards to reduce publication bias</li><li>Conduct meta-analyses on the existing literature</li><li>Synthesize from the existing empirical results to identify promising pathways for future research</li><li>Conduct future object-level research&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Future focus on the following topics would help to build the science of mass media, propaganda, and social influence:</p><ol><li>Systematic evaluation of epistemological assumptions<ol><li>that there is a meaningful difference between large-scale governmental influence operations framed as information warfare within and between countries and individual-level social influences and intentional strategies aimed at changing individuals\u2019 pro-environmental, health, social, political, and consumer behavior.</li><li>that we can make meaningful systemic change with mass media or propaganda targeted at individuals.</li><li>that we can detect macro- or institutional-level change from studies of individual-level or aggregated individual-level attitudes and behaviors.</li><li>about the differences between influence operations used for social good and influence operations used for destruction or control of power.</li><li>about how we perceive and evaluate social influence, particularly any misperceptions or global evaluations of all social influence or influence operations as harmful.</li><li>about our evidence-informed or intuitive confidence in<ol><li>our understanding of the social influence mechanisms underpinning influence operations and how these scale up for deployment in large-scale organized mass media approaches.</li><li>the impactfulness and commonness of harmful influence operations (e.g., How sure are we that an influence operation is worth the resources to combat?).</li><li>the implementation of impactful strategies (e.g., How sure are we that an influence operation or anti-influence intervention is effective at the scale and context it\u2019s employed in?).</li><li>the necessity of resisting certain operations (e.g., How tractable is it to resist?

It includes tracking things like:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Are we staying on topic?&nbsp;</li><li>Is everyone getting a chance to contribute?&nbsp;</li><li>Is the discussion productive?&nbsp;</li><li>Should we table this topic for a later time (or a smaller group)?&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This alone is often a full-time job. But it's only the beginning. A good facilitator must also:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Track time.</strong> A calendar invite is a promise: <i>for one hour of your time, we will have a valuable discussion on something you care about</i>. One of the most common failure modes for a meeting is running over time. This isn't always a big deal; sometimes all your participants are highly engaged in a discussion, get consistent value and/or entertainment from it, and don't have any backend commitments. But the larger a meeting, the less likely it is that these conditions obtain, and the more important it becomes to <i>respect your participants' time</i>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Take notes.</strong> Track what's been said. Main ideas; points and counterpoints; valuable tools and viable paths. Publish a clear and legible summary after the meeting.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Track follow-ups</strong>. The magic phrase is: \"<strong>Who </strong>will do <strong>what </strong>by <strong>when</strong>?\"</li><li><strong>Iterate and improve</strong>. Solicit, receive, sort, and implement feedback. Make incremental changes. Depending on the meeting, one might even offer feedback to participants. Especially important for recurring meetings.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This is a <i>lot</i> for one person to manage. Even highly experienced facilitators typically drop the ball on <i>something;</i> I've seen it happen a dozen times.&nbsp;</p><p>If only there were <i>some way</i> we could do all these things at once!&nbsp;</p><p>Well, I have good news: we can. It's time to call in...&nbsp;</p><h2>The M Team</h2><p>This section owes thanks to Toastmasters International, whose concept of <a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org/membership/club-meeting-roles\">meeting roles</a> I have shamelessly appropriated.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Timer</h3><p>Calm. Collected. Punctual. Wears a monocle and carries a fancy pocketwatch on a gold chain. Has one job and does it well.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Protect participants' time</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>The Timer is not forceful, insistent, or demanding. They do not need to be, because when they whisper, you listen. Their domain is the gentle nudge. They claim your attention with a mere two words. <i>Five minutes.</i> Your time is almost up; take heed.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Role</strong>: Watch the schedule and the clock. <i>Gently but firmly </i>indicate to the facilitator (and/or speaker) when a timed segment is ending.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefma6wrleocla\"><sup><a href=\"#fnma6wrleocla\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><h3>The Archivist</h3><p>Some are meticulous, fastidious, detail-driven. Others are hands-on, swashbuckling, quick-and-dirty. But they all share one thing in common: nothing of consequence escapes their notice. In the award-winning TV drama inspired by your work, they are the one who <i>knows things</i>. And in the final act, when your back's to the wall, it will be they who reminds you what you're here to accomplish, and how far you've come since the beginning.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Role</strong>: Write down <i>key points</i> and <i>follow-ups</i>. They don't actually need to track every word, just the main topics and insights discussed. Optionally, clean up and share the notes with the group after the event.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref477vmnsxkaz\"><sup><a href=\"#fn477vmnsxkaz\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><h3>The Evaluator</h3><p>In a courtroom drama, they are Judge and Jury. In a survival epic, they are merciless Mother Nature. In the arts drama, they are the Critics. They are the First and the Last, the Rose and the Thorn, the Yin and the Yang. They are the Karma, the Kaizen, the Sixth Sigma. They are Judgment Day. When they arrive, will you be ready?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Role</strong>: Throughout the meeting, notice what's going well or poorly. Make a note. Tell the facilitator at the end.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrmwzjcrifvj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrmwzjcrifvj\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Secret Bonus Role</strong>: Also provide feedback to keynote speakers, presenters, debaters, and/or organizers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Secret Bonus Role #2</strong>: Pay attention in the next meeting. Were past suggestions implemented? What seems hardest to improve?&nbsp;</p><h2>You don't have to go it alone</h2><h3>Why delegate?&nbsp;</h3><p>Running a meeting includes a lot of small tasks. Each one is easy, but juggling them all can be hard for even the most experienced facilitator to manage. Especially if, like me, you're the sort of person who gets <i>very very focused</i> <i>on one thing at a time</i>. Delegating some of these small tasks to participants can make your job easier.&nbsp;</p><p>\"But Joe,\" I hear you say, \"that would be <i>selfish </i>of me! I don't want to <i>presume</i>...\"</p><p><i>Hogwash</i>, I tell you. <i>Hogwash</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, many people actually benefit from having a minor role in a meeting. It helps keep them focused and involved even when they're not talking, and it makes them feel useful - not in any manipulative way, but because they <i>are</i> being useful.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, your primary obligation as a facilitator is to <i>help the participants accomplish their goals</i>. This means giving them a smooth discussion with minimal distractions, interruptions, or errors. If you can't simultaneously juggle four or five distinct roles to perfection - and <a href=\"https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Human_multitasking#/The_brain's_role\">I assure you that you can't</a> - then you should be willing to recruit participants to assist. It's <i>their </i>meeting, after all.&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, you'll often find that many people are delighted to volunteer for a meeting role.&nbsp;</p><p>And finally, you don't need anyone's permission to do your job. If they didn't want you making decisions about how their meeting is run, they wouldn't have asked you to facilitate in the first place.&nbsp;</p><h3>What are the downsides of delegating?&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>Not everyone knows how to take good notes, especially on technical topics.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrstp9wy48n\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrstp9wy48n\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</li><li>Sometimes people drop the ball.&nbsp;</li><li>It might distract participants from the discussion at hand.&nbsp;</li><li>You're still ultimately responsible for making sure the meeting goes well.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>So when should I delegate tasks?&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>You have enough participants to justify splitting duties (typically 4 or more).&nbsp;</li><li>You are willing to trust your participants with at least one of the above tasks.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefccget3c3sfa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnccget3c3sfa\">[6]</a></sup></span></li><li>Your participants either volunteer for roles or agree that role assignments are part of the meeting.&nbsp;</li><li>You aren't assigning roles to keynote speakers or others who already have significant duties, e.g. a Master of Ceremonies or The One Who Fixes PowerPoint.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><i>Especially </i>delegate if you plan to actively contribute to the discussion, rather than acting only as a guide.&nbsp;</p><h3>How do I delegate well?</h3><p>First, make sure your prep work is done (a subject for another post). Then explain the system to your participants. Link this post if you'd like.&nbsp;</p><p>Either ask for volunteers or announce how you'll be assigning roles. If you do the second thing, make sure everyone is OK with the idea before announcing specific assignments.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, look for ways to adapt these roles to your needs. Maybe you are teaching people speaking skills and want multiple Evaluators, maybe you need a dedicated specialist on call for IT problems, maybe you want to split roles for a particularly long meeting. You may even want to offload some pre- or post-meeting work if your facilitation load is unusually high. Meeting roles and prep work are both good ways for budding facilitators to practice.&nbsp;</p><p>Whatever your needs, if you find yourself dedicating a lot of your time to a particularly demanding task, it may be worth delegating.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, spaketh Joe, go forth and delegate.&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnpn55qotjo4d\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefpn55qotjo4d\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>For example, the meeting runs over time and someone has to leave.&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnma6wrleocla\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefma6wrleocla\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>If they want to cheat, they can set an actual timer for 5 minutes before the segment ends.&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn477vmnsxkaz\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref477vmnsxkaz\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The facilitator could do this bit instead.&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnrmwzjcrifvj\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefrmwzjcrifvj\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This part can be public or private.

However, in the current implementation for professional programs, all participants are always set to have ability level 1 (average relative to the ML research community).&nbsp;</p><p>This agnostic stance is (somewhat) in contrast to the stance taken in our post covering <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zYSAFtjasxsfm3nmh/cost-effectiveness-of-student-programs-for-ai-safety\">student programs</a>. We think it is reasonable to expect the ability of marginal participants to be constant for programs that are not selective (such as the programs considered in this post, and unlike some student programs).</p><p>Separate from their ability, participants might work on varying research avenues that we value differently.</p><p>For a sense of how we operationalize these differences, consider research avenue relevance among participants of the TDC<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpiazom3vhn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpiazom3vhn\">[5]</a></sup></span>. During the time participants spent working on the TDC, all contenders were working on trojans research, which we consider to be 10x more relevant than adversarial robustness research. We believe that, before the program, scientists, professors, and Ph.D. students are 50% likely to be working on trojans research relevant to the TDC, and 50% likely to be working on research avenues that we judge to be 10x less relevant than adversarial robustness. Then, on average, participants produce research with relevance 5.05. After the program, 2% of research done by scientists, professors, and PhD students is shifted towards trojans work relevant to the TDC, leading to research relevance of 5.15. (You could think of this difference as coming from all participants switching research avenues by some very small amount, or some very small number of participants switching research avenues entirely, or some combination of these possibilities.)</p><p>The research avenue relevance of each participant in each program over time is specified as follows:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7kFPFYQSY7ZttoveS/xwzjk96vsz5uys3sm1xj\"></p><p>The shaded area indicates research avenue relevance for the average participant with (solid line) and without (dashed line) the program.</p><p>Notice the vertical changes for contenders in the TDC and NeurIPS Workshop. Zooming into the 2 weeks following the start of the program, we see that these changes consist of a very short period in which participants are working directly towards the program, before a many-year period in which they adopt a very slightly different research portfolio.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7kFPFYQSY7ZttoveS/c6h9vokkxjknkojzri50\"></p><p>Relevance starts high for the TDC because contenders are compelled to work on relevant Trojans research in order to enter. After this period, we expect the research avenues pursued by scientists, professors, and PhD students to shift very slightly closer towards research avenues of interest to CAIS. Off-chart, engineers do not shift their research following the program.</p><p>In the case of the NeurIPS Workshop, we do not expect contenders to work on research avenues that are significantly more relevant than they might have otherwise during the time they spend directly working towards the workshop. But we do expect a similar effect on the relevance of their research beyond the workshop. In particular, CAIS gave awards to researchers who wrote an existential risk analysis in the appendix of their paper. We think it is plausible that this scheme \u2014 in combination with the more typical ways in which future research might be influenced by engaging with a workshop \u2014 caused a small expected shift in contenders\u2019 future research avenue relevance.</p><p>For attendees of both the NeurIPS Workshop and NeurIPS Social, we expect a very slight shift in research avenues, in the direction of those avenues most relevant to CAIS.</p><p>Taking the product between time spent on research and research avenue relevance, we obtain QARYs per scientist-equivalent participant as a function of time.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7kFPFYQSY7ZttoveS/wmhedxtj3kpe8w27u3nr\"></p><p>The (difficult-to-see) shaded area in the bottom row equals QARYs per scientist-equivalent participant for each program.

This is not surprising: the long-term counterfactual effect is believed to be similar, around 0.05-0.1x the relevance of adversarial robustness. The NeurIPS Social gets a slightly smaller boost from having a slightly smaller counterfactual effect, whilst the TDC gets a slightly larger boost due to the large change in research avenue relevance during the program.</p><h3>Productivity, staying in AI research, and time discounting</h3><p>Researchers' productivity can vary throughout their careers.

The change in topic has two effects: work during the prize is 100x more relevant than analogous work on adversarial robustness, and 2% of contenders shift to a 100x research avenue following their work on the prize. (The research avenue relevance of trojans was 10x adversarial robustness, with the same proportion of research shifting.) The \u201ccheaper workshop\u201d is identical to the NeurIPS ML Safety Workshop, except with $75k less award funding.</p><p>\"Scientist Trojans\" and \"PhD Trojans\" are hypothetical programs, wherein a research scientist or a PhD student is funded for 1 or 5 years, respectively. This funding causes the scientist or PhD student to work on trojans research (a 10x research avenue) rather than a research avenue that CAIS considers to have limited relevance to AI safety (0x). Unlike participants considered previously in this post, the scientist or PhD student has ability 10x the ML research community average. The benefits of these programs cease after the funding period.</p><p>The cost-effectiveness of the NeurIPS ML Safety Social is estimated to be nearly 10x greater than that of the NeurIPS ML Safety Workshop, which in turn is nearly 10x more cost-effective than the Trojan Detection Challenge. We do not conclude from this that workshop and prize programs are not worthwhile as part of our portfolio of programs. Intuitively, socials scale much less well than workshops and prizes. Further, the estimates for a hypothetical cheaper workshop and power aversion prize imply that straightforward changes to workshop and prize programs might result in much greater cost-effectiveness.</p><p>All of the professional field-building programs are estimated to be more cost-effective than the baseline programs. What factors contribute to this gap between professional and baseline programs?</p><p>Cost per participant is the most important factor \u2014 coming in at approximately $300, $15, and $200 for the TDC, NeurIPS Social, and NeurIPS Workshop respectively, compared with $500,000 and $250,000 for the baseline programs.</p><p>Smaller factors favoring the professional programs we considered include the benefits of professional programs being spread out over many more years and, in the case of the NeurIPS Social and NeurIPS Workshop, the greater level of scientist-equivalence per participant (due to the high proportion of participants who are professors).</p><p>Of course, there are powerful offsetting factors. The baseline programs\u2019 treatment effect on research avenue relevance is assumed to be around 100x as large as the largest effect among the TDC, NeurIPS Social, and NeurIPS Workshop, and ability is assumed to be 10x greater.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, while it did not feature prominently in this post, note that research avenue relevance could have had a very large effect on cost-effectiveness differences between the TDC, NeurIPS Social, and NeurIPS Workshop (see the robustness to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7kFPFYQSY7ZttoveS/cost-effectiveness-of-professional-field-building-programs#Research_avenue_relevance\"><u>research avenue relevance</u></a> section). This suggests the importance of tracking research avenue differences before and after the program, and of accountability mechanisms as a lever for affecting these differences. It also underscores the importance of focusing prizes on the most important research avenues \u2014 shifting the hypothetical prize towards a 100x rather than 10x research avenue leads to 10x greater benefits.</p><h1>Scalability and robustness</h1><h2>Scalability</h2><p>So far, we've considered a single budget for each program. We might instead be interested in running these programs at a higher or lower cost, with correspondingly different benefits.</p><p>In the model, benefit is linked to cost by having higher variable costs lead to a larger number of participants<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzmlj18hti4n\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzmlj18hti4n\">[7]</a></sup></span>. Three deep parameters control these \u2018scaling\u2019 functions: a curvature parameter, and slope and intercept parameters to transform something like utility to the number of entries or attendees. These parameters are (very informally) calibrated to match survey answers about the number of participants given the default budget, and to match intuition in other cases. Clearly, this is a tricky exercise; you should treat these functions (and therefore estimates of benefit beyond the default case) with healthy skepticism.</p><p>Given the scaling parameters we use, the expected number of participants as a function of budget looks as follows:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7kFPFYQSY7ZttoveS/zyw73lsvpffrchc3tf6e\"></p><p>The scaling functions lead to the following expected benefit and cost-effectiveness estimates as a function of budget:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7kFPFYQSY7ZttoveS/ggwnpcpnqu5v3n0rfmf3\"></p><p>This plot complicates our earlier results using only default budgets.</p><p>For instance, although the NeurIPS Social was estimated to be the most cost-effective program at default budgets, it does not scale as well as the NeurIPS Workshop. (Nor would it scale as well as the hypothetical power aversion prize.) The implication is that, if our goal is to maximize cost-effectiveness with access to a sizable budget and only these programs, we would probably want to pursue multiple programs simultaneously<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkfl9w8vvg1\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkfl9w8vvg1\">[8]</a></sup></span>.</p><h2>Robustness</h2><h3>Research discount rate</h3><p>We saw earlier that the research discount rate \u2013 the degree to which a research year starting next year is less valuable than one starting now \u2013 had an especially large effect on (absolute) cost-effectiveness estimates.</p><p>For purposes of this post, research one year from now is considered to be 20% less valuable than research today. The justification for this figure begins with the observation that, in ML, research subfields often begin their growth in an exponential fashion. This means that research topics are often dramatically more neglected in earlier stages (i.e. good research is much more counterfactually impactful), and that those who are early can have an outsized impact in influencing the direction of the field \u2014 imagine a field of 3 researchers vs. one of 300 researchers. If, for instance, mechanistic interpretability arose as a research agenda one year earlier than it did, it seems reasonable to imagine that the field would have 20% more researchers than it currently does. In fact, we think that these forces are powerful enough to make a discount rate of 30% seem plausible. (Shorter timelines would also be a force in this direction.)</p><p>This view does not reflect a consensus. Others might argue that the most impactful safety work requires access to more advanced models and conceptual frameworks, which will only be available in the future<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref174jgyl8br6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn174jgyl8br6\">[9]</a></sup></span>.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7kFPFYQSY7ZttoveS/ukxxbc65tfenppjgz4gt\"></p><p>The plot above shows how cost-effectiveness changes with the research discount rate. 0.2 is our default; negative values represent a preference for research conducted in the future.</p><p>For the programs considered in this post, research time discounting strongly affects conclusions about absolute impact, but does not affect conclusions about relative impact.</p><p>It is hardly surprising that the research discount rate does not affect the relative impact of professional field-building programs: these are all programs that aim to affect research starting immediately. Relative cost-effectiveness might be less robust when comparing professional programs with student programs \u2014 where the trade-off between the malleability of research interests and timing of research is starker \u2014 for different values of the research discount rate. (The research discount rate section of our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ykqh8ku7NHN9CGkdC/modeling-the-impact-of-ai-safety-field-building-programs#Possible_crux__research_discount_rate\"><u>introduction post</u></a> explores this comparison.)</p><h3>Research avenue relevance</h3><p>Consider this illustrative scenario. All participants begin the programs considered above pursuing research avenues that CAIS considers to have limited relevance to AI safety (0x adversarial robustness). For programs with an award component, contenders pursue research avenues that are 10x as relevant as adversarial robustness during their direct involvement in the program. For all programs, once the program ends, participants shift from research avenues with 0x relevance to research avenues with 10x relevance with some probability. (This could also be viewed as a proportion of research being redirected towards more relevant avenues.)</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7kFPFYQSY7ZttoveS/dcaa6fybi0ob30i8csh1\"></p><p>The above plot shows how program benefit and cost-effectiveness vary in response to changes in the probability that different types of participants alter their research avenues (with other participant types remaining unchanged).</p><p>Notice that differences in research avenue relevance matter a&nbsp;<i>lot</i> for program outcomes. Two alternative, plausible views on research avenue relevance could imply more than 3 orders of magnitude difference in final impact.

This funding causes the scientist or PhD student to work on trojans research (a research avenue that CAIS believes is 10x the relevance of adversarial robustness) rather than a research avenue that CAIS considers to have limited relevance to AI safety (0x). Unlike participants considered previously in this post, the scientist or PhD student has ability 10x the ML research community average \u2014 akin to assuming that the program reliably selects unusually productive researchers. The benefits of these programs cease after the funding period.</p><p>The Student Group and Undergraduate Stipends programs are competitive with programs that fund researchers directly. However, Atlas and MLSS lag behind in terms of cost-effectiveness.</p><p>What factors contribute to this pattern across student programs?&nbsp;</p><p>There is no single explanatory factor. A lower cost per participant mechanically increases cost-effectiveness. Having a greater expected number of professional researchers among participants (via improved pipeline probabilities, or a larger fraction of participants who are currently PhD students) naturally multiplies the quantity of future research produced as a result of the program. Similarly, participant ability and research avenue relevance multiply the quality of future research.</p><p>Despite its strengths in some areas, the Atlas Fellowship\u2019s very high cost per participant brought down its overall cost-effectiveness. MLSS was most affected by the relatively small change it caused to the relevance of participants\u2019 future research. The Student Group benefited from having a larger number of participants (per cost), and from involving PhD students. And Undergraduate Stipends performed well across all areas.</p><h1>Robustness</h1><h2>Research discount rate</h2><p>We saw earlier that the research discount rate \u2013 the degree to which a research year starting next year is less valuable than one starting now \u2013 had an especially large effect on (absolute) cost-effectiveness estimates.</p><p>For purposes of this post, research one year from now is considered to be 20% less valuable than research today. The justification for this figure begins with the observation that, in ML, research subfields often begin their growth in an exponential fashion. This means that research topics are often dramatically more neglected in earlier stages (i.e. good research is much more counterfactually impactful), and that those who are early can have an outsized impact in influencing the direction of the field \u2014 imagine a field of 3 researchers vs. one of 300 researchers. If, for instance, mechanistic interpretability arose as a research agenda one year earlier than it did, it seems reasonable to imagine that the field would have 20% more researchers than it currently does. In fact, we think that these forces are powerful enough to make a discount rate of 30% seem plausible. (Shorter timelines would also be a force in this direction.)</p><p>This view does not reflect a consensus. Others might argue that the most impactful safety work requires access to more advanced models and conceptual frameworks, which will only be available in the future<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw289hw7ylfa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw289hw7ylfa\">[10]</a></sup></span>.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zYSAFtjasxsfm3nmh/gsoipfmtc4ncbnx2khwf\"></p><p>The plot above shows how cost-effectiveness changes with the research discount rate. 0.2 is our default; negative values represent a preference for research conducted in the future.</p><p>For the programs considered in this post, research time discounting strongly affects conclusions about absolute impact, but typically does not significantly affect conclusions about relative impact. The one exception is the Student Group, which is the first-ranked program assuming very high discount rates and the joint-last-ranked program assuming very low discount rates.</p><p>It is hardly surprising that the research discount rate does not typically affect the relative impact of student field-building programs: these are all programs that aim to produce researchers at an approximately similar point in time. Neither is it surprising that the Student Group performs relatively better when assuming high discount rates (perhaps corresponding to very short timelines). If research feels more urgent, programs with older students are a better bet, because older students are likely to produce research sooner. (For similar reasons, relative cost-effectiveness might be less robust when comparing professional programs with student programs. The research discount rate section of our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ykqh8ku7NHN9CGkdC/modeling-the-impact-of-ai-safety-field-building-programs#Possible_crux__research_discount_rate\"><u>introduction post</u></a> explores this comparison.)</p><h2>Research avenue relevance</h2><p>Consider this illustrative scenario. All participants begin the programs considered above pursuing research avenues that CAIS considers to have limited relevance to AI safety (0x adversarial robustness). Once a program ends, participants shift from research avenues with 0x relevance to research avenues with 100x relevance with some probability.

At the same time, however, we expect that few do this in practice, in part because evaluating the cost-effectiveness of AI safety programs might be more challenging than evaluating global development or animal welfare programs. This section justifies our belief that using explicit models for AI safety is worthwhile in practice.&nbsp;</p><p>We see two core benefits:</p><ol><li>Enhanced strategic decision-making, for CAIS as well as other organizations.</li><li>Improved communication between organizations.</li></ol><p>When making strategic decisions, we are often interested in questions such as:</p><ol><li>What assumptions does our view on the impact of program X depend on?</li><li>Which information is most important for us to learn about program X?</li><li>At what scale should we operate program X?</li><li>How should we make allocation decisions between programs?</li></ol><p>The first benefit \u2014 enhanced strategic decision-making \u2014 is realized if models help us to reason through questions like these.</p><p>The second benefit of using explicit models \u2014 improved communication between organizations \u2014 is realized if models help illuminate disagreements' cruxes and their significance. See the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ykqh8ku7NHN9CGkdC/modeling-the-impact-of-ai-safety-field-building-programs#Possible_crux__research_discount_rate\">analysis of preferences for current versus future research</a> later in this post for an example of this benefit in action.</p><p>Of course, explicit models are not without limitations. Models might not answer the right questions, contain conceptual or implementation errors, or risk their outputs being taken too literally. Most importantly, explicit models are inherently reductionist, ignoring factors that might be crucial in practice, including (but not limited to) interactions between programs, threshold effects, diffuse effects, and learning benefits. That said, we believe that explicit models can be quite useful to the AI safety field if we keep these limitations in mind.</p><h1>What we model: QARYs</h1><h2>Definitions</h2><p>Our key metric is the&nbsp;<strong>Quality-Adjusted Research Year (QARY)</strong>. We define a QARY as:</p><ol><li><i>A year of research labor (40 hours * 50 weeks),</i></li><li><i>Conducted by a research scientist (other researcher types will be inflated or deflated),</i></li><li><i>Of average ability relative to the ML research community (other cohorts will be inflated or deflated),</i></li><li><i>Working on a research avenue as relevant as adversarial robustness (alternative research avenues will be inflated or deflated),</i></li><li><i>Working at their peak productivity (earlier-in-career research will be discounted),</i></li><li><i>Conducting all of their research in the present (later-in-time research will be time discounted),</i></li><li><i>Who stays in the AI profession (later-in-time research will be discounted by the probability that the researcher switches).</i></li></ol><p>In order to operationalize the QARY, we need some way of defining weights for different researcher types, researcher abilities, and the relevance of different research avenues.</p><p>We define the \u2018<strong>scientist-equivalence</strong>\u2019 of a researcher type as the rate at which we would trade off an hour of labor from this researcher type with an hour of otherwise-similar labor from a research scientist.</p><p>Similarly, the \u2018<strong>ability</strong>\u2019 level of a researcher is the rate at which we would trade off an hour of labor from a researcher of this ability level with an hour of otherwise-similar labor from a researcher of ability level 1.</p><p>Finally, the \u2018<strong>relevance</strong>\u2019 of a research avenue is the rate at which we would trade off an hour of labor from a researcher pursuing this avenue with an hour of otherwise-similar labor from a researcher pursuing adversarial robustness research.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>benefit</strong> of the program is given by the difference between expected QARYs with and without the program. (QARYs with or without the program could be further decomposed as QARYs per scientist-equivalent participant of some participant type, multiplied by the number of scientist-equivalents of that participant type, summed across participant types.)</p><p><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong> is calculated by dividing this benefit by the expected cost in millions of US dollars.</p><p>Example calculations using these definitions can be found in our posts evaluating field-building programs for <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zYSAFtjasxsfm3nmh/cost-effectiveness-of-student-programs-for-ai-safety\">students</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7kFPFYQSY7ZttoveS/cost-effectiveness-of-professional-field-building-programs\">professionals</a> respectively.</p><h2>Benefits and limitations</h2><p>QARYs offer three major advantages:</p><ol><li>They provide a comparative measure across different programs.</li><li>They decompose into components that are straightforward to inform empirically.</li><li>They enable shorter feedback loops.</li></ol><p>These benefits are all considered&nbsp;<i>relative to estimating terminal outcomes</i>. Estimating program impact in x-risk basis points would certainly aid comparability, but at the cost of requiring strong assumptions about how exposure to good outcomes (something like QARYs) translates into better terminal outcomes. Relatedly, components of the QARY framework \u2014 how many researchers we might affect, which research avenues they will work on, and so on \u2014 are easier to inform empirically. And these components are easier to affect, enabling shorter feedback loops.</p><p>Still, QARYs have important limitations, the very most important of which is that QARYs are narrowly focused on researchers and programs that produce research.</p><p>In the QARY framework, any labor from politicians, lobbyists, or military leaders is implicitly not valued.</p><p>Even for research-centric programs, the QARY framework might not be ideal. For example, when evaluating research labs, one might be more interested in metrics that engage more directly with research outputs, such as high-impact citations.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, these limitations can be partially addressed. We could model the influence of QARYs on more downstream outcomes, such as high-impact citations or even x-risk basis points, then compare different categories of programs by downstream impact. Or we could at least&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nunosempere.com/blog/2023/04/25/worldview-diversification/\"><u>avoid inconsistent priorities by specifying a fixed exchange rate</u></a> between QARYs and other goods.</p><h1>How to use models yourself</h1><p>The full code for this project is in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/centerforaisafety/AIS-cost-effectiveness/tree/main\"><u>this repository</u></a>.

These caveats include:</p><ol><li>Different programs might perform relatively better or worse at different scales of budget (a fact which is obscured above, with one budget presented per program). For example, although a low-cost social might be more cost-effective than a low-cost prize, the opposite might be true for high-cost implementations of these programs.</li><li>Since the QARYs framework focuses on benefits for technical AI safety research exclusively, we will not account for other benefits of programs with broader objectives, such as the Atlas Fellowship.&nbsp;</li><li>The parameter values are currently based on CAIS\u2019 worldview: for instance, the research discount rate (discussed below), the research ability of participants, and the relevance of different research avenues. Other organizations may disagree and have different values for these parameters.</li></ol><h2>Possible crux: research discount rate</h2><p>The evaluation posts each consider programs that affect research at a similar point in time: student programs, which aim to influence future research, or professional programs, which aim to influence research today. A possible crux for whether targeting students tends to be more cost-effective than targeting professionals (or vice versa) is one\u2019s preference for current versus future research.</p><p>In the QARYs framework, this preference is described by the&nbsp;<strong>research discount rate</strong>, defined as the degree to which we value a research year beginning next year less than a research year beginning today.</p><p>In this model, we consider research one year from now to be 20% less valuable than research today. The justification for this figure begins with the observation that, in ML, research subfields often begin their growth in an exponential fashion. This means that research topics are often dramatically more neglected in earlier stages (i.e. good research is much more counterfactually impactful), and that those who are early can have an outsized impact in influencing the direction of the field \u2014 imagine a field of 3 researchers vs. one of 300 researchers. If, for instance, mechanistic interpretability arose as a research agenda one year earlier than it did, it seems reasonable to imagine that the field would have 20% more researchers than it currently does. In fact, we think that these forces are powerful enough to make a discount rate of 30% seem plausible. (Shorter timelines would also be a force in this direction.)</p><p>This view does not reflect a consensus. Others might argue that the most impactful safety work requires access to more advanced models and conceptual frameworks, which will only be available in the future<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0e8dp7t7201b\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0e8dp7t7201b\">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>To illustrate the difference this parameter could make, consider someone who believes that research one year from now is 20%&nbsp;<i>more</i> valuable than research today. This person would be indifferent between 1 research year today and 0.23 research years in 8 years time \u2014 approximately the point in time at which rising juniors would finish a PhD \u2014 whereas this model would be indifferent between 1 research year today and 6 research years in 8 years time.</p><p>The plot below compares the cost-effectiveness of student programs with that of professional programs for different values of the research discount rate. 0.2 is our default; negative values represent a preference for research conducted in the future.

(This disparity is due to Atlas having younger participants, and the Student Group having older participants, compared to MLSS and Undergraduate Stipends.)</li><li>For very low discount rates, Undergraduate Stipends emerges as the best-performing program.</li></ol><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p>Thank you to:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Dan Hendrycks and Oliver Zhang for high-level guidance,</li><li>Aron Lajko for excellent research assistance,&nbsp;</li><li>Miti Saksena, Steven Basart, and Aidan O\u2019Gara for feedback, and</li><li>The Quantified Uncertainty Research Institute team for creating&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.squiggle-language.com/\"><u>squiggle</u></a> \u2014 in particular, to Nuno Sempere and Sam Nolan for early hand-holding \u2014 and to Peter Wildeford for creating&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/squigglepy\"><u>squigglepy</u></a>.</li></ol><h1>Footnotes</h1><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn0e8dp7t7201b\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref0e8dp7t7201b\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The extent to which current research will apply to more advanced models is a useful topic of discussion.

The preference for reducing suffering is one example of a preference that seems particularly likely to be unadapted and selected against. It forces the suffering-concerned agents to make trade-offs between preventing suffering and increasing their ability to create more of what they value. Meanwhile, those who don\u2019t care about suffering don\u2019t face this trade-off and can focus on optimizing for what they value without worrying about the suffering they might (in)directly cause.

While the PUs can happily spread without fearing any downside, the HVs would want to spend some time and resources thinking about how to avoid causing too much suffering while colonizing space (and about whether it\u2019s worth colonizing at all), since suffering would hurt their total utility. This means, according to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xdKnfQKLyYQfeErSr/the-grabby-values-selection-thesis-what-values-do-space\"><i><u>Grabby Values Selection Thesis</u></i></a>, that we should \u2013 all else equal \u2013 expect PU-ish values to be selected over HV-ish values in the space colonization race.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqy4sqavsizl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqy4sqavsizl\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Obviously, if there were values prioritizing suffering reduction more than the HVs, these would be selected against even more strongly.

The heavier it is, the harder it is for you to win the race. The situation PUs and the HVs are in, in my story, is analogous to the situation the AI capability and AI safety people are currently in, in the real world.</p><p>This UCC selection effect can occur both within a civilization (intra-civ; where HVs and PUs are part of the same civilization) and in between different civs (inter-civ selection; where HVs and PUs are competing civilizations).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm4tmv9tt9fg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm4tmv9tt9fg\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Addressing obvious objections</h2><p><i>(Mostly relevant to the inter-civ context)&nbsp;<strong>But why don\u2019t the suffering-concerned agents simply prioritize colonizing space and actually think about how to best maximize their utility function later, in order not to lose the race against the PUs?&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>This is what&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xdKnfQKLyYQfeErSr/the-grabby-values-selection-thesis-what-values-do-space\"><u>my previous post</u></a> refers to as the&nbsp;<i><strong>convergent preemptive colonization</strong></i>&nbsp;<i><strong>argument</strong></i>. We'll see that this argument does not apply well to our present example.<i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i>(See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2012/09/spreading-happiness-to-stars-seems.html\"><u>Shulman 2012</u></a> for an example in which the argument works better.) It, indeed, seems like the HVs could postpone some actions like thinking about how to create happy minds without requiring some non-trivial&nbsp;<a href=\"https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/research/a-typology-of-s-risks/#Incidental_s-risks\"><u>incidental suffering</u></a>, and therefore the action of eventually doing it. However, \u2026</p><ul><li>this, of course, conditions on them being patient enough.&nbsp;</li><li>they can\u2019t similarly delay reducing all kinds of s-risks. The idea of prioritizing space colonization and postponing suffering prevention may be highly similar to that of prioritizing AI capabilities and postponing AI safety. Once the former is prioritized, it may be too late for the latter. A few examples:<ul><li>they can\u2019t delay preventing disvalue from conflict with other agents (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DbuCdEbkh4wL5cjJ5/preface-to-clr-s-research-agenda-on-cooperation-conflict-and\"><u>Clifton 2019</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMouMl7RHk0\"><u>Sandberg 2021</u></a>). They need to think about this before meeting them so they\u2019ll spend time/resources thinking about this instead of colonizing sooner/faster.</li><li>they also can\u2019t delay preventing suffering subroutines/simulations (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/risks-of-astronomical-future-suffering\"><u>Tomasik 2015</u></a>) that might be instrumentally useful during the colonization process. They also need to think about this beforehand.</li><li>the HVs should be more concerned (relative to the PUs) about the possibility of their values drifting or being hacked (by, e.g., a malevolent actor), since this might result in hyper-catastrophic near-misses (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/near-miss/\"><u>Tomasik 2019</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/j4G5Gqxa6JmbbQYzX/mediocre-ai-safety-as-existential-risk#Risks\"><u>Leech 2022</u></a>) from their perspective. The HVs have more to lose than the PUs, such that they would want to spend time and resources on preventing this early on.</li></ul></li><li>in our current world, concern for suffering seems to correlate with skepticism and uncertainty regarding the value of colonizing space. This correlation is so strong that it might be hard to select against the latter without selecting against the former. And while this might seem specific to today\u2019s humans, it is arguably a tendency that is somewhat generalizable to our successors and aliens.</li><li>the HVs\u2019 concern for suffering may very well be asymmetric on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omission_bias\"><u>action-omission</u></a> axis, such that they\u2019re more worried about the suffering they might create than the suffering they might prevent, making them less bullish on space colonization.</li></ul><p>Note that all those points are disjunctive. You don\u2019t need to buy them all to agree with my general claim.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>(Mostly relevant to the intra-civ context)</i>&nbsp;<i><strong>But why don\u2019t the suffering-concerned agents try to join the PUs in their effort to colonize space and push for more cautiousness instead of trying to beat them?&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>They will likely try that, indeed. But we should expect them to be progressively selected against since they drag down the PU project. The few HVs who might manage not to value drift and not to get kicked out of the group of PUs driving colonization efforts are those who are complacent and not pushing really hard for more cautiousness.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>If the Upside-focused Colonist Curse is real,&nbsp;then so too is the selection effect against anything that differs from \u201clet\u2019s just grab as much as possible and nothing else matters\u201d.</strong></i></p><p>Yes, that is (technically) true. However, the selection effect against concern for suffering/disvalue seems much stronger than the selection effect against PU-ish values. In fact, Carl Shulman (<a href=\"https://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2012/09/spreading-happiness-to-stars-seems.html\"><u>2012</u></a>) argues that the selection effect against PU-ish values is very small. And although I find some of his assumptions poorly backed up, I think the considerations he raises make a lot of sense. Disvaluing something, however, seems to be a notable constraint, especially when this&nbsp;<i>something</i> is&nbsp;<i>suffering</i>, i.e., a thing that might be brought about for quite a few different reasons (see my response to the first objection). Value systems that demand the minimization of suffering seem therefore more likely to be selected against.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/5Nm93x8GynXPhZpYe/ioiuwmbmdlgbvwfwj3od\"></p><p>Figure 1: Vague illustration of my intuitions regarding how grabby different moral preferences are.</p><h1>Potential implications</h1><p>I think I have demonstrated that the biggest futures correlate with negligible concern for suffering (i.e., that UCC is a thing),&nbsp;<i>all else equal</i>.

In general, you can\u2019t increase your ability to create what you value without non-trivially increasing the risk of (directly or indirectly) bringing about more of what you disvalue (i.e., as long as you disvalue something, you have a non-zero disvalue penalty). For instance, say Bob values buildings and disvalues trees. It might seem like it is quite safe for him to start colonizing space (with the aim of eventually creating a bunch of buildings), without taking any non-trivial risk of becoming responsible for the creation of more trees. But, there are at least two reasons to think Bob has a non-negligible disvalue penalty. First, errors or value drift might lead to a catastrophic near miss (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/near-miss/\"><u>Tomasik 2019</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/j4G5Gqxa6JmbbQYzX/mediocre-ai-safety-as-existential-risk#Risks\"><u>Leech 2022</u></a>). Second, Bob may very well not be the only powerful agent there is around, such that his expansion straightforwardly increases the chance of triggering a conflict with other agents or civilizations. Such conflict could become catastrophic by bringing about what the involved agents disvalue (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DbuCdEbkh4wL5cjJ5/preface-to-clr-s-research-agenda-on-cooperation-conflict-and\"><u>Clifton 2019</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMouMl7RHk0\"><u>Sandberg 2021</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>And while Bob\u2019s expansion involves a non-trivial risk of tree creation, the risk of the HVs\u2019 expansion causing (indirectly/incidentally) suffering may be greater, for three reasons. First,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/what-are-suffering-subroutines/\"><u>negative reinforcement may be instrumentally useful</u></a> to the accomplishment of many tasks (unlike tree creation). Second, a catastrophic near-miss seems much more likely with humane values than with Bob\u2019s, since pleasure-like sources of value and suffering are much closer than trees and buildings in the space of all things one can create. Third, the technologies enabling the creation of more value might empower potential sadistic/retributivist actors willing to create suffering.</p><p>One counter-consideration is that the more the HVs colonize space, the more they might be able to reduce potential non-anthropogenic suffering (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/s-risk-impact-distribution-is-double-tailed/\"><u>Vinding and Baumann 2021</u></a>). However, bringing about suffering seems far easier than reducing the suffering brought about by other civilizations, such that we should still expect the HVs' expansion to increase s-risks overall.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fna7v9ux48ef\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefa7v9ux48ef\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Where x &gt; 0, and where the value-disvalue metric is built such as 1 unit of value subjectively outbalances 1 unit of suffering.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnbiqbpwdjq9u\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefbiqbpwdjq9u\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><i>\u201cYou love pain.

The dynamic I describe is one where concern for&nbsp;<i>disvalue</i> (i.e., one specific bit of our moral preferences) is selected against, while the dynamics they describe are ones where our moral preferences, as a whole, are gradually eliminated. The reason why my claim is weaker is that concern for suffering is obviously less adaptive to space colonization races than things like caring about \u201chuman flourishing\u201d. For instance, preferences for filling as many stars as possible with value are much more competitive, in this context, than preferences for reducing s-risks. To be clear, the former might also be selected against to the extent that it might be less adaptive than things like pure intrinsic preferences for spreading as much as possible, but concern for suffering is far less competitive and therefore far more likely to be selected against. I expand a bit on this in my response to the third objection in the next section.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnm4tmv9tt9fg\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefm4tmv9tt9fg\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>See my <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xdKnfQKLyYQfeErSr/the-grabby-values-selection-thesis-what-values-do-space\">previous post</a> for more detail on intra-civ vs inter-civ selection.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnpwhse2v5kol\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefpwhse2v5kol\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Brauner and Grosse-Hotz\u2019s (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NfkEqssr7qDazTquW/the-expected-value-of-extinction-risk-reduction-is-positive?fbclid=IwAR2Si8qdOEqXdPujDfv6gDGLaTdevs4Tb_CALW0D2MHUC4Ot9evEAoem3Gw#2_1_Whether__post__humans_colonizing_space_is_good_or_bad__space_colonization_by_other_agents_seems_worse\"><u>2018, Part 2.1</u></a>) suggest that we should find one\u2019s values \u201cworse\u201d if they don\u2019t&nbsp;<i>\u201cdepend on some aspects of being human, such as human culture or the biological structure of the human brain\u201d</i>.

After going through our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/research\"><u>iterative research process</u></a>, we have found two highly promising intervention ideas for new charities to start:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Childhood vaccination reminders&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A simple SMS or call reminder can be all a caregiver needs to attend a child\u2019s vaccination appointment.

It\u2019s an unconventional career step, but we genuinely believe that for those&nbsp;for whom it is a good fit, starting a charity could be one of the most impactful, fulfilling paths they might ever take.<br><br><strong>1) Do it for impact</strong><br><br>Our internal calculations of the counterfactual impact of our charities suggest that pursuing a career in nonprofit entrepreneurship could have&nbsp;<strong>an impact equivalent to counterfactually donating $338,000-$414,000 USD annually</strong> to the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF).&nbsp;</p><p>Some caveats: It's important to note that this calculation represents our current best estimate, and while we are reasonably confident that it is in the correct range, the exact number relies on several highly uncertain inputs. These inputs include assessing the impact of 23 charities that we have assisted in launching until early 2023, as well as our estimates of the counterfactuals of co-founder time, that is, of how much impact they would probably have achieved if they had pursued a more conventional, impactful nonprofit job instead of starting a charity through our program. This estimate is based on our last assessment of charity progress from early 2023. Furthermore, the impact that our co-founders have had is heavy-tailed, meaning that some co-founders are having an impact in the range of equivalent to $1,000,000 USD in counterfactual donations to AMF while a bigger number of others have less than the $338,000-$414,000 average in counterfactual impact.</p><p><br><strong>2) Do it for the skills</strong></p><p>Pursuing this career path can have an immense counterfactual impact while also providing opportunities to learn and develop a diverse set of transferable skills. Here are some things that you will learn from our program alone:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Evaluation Skills</strong><ul><li>Building a Theory of Change</li><li>Basics of Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E)</li><li>Cost-effectiveness analysis</li><li>Scientific evidence reviews</li></ul></li><li><strong>Leadership Skills</strong><ul><li>Strategic planning and prioritization</li><li>Task management and productivity</li><li>Pitching</li><li>Fundraising</li></ul></li><li><strong>Operations Skills</strong><ul><li>Basic operations management</li><li>Human Resources (HR)</li><li>Financial planning</li><li>Legal setup</li></ul></li></ul><p>And these are just a few examples. After the program, you will gain hands-on experience in running a nonprofit, collaborating with stakeholders, designing and implementing pilot programs, and learning from our network of 27 charities and other&nbsp;CE-adjacent projects. All this with ongoing support from the CE team and our community of over 100+ previous incubatees, researchers, and funders.<br><br>Plus, how cool does the title \u201cCo-founder of a GiveWell-incubated charity\u201d or \u201cCo-founder of the world's first organization solely dedicated to shrimp welfare, potentially improving the lives of 2.5 billion individuals annually\u201d sound? ;)&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Our application process as a career fit assessment</strong></h1><p><strong>We value potential over experience.

A friend remarked on the challenges of navigating \"corrupting forces\" in the Bay Area. Intrigued by this statement, I decided to investigate the state of affairs in the Bay if I had the chance. So when I got the opportunity to visit Berkeley in February 2023, I prepared a set of interview questions.&nbsp;<i>Can you share an experience where you had difficulty voicing your opinion? What topics are hard to clearly think about due to social pressures and factors related to your EA community or EA in general? Is there anything about your EA community that makes you feel alienated?&nbsp;What is your attitude towards dominant narratives in Berkeley?&nbsp;&nbsp;</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefou5vs2ct92\"><sup><a href=\"#fnou5vs2ct92\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In the end, I formally interviewed fewer than ten people and had more casual conversations about these topics with around 30 people. Most people were involved in AI alignment to some extent. The content for this collection of vignettes draws from the experience of&nbsp;around ten people.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0i7g0p366gv9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0i7g0p366gv9\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I chose the content for the vignettes for one of two reasons \u2013 potential representativity and potential extraordinariness. I hypothesized that some experiences represent the wider EA Berkeley community accurately. Others, I included because they surprised me, and I wanted to find out how common they are. All individuals gave me their consent to post the vignettes in their current form.&nbsp;</p><p>How did I arrive at these vignettes? It was a four-step process. First, I conducted the interviews while jotting down notes. For the more casual conversations, I took notes afterwards. The second step involved transcribing these notes into write-ups. After that, I obscured any identifying details to ensure the anonymity of the interviewees. Lastly, I converted the write-ups into vignettes by condensing them into narratives and honing in on key points while trying to retain the essence of what was said.</p><p>I tried to reduce artistic liberties by asking participants to give feedback on how close the vignettes were to the spirit of what they meant (or think they meant at the time). It is worth noting that I bridged some gaps with my own interpretations of the conversations, relying on the participants to point out inaccuracies. By doing that, I might have anchored their responses. Moreover, people provided different levels of feedback. Some shared thorough, detailed reviews pointing out many imprecisions and misconceptions. Sometimes, that process spanned multiple feedback cycles. Other participants gave minimal commentary.</p><p>Because I am publishing the vignettes months after the conversations and interviews, I want to include how attitudes have changed in the intervening period. I generalised the attitudes into the following categories:</p><ul><li>Withdrawn endorsement <i>(Status: The interviewee endorsed the following content during the interview but <strong>no longer endorses it</strong> at the time of publication.)</i></li><li>Weakened endorsement<i> (Status: The interviewee has <strong>weakened</strong> <strong>their endorsement</strong> of the following content since the interview.)</i></li><li>Unchanged endorsement <i>(Status: The interviewee maintains their endorsement of the following content, which has remained <strong>unchanged</strong> since the interview.)</i></li><li>Strengthened endorsement <i>(Status: The interviewee has <strong>strengthened their endorsement</strong> of the following content since the interview.)</i></li></ul><p>I clustered the vignettes according to themes so it's easier to navigate them. Classifying them was difficult because many vignettes addressed overlapping topics. Especially,&nbsp;<i>Self-Censorship in Social Contexts</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Self-Censorship in Professional Contexts&nbsp;</i>seem to intersect in intricate ways. I might reclassify the vignettes in the future.</p><p>What remains uncertain is how representative these vignettes are. I am keen to uncover this. So if you found this work valuable and wish to support it further, consider participating in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forms.gle/CjNc4xSYwWpLSk6aA\"><u>accompanying poll</u></a>&nbsp;(particularly if you\u2019re involved in the&nbsp;<strong>Berkeley community</strong>!). If you are interested in participating in potential future blog posts, please feel free to complete&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forms.gle/8U3W3AdEwdqrEHYx9\"><u>this form</u></a>. Feel free to send me a direct message on LessWrong if you have suggestions for other relevant spaces to investigate!</p><p><i>I thank all participants who have shared their stories and experiences with me! Your willingness to engage in open dialogue, provide reviews, and answer all my questions has been instrumental in creating this vignette collection. I am particularly grateful for your patience throughout the feedback cycles. Thank you for your trust and collaboration!</i></p><h1>Personal Insecurities and Alienation</h1><h3>Dumb Questions</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee has&nbsp;<strong>weakened</strong>&nbsp;<strong>their endorsement</strong> of the following content since the interview.</i></p><p>Hamlet is a young AI safety researcher. He vigilantly avoids asking stupid questions. His reason? The rampant elitism he perceives in the Berkeley community. Of course, that\u2019s just the flip side of a great thing. A space like this, with tons of driven and talented people, allows for advanced intellectual conversations and remarkable collaborations. The filters maintaining the quality will exclude some who want to be there. Others, even when invited in, will be intimidated. Hamlet is one of those who get intimidated sometimes. Being associated with stupid questions is very uncomfortable for him. His primary concern lies in the second-order consequences. If others perceived him as dumb, they would dismiss him. He came to Berkeley to find mentors and collaborators, not to be ignored! So better lie low, occasionally drop sophisticated remarks \u2013 and don't be caught asking dumb questions.</p><h3>The Wrong Kind of Weird</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee maintains their endorsement of the following content, which remains&nbsp;<strong>unchanged</strong> since the interview.</i></p><p>Bay Area rationalists have a penchant for a specific brand of weird ideas \u2013 at least in Adrian's experience. Sadly, he is often intrigued by topics whose weirdness rationalists do not appreciate. Adrian enjoys thinking about moral realism and consciousness, for example. What kind of structures could be conscious? Is there something like a global consciousness? After collecting weird looks at parties and being dismissed for bringing those topics up, Adrian has become more reserved. Now he has less trouble fitting in. Another person like him would probably have difficulty gaining acceptance and entry into the community. And navigating the differences in thinking style still poses a challenge.</p><p>Adrian develops his ideas through free association and creative, open exploration. Stream-of-consciousness writing works well for him. He likes using parables, metaphors, examples and anecdotes to express meaning. Because his approach does not conform to established epistemic norms on LessWrong, Adrian feels pressure to cloak and obscure how he develops his ideas. One way in which this manifests is his two-step writing process. When Adrian works on LessWrong posts, he first develops ideas through his free-form approach. After that, he heavily edits the structure of the text, adding citations, rationalisations and legible arguments before posting it. If he doesn\u2019t \"translate\" his writing, rationalists might simply dismiss what he has to say.</p><h1>Attitudes towards Doom</h1><h3>An Oasis of Sanity</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee maintains their endorsement of the following content, which has remained <strong>unchanged</strong> since the interview.</i></p><p>Romeo is a talented graduate excited to contribute to AI alignment. He comes to Berkeley to participate in an AI safety program. His first week in town feels like finally coming home. For years, Romeo had to deal with people confused by intellectualized tribalism or absorbed in trivial philosophical naval-gazing \u2013 individuals who didn\u2019t seem to care whether humanity thrives or dies. Now, finally, Romeo is surrounded by people who&nbsp;<i>actually&nbsp;</i>give a damn. People who speak his language. People who take the possibility of the world ending seriously. In a world of irrationality and madness, Romeo has found an oasis of sanity!</p><h3>Flinching Away</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee maintains their endorsement of the following content, which remains&nbsp;<strong>unchanged</strong> since the interview.</i></p><p>Antony's mind becomes clouded when contemplating scenarios with very high p(doom). He returns to them over and over \u2013 but again and again, he flinches away. Imagining concrete scenarios of that kind is oppressive, after all. But that's not all. A fear is lingering in the back of his mind. What kind of mindset would set in if he thought through the scenarios? Would he even want to live with such a mentality?</p><h3>Clear-Eyed Despair</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee maintains their endorsement of the following content, which has remained <strong>unchanged</strong> since the interview.</i></p><p>Ajax wants to have well-calibrated ideas and intuitions around AI alignment. He wants to work hard \u2013 and he doesn't believe he can do that if he lets wishful thinking cloud his mind. So he tries to viscerally understand, no,&nbsp;<i>feel&nbsp;</i>what AI doom would be like. How would he feel if all the people he loved were killed? If all of civilization were destroyed? Ajax wants to let go of all delusional positivity. He wants to tap into the depths of despair so his mind can stay clear and focused.</p><h1>Attitudes towards the EA Sphere</h1><h3>Hard to Own-Up, Hard to Criticise</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee endorsed the following content during the interview but <strong>no longer endorses it</strong> at the time of publication.</i></p><p>\u201cThe EA community building program is overrated \u2013 and quite possibly net-negative\u201d \u2013 is what Aaron would like to say when the topic comes up. He doesn\u2019t, though. He did not always see it that way. Aaron used to trust CEA's approach to community building. Before launching his career in AI alignment, he worked on community building himself, together with his friend Timon.</p><p>Aaron\u2019s sense of his job was informed by reading between the lines of CEA material. Discussion templates came with the conclusions panel filled in? That probably meant he should set up engaging, seemingly open-ended conversations \u2013 while making sure that the group reached the predetermined conclusions. After all, new members should not be trusted with thinking for themselves. CEA had figured things out, and other EAs should be kept in line.</p><p>Aaron understood and agreed with many of the EA takes. Others, he tribally supported \u2013 even though he didn't fully understand them. He put subtle pressure on members of his local group to support them as well. As time went by, Aaron became more sceptical. Isn\u2019t it much more critical to cultivate truth-seeking in people who want to do good rather than force-feeding them \u201ccorrect\u201d ideas? Now Aaron regrets manipulating conversations to reach \"sanctioned\" conclusions. He regrets pressuring others to fall in line.</p><p>Even though Aaron thinks that CEA's approach nudges community organisers into some poor behaviours, he feels bad about criticising a system he used to be part of. That would mean coming clean about his mistakes to his friends from the local group. But mostly, Aaron keeps quiet because he doesn\u2019t want to trash his former collaborator\u2019s work. Timon is a good person, and he tries hard.</p><h3>Is EA bad, actually?</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee maintains their endorsement of the following content, which remains&nbsp;<strong>unchanged</strong> since the interview.</i></p><p>Fang would like to unflinchingly face the question:&nbsp;<i>\u201cIs EA bad, actually?\u201d&nbsp;</i>Of course, this broad concern drags many children behind it:&nbsp;<i>Has AI alignment been net-negative so far? How should we integrate (sceptical) outside perspectives? What are sketchy assumptions that people make about AI?</i> Thinking about whether the movement is going in the right direction is difficult for Fang. His map was built on writing that, to some extent, has fossilised into AI alignment orthodoxy. It\u2019s hard for him to look at developments in alignment and the community with fresh eyes.</p><p>And then there\u2019s a further dimension to these questions. Fang has bought into the movement, socially and professionally. Most of his friends and colleagues are part of EA. If he concluded that he was in the right spot doing his best, it would mean that nothing would change. But what would happen if he understood that his calling lied elsewhere, in a pursuit unrelated to the EA community? Fang fears that his current social circle would only stay superficially involved with him.</p><p>Support among EAs only goes so far. They\u2019ll be there for you, stand by you, and some of them will be close friends \u2013 as long as you\u2019re part of the community. Or work for a big player in that space. At least, that\u2019s what Fang fears. The idea of doing something else is equivalent to starting over. Fang doesn\u2019t like the possibility of such a conclusion. And he doesn't like that he flinches away from such a possibility. He wants to be more resilient, so he works on finding friends outside EA. Until then, it will probably be hard to think about the question closely.</p><h3>The Dangers of EA</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee has&nbsp;<strong>strengthened their endorsement</strong> of the following content since the interview.</i></p><p>Is EA a&nbsp;<strong>dangerous</strong> movement? Maybe it isn\u2019t. Malcome feels strongly, however, that he should at least ask that question. People around him seem to assume that EA is, by default, built to be altruistic. But should we really expect a group of people with firm ideologies to change the world positively? What are the consequences of a bunch of young, inexperienced people trying to gain influence and power? Should they be the ones who shape the future? These questions are critical, yet they only stir up confusion in his mind.&nbsp;</p><p>The potential implications are disturbing. Still, it\u2019s hard to investigate these questions \u2013 they might be insurmountably difficult to answer. And it probably doesn't help that Malcome is invested in the movement. He tries not to think of EA as part of his identity. But at the end of the day, he must acknowledge that his identity is, to some extent, attached to EA. If Malcome gets to the bottom of this, he might want to distance himself from the ideological side of the movement.</p><h1>Status Dynamics and Social Signalling</h1><h3>Value and Proxies</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee has&nbsp;<strong>weakened</strong>&nbsp;<strong>their endorsement</strong> of the content since the interview. At the time of publication, they don't consider the incident described below as representative of the EA Berkeley community.</i></p><p>Ulysses believes that status hierarchies are not inherently problematic. Basing them on people's usefulness for a shared mission can benefit coordination. Problems can arise, however, when people try to<i> exploit</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>those systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Ulysses has witnessed such manipulative tendencies firsthand. Once, while at a party, he was immersed in a discussion with an acquaintance named Kent. Amid their conversation, King Lear, a high-status member of the Berkeley EA community, approached to greet Kent. The two started chatting. Soon, their conversation revolved around acquiring status. That exchange struck Ulysses. It was incredible how&nbsp;<i>casually&nbsp;</i>those influential people talked about applying social tricks to gain power. They underscored the disparity between proxies for doing good and the actual act of doing good. They discussed how to inflate and manipulate these proxies to enhance the appearance of social contribution \u2013 without actually increasing it.</p><p>Ulysses felt increasingly uneasy as he listened to this exchange. He would have expected people familiar with prisoner's dilemmas and Goodhart's law to be <i>less </i>drawn to exploiting proxies. It felt like they were defecting in a multi-person prisoner\u2019s dilemma! Despite his discomfort, he refrained from interjecting. Speaking up would have felt awkward and out of place since he wasn't directly involved in the discussion. He was but an incidental observer, after all. And what good would it have done to criticise? People like King Lear probably assume that applying such tricks is justified, believing that, as EAs, they will use that underhandedly harvested power for good.</p><h3>Distrust</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee maintains their endorsement of the following content, which remains&nbsp;<strong>unchanged</strong> since the interview.</i></p><p>Richard worries that professional decisions and personal relations are highly coupled in EA. The social sphere seems to intersect with object-level conversations and decisions. That observation affects how he interprets interactions with fellow community members. For example, Richard doesn\u2019t always know if he should take people\u2019s word on their life decisions at face value. How much of what they say is social signalling? When he asks about their decisions, people bring up object-level arguments and seem to undervalue or downplay social reasons. That makes it confusing and difficult to navigate social interactions!</p><h3>The Seeker's Game</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee maintains their endorsement of the following content, which has remained <strong>unchanged</strong> since the interview.</i></p><p>By chance, Valentine runs into Rosaline, an established professional in Berkeley. They chat for a bit. Rosaline seems to have a favourable first impression of Valentine and invites him to an after-hours office party. Valentine wasn\u2019t even aware that these kinds of parties existed! He decides to attend \u2013 more out of curiosity than anything else. He doesn't have high expectations because he doesn't know who will be there. Surprisingly, there are a few high-profile AI alignment researchers in attendance. Valentine gets to talk to some of them. The conversations prove to be engaging and enlightening! They provide perspectives that might help Valentine with his research. Would he have heard of the party if he hadn\u2019t randomly talked to Rosaline? In hindsight, that interaction reminds him of a computer game. It's similar to how interactions with other player characters can unlock new game events and help with game progress. Maybe he should talk to people like Rosaline more often.</p><h3>Belonging vs Competition</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee maintains their endorsement of the following content, which remains&nbsp;<strong>unchanged</strong> since the interview.</i></p><p>Brutus is a young AI alignment researcher. He struggles with resolving the tension between social belonging and competition in the Berkeley community. Brutus is firmly rooted in this social circle. At the same time, he competes with fellow community members for limited resources and opportunities. This inner conflict manifests in Brutus being sensitive about not being invited to parties. The sense of competition makes it tempting to build up his social prestige. But that is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> something he wants to focus on! He wants to do good alignment work. Brutus feels paranoid about unwittingly steering towards status and prestige \u2013 even if he doesn\u2019t necessarily endorse it. Adjacent to that is a nebulous, ill-defined fear of being left behind. What will happen if he opts out while others keep working on their prestige? Will that give them an edge that Brutus can\u2019t compensate for?</p><h1>Self-Censorship in Social Contexts</h1><h3>Social Justice Conversations</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee has&nbsp;<strong>weakened</strong>&nbsp;<strong>their endorsement</strong> of the content since the interview.</i></p><p>Charles hesitates to participate in social justice conversations. Even when he knows specifics about incidents on the scale of sexual assault cases, he feels uncomfortable bringing them up. Determining in advance who will be reasonable in a conversation and who will not is just too difficult. There are some fanatics on the social justice side, after all. What if Charles expressed himself clumsily? Which is not unlikely since he doesn\u2019t know much about the topic, hasn\u2019t thought deeply about it and lacks the subtle tact required for such conversations. If he said something silly once, would people forgive him? Maybe not. Maybe they would cancel him \u2013 or at least try to do that \u2013 if he said the wrong thing. The concern is not particularly intense. Most likely, nothing would happen. However, the potential downsides are still not worth it.</p><h3>Delicate Topics</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee maintains their endorsement of the following content, which has remained&nbsp;<strong>unchanged</strong> since the interview.</i></p><p>Some topics simply ooze bad vibes. Jupiter doesn\u2019t bring them up. Sure, there might be reasons for disturbing the peace. Discussing EA's role in producing SBF-type people could be significant. It could be crucial to talk about the links between social, romantic and professional relationships in EA and how they could give rise to nepotistic behaviour. Is it worth the price, though? Why should Jupiter be the one to ruin the mood? These conversations are downers and simply not fun \u2013 not even for him. And how awkward would it be if he accidentally brought this up to someone involved in these issues? Not to mention that Jupiter might simply be overlooking some apparent arguments and end up looking foolish.</p><p>He could raise these controversial topics publically and risk awkward, uncomfortable conversations \u2013 and heck, maybe even end up accidentally accusing someone! Or he could stick to safe and non-polemical subjects. From Jupiter\u2019s perspective, the choice is obvious.</p><h3>To Gossip or Not to Gossip</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee maintains their endorsement of the following content, which remains&nbsp;<strong>unchanged</strong> since the interview.</i></p><p>Hastings is confused. He unmistakably recognizes the need to let people know about bad actors. It can be an integral part of keeping the community healthy. However, there is never a good time for it. Conversations like that just do not come up naturally! Hastings doesn't feel comfortable gossiping about random people to friends. And he doesn't feel comfortable gossiping with people he doesn\u2019t consider a friend. It also feels inappropriate \u2013 don\u2019t people deserve some privacy? Still, Hastings tried. Post-FTX, he unpromptedly pointed out individuals he perceived as bad actors. That was a tiring, awkward and uncomfortable ordeal. In the end, he wasn't sure if he did any good.</p><p>It\u2019s just as bad when unfamiliar people approach Hastings to gossip. A remote acquaintance once warned him about dating a person he adored.&nbsp;<i>They are of bad character and a poor match for you</i>, the acquaintance said. Then they went ahead and presented evidence supporting their claim. That did nothing but leave Hastings bewildered, confused and vaguely annoyed. No more indulging in gossip for Hastings, that's for sure!</p><h3>I won\u2019t start a Culture War</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee has&nbsp;<strong>strengthened their endorsement</strong> of the following content since the interview.</i></p><p>With some regularity, discussions about visions for a future to strive for come up in Berkeley. People seem to agree that it\u2019s a transhumanist future. Well, William rejects this idea. He opposes the implicit plans of what humanity should do after solving X-risks. It\u2019s irritating how this cultural marinade soaks the discourse, slightly tinting the taste of beliefs and decisions. William firmly believes that Berkeley\u2019s shared futuristic tech mythology is not an appropriate foundation for these conversations!</p><p>One of the reasons that he doesn\u2019t challenge these ideas loudly is that he can\u2019t offer alternatives on how to ground these discussions. Moreover, he has a lingering frustration about not being taken seriously. But most importantly, he fears starting a&nbsp;<strong>culture war</strong> about what the future should look like. William is not sure if it\u2019s likely that challenging that shared vision would lead to that. Nevertheless, the significance of these questions pales in comparison to the imminent threats humanity faces. William doesn\u2019t want to risk distracting the community from the most urgent problems.</p><h3>High Variance</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee has&nbsp;<strong>strengthened their endorsement</strong> of the content since the interview.</i></p><p>Othello has a friend, Cassio, who works at Fancy AI Lab (FAIL). Othello suspects that the potential outcome of his friend's work has a very high variance \u2013 from&nbsp;<i>insignificant</i> to&nbsp;<i>civilization ending bad</i>. He does not press the matter, however. Cassio probably believes that his work is helping. It would be <i>unbearably</i> awkward to tell someone you\u2019re friendly with, \"Hey, I think you\u2019re destroying the world!\" Othello does not want to go that far when he is uncertain that his assessment is correct! Who knows, maybe it would even endanger the friendship.</p><h1>Self-Censorship in Professional Contexts</h1><h3>\u201cDeclaring Loyalty\u201d</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee endorsed the following content during the interview but <strong>no longer endorses it</strong> at the time of publication.</i></p><p>Brabantio is a young, not yet established AI alignment researcher. He has a hard time navigating conversations around AI policy. Many people have strong opinions on AI policy that they think are obvious. Brabantio feels that sharing his opinion on the topic would be akin to declaring loyalty to a whole cluster of ideas, part of which he doesn\u2019t agree with or isn\u2019t even aware of. He already has enough to think about \u2013 he doesn\u2019t want to add navigating community politics to that! The clever thing is to keep quiet.</p><h3>The Temptation of Legibility</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee endorsed the following content during the interview but <strong>no longer endorses it</strong> at the time of publication.</i></p><p>Cleon suspects that legible alignment research is over-prioritised. Of course, legible work has its perks. It can improve research quality, and it feels more motivating to work on a problem when you can track your progress. But there are costs to that. Focusing on legibility might sap the curiosity of the researcher. What Cleon is truly afraid of, however, is legible research diverting attention from more crucial, less tangible work. Cleon observes that there is additional pressure<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to make your research legible. With growing distrust in the community, it becomes vital that other people can easily evaluate the quality of the research. Additionally, there is more ease in communicating with outside groups like people in finance, academia and capability labs.</p><p>Cleon is confused and unsure about the extent of the problem. Is legible research truly overly prioritised? He might be wrong about this. He would like to think more publicly, openly and collaboratively about it.&nbsp;</p><p>He doesn\u2019t bring the topic up, though. Not often, anyway. A vision in his mind holds him back. He imagines bringing up the topic \u2013 and seeing his conversation partner's smirk. \u201cVery&nbsp;<i>interesting</i> that you want to do less legible research\u201d, they would say as if to imply that Cleon wants to hide something. What would he do if someone wanted to discredit him like that? Cleon doesn't want to open himself up to such political attacks! So he keeps his confusion to himself.</p><h3>A Game of Diplomacy</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee has&nbsp;<strong>weakened</strong>&nbsp;<strong>their endorsement</strong> of the content since the interview.</i></p><p>Thurio used to work as an alignment researcher for an AI organisation. When people inquire about his former employer, he hesitates to share his genuine opinion. Before he speaks, he usually activates a diplomatic filter. That way, \u201cmanagement was&nbsp;<strong>terrible</strong>\u201d transforms into mild commentary on subpar leadership.</p><p>Why is Thurio holding back? For one, he doesn\u2019t want people asking for advice to walk away with the impression that his former employer is worse than is the case. He doesn\u2019t want to exaggerate the badness. In addition, Thurio doesn\u2019t want people who still work there to learn about him \u201cbad-mouthing\u201d the organisation. He is sceptical that he could find high-impact opportunities outside of EA. AI alignment is a small world. Maintaining civil relations is crucial, even if not everything went splendidly in the past. Thurio doesn\u2019t want to burn bridges \u2013 especially in a tiny village.</p><h3>Tedious and Tiring&nbsp;</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee has&nbsp;<strong>weakened</strong>&nbsp;<strong>their endorsement</strong> of the content since the interview.</i></p><p>Seyton is strongly averse to bringing up opinions about the quality of other AI alignment research. It would take up too much bandwidth and energy, and the resulting fights would likely go nowhere. People would just get defensive and drag him into long, tedious debates \u2013 especially because the critique is often not anonymous or double-blinded. That\u2019s why he didn't participate in the 2021 LW year-end review. Of course, Seyton considered using a pseudonym to share his critiques. But it was never high enough on his priority list. After all, it\u2019s also not clear if people would even read that. And it takes a while to build up credibility and traction for a pseudonym.</p><h3>Team Player</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee has&nbsp;<strong>weakened</strong>&nbsp;<strong>their endorsement</strong> of the content since the interview, particularly concerning friends. They&nbsp;<strong>maintain their endorsement&nbsp;</strong>with respect to more distant acquaintances.</i></p><p>When Anthropic received cloud compute from Google, Taurus was sceptical. Was that investment a good thing for the world? What kind of promises did Anthropic make to the investors? However, when talking with his friends who work at the lab, Taurus refrains from voicing his concerns. They might start doubting if he is on the same team otherwise. In addition, he doesn't want his friends to feel like he thinks that they are working for a bad company. If he was&nbsp;<i>sure&nbsp;</i>that was the case, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to tell them! And who knows, Taurus might apply for a job at Anthropic in the coming years. He doesn\u2019t want to express concerns until he has a foot in the door. Why jeopardise his chances with a potential employer?</p><h3>Preformal Ideas</h3><p><i>Status: The interviewee maintains their endorsement of the following content, which remains&nbsp;<strong>unchanged</strong> since the interview.</i></p><p>Cato feels that people in rationalist and EA communities discourage voicing preformal ideas. They are strict, imposing a high bar on expression. Some budding ideas undergo destructive scrutiny \u2013 the first instinct seems to be to tear down half-baked concepts before they can mature. Finding someone who wants to collaborate on building up a not-yet-fleshed-out idea can be difficult. Sometimes Cato is lucky to encounter a person to think with. Often, he refrains from expressing thoughts that he has not fully developed yet. He keeps them to himself, brooding over them, until he thinks it would be challenging to dismiss them immediately.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnou5vs2ct92\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefou5vs2ct92\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I also asked questions about what would make it easier to bring up opinions that are hard to voice.

Financial institutions, the corporate sector in general, media outlets, governments, think tanks, and non-EA philanthropists all seem to face a large number of questions which could get better answers through this type of forecasting. In practice, however, forecasting is not that popular among these actors, and I couldn't think of/find a good reason why.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3382kpa9psj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3382kpa9psj\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>The most relevant piece on the topic that I could find was <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dQhjwHA7LhfE8YpYF/prediction-markets-in-the-corporate-setting\">Prediction Markets in The Corporate Setting</a>. As the title suggests, it focuses on prediction markets (whose lack of success is similarly intriguing), but it also discusses forecasting tournaments to some extent. Although it does a great job at highlighting some important applicability issues for judgmental forecasting and prediction markets, it doesn't explain why these tools would be <i>particularly useful</i> for EAs. None of the reasons there would explain the fact that financial institutions don't seem to be making widespread use of forecasting to get better answers to particularly decision-relevant questions, either internally or through consultancies like Good Judgment.</p><p>Answers to this question could be that this type of forecasting is:</p><ul><li><strong>Useful for EA, but not (much) for other actors.</strong> This solution has some support if we think that EAs and non-EAs are efficiently pursuing their goals. If this is true, then it suggests that EAs should continue supporting research on forecasting and development of forecasting platforms, but should perhaps focus less on getting other actors to use it.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefup3qt6deum\"><sup><a href=\"#fnup3qt6deum\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;My best guess is that this is not true in general, though it is more likely to be true for some domains, such as long-run forecasting.</li><li><strong>Useful for EA and other actors.</strong> I think that this is the most likely solution to my question. However, as mentioned above, I don't have a good explanation for the situation that we observe in the world right now. Such an explanation could point us to what are the key bottlenecks for widespread adoption. Trying to overcome those bottlenecks might be a great opportunity for EA, as it might (among other benefits) substantially increase forecasting R&amp;D.</li><li><strong>Not useful.</strong> This is the most unlikely solution, but is still worth considering. Assessing the counterfactual value of forecasting for EA decisionmaking seems hard, and it could be the case that the decisions we would make without using this type of forecasting would be as good as (or maybe even better than) those we currently obtain.</li></ul><p>It could be that I'm missing something obvious here, and if so, please let me know! Otherwise, I don't know if anyone has a good answer to this question, but I'd also really appreciate pieces of evidence that support/oppose any of the potential answers outlined above. For example, I would expect that by this point we have a number of relatively convincing examples where forecasting has led to decisionmaking that's considerably better than the counterfactual.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn3382kpa9psj\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref3382kpa9psj\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This is not to say that forecasting isn't used at all.

Impact Academy was founded by Vilhelm Skoglund, Sebastian Schmidt, and Lowe Lundin. We have already secured significant funding to set up the organization and carry out ambitious projects in 2023 and beyond. Please read&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tranquil-tennis-f7d.notion.site/Theory-of-change-7d17e21cf82748acbcbdee257e18582b?pvs=4\">this document</a>&nbsp;for more about Impact Academy, our Theory of Change, and our two upcoming projects.&nbsp;</p><p>The purpose of this document is to provide an extensive evaluation and reflection on Future Academy - our first program (and experiment). Future Academy aimed to equip university students and early-career professionals worldwide with the thinking, skills, and resources they need to pursue ambitious and impactful careers. It was a free six-month program consisting of four in-person weekends with workshops, presentations, socials, and monthly digital events. Furthermore, the 21 fellows worked on an impact project with an experienced mentor and received professional coaching to empower them to increase their impact and become their best selves. Upon completion of the program, all participants went to a global impact conference (EAGx Nordics) where four fellows presented their projects. We awarded stipends of a total of $20,000 to the best projects. The projects included a sentiment analysis of public perception of AI risk, a philosophy AI alignment paper, and an organization idea for improving research talent in Tanzania. Our faculty included entrepreneurs and professors from Oxford University and UC Berkeley.</p><p>Note that this document attempts to assess to what extent we\u2019ve served the world. This involves an assessment of the wonderful fellows who participated in Future Academy, and our ability to help them. This is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;meant as an evaluation of peoples\u2019 worth nor a definite score of general abilities, but an evaluation of our ability to help. We hope we do not offend anyone and have tried our best not to do so, but if you think we write anything inappropriate, please let us know in the comments or by reaching out to sebastian [at] impactacademy.org.</p><h2>Main results and successes</h2><ul><li><strong>We confirmed a key hypothesis underlying Future Academy </strong>- namely that we can attract promising and talented people who i) have no to moderate knowledge of Effective Altruism and longtermism, ii) are coming from underserved regions (e.g., 40% came from Southern and Eastern Europe), and are more diverse (e.g., 56% were female).</li><li><strong>We created a bespoke primary metric called counterfactual expected career contribution (CECC)</strong> inspired by 80,000 hours\u2019&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2016/07/update-on-number-of-significant-plan-changes/#impact-adjustment-of-significant-plan-changes\">IASPC metric</a>&nbsp;and Centre for Effective Altruism\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/cea-grew-a-lot-in-the-past-year#fnref-3\">HEA metric</a>. We think the total score was 22.8, and ~ four fellows made up the majority of that score.<ul><li>To give an understanding of the CECC metric, we\u2019ll give an example. Take an imaginary fellow, Alice. Before the intervention, based on our surveys and initial interactions, we expected that she may have an impactful career, but that she is unlikely to pursue a priority path based on IA principles. We rate her Expected Career Contribution (ECC) to be 2. After the program, based on surveys and interactions, we rate her as 10 (ECC) because we have seen that she\u2019s now applying for a full-time junior role in a priority path guided by impartial altruism. We also asked her (and ourselves) to what extent that change was due to IA and estimated that to be 10%. To get our final Counterfactual Expected Career Contribution (CECC) for Alice, we subtract her initial ECC score of 2 from her final score of 10 to get 8, then multiply that score by 0.1 to get the portion of the expected career contribution, which we believe we are responsible for. The final score is 0.8 CECC. As a formula: 10 (ECC after the program) - 2 (ECC before the program) * 0.1 (our counterfactual influence) = 0.8 CECC. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pb1HeD362xX8UtInJtl7gaKNKYCDsfCybcoAdrWijWM/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>&nbsp;for a more detailed description of the metric.</li><li>It seems as if we played a substantial counterfactual role (~50%) in bringing about three-four people with an expected career contribution of 10. This corresponds to someone who is now actively searching for a full-time junior role or got an internship in a priority path and is on track to making a senior-level contribution - see an example of a case study&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AP4yxGYldQMClBf4_GrldH_FBmi6we0vv-Q0WAA-GbY/edit#heading=h.4k5wafxuw3ze\">here</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>There were 11 fellows with a CECC score of 2 (which means they may or may not become a 10 eventually), and where we would\u2019ve played a substantial counterfactual role (~50%) in their progress if that were to happen. See an example of a case study&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AP4yxGYldQMClBf4_GrldH_FBmi6we0vv-Q0WAA-GbY/edit#heading=h.sq47dxs8k282\">here</a>.</li></ul></li><li><strong>We had a control group of the top 30 rejectees</strong> (only 14/30 responded to our surveys). Thus, this was a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasi-experiment\">quasi-experiment</a>&nbsp;- not a randomized control trial. 70% (10 people) of the control group didn\u2019t do anything similar to Future Academy, and of those who did, we think it\u2019s likely that two of them would\u2019ve been better off by doing Future Academy, whereas one of them was probably better off not doing Future Academy and one where we are unsure. The control group had a final ECC that was 40% lower than the fellows, which might support our assumption of being able to create counterfactual impact via programs like Future Academy. This supports our assumption of being able to counterfactually engage people in EA.</li><li><strong>The fellows were very satisfied, with an average satisfaction score of 9.6/10 (with an 86% response rate)</strong>. We asked the control group how satisfied they were with what they did instead of Future Academy. The average satisfaction was 6.7.</li><li><strong>Future Academy seems to have increased the fellows' number of connections relevant for doing good substantially</strong>. The average number (before) was 3. The average number (after) was 17. This corresponds to an increase by a factor of 4.5 (compared to the control group, which was increased by a factor of 2).</li><li><strong>92% of the fellows reported that they changed their career in ways they think will make it more impactful</strong> (compared to 71% of the control group).</li><li><strong>Our focus on well-being and general human development via coaching appears to have been a success.</strong> For example, two out of the four well-being metrics had a statistically significant increase with a moderate-strong effect size. The two other metrics didn\u2019t change in statistically significant ways. Relatedly, it increased the overall engagement with the program (fellows reported an average engagement increase of 30.5% due to coaching) while providing career-related outputs (e.g., being more ambitious and optimistic about the impact they can have).</li><li><strong>We were excited about awarding $20,000 to the best projects.</strong></li><li><strong>The total cost (including staff salary) of Future Academy was $229,726</strong>, which corresponds to $11,000/fellow and ~ $10,000/Counterfactual Expected Career Contributions (CEEC). The total FTE of the core staff was ~ 2.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Main challenges and mistakes</h2><ul><li><strong>Impact evaluation presents multiple challenges</strong>. We take all of the results with substantial uncertainty and worry that our conclusions could easily change within six months. Relatedly, the assessment of our control group could be much more rigorous.</li><li><strong>Three fellows reported having had difficult experiences with one of the organizers</strong> - e.g., feeling that the organizer had been too pushy with some of the EA ideas. This made them feel uncomfortable and less prone to engage with the effective altruism community. None of the fellows are hurting in any way - they shared the information to help Future Academy thrive. We took this feedback very seriously, solicited advice from around ten people, and considered a wide range of options for moving forward with the organizer (including whether the person should continue with us). We eventually decided to continue as we trust the person\u2019s ability to grow and saw that the person created a convincing development plan for improvement.</li><li><strong>We needed to spend more time and resources on marketing and attracting applications to the program</strong>. We weren\u2019t particularly systematic in the recruitment process, as multiple individuals were involved, and we want to set aside more time and resources for both marketing and application processing. With a simple budget of $2,000 at least three participants found the program through paid advertising (\u201ceyeballs can be bought\u201d).</li><li><strong>The fellows didn\u2019t get as much out of the Impact Projects and mentoring as we would\u2019ve liked</strong>. For example, 3/18 didn\u2019t hand in a project, only four fellows worked in groups, and some mentor-mentee-pairings seemed not to have taken off. However, compared to other programs (e.g., SERI), it seems as if this was a high rate of project completion.</li><li><strong>We needed more normal lectures and more time for active learning and a&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/flipped-classrooms#:~:text=A%20flipped%20classroom%20is%20structured,that%20involve%20higher%20order%20thinking.\"><strong>flipped classroom</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;approach</strong>. Relatedly, the exercises prepared for the workshop elements were of varying quality - e.g., they hadn\u2019t been test-run.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusions for Impact Academy</h2><p>Overall, we think Future Academy was a successful experiment as we were satisfied with how we ran the program and the outcomes of the program. However, there was significant room for improvement, and we don\u2019t want to run Future Academy in its exact form again. We\u2019ve decided to run another version of Future Academy where we will continue to primarily target people who&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Have no or moderate knowledge of and engagement with EA/longtermism and&nbsp;</li><li>Are from underserved regions and groups.</li></ul><p>We\u2019ll also update the program to reflect best practices within education, the science of learning, and other programs we think highly of. Finally, we\u2019ll also explore the feasibility of targeting early-mid career professionals as the wider community seems to be very interested in individuals with 3+ years of experience.</p><p>You can learn more about the other project (an AI governance fellowship) we will be running&nbsp;<a href=\"https://tranquil-tennis-f7d.notion.site/Theory-of-change-7d17e21cf82748acbcbdee257e18582b?pvs=4\">here</a>.</p><h2>Recommendations for the EA community</h2><p>Based on our experience with Future Academy, we think these recommendations might provide value to the EA community as a whole:</p><ul><li><strong>More focus on recruiting from underserved communities</strong> (like Eastern and Southern Europe and specific regions in Africa and Asia) - it\u2019s possible!</li><li><strong>Consider adding a component around well-being and general human development via coaching</strong>. For example, two out of the four well-being metrics had a statistically significant increase with a moderate-strong effect size. The two other metrics didn\u2019t change in statistically significant ways. Relatedly, it increased the overall engagement with the program (fellows reported an average engagement increase of 30.5% due to coaching) while providing career-related outputs (e.g., being more ambitious and optimistic about the impact they can have).</li><li><strong>Learn from educational best practices</strong>. Many things related to field-building can be modeled as education. From the design of programs (e.g., by backward chaining from where you want fellows to end up) to the impact evaluation (it can be similar to grading hard things like essays). See this excellent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZPNNnEu2HGNSNmifo/we-all-teach-here-s-how-to-do-it-better\">blog post</a>&nbsp;by Michael Noetel for more.</li><li><strong>Be more rigorous and systematic about impact evaluation</strong>. E.g., creating a baseline estimate or a simple control group by sending a survey with a $20 Amazon gift card to top rejectees led to a surprisingly high response rate. That said, impact evaluation is hard, and we\u2019d be interested in exploring some form of external evaluation.

Doing this also makes it easier for this to be relatively public, and so to get some difficult conversations over with.

There was never anything that meaningfully \u2018drove me to drink\u2019. The idea that drinking at this point could land me here wasn\u2019t part of my decision at all, I was just kind of bored and lonely and decided it would be a fun treat to drink a beer or two at night \u2013 something I had very rarely done before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As the pandemic wore on, it became something I looked forward to more and more, and eventually I discovered the appeal of hard liquor, which I never switched back from, and eventually I started working on my thesis for my first MA. The combination of my thesis and hard liquor turned a casual habit and minor coping mechanism into something more obviously hard for me to let go of. Over the course of the next three years things got slowly worse from there, and I came to realize more and more how little control I had.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It wasn\u2019t some meaningful part of the larger story of my life, replete with a buried darkness in my soul coming to the forefront, or a unique challenge driven by terrible circumstances. I have had to push back in therapy repeatedly on these subtler and more interesting attempts to make something of the event. The truth is sober reflection makes it all look like little more than a meaningless tragedy.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here are some reflections on what it feels like:</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cOne thing that I think people on the outside of this get wrong is the way conscious and unconscious feelings work in this context. I have been asked many times, especially in therapeutic contexts, what it feels like to get urges to drink. Truthfully, it doesn\u2019t feel like much of anything as far as I can tell. It isn\u2019t like thirst or hunger where there is some identifiable physical sensation. The easiest description of how the \u2018urges\u2019 start, is with intrusive thoughts. Not necessarily something as consciously obvious as \u2018hey, you should drink\u2019, but often more abstract things about drinking. \u2018Do you think you\u2019re going to drink tonight?\u2019 \u2018what happens if you drink tonight?\u2019 \u2018what happens if you don\u2019t drink tonight?\u2019 \u2018if you do this, then you can drink tonight\u2019. Argue with these, and they keep going all day until you drink. Drinking, in fact, is largely how you settle the argument, how you release the building tension.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not argue with these thoughts, it does not help, or at least helps very rarely, especially when they are persistent. Not arguing isn\u2019t perfectly adequate either. Ignore them and they aren\u2019t replaced either by silence or by an identifiable urge sensation like hunger, but rather by, when one reflects on the idea of a night without drinking, a vague sense of sadness, even of indignity, at being cheated out of drinking when all the other surrounding nights you got to, and one night won\u2019t make a difference anyway, and your reward for good behavior is to wind up getting punished by being denied alcohol.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a summary of one of my worst periods of drinking, driven by fears about AI:</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cOver this time period Effective Altruism played very little role in my alcoholism. The closest it came was for a few months starting around April of 2022, when the combination of Yudkowsky\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j9Q8bRmwCgXRYAgcJ/miri-announces-new-death-with-dignity-strategy\">Death With Dignity</a> post and the <a href=\"https://openai.com/dall-e-2\">various</a> <a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/publications/an-empirical-analysis-of-compute-optimal-large-language-model-training\">AI advancements</a> released around the same time caused me to look into AI risks more than I had been, and for them to suddenly feel real in a way they hadn\u2019t before. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FGiKbbTKezqj9bvbm/how-have-shorter-ai-timelines-been-affecting-you-and-how?commentId=Cqj73vSL3F4tcisgj\">During this period</a> I was regularly wracked with fear and sadness, especially at night, and often drank more just to forget a little, just to get to sleep. Ultimately this improved after a few months, and I can\u2019t really tell to what extent even this made my drinking worse in the long term.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is how alcoholism has been psychologically corrosive to my view of myself as an EA:</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cA final way that Effective Altruism could affect alcoholism is <a href=\"https://personal.lse.ac.uk/robert49/teaching/mm/articles/Singer_1972Famine.pdf\">perhaps the oldest part</a> of the Effective Altruism canon \u2013 your resources can do much more good in other hands, and at the very least one should prefer to spend on the good of those who need it much more than on trivial expensive luxuries. The occasional drink perhaps doesn\u2019t merit strict personal control for any but the most ambitious altruists, but this was not remotely my situation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every week or so when I took out the recycling, I was reminded by the avalanche of bottles I poured into the recycling, that I was voluntarily paying a small second rent for the privilege of slowly killing myself. This would be bad enough news for someone who knew they were going into debt for their schooling anyway, but for an Effective Altruist it is hard not to think about how many lives are being lost to this self-destruction on top of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At first this is one of many things that can be motivating \u2013 it is a very inspiring Effective Altruist story to say that you managed to make yourself stop drinking because you felt you had a moral duty that this was keeping you from meeting. It is, at least by a certain point and in my experience, one of many framings that worked and then worked less and then stopped working. This is all the more disheartening \u2013 a sense of purpose is the thing I\u2019ve felt most in need of for pulling myself up, and everything I appeal to in this regard gets worn down and abandoned in time. A sort of gradual moral injury, and erosion of identity.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And finally, this is how the post ends, with some thoughts on how the community aspect of Effective Altruism can be concretely helpful in this context:</p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cSince I have mentioned the relationship between my drinking and my Effective Altruism, I should maybe finally end with the confession that I am <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/anotherburneraccountsorry\">anotherburneraccountsorry</a>, the author of \u2018<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ugsgFkLGShEjMqfBA/advice-for-an-alcoholic-ea\">Advice for an alcoholic EA</a>\u2019. I regret to say that little came of this post. While people brought up potentially helpful advice and resources, I never got around to reviewing them in the way I had planned to, as the rest of my treatment picked up in terms of time commitment, and my other commitments outside of it did as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One thing that I asked, and which seemed to come up briefly in the comments as well, was that it might be a good idea to set up some kind of recovery group for EAs struggling with substance abuse. While there are other EA mental health initiatives, ones more like group meetings seem less common, but I think I would feel especially eager and able to be helpful and be helped by people who have some of the same background references and concerns and beliefs, at least it would help when airing out certain topics. Something as simple as some informal recovery meetups, in person in major hubs and/or remote ones for EA more broadly could potentially be helpful to many people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If there is something I could concretely do to help setup or participate in a group like this, I would be happy to. If anyone else wants to do something like this, I would support them in it. At the same time, as I mentioned in this post, there is a risk of becoming too inward facing or getting too reliant on this one group for even major life events that aren\u2019t as directly relevant to it, so I don\u2019t want to remotely discourage people from attending different groups, even if one like this does get set up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand\u2026One of the most inspiring things I ran into during my period as an alcoholic was just a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/incertaspecie/status/1384976216566816770?cxt=HHwWhICjrf6htrgmAAAA\">couple</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/incertaspecie/status/1471964436747329540?cxt=HHwWiICp5ef2u-0oAAAA\">videos</a> by Victoria Lynn Carroll on her experience with alcoholism, someone I mostly knew about through a single funny sketch on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/incertaspecie/status/1359255423048577024\">rationalist twitter handles</a>, and whose level of involvement with EA or rationalism is unclear to me. I wouldn\u2019t have run into these if it wasn\u2019t for my involvement with the EA and rationalist communities, and it\u2019s not clear they would have meant as much to me without that context. Another was just watching the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hV4coeum6w\">2022 Secular Solstice</a> recording during an especially tough time for me \u2013 I still have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGRP3jxwD_A\">The Mary Ellen Carter</a> on repeat when I need to feel some hope and motivation \u2013 and it didn\u2019t even touch on addiction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Despite my sense that separating intimate mental health experiences from EA to a degree can be important for being a richer and more grounded person, it is undeniable to me that I feel a strong need to connect my hardest experiences to aspects of my community and values that provide me with day to day meaning, and that did before I had this problem. It is unsurprising to me that so many religious addicts wind up involving religion very heavily in their recovery. People who compare Effective Altruism to religion are usually making some subtle dig, meant to prove something they lack the arguments to argue for directly, and so hope to imply with more superficial connections\u2026but there is at least some less superficial connection as well, and I think one of more important ones to recognize is the way EA can serve as an anchor point for identity and meaning for people in the community who are suffering from an acute crisis of both. When it comes to cheap or free ways to help people through this anchor point, like informal recovery groups, we shouldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anyway, these are on average fairly depressing quotes from on average a fairly depressing post, so I want to briefly close by saying that I\u2019m currently optimistic. A regime involving Naltrexone and Trazodone is helping me get more control, and some recent more hard to explain emotional motivation and longer patches of sobriety make me think things are on the whole improving. Sorry if this is the wrong place to post it.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Devin Kalish"}}, {"_id": "wbi3y8PsswpYvn5YN", "title": "Constructive Discussion and Thinking Methodology for Severe Situations including Existential Risks", "postedAt": "2023-07-08T00:04:39.376Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>My Methodology for Thinking Further and Deeper</strong></p><p>I have always considered myself to be a pragmatist, egoist, and realist. However, there seems to be a gap between these ideologies as I see them and the image associated with these words, so I always have to be careful about how I use them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No matter what kind of ideology you hold, for instance, even if it's egoism, if it's hasty and lacks thoughtfulness, it will ultimately bring losses to oneself. Similarly, even if you claim altruism, if it's hasty, it can cause harm to others. On the other hand, whether you take either stance, if you think it over from a long-term perspective, you will often arrive at a conclusion that is positive for both yourself and others. This is because your happiness cannot be established without the stability and prosperity of society, and society too will become unstable and poor if each individual is not happy. Therefore, the problem is not the ideology or principle itself, but rather whether one thinks hastily or contemplates with a long-term view, which is crucial.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that these ideologies are about where to place the starting point or anchor of our thoughts. Therefore, if there is only one answer to the subject under consideration, even if we start thinking from an ideology that is the opposite of these, we should arrive at the same answer. If a different answer comes out, it's not that the starting point was wrong, but simply that there was a mistake in the thinking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of a problem with multiple answers, no matter where you start, you should be able to arrive at one of the answers that meet the requirements of the question. Since there are multiple answers, different starting points will result in different answers. However, all of the answers meet the requirements, so it's a matter of choice. If the requirements are not met, it may be a question with no answer, or there may simply be a mistake in the execution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In some problems, the degree of the result changes depending on the answer. In that case, you should choose the one with the most desirable degree among the answers that meet the requirements. In this case, the goodness of the answer will differ depending on where you started thinking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even if you start thinking with some kind of thought or ideology in mind, in order to think through to the answer, it is important to think carefully without rushing to conclusions, bring out thoughts from different perspectives, and push your thinking further and deeper.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I use pragmatism, egoism, and realism as the starting points for my thinking because I can always hold onto some feasible idea by starting my thinking from there and eventually returning to it. Organizing and advancing my thinking from this perspective seems to suit me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Extension to Multi-Person Discussion</strong></p><p>When discussing with multiple people, there may be cases where the discussion does not progress due to differences in opinions and answers. The reason is not that there is a problem with the starting point or ideology of the person who thought of the opinion. There may be a leak in the setting of the question and the requirements of the goal. Or, one of them may have made a mistake in thinking.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, if there is a discrepancy in the discussion, you should focus on making explicit the setting of the problem and the requirements that were implicit, hidden, or newly noticed. If there is still a discrepancy and the answers do not match, even after agreeing on the premises and requirements, there must be a mistake in thinking somewhere. You should proceed with the task of reviewing each other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of a problem where the degree of the result changes depending on the answer, there is no need to condemn the person who came up with a different answer. You should commend the person who gave the answer with the best degree and adopt that answer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, there may be cases where the participants have different values or where, even if the values are the same, the benefits gained differ depending on the answer. In such cases, discussions and negotiations will be necessary to find a compromise.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even here, the key to whether or not the discussion converges is not a matter of each other's ideologies, but how to set up the problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Importance of Requirement Definition in Discussions</strong></p><p>In many discussions, the focus of the discussion tends to be on the solution to the problem. However, in order to evaluate the goodness of the solution, the requirements, their priorities, and the evaluation method must be clearly defined. There are too many cases in reality where the discussion is conducted without organizing this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What should be discussed is the explicit presentation of requirements, how to set them, and how to evaluate them and which requirements to prioritize. This should be a task of documentation, not a verbal argument. Discussions conducted orally without writing up the requirements in the discussion may be taking a flawed methodology in this basic attitude towards discussion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding the priority of requirements, it is not something that can be logically answered by discussion alone, so a mechanism for decision-making, such as discussions between representatives or, in some cases, voting by all stakeholders, is needed. It is important to get agreement and understanding from the stakeholders based on this decision.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once this is done properly, the discussion of solutions is just a pure technical task that can be carried out logically and rationally. If, in the consideration or search for solutions, new requirements are discovered and decision-making is necessary, then a decision must be made again in a discussion or voting session.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, the building up of requirements that are explicitly organized and solutions is the main road to constructive discussion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Factors That Halt Constructive Discussion</strong></p><p>When proceeding with discussions in the above manner, there are several factors that inhibit this and halt constructive discussions. Although I may not be able to cover all of them, I believe there are at least the following four.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Lack of attitude to admit mistakes or shortcuts in thinking</p><p>If there are mistakes or shortcuts in thinking, it is not possible to obtain the answers or compromise points that should be found. When you notice this point in a discussion, either by yourself or pointed out by others, it is necessary to accept it without emotional reaction or ignoring it. If a representative is appointed in the discussion, the person who can honestly admit these mistakes and shortcuts should be chosen as the representative. A group that cannot tolerate mistakes by the representative needs to understand that the group itself is causing the discussion to stall and, as a result, harming the interests of the group.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Lack of requirement definition and lack of effort to fill it</p><p>As the discussion progresses, there may be a lack of requirement definition in the initial problem setting or implicit requirements that are found as a result of the discussion. In such cases, it is necessary to properly add these requirements to the problem. Discussions that criticize after-the-fact requirements, proceed without explicitly stating implicit requirements, or simply attack the other party without paying attention to the problem of requirement definition are not constructive discussions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Pursuit of relative benefits</p><p>If you set a goal of always having \"more than the other person\" without putting out requirements based on your own desires, it will cause conflicts. The very idea of wanting more than the other person is an act of denying the dignity of the other person, and becomes an ethical issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>- Rebellion</p><p>If you don't put out requirements based on your own desires and set a goal of hindering the other person, it will cause conflicts. The mindset of aiming to hinder the other person, regardless of one's own benefits, is an act of denying the dignity of the other person, and becomes an ethical issue.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Misunderstandings About Constructive Discussions</strong></p><p>There is a misconception that egoism and differences in values cause conflicts in discussions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, from the standpoint of thorough egoism, one would think that it is not in one's own interest to waste time without resolving discussions. Moreover, since one has chosen to participate in the discussion without choosing other means, finding a compromise with the other party is in one's own interest, there are also methods to make profits by borrowing it in the next and subsequent times even if one compromises this time, and there are possibilities that it may be a plus for the future if the</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>partner participating in the discussion also has benefits. Therefore, one should come to the conclusion that the decision to allow a certain compromise is a plus for oneself.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Differences in values themselves should not be the cause of stagnation in discussions. If we explain and understand our differences in values, the work of finding a compromise point will naturally progress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The problem lies in the four points mentioned above. In other words, the root cause of the stagnation of discussions is not approaching discussions with a sincere attitude. It is an attitude that questions the differences in values and the ideology of the other party that hinders constructive discussions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Measures Needed for Constructive Discussions</strong></p><p>In dealing with truly important issues, it is more important to exclude those who violate these four points than to exclude minority opinions or oppositionists from the discussion. For this purpose, rules or guidelines should be established, and some fair method should be used to determine violations of these four points, and measures should be taken to exclude those who repeatedly violate them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In dealing with truly important issues, these violations raise ethical issues. Therefore, while ensuring freedom of speech and expression, society needs to impose a duty and responsibility not to commit these four violations in discussions in the face of these basic incidents that can undermine public welfare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Emergency Evacuation in Severe Situations</strong></p><p>Only when there is no other means to rely on and it is clear that letting the discussion drag on will cause a greater tragedy or ethical issue, there is room for considering the last resort. That is, in situations where it is clear that leaving these violations unchecked will cause another basic incident to be severely damaged, it may have to be considered as an option to forcibly remove them using public power. If this is left unchecked, or if freedom of speech or expression is mistakenly defended, and as a result, many lives are lost, the executor of public power may even be held responsible for violating the duty of care as a good administrator.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The forced exclusion of such acts cannot simply be condemned from the viewpoint of public welfare, ethical issues, and violation of the duty of care as a good administrator. If it is clear that a more tragic or ethical issue will be caused by not making a decision, the use of such power must be recognized as a social emergency evacuation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dishonest Attitude in Discussions</strong></p><p>What I mentioned in \"Emergency Evacuation in Severe Situations\" is my personal opinion, but it is not something I raised lightly; it is my opinion that I thought through sincerely. Discussions about things that are commonly understood as important and should be cherished and defended, like these basic human rights, tend to be avoided.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>However, when considering severe situations and when these come into conflict, it is inevitable that something will have to be sacrificed. In these discussions, it is certainly a sensitive topic to talk about what should be sacrificed, and it always attracts resentment and dissatisfaction. But avoiding that does not mean that the correct answer will come out or that society will be saved.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, in these discussions, it is completely dishonest to just emphasize that these rights are important. The problem is to discuss what can be partially lost in order to protect as much as possible what is important, considering ethical aspects and future impacts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I understand the feelings of wanting to avoid or fear attracting resentment and dissatisfaction, especially if you are in a position to be supported by votes. Still, if discussions with such courage are not allowed and only dishonest discussions are allowed, then that society becomes a fragile society that could lose everything important in truly severe situations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the debater must clearly show what can be sacrificed and what can be protected by doing so. And the recipient must be most cautious about the opinions of debaters who only talk about what is important to cherish, not those who talk about sacrifices. It is necessary to strongly demand from these dishonest debaters to make explicit what will be sacrificed.</p>", "user": {"username": "YoshiAino"}}, {"_id": "hXjBJLqxdG5FNn3ps", "title": "Infographics

As I enter the second year, I plan to take the sequences in development and energy/environmental economics. I would also like to include some trade/growth and econometrics courses.</p><p>Over the course of the first year, my views on the PhD have evolved in such a way that impacts my decision to continue in the program or leave with a Master\u2019s. I am not quite sure how the additional ~5 years stacks up against the expected benefits.</p><ol><li>I find a career in academia less appealing than before. I think the incentives for publication induce a lot of work that is orthogonal to the effort of generating high quality evidence. Further, the lifestyle of academia seems inconsistent with my desired family life and work-life balance.</li><li>I have more confidence in my ability to self study. I am amazed at how much I learned over the course of the year, and I have greater faith in my ability to work through challenging concepts. However, not all skills are amenable to self study. If I want to conduct more sophisticated research (I elaborate on this below), getting a PhD seems like the best option.</li><li>The subjective experience of grad school is worse than I expected. First, I miss (more than expected) having 5 days of work followed by 2 days off. I previously worked as a research assistant for a professor. Second, since we all take courses together in the first year, there is a strong sense of camaraderie in the cohort that I enjoy. However, I suspect that will fade as we pursue our own research. On the other hand, I will likely join a research lab, which might give me the sense of work community I desire.</li><li>I have a stronger desire to live on the West Coast than I expected. I would like to be closer to friends and family, and I feel greater cultural comfort on the West Coast. It seems like geographic preferences are difficult to manage in academia, especially if I have to coordinate with a partner.</li></ol><p>I do think I should give the second year a chance, as I imagine it will be closer to representative of the rest of the experience. I will have the opportunity to learn more about frontier work and devote more time to research.</p><p><strong>My Vision of a Career with a PhD</strong></p><p>Previously, I saw myself as a development economist at an R1 university. Outside of academia, places like Evidence Action, J-PAL, or the World Bank, for example, seem appealing.</p><p>As for my research agenda, I am primarily interested in two lines of thinking.</p><ol><li>I think that treatment externalities are everywhere, failing to account for such externalities can materially impact results, and that these two facts are underappreciated.</li><li>Agricultural productivity seems to be an important ingredient for economic growth. However, climate change threatens agricultural productivity in the developing world.</li></ol><p>As to the first point, accounting for treatment externalities can be tricky; I see the value of getting a PhD in that effort. The <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1468-0262.2004.00481.x\">Miguel and Kremer worms paper</a> is a great example of this kind of thinking. Being at UChicago certainly helps in this effort, as I am hoping to start working at Kremer\u2019s lab later this summer. As to the second point, the lab is starting to study questions in this area.</p><p><strong>My Vision of a Career without a PhD</strong></p><p>I would be most interested in a research role evaluating health and development initiatives. Organizations like GiveWell or GiveDirectly come to mind. Note, these are just salient examples, as a I have not done much digging. I think my research experience (in RCT evaluations and poverty measurement) would fit nicely with such work. I additionally have some limited management consulting experience that I\u2019ve found useful in most work activities.</p><p>Alternatively, I could see myself in a more technical role, perhaps as a data scientist. In my previous job, I found myself gravitating towards and quite engaged when solving interesting computational problems. We did a lot of work with large datasets, and I enjoyed the associated optimization tasks, especially when using some form of numerical analysis. I also enjoyed my work with geospatial data; I assume this skill could be useful in climate or agricultural work.</p><p><strong>Key Benefits to PhD</strong></p><p>I\u2019d be hesitant to leave the PhD for a couple reasons.</p><ol><li>I have never had such a wealth of peers with common interests (both in development topics and the tools of economics/econometrics). I find this exciting, and I learn a lot from my peers. It's also quite fun to be surrounded by this crowd.</li><li>If I want to focus on treatment spillovers and/or economic growth, I think the PhD would be crucial.</li><li>Getting a PhD is an act of building career capital, and it might be quite difficult to return to a PhD. Similarly, my opinions on academia could change, and completing the PhD doesn\u2019t really close off the non-academic paths I mention above.</li></ol><p>I will be attending a course on economic theory and global priorities, hosted by the Forethought Foundation, later this summer. Further, I plan to apply for 80K career coaching. I\u2019m curious if anyone has thoughts on this decision, suggested resources, or is keen to discuss.</p>", "user": {"username": "Connacher Murphy"}}, {"_id": "SG725YT5b59Cn4WQr", "title": "Notes on cultivating good incentives", "postedAt": "2023-07-07T20:07:45.797Z", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p><i>Which behaviours would I be praised for if the praiser was kinder &amp; smarter than me, and had access to all the same internal &amp; external information?</i></p></blockquote><ul><li>Always seek to impress the internal simulation you call upon to answer the above question.

Below we'll discuss, in light detail, a program that's well outside of our traditional wheelhouse, but that we think significantly improves children's lives\u2014treatment for clubfoot with an organization called MiracleFeet.</p>\n<h3>The grant</h3>\n<p>Clubfoot is a congenital (i.e., present from birth) abnormality that causes one or both feet to twist inward and upward. Children born with clubfoot must walk on the sides or backs of their feet, which leads to pain, severely limited mobility, and, reportedly, social stigma. If not corrected, clubfoot is a lifelong condition.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-1\" id=\"fnref-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-1\">[1]</a></sup> In January 2023, we recommended a $5.2 million grant to <a href=\"https://www.miraclefeet.org/\">MiracleFeet</a> to expand its existing clubfoot treatment program in the Philippines and launch two new programs in Chad and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-2\" id=\"fnref-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>In the countries where it works, MiracleFeet and its local NGO partners help health facilities diagnose and treat clubfoot, using a process called the <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/ponseti-casting-for-clubfoot\">Ponseti method</a>. This generally requires placing the affected foot in a series of casts, performing a minor surgical procedure to improve the foot's flexibility, and bracing the foot during sleep for up to five years.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-3\" id=\"fnref-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-3\">[3]</a></sup> MiracleFeet and its partners provide supplies for casting and bracing, train government health care workers in the above procedures, build awareness of clubfoot, and help health systems collect data on treatment.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-4\" id=\"fnref-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-4\">[4]</a></sup> This makes it comparable to a \"technical assistance\" program: MiracleFeet doesn't perform clubfoot treatment itself; instead, along with its partners, it helps set health facilities up to successfully find and treat clubfoot cases themselves.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/eeo96yTefNsG6ELkT/hrzovaviqllhk6uqkegy\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><em>The brace and custom shoes supplied by MiracleFeet for clubfoot treatment. Photograph courtesy of MiracleFeet.</em></p>\n<p>We were excited to recommend this grant because we think it will probably result in a lot more kids being treated for a serious, lifelong condition that nevertheless appears neglected. Clubfoot is debilitating but not life-threatening, and affects only about 1 in 800 babies born.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-5\" id=\"fnref-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-5\">[5]</a></sup> In resource-strapped countries, a relatively new and involved treatment like the Ponseti method may not be prioritized unless an NGO like MiracleFeet is there to advocate for and assist with it.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-6\" id=\"fnref-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-6\">[6]</a></sup> We estimate that MiracleFeet will support treatment of about 10,000 children with this grant, and that only about 10% of those children would get treated absent MiracleFeet,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-7\" id=\"fnref-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-7\">[7]</a></sup> though we don't feel very certain about this (more below, under \"What we're still learning\").</p>\n<p>All in all, after adjustments, we think that this grant will lead to about 3,700 cases of clubfoot successfully treated that otherwise wouldn't have been, and that will result in lifelong mobility gains and pain relief for the children treated.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-8\" id=\"fnref-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-8\">[8]</a></sup></p>\n<h4>Why this grant is different</h4>\n<p>MiracleFeet's program is different from our top charities for a few reasons:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-9\" id=\"fnref-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-9\">[9]</a></sup></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The program is expensive compared with our top charities.</strong> The Ponseti method requires specialized equipment, training for medical staff, and a multi-step execution with years of subsequent follow-up. In the countries funded by this grant, we estimate that MiracleFeet's program costs a little over $500 per treatment, compared with (for example) about <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z065ab9PPMu9i5KiQ4yLyQJPFQCfEzHSgtHulPiZeBo/edit#gid=1407352843&amp;range=G9\">$1</a> per child given vitamin A supplements through Helen Keller International.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>But it's also much more targeted.</strong> Our current top charities increase coverage of blanket preventive measures\u2014ones given to all children in the target age group, whether or not they would have eventually become sick. By contrast, all the children in MiracleFeet's program have clubfoot and need an intervention to gain full mobility. The higher cost is offset by closer targeting of the kids who will benefit.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>The main benefit is reduced disability, not lives saved or income gained.</strong> While our top charities' work primarily saves lives, MiracleFeet's program focuses on reducing or avoiding disability\u2014thus reducing pain and suffering, and indirectly increasing income (since improved mobility means more opportunity to work<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-10\" id=\"fnref-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-10\">[10]</a></sup>). In our cost-effectiveness analysis for this grant, we used our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hOQf6Ug1WpoicMyFDGoqH7tmf3Njjc15Z1DGERaTbnI/edit#heading=h.619kve7fh5cy\">moral weights</a> to compare the value of saving lives to that of avoiding disability and raising incomes.</p>\n<p>To do that, we also needed to answer the question of how bad clubfoot is. We have a generic value for a year of avoiding disability, but we needed to multiply it by another value that would represent the burden of clubfoot specifically.</p>\n<p>The source we typically rely on for measures of disease burden doesn't provide a disability weight for clubfoot, so we had to find a proxy among the conditions it does list. We considered a couple of options that represented higher and lower degrees of severity, and spoke with a disability expert and reviewed related literature to get a better sense of clubfoot's effects. In the end, we settled on a value that seemed to match clubfoot's combination of pain, impairment, and stigma.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-11\" id=\"fnref-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-11\">[11]</a></sup> This was ultimately a judgment call based on what we had learned about clubfoot over time.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What we're still learning</h3>\n<p>Our preliminary cost-effectiveness estimate put MiracleFeet's program close to meeting our bar for funding. Still, we had a lot of uncertainty about the ultimate impact of this grant, including the counterfactual impact of the program\u2014that is, how many more kids would be treated for clubfoot because of MiracleFeet's work in these countries? Because MiracleFeet provides assistance for treatment, but not the treatment itself, it's tougher to draw a straight line from its work to impact. We were also unsure about existing access to treatment in the three countries where MiracleFeet would be working; we had been told that treatment is scarce in the Philippines, and essentially nonexistent in Chad and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, but we didn't have independent confirmation of that.</p>\n<p>We saw a grant to MiracleFeet as a learning opportunity, in addition to the direct benefit it would have on children's lives. MiracleFeet and its partners already collect some data on the program,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-12\" id=\"fnref-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-12\">[12]</a></sup> but if we could fund additional information-gathering on the number of children treated before program launch (or expansion, in the case of the Philippines), then measure the same numbers a few years later, we'd have a clearer idea of what a program like this accomplishes with philanthropic support. We could use that information to make better decisions not only about whether to fund MiracleFeet again in the future, but also about whether to fund other clubfoot treatment programs.</p>\n<p>When we factored in what we'd get out of a separate grant for monitoring and evaluation\u2014what we call \"value of information\"\u2014the whole opportunity looked cost-effective. In May 2023, we recommended a separate grant of about $600,000 for an external evaluator in each of the three countries to conduct those before-and-after surveys of clubfoot treatment levels, which we hope will give us the extra data we're looking for.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-13\" id=\"fnref-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-13\">[13]</a></sup></p>\n<p>It's possible, of course, that these monitoring activities will tell us that the program doesn't have much of an effect\u2014meaning we might look back several years from now and decide that we wouldn't have made the initial grant, given what we learned. It's a risk inherent in all the work GiveWell does, and, we think, a greater risk for newer-to-us programs like this one. But the upside of a positive finding is considerable! Even learning that the program isn't very effective would be valuable, since it would allow us to more confidently steer our funding toward more cost-effective uses.</p>\n<p>There's a lot we don't know about clubfoot treatment, and a lot we hope to learn in the coming years. We're grateful for the more flexible funding we get from our donors so we can continue to invest in our learning and expand our funding's reach beyond top charities.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-yyvFKmEYiZXxt7Dba-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>\"Congenital talipes equinovarus (CTEV), also known as clubfoot, is a congenital condition characterized by one (unilateral) or both (bilateral) feet twisting inward\u2026.

I have also experienced an identical, though sometimes inconsistent, reaction to:</p><ul><li>Fish</li><li>Soylent</li><li>Shellfish</li><li>Eggplant</li><li>Sweet potato&nbsp;</li><li>Cranberry sauce</li><li>Butternut squash</li><li>Every protein shake mix I have ever tried</li><li>Several mixtures containing none of the above but some hard-to-isolate combination of ingredients</li></ul><p>You will notice that several of the items on the above lists are widely considered key sources of vital nutrients in a vegetarian or vegan diet.</p><p>Coupled with my strong dislike of spicy food, a typical restaurant menu typically contains at most 1-5 entrees I can safely eat. Catered meals often hedge me out entirely. At one (non-EA) event, <i>after listing my allergies in the RSVP</i>, I was served a dinner plate consisting of fish, lima beans, and rice pilaf with peas and celery.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj6xfp804zl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj6xfp804zl\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>Even with these honestly ridiculous constraints, I've found some cheap ways to reduce my dependence on harmfully-produced meat.&nbsp;</p><h3>Reducing harm in an omnivorous diet</h3><p>It's easier to cut the first half of my meat intake than the second half. Diminishing returns apply. By the same logic, two people eating half as much meat is just as good as one person eating none.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some things I've learned while trying to minimize the suffering my diet imposes:</p><ul><li>Tofu is a fine supplement in many dishes, and rice is a cheap and flexible staple.&nbsp;</li><li>Green vegetables like spinach and broccoli make good additions to any diet.</li><li>Nuts and many dried fruits are nutrient-rich. Also, peanuts and cashews add a nice crunchy texture to homemade rice dishes.&nbsp;</li><li>I can also eat cooked eggs and yogurt, and I've heard some convincing arguments in favor of eggs being less harmful than chicken and dairy less harmful than beef.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcmr44wbhief\"><sup><a href=\"#fncmr44wbhief\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(Edit: eggs <a href=\"https://foodimpacts.org/\">may be</a> more <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods/\">harmful </a>than I thought, but dairy still seems promising.)&nbsp;</li><li>I'm distrustful of \"cruelty-free\" branding because so many standards for that kind of thing are false or misleading, but with further research I expect I could find more harm-minimizing options there too. (Edit: <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ubXnfYihRtvg59Nk2/even-an-obligate-omnivore-can-try-to-eat-less-meat?commentId=cG9XtN7oJq5shznRc\">yep!</a>)</li><li>Being allergic to fish really hurts, because I think fish probably suffer less than birds or mammals, if at all. If I could eat more fish instead of meat, I would.&nbsp;</li><li>I could probably bring myself to eat insect-based protein if it were a) actually available where I live and b) not recognizably still a whole bug at the time. Still working on that angle.&nbsp;</li><li>I'm tentatively excited about lab-grown meat.</li><li>My wife and I did some math and determined we aren't getting enough protein in our diets, so we're stepping up meat intake overall, but it's still a significant improvement over my past eating habits. I used to cook lots of chicken.</li><li>My wife can eat beans and likes them fine. We don't have to eat the same things, especially when leftovers are available.&nbsp;</li><li>We do a lot of home cooking, buy foods that keep, and try not to waste anything.</li></ul><p>If you have other ideas for reducing diet-induced harm, please share!&nbsp;</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Even if you can't or don't want to fully expunge meat from your diet, it's possible to significantly reduce your meat intake. It's an easier lifestyle change, and I bet it's easier to encourage the average person to adopt a policy of meat-reduction than outright veganism.

The phone call quickly turned sour as she believed I was making a grave mistake and that I was being unjust. This was not unique - I talked to two other individuals raised in East Asian households which elicited similar if not stronger responses. One friend told me that coming out vegan elicited a stronger response than coming out as gay.</p><p>Effective Altruism's moral roots are weird. Really weird to those raised on a western ethical system and absurdly weird to those raised on an eastern ethical system.</p><p>This is because following the virtues of effective altruism can often lead to conflict within Eastern ethical systems. Being virtuous requires us to stick to a moral code, even if that means clashing with personal relationships. Otherwise, virtue would demand that we keep doing things that aren't morally right just to keep the peace in our circles. This dilemma can be difficult for everyone, but it's particularly challenging for those of us brought up in Asian households.</p><p>Take my mother's moral compass, for instance. It closely reflects the Chinese ethos, which in turn is heavily influenced by Confucian principles. In the Confucian view of virtue, the focus is on fulfilling one's duties within a socially hierarchical and communal framework. This is articulated through key concepts such as \"ren\" or benevolence, often expressed through the cultural concept of \"mianzi\" or face, which is deeply embedded in social relationships. A core expectation within the family is to fulfill one's duties, especially towards one's parents.</p><p>In the eyes of Confucian virtue, my vegetarianism disrupts this order. The sharing of food, often including meat, is a significant social ritual in Chinese culture, promoting family cohesion. My deviation from this norm is seen as a violation of the principle of \"Li\", disrupting harmony and causing displeasure at the family table. My mother\u2019s emotionally charged conversations with me reflects this deep-rooted cultural clash.</p><p>In many Asian cultures, there are two important ideas. The first is \"guanxi,\" or the idea that everyone is connected and relies on each other. The second are the unbreakable responsibilities to your parents, called \"filial piety.\" These ideas are a big part of the way people think and act in these cultures, and they create a complicated set of rules and expectations for how people should behave.</p><p>This can make it hard for someone to do something different, because it might upset this delicate balance. Often, what's seen as most important is what's best for the family or community, even if it means sacrificing your own personal beliefs.</p><p>So, for someone from these cultures to take on the role of an Effective Altruist - someone who tries to do the most good possible - it could be seen as going against their culture and disappointing those around them. It's like they're rejecting their roots and the values their community holds in high regard.</p><p>While pursuing an Effective Altruist moral framework may be hard for all, it is certainty harder for those of from these Asian backgrounds. The communal ties and expectations so core to eastern philosophy does not appear in the west.</p><p>Vegetarianism itself was made all the more challenging by the meat-heavy diets reguarly seen on dinner tables in Asian circles today. The rapid development of Asia has led to an increase in meat consumption, as the rise in living standards often associates meat with luxury and nutritional completeness. For many families who could only enjoy meat sparingly in their earlier years, its abundance now symbolises not just improved economic status, but a diet perceived as more balanced and nutritious.</p><p>Looking back on that intense conversation with my mum, the feelings of disappointment and disagreement remind me how complicated it can be to bring western ideas like Effective Altruism into eastern ways of thinking. Effective Altruism isn't just about changing our habits\u2014it's a whole new way of thinking that can sometimes be alien to those around us.</p><p>The path of an EA often presents greater challenges for individuals raised in Asian cultures where the emphasis shifts from communal responsibility and harmony to individual actions and beliefs. The hardship and complexities of this interaction, sadly, often fly under the radar. Sometimes, we should recognise cultural nuances and ethical disparities that might make this journey more difficult for some than others.</p><p><i>Thank you to </i><a href=\"https://atalkingbill.substack.com/p/do-i-need-to-be-a-bad-child-to-be?r=1mnprj&amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;utm_campaign=post\"><i><u>Bill</u></i></a><i> for this guest post!

It also discusses some ideas for how you might be able to help solve this problem.</p><p>This post includes the top-line summary of the profile. Following that, I draw out the highlights that seem particularly relevant for the EA community.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QQFzQKoQdpd58wa6K/nzmah6rohwksek1ytsld\"><figcaption>The heavy tail of war battle deaths (note the log-log scale). We just don't know how far into the tail of terrible outcomes a modern great power war could take us.</figcaption></figure><h1>Profile Summary</h1><blockquote><p>Economic growth and technological progress have bolstered the arsenals of the world\u2019s most powerful countries. That means the next war between them could be far worse than World War II, the deadliest conflict humanity has yet experienced.</p><p>Could such a war actually occur? We can\u2019t rule out the possibility. Technical accidents or diplomatic misunderstandings could spark a conflict that quickly escalates. Or international tension could cause leaders to decide they\u2019re better off fighting than negotiating.</p><p>It seems hard to make progress on this problem. It\u2019s also less neglected than some of the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">problems that we think are <i>most</i> pressing</a>. There are certain issues, like making nuclear weapons or military artificial intelligence systems safer, which seem promising \u2014 although it may be more impactful to work on reducing <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\">risks from AI</a>, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/preventing-catastrophic-pandemics/full-report/\">bioweapons</a> or <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/nuclear-security/\">nuclear weapons</a> directly. You might also be able to reduce the chances of misunderstandings and miscalculations by developing expertise in one of the most important bilateral relationships (such as that between the United States and China).</p><p>Finally, by making conflict less likely, reducing competitive pressures on the development of dangerous technology, and improving international cooperation, you might be helping to reduce other risks, like the chance of future pandemics.</p><h1>Overall view&nbsp;</h1><h2>Recommended</h2><p>Working on this issue seems to be among the best ways of <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/future-generations/\">improving the long-term future</a> we know of, but all else equal, we think it\u2019s less pressing than our <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">highest priority areas</a> (primarily because it seems less neglected and harder to solve).</p><h2>Importance:</h2><p>There's a significant chance that a new great power war occurs this century.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the world's most powerful countries haven't fought directly since World War II, war has been a constant throughout human history. There have been numerous close calls, and several issues could cause diplomatic disputes in the years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>These considerations, along with forecasts and statistical models, lead me to think there's about a one-in-three chance that a new great power war breaks out in roughly the next 30 years.</p><p>Few wars cause more than a million casualties and the next great power war would probably be smaller than that. However, there's some chance it could escalate massively. Today the great powers have much larger economies, more powerful weapons, and bigger military budgets than they did in the past. An all-out war could kill far more people than even World War II, the worst war we've yet experienced.&nbsp;</p><p>Could it become an <i>existentially threatening</i> war \u2014 one that could cause human extinction or significantly damage the prospects of the long-term future? It's very difficult to say. But my best current guess is that the chance of an existential catastrophe due to war in the next century is <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/great-power-conflict/#total-existential-risk\">somewhere between 0.05% and 2%</a>.</p><h2>Neglectedness:</h2><p>War is a lot less neglected than some of our other top problems. There are thousands of people in governments, think tanks, and universities already working on this problem. But some solutions or approaches remain neglected. One particularly promising approach is to develop expertise at the intersection of international conflict and another of our top problems. Experts who understand both geopolitical dynamics and risks from advanced artificial intelligence, for example, are sorely needed.</p><h2>Solvability:</h2><p>Reducing the risk of great power war seems very difficult. But there are specific technical problems that can be solved to make weapons systems safer or less likely to trigger catastrophic outcomes. And in the best case, working on this problem can have a leverage effect, making the development of several dangerous technologies safer by improving international cooperation and making them less likely to be deployed in war.</p><p>At the end of this profile, I suggest <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/great-power-conflict/#issues-to-focus-on\">five issues which I\u2019d be particularly excited to see people work on</a>. These are:</p><ul><li>Developing expertise in the riskiest bilateral relationships</li><li>Learning how to manage international crises quickly and effectively and ensuring the systems to do so are properly maintained</li><li>Doing research to improve particularly important foreign policies, like strategies for sanctions and deterrence</li><li>Improving how nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction are governed at the international level</li><li>Improving how such weapons are controlled at the national level</li></ul></blockquote><h1>Highlights for an EA audience</h1><p>The full profile is a major update to 80k\u2019s content on great power conflict. It\u2019s also a kind of update to my <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/great-power-conflict\">Founders Pledge report</a> and previous Forum posts on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mBM4y2CjfYef4DGcd/modelling-great-power-conflict-as-an-existential-risk-factor\">conflict as a risk factor</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aSzxoj7irC5jNHceB/how-likely-is-world-war-iii\">the likelihood of World War III</a>, and the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PyZCqLrDTJrQofEf7/how-bad-could-a-war-get\">potential for catastrophic wars</a> (co-authored with <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/rani_martin\">Rani Martin</a>).</p><p>Some highlights and updates that seem particularly relevant to an EA audience are:</p><ul><li><strong>Revised forecasts of the likelihood of major conflict this century</strong>. I haven\u2019t updated majorly since \u201cHow Likely is WWIII?\u201d. Before 2050, I think there\u2019s a 30-40% chance we see direct conflict between great power countries and a 10% chance we see a war we could reasonably call World War III.<ul><li>I\u2019ve added a lot of detail in the profile about how a war could happen through rapid escalation following a technical or human error or as a result of a bargaining failure (adopting the useful framework from <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/chris-blattman-five-reasons-wars-happen/\">Prof. Chris Blattman</a>\u2019s book&nbsp;<i>Why We Fight</i>)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Some new thinking about how likely war is to cause an existential catastrophe</strong>. I make rough estimates of the likelihood of both an extinction war and a civilizational collapse or trajectory-bending war. The latter is much more likely but its effects are much more uncertain. On the whole I estimate the amount of x-risk war poses this century to be between 0.05% and 2% (thanks to Benjamin Hilton for his help with this section).<ul><li>I think I overestimated the risk of an extinction-level war in \u201cHow Likely is WWIII?\u201d, but this is partly offset by accounting for other ways war could cause an existential catastrophe</li></ul></li><li><strong>I\u2019m more confident that enormous wars are possible and even worryingly likely</strong>. Rani&nbsp;Martin and I had previously <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PyZCqLrDTJrQofEf7/how-bad-could-a-war-get#Conclusion\"><u>speculated</u></a> that enormous wars much larger than WWII are even less likely than statistical models imply. I now don\u2019t weigh those considerations very highly.<ul><li>Instead, I think the evidence from statistical analyses, theoretical models, and forecasts all suggest that a modern global war could indeed escalate to kill hundreds of millions or billions of people.</li></ul></li><li><strong>I raise the tricky issue of subtle trajectory changes</strong>. Any major great power war seems likely to have a bunch of important, long-lasting effects even if it doesn\u2019t threaten us with extinction. They shift global power balances, and in their aftermath borders can be redrawn, institutions created or destroyed, and technological development pathways altered.<ul><li>I\u2019m still very unsure how to think about the expected net effect of these factors and mostly skirt the issue. But I wanted to raise it as a potential useful departure point for future work.</li></ul></li><li><strong>I think a bit more about how to prioritise work on this topic vs. 80,000 Hours\u2019 other priorities.</strong> Ultimately I do think other existential risks seem potentially more important&nbsp;<i>and</i> less neglected than global conflict. But I do think this is still a pathway some people in the EA community should pursue, for a few reasons.&nbsp;<ul><li>There may be relatively low-hanging fruit to pick&nbsp;<i>within</i> the area that a scope-sensitive, impact-focused, altruistic person can work on.&nbsp;</li><li>Personal fit factors could very plausibly overwhelm other factors.&nbsp;</li><li>I think developing expertise at the intersection of geopolitics/diplomacy and some other important issue (like AI risk or US-China relations) seems highly and robustly valuable.</li></ul></li><li><strong>I suggest some places&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/great-power-conflict/#where-can-you-work\"><strong><u>where people could work</u></strong></a><strong> and&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/great-power-conflict/#issues-to-focus-on\"><strong><u>issues that they could focus on</u></strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;Those issues are:</strong><ul><li>The riskiest bilateral relationships. Become an expert on US-China, US-Russia, or China-India relations.</li><li>Crisis management. Think about how to avoid and de-escalate technical accidents, international misperceptions, or border conflicts.</li><li>Scrutinising important foreign policies, like US export control policy</li><li>How to govern weapons of mass destruction and emerging weapons technologies at the international level</li><li>How to control and keep such weapons safe at the national level</li></ul></li></ul><p>I tried to load the profile with concrete examples and anecdotes, including the stories of the most devastating conflicts and near-misses throughout history.</p><p>Naturally, the Paraguayan War of 1864-70 warrants a paragraph of its own (real ones know).</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QQFzQKoQdpd58wa6K/a89lwa7lk1hy2kdcbbsf\"><figcaption><i>The Battle of Ava\u00ed </i>by Pedro Am\u00e9rico.

Striking a balance between incremental progress and ambitious policy ideas while framing recommendations will not just make the proposal(s) more palatable, but also serve as a useful exercise to test whether you enjoy straddling these considerations. Interacting with experts will help a lot in ensuring the proposals are grounded in reality. We encourage using those considerations to guide brainstorming.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Study and acknowledge existing work</li></ul><p>Many ideas and arguments that might initially seem novel most likely have been proposed in the past (perhaps under different framing). Doing your due diligence and acknowledging past work will make your proposals more robust and ensure that you are not rehashing points but adding to the conversation.</p><p>Overall, the competition really did help us feel like our ideas were part of the next generation of biosecurity. Participating helped us refine our understanding of past issues, incentives, and constraints in order to effectively prioritise action that will work in the real world in a way that doesn\u2019t come naturally from just engaging with articles, books, webinars and posts. We hope you find similar values out of the process.

They are hiring for a <a href=\"https://awepeople.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/External_Careers/jobs/\">lot of jobs</a> (177!), but there are two software engineer jobs (a <a href=\"https://awepeople.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/External_Careers/jobs/details/Analyst-Software-Developer_R12976-1?q=Systems%20Assessments%20Battle%20Modelling%20Team\">junior</a> and <a href=\"https://awepeople.wd3.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/External_Careers/jobs/details/Senior-Software-Developer_R12786-1?q=Systems%20Assessments%20Battle%20Modelling%20Team\">senior</a> one) on the \"Systems Assessments Battle Modelling Team\" that jumped out at me as being relevant to people trying to build knowledge/career capital in nuclear security. Here's a snippet from the senior job description:</p><blockquote><p>A unique opportunity has arisen within a dynamic and diverse team assessing the effects that nuclear weapons have on the offence and defence systems during a nuclear battle. The role includes the managing and development of complex computational models to enhance existing wargaming capability within the team and to run, analyse and visualise results from these models to inform key Government decisions for many years into the future.</p></blockquote><p>...</p><blockquote><p>The Systems Assessments Group (SAG) is a multi-discipline group, providing mission effectiveness and weapons effects assessments to AWE and our government stakeholders. We contribute a range of capabilities in support of the UK\u2019s national nuclear security and treaty verification requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Battle Modelling Team within SAG covers a broad domain encompassing radiation transport, atmospheric physics and nuclear physics, mathematical algorithm development, operational analysis, Monte Carlo modelling and software development. The successful candidate will have qualifications and experience in software development and at least one of the other disciplines.</p></blockquote><p>I'm not really sure about the ethics of working for a company that literally builds nuclear weapons, personally I would feel guilty about doing that. But, someone else would do it anyway and you are likely to be able to build career capital that would be hard to get elsewhere.</p>", "user": {"username": "Will Howard"}}]
