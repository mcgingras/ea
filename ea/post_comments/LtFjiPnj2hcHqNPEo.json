Those are very relevant questions! They are also quite complex and hard to give a clear answer to. Some thoughts below.</p><ol><li>We have not conducted a detailed analysis on the trajectory of Nigeria vs. China. This seems like an interesting avenue for further research though, as Nigeria is one of <i>the</i> countries to watch out for. Quickly comparing meat consumption vs. GDP per capita over time via <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production#meat-consumption-tends-to-rise-as-we-get-richer\">Our World in Data</a> suggests that meat consumption per capita in Nigeria will be significantly lower than for China at comparable income levels. The two graphs below illustrate this. The first one shows the latest data (2020) for current meat consumption and GDP per capita. The second one shows data for 2004, when China had similar GDP/capita levels as Nigeria had in 2020. We can see that China's meat consumption levels were much higher than those of Nigeria at comparable income levels (40-50 kg vs. 5-10 kg per person). It thus seems unlikely that Nigeria will match China's meat consumption patterns. Of course, this is only a shallow analysis and should not be taken with much confidence. In any case, Nigeria is expected to see rapid increases in meat consumption over the next years and decades and should probably receive more attention from the animal advocacy community.<br><br><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/maeihfwljss2azo6udrs\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/gbrqb62vvnoei680cnvw 80w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/qwjriqo3pmrqwgckqgsj 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/mpv7aas10b526eglghv6 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/xtgjp8tmxodovyeahg4p 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/fckzo8k9vncbmjev18gu 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/boiiy4ft97u7ji2nqqde 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/zzxmv8uxapb9xncx00rw 560w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/luu45x1gwelvysk2i0cx 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/r1mogebdmj6ebuhsvli6 720w\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/wpdzuqgaiellktzhajmp\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/iekpgvdd5ngkv3fnfiap 158w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/vk42b7tzj8lmohrdwagd 238w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/gzhci5uwxr0guqb6drlq 318w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/s1456f6p8zxvs1it3ucn 398w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/i4pu0gf4aqsufrcl2vva 478w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/lbgqhl4uhujgrwgvhral 558w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/qtr9vtyjctsjqo68kwux 638w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yA4iRwtRRevFR5ei6/hgdsuyzy6rqnfwhutfew 718w\"></li><li>Various scenarios are plausible and we are highly uncertain about how this will play out.
