How can that be justified? Did you consider that it might have just led the reform to occur slightly earlier?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How confident are you that there is really room-for-more-funding for the next campaign, or will SFI likely get enough funds to run it even without EA involvement?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given what (I think) is limited room for more funding, perhaps you should be highlighting and boosting the other highly rated charities a bit more? Consider also that people may not look literally at all your details and may use it as a loose proxy. The 'Smoke Free Israel is the best' charity might get interpreted as 'charities that work on domestic Israeli politics/health issues are among the most effective.' Whereas I suspect that in general, health interventions in poor countries, and perhaps also the alternative proteins work, may be more effective as a general recommendation.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "david_reinstein"}}, {"_id": "yJnwWRGJkBGnvqKJE", "postedAt": "2023-08-28T22:55:47.573Z", "postId": "BLqJdZAgsvyWX7fug", "htmlBody": "<p>Fantastic work!
