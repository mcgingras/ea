Our point is not only that VC markets are inefficient and thus the EMH may not apply, but also that the EMH is only a statement on the pricing of assets, and does not in fact imply that all available assets will be funded. Thus, it is possible for investments that offer market-rate returns to go unfunded and for the EMH to still hold.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, in VC, investors and founders can actually negotiate the pricing for an investment round. Thus, it may be possible for most/all startups to produce market-rate returns if the valuation is tweaked (for example, founders getting less dollars per share than they are asking investors for in a priced round), but since many startups don't even get an investment offer, clearly not all market-rate investments are being funded.</p>\n<p>Even if this is not the case, altruistic investors/impact investors are willing to make concessionary investments in which expected returns are lower than the market rate. For example impact investors give loans to nonprofits or disadvantaged communities at interest rates lower than the market rate, gaining both impact returns and financial returns, whereas for-profit investors may pass because they are only looking at financial returns.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, it seems like the consensus is that primary market investments (like VC investing and loans directly to people and organizations) are much higher impact than secondary market investments, and I agree with this consensus. I think there may be the chance that creative secondary market strategies, like forms of shareholder advocacy, may have a counterfactual impact (the exact degree of which is unclear), but I haven't looked into it much yet.</p>\n<p>\"I'm interested in further research on this concept, and I'm not sure how much EA-aligned for-profits are already working on this.\"</p>\n<p>Which concept are you referring to?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "iPw8vy7mmN6nWnbgF", "user": {"username": "Brendon_Wong"}}, {"_id": "nNWwFyJrnzp9oFsEB", "postedAt": "2021-11-15T21:21:14.657Z", "postId": "Ch5NZ7LhsY3mumMzn", "htmlBody": "<p>This is a great analysis!</p><p>I'm working on an EA-aligned public benefit corporation (www.dozy.health) with similar ambitions as Mind Ease, but for insomnia treatment.

Headspace and Calm strike me more as \"mindfulness apps\" versus \"mental health apps.\" For instance, it doesn't look like Mindspace and Calm feature any CBT exercises, whereas Sanvello does. I have paid access to Calm via my employer, and while I haven't used it much, it looks like all it has are guided meditations. Reviews of <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/headspace-review#what-is-it\">Headspace</a> and <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/calm-app-reviews\">Calm</a> support my initial impression and mention that they just have guided meditation and music. I &nbsp;expect that evidence-based practices specifically designed to target certain mental health conditions are significantly more efficacious than guided mindfulness meditations.</p><p>This distinction might've made it so that this <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/how-do-life/201902/the-sanvello-app\">Psychology Today review</a> from 2019 mentions Sanvello as \"the most popular\" mental health app, ignoring Headspace and Calm. Regarding competition, it mentions that Sanvello has 2.6 million registered users, which is smaller than Headspace and Calm but still seems significant. It seems like other apps, including ones I've never heard of, have also been able to get decent user counts. For example, Moodpath <a href=\"\">reached 1 million downloads</a> in 2019. Regardless of whether Headspace and Calm are competitors, Sanvello and other apps would still need to be competed against. Unlike other industries, like network effects with social media, I don't think that the major mindfulness/mental health apps have enough of a moat to prevent other competitors from emerging.</p><p>My understanding is that Headspace and Calm offer their vast majority of their content behind a paywall. The Headspace review I linked to suggests free users get access to one-third of a \"Basics\" (introductory meditation) course before they need to pay.</p><p>What constitutes releasing an app for free as \"working?\" It's commonly known that free apps get many more downloads and are the <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/263797/number-of-applications-for-mobile-phones/\">vast majority</a> of apps on the iOS and Android app store, so I would expect that this would be a very effective user acquisition strategy (but perhaps not an effective monetization strategy, hence the social impact angle).</p><blockquote><p>The Pacifica study that Hauke cites compares counseling alone to counseling + Pacifica.

Thank you for sharing your views on this analysis that you completed while you were at Rethink Priorities.</p>\n<p>The difference between your estimates and Hauke's certainly made our work more interesting.</p>\n<p>A few points that may be of general interest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For both analysts we used 3 estimates, an 'optimistic guess', 'best guess' and 'pessimistic guess'.</li>\n<li>For users from middle-income countries we doubled the impact estimates. Without reviewing our report/notes in detail, I don't recall the  rationale for the specific value of this multiplier. The basic idea is that high-income countries are better served, more competitive markets, so apps are more likely to find users with worse counterfactuals in middle income countries.</li>\n<li>The estimates were meant to be conditional on Mind Ease achieving some degree of success. We simply assumed the impact of failure scenarios is 0. Hauke's analysis seems to have made more clear use of this aspect. Not only is Hauke's reading of the literature more optimistic, but he is more optimistic about how much more effective a successful Mind Ease will be relative to the competition.</li>\n<li>Indeed the values we used for Derek's analysis, for high income countries, were all less than 0.01. We simplified the 3 estimates, doing a weighted average across the two types of countries, into the single value of 0.01 for Derek's analysis after rounding up (I think the true number may be more like 0.006). The calculations in the post use rounded values so it is easier for a reader to follow. Nevertheless, the results are in line with our more detailed calculations in the original report.</li>\n<li>Similar to this point of rounding, we simplified the explanation of the robustness tilt we applied. It wasn't just about Derek vs Hauke. It was also along the dimensions of the business analysis (e.g. success probabilities). We simplified the framing of the robustness tilt both here and in a 'Fermi Estimate' section of the original report because we believed that it is conceptually clearer to only talk about the one dimension.</li>\n<li>What would I suggest to someone who would like to penalize the estimate more or less for all the uncertainty? Adjust the impact return.</li>\n<li><strong>How can you adjust the impact return in a consistent way?</strong> Of course, to make analyses like this useful you would want to do them in a consistent fashion. There isn't a golden standard for how to control the strength of the robustness tilts we used. But you can think of the tilt we applied (in the original report) as being like being told a coin is fair (50/50) and then assuming it is biased to 80% heads (if heads is the side you don't want). This is an expression of how different our tilted probability distribution was from the distribution in the base model (the effect on the impact estimate was more severe; 1-0.02/(0.25/2+0.01/2)=85%). There is a way of assessing this \"degree of coin-equivalent tilt\" for any tilt of any model. So if you felt another startup had the same level of uncertainty as Mind Ease you could tilt your model of it until you get the same degree of tilt.

An early reviewer of our analysis also made a similar point. In the end we are fairly confident this turns out to not be a key consideration. The key reason is that mental health is generally found to be a service for which people's willingness to pay is far below the actual value (to them). Especially for likely paying customer markets of e.g. high-income country iPhone users, the subscription costs were judged to be trivial compared to changes in their mental health. This is why, if I remember correctly, this consideration didn't feature more prominently in Hauke's report (on the potential impacts on the customers). Since it didn't survive there, it also didn't make it into the investment report.</p>\n<p>I'm not quite sure I understand the point about the customer donating to the BACO instead. That could definitely be a good thing. But it would mean an average customer with anxiety choosing to donate to a highly effective charity (presumably instead of not buying the App). This seems unlikely. More importantly, it doesn't seem like the investor can influence it?...</p>\n<p>In short, since the expected customers are reasonably well off non-EAs, concerns about customer wallet or donations didn't come into play.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "A7nmfscMCM499dC2o", "user": {"username": "jh"}}, {"_id": "JhNCYfNzNW4n3oPtP", "postedAt": "2021-12-23T15:12:08.558Z", "postId": "Ch5NZ7LhsY3mumMzn", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for the response.

The payment of the customers was accounted for as a negligible (negative) contribution to the net impact per customer.</p>\n<p>To put it another way: Think of the highly anxious customers each will get $100 in benefits from the App plus 0.02 DALYs averted (for themselves) on top of this. The additional DALYs being discounted for the potential they could use another App.</p>\n<p>Say the App fee is $100 dollars. This means to unlock the additional DALYs the users as a group will pay $400 million over 8 years.</p>\n<p>The investor puts in their $1 million to increase the chances the customers have the option to spend the $400m. In return they expect a percentage of the $400m (after operating costs, other investors shares, the founders shares). But they are also having a counterfactual effect on the chance the customers have/use this option.</p>\n<p>This is basically a scaled up version of a simple story where the investor gives a girl called Alice a loan so he can get some therapy. The investor would still hope Alice repays them with interest. But they also believe that without their help to get started she would have been less like to get help for herself. Should they have just paid for her therapy? Well, if she is a well-off, western iPhone user who comfortably buys lattes everyday, then that's surely ineffective altruism.

The message of the post is that specific impact investments can pass a high effectiveness bar (i.e. $50 / DALY). If the investor thinks most of their donation opportunities are around $50/DALY, then they should see Mind Ease as a nice way to add to their impact.</p>\n<p>If their bar is $5/DALY (i.e. they see much more effective donation opportunities) then Mind Ease will be less attractive. It might not justify the cost of evaluating it and monitoring it. But for EAs who are investment experts the costs will be lower. So this is all less an exhortation for non-investor EAs to learn about investing, and more a way for investor EAs to add to their impact.</p>\n<p>Overall, the point of the post is a meta-level argument that we can compare donation and investment funding opportunities in this way.

I haven't seen too many examples of that in EA analyses, but let me know if you find any on the EA Forum! I can think of a few difficulties associated with doing that and I'm not sure how people would overcome that, including establishing a counterfactual personal impact benchmark (what is the baseline impact of the EA that would have been hired?) and modeling the additive impact of additional team members (does going from 10 to 30 team members triple the impact? under what impact scenarios would that occur?). Also, not all team members would need to be \"EAs\" (what even counts as EA?), and I think that can also be hard to forecast and is somewhat dependent on the team and how things end up working out (whether people end up joining from within or outside EA).</p>", "parentCommentId": "C2n6nx7wL9cfarQxt", "user": {"username": "Brendon_Wong"}}]
