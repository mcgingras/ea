Its methods leave it incapable of addressing historically sedimented structural injustices and intergenerational injuries, since these aren\u2019t the sorts of things that can be quantified by EA-style metrics.</p></blockquote><p>This seems conceptually confused. Any kind of injustice or injury could, in principle, be associated with an estimated welfare cost. (Unless it was literally harmless, but that's surely not what they intend.)</p><p>I know there have been past methodological critiques of the particular vein of classic (GiveWell-style) EA that was addressed to aid skeptics and focused on just the most robustly-evidenced global health interventions. But obviously there's nothing in utilitarianism (or EA more broadly) that rules out making use of more speculative evidence and expected-value reasoning.</p><p>It sounds to me like their real complaint is something like: <i>How dare EA/utilitarianism prioritize other things over my pet causes, just because there's no reason to think that my pet causes are optimal?</i>&nbsp;</p><p>E.g.: \"To grasp how disastrously an apparently altruistic movement has run off course, consider that... covering the costs of caring for survivors of industrial animal farming in sanctuaries is seen as a bad use of funds.\"</p><p>Note that they don't even <i>attempt </i>to offer reasons for thinking that animal sanctuaries are a better use of funds than existing EA priorities. Indeed, they don't seem to acknowledge the reality of tradeoffs at all. &nbsp;It's just supposed to be obvious that refusing funding to them and their allies is \"grievous harm\".</p><p>Hopefully some of the papers in the volume will offer some actual arguments that are worth engaging with.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "RYC"}}, {"_id": "ahEEDAnXBDuJfw8eQ", "postedAt": "2023-01-18T06:29:43.943Z", "postId": "Ny3v2Qe4LfaYJYKcq", "htmlBody": "<p>This comment reads to me as unnecessarily adversarial and as a strawman of the authors' position.</p><blockquote><p>It sounds to me like their real complaint is something like: <i>How dare EA/utilitarianism prioritize other things over my pet causes, just because there's no reason to think that my pet causes are optimal?</i>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I think a more likely explanation of the authors' position includes cruxes like:</p><ul><li>disagreeing with the assumption of maximization (and underlying assumptions about the aggregation of utility), such that arguments about optimality are not relevant</li><li>moral partiality, e.g. a view that people have special obligations towards those in their local community</li><li>weighting (in)justice much more strongly than the average EA, such that the correction of (certain) historical wrongs is a very high priority</li><li>disagreements about the (non-consequentialist) badness of e.g. foreign philanthropic interventions</li></ul><p>Your description of their position may very well be compatible with mine, they do write with a somewhat disparaging tone, and I expect to strongly disagree with many of the book's arguments (including for some of the reasons you point out).

While they might be obvious to community members, many of those nuances, counterarguments to naive objections, etc. aren't in easy-to-find descriptions of EA.

It is very hard for critics of EA to keep up with the rapid pace at which the EA movement evolves, particularly given that academic research tends to move slowly.

This seems like cherry picking to me. There are plenty of examples of morally wrong anger, from the petty - the violent drunkard - to the grand - a Hitler or Stalin inciting people to hatred based off perceived historical injustice. Any reasonable evaluation of anger has to take into account the pretty high <i>ex ante</i> probability that anger is clouding your judgement and your cause is unjust. On average I would guess that historically angry people have more typically been in the wrong morally, and the mere fact that someone is angry doesn't seem like it should be evidence to third parties that they are in the right.&nbsp;</p><p>Anger also seems generally harmful because it leads to nursing grievances. At a personal level these seem psychologically unhealthy - my understanding is the most scientifically supported form of therapy, CBT, in part encourages people to stop dwelling on issues, and at a civilization level, we have gained enormously from the triumph of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Bourgeois-Virtues-Ethics-Age-Commerce/dp/0226556646\">Bourgeois Virtues</a> and productive collaboration over honour culture and endless cycles of vengeance.&nbsp;</p><p>All these arguments seem especially true when doing philosophy - maybe anger is appropriate when a burglar breaks into your house, but it is not at all helpful when trying to make a logical argument. Logical arguments are good because there is a strong reason they should tend to push us towards the truth; if we instead reward anger, we encourage an arms race of escalating rage with only negative consequences for the world.</p>", "parentCommentId": "ELvyq9pYcuTYbqT9n", "user": {"username": "Larks"}}, {"_id": "8YxxP2kZzSwAipexP", "postedAt": "2023-01-19T18:18:09.796Z", "postId": "Ny3v2Qe4LfaYJYKcq", "htmlBody": "<p>Srinivasan is not focused on the question of whether anger is counterproductive, harmful, or has bad consequences.
