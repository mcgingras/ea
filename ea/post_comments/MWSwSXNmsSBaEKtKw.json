This is a great question. There's a lot of uncertainty here but here's a few thoughts:</p><ol><li>Postpartum insusceptibility is likely a decent chunk of it -- i.e. some women have \"redundant\" protection where they were already 100% protected from pregnancy, so the modern contraception does nothing in the short term, or they were mostly protected and the modern contraception only adds a small marginal benefit</li><li>For some of the studies, there was a higher contraceptive uptake at 12 months postpartum in the intervention group than the control but the contraceptive uptake in intervention and control groups was similar at 2 years postpartum -- it seems that some PPFP interventions are primarily shifting contraceptive uptake sooner, where postpartum insusceptibility is a particularly strong factor.</li><li>Behavior related to family planning is really complex and can be unpredictable/unexpected. For example, the women who&nbsp; start using contraception because of a program are likely not a representative sample of the population; in fact, they may be skewed towards people who are at a lower risk of getting pregnant, because they're more careful in other ways.&nbsp;</li></ol>", "parentCommentId": "pjPganZjjgHGysTS9", "user": {"username": "Sarah H"}}, {"_id": "geL5G4QBNKm8ZfPaE", "postedAt": "2024-03-18T04:48:29.715Z", "postId": "MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw", "htmlBody": "<p>Good on you for being courageous and scout-minded enough to shut this down (and to start it in the first place)!
