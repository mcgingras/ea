Congrats on everything :D</p><p>I think there are a few ways I can help:</p><p><strong>NZ:</strong> You've probably already thought of this, but you should reach out to <a href=\"https://effectivealtruism.nz/\">New Zealand EA</a>! I know a couple of people in the NZ EA community \u2014 DM me if you'd like to be put in touch.</p><p><strong>LAW:</strong> You could also reach out to the <a href=\"https://www.legalpriorities.org/\">Legal Priorities Project</a> for connections with the EA &amp; Law community. <a href=\"https://law.stanford.edu/stanford-law-school-effective-altruism/\">SLEA</a> and <a href=\"https://orgs.law.harvard.edu/effectivealtruism/\">HLSEA</a> are two other options.</p><p><strong>OPEN QUESTIONS:</strong> A lot of your \"Open Questions\" seem like (with a little tweaking) pretty good questions for forecasting, like the type on <a href=\"https://metaculus.com\">Metaculus</a> or <a href=\"https://www.infer-pub.com/\">INFER</a>. At a minimum, you could post a few markets on <a href=\"https://manifold.markets\">Manifold</a>, but you could also go bigger and get decision-relevant info from other platforms. Let me know if you want more help with this \u2014 forecasting as a field can seem a lot more intimidating than it actually is!</p><p><strong>OTHER/EVERYTHING:</strong> You can/should post on the EA Groups Slack and the EA Anywhere Slack (if appropriate). They each have channel(s) dedicated to \"opportunities\" or \"careers\" or \"resources\" etc.</p><p>Hope I could help! Let me know if there's anything else I can help with \u2014 can't wait to see y'all at EAG London :)</p><p>~ Saul Munn</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Saul"}}, {"_id": "rQje7bigDfyx7AZQC", "postedAt": "2023-05-05T15:01:08.102Z", "postId": "G2vPqkCZkJusKGLtK", "htmlBody": "<p>This is something people won't know unless they were in the CE cohort/office, but Mandy and Rainer are an exceptionally productive pair.
