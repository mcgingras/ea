In reply:</p><ol><li>The time for parenting, in my experience, comes mostly from spending less time watching less TV, playing computer games, and reading; doing less traveling and socializing with friends; and working in a different way -- cutting out wasted time on low-priority things, learning to say no to irrelevant distractions, and learning how to collaborate, outsource, and delegate more efficiently. It's very important to have a partner/spouse/co-parent who's smart, efficient, and pragmatic at organizing life, and figuring out good, sustainable, divisions of labor.</li><li>My older daughter (age 26) was fully grown when I had my younger daughter (age 6 months), so I haven't had the experience of raising two young kids at the same time. However, I was raising older daughter at the same time as I was helping to care for my teenage step-son, and task-switching between them could be challenging (i.e. not treating a toddler as if they're a teen, or vice-versa).&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Regarding sleep: it's absolutely crucial to sleep-train a baby starting around 3-4 months old, using behaviorist learning principles that can be emotionally challenging to implement at first (e.g. ignoring baby crying for certain lengths of time), but that are hugely beneficial in the long run (e.g. having to wake up with them only twice a night, rather than six times a night.) &nbsp;Once a kid is about 2-3 years old, they'll typically sleep through the night. And remember, young kids sleep MUCH more than adults -- our baby typically goes to sleep around 6:30 pm and wakes around 6:30 am -- plus has four 40-minute naps during the day. So there's quite a bit of time when they're just sleeping in their crib.</p><p>Regarding the dangers of working less: I was very worried about this as a post-doc (age 30) having a kid, and being concerned about getting an academic job and tenure. However, I found that having a baby was enormously motivating. The book I'd been procrastinating about writing for 3 years suddenly got written within a fairly short period, because I really needed the advance money to buy a bigger house for the family. My career strategizing, which had been rather self-indulgent and haphazard, got laser-focused on getting a good stable tenure-track job with decent pay and good colleagues -- and it worked. All because being a parent forces one to get very realistic about money, time, job stability, and career goals, very quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding job and fulfillment: every parent I know says there's a qualitatively new kind of fulfillment that comes from having kids. When my first daughter was born, I immediately thought, 'Why did I waste so much of my life before this, in things that now seem meaningless?' &nbsp;This might be a trick that evolution plays on our brains, but it works! Also, competent and effective parents can still find plenty of time to socialize, enjoy Game of Thrones, read, relax, etc. It's not nearly as easy to travel or go to Burning Man, but it's possible, especially with older kids.</p>", "parentCommentId": "3Frcn5hxJBNkxSuL3", "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "wDyYJteunWfn2bhje", "postedAt": "2022-09-27T01:01:12.047Z", "postId": "PxwdLvYA8HvRkWXnH", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Prof. Miller,</p><p>Do you think I should spend effort and research and care about the particulars of having kids ahead of time even though I largely perceive myself as possibly/probably never wanting to have kids? &nbsp;It certainly seems reasonable to strongly expect I might eventually fully change my mind about having kids just because having kids is - well - genetically mandated and such. Preparing and planning now seems like a wise hedge against my lack of desire to have kids right now?</p><p>I am a 30 year old male now and am still sorta mostly leaning towards not having kids. Is that normally a sign that this is how I should expect my psychology to be throughout my thirties and forties? And I should just not sweat it and continue to focus on studying AI Alignment?</p><p>Secondly, do you think there is a &nbsp;good pronatalist argument to be made that an EA that doesn't feel like they want kids <i>should </i>still regardless have kids? I've heard the \"in expectation if EAs all have kids we'll get more geniuses - low prob. in each case, but such high potential impact that we ought to have kids\" argument. I take this line of thinking seriously, but I still find it hard to think that this argument could ever be strong enough to - on consequentialist grounds - mean someone who doesn't want kids should have kids regardless.</p><p>Thirdly, I find the idea of adopting pulls at my heartstrings, but have lost track of how many times I've heard the argument that I should have my own kids to pass on my genes. Naturally sperm bank donations are always an option if I am rationally committed to the latter.

If you don't sleep train a baby, you also end up sleep deprived, which makes you irritable and frustrated. On the other hand, the happiness is very frequent and strong (assuming baby is healthy and well). I'm naturally quite introverted, dysthymic, and irritable, but being around a happy baby makes me playful, delighted, and grounded; often I've been smiling so much at the end of the day that my face muscles hurt (which rarely happens around adults.)</p><p>Regarding thinking clearly, the only real cognitive deficits from parenting come from sleep deprivation (which is mostly avoidable), and from having a bit less time for self-care in terms of exercise, nutrition, nootropics, and cognitively stimulating socializing.</p>", "parentCommentId": "tfF2EDbneDMtycg83", "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "75damcQndoexBCphC", "postedAt": "2022-09-27T01:21:26.216Z", "postId": "PxwdLvYA8HvRkWXnH", "htmlBody": "<p>Cornelis - very thoughtful questions.&nbsp;</p><p>I would strongly recommend doing some serious research and thinking about this issue now, while you're 30. Partly to plan ahead and prioritize, partly to get clarity before getting seriously involved with a partner (who will probably want that clarity up front!), partly to be able to empathize more effectively with both parents and non-parents, in terms of the tradeoffs they've faced. Being male does buy you a bit more elbow room in terms of reproductive timing; you could potentially wait until your 50s. Mutation load in sperm does slightly increase with age, but it's not a very big effect. Energy for parenting does slightly decrease with age, but not that quickly if you stay in shape.</p><p>In my experience, and among male friends and colleagues, it's fairly rare for guys to have a strong, specific desire to have kids, at least until they meet a woman who seems exciting to have kids with. Evolution seems to have figured that if we have a sex drive and good mate choice, we don't need a specific desire for kids. Contraception makes that heuristic less effective now.</p><p>Regarding sperm donation, I think it's a very sensible thing to do, if you qualify; I think it's ethical to allow any resulting kids to contact you when they're a teen if they want to. I think raising one's own kids is often significantly more rewarding than raising adopted kids, just because one's own kids will share so much more of one's cognitive traits, personality traits, quirks, etc, that you can empathize better with them.</p><p>The pronatalism argument is something I should write about in more detail later. I don't think that reproducing oneself just in order to maximize total number of geniuses is that compelling an argument -- one could 'offset' genius-reproduction by encouraging other smart people to have kids, promoting pronatalism, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I do think there are some specific benefits of becoming a parent, especially for someone working on AI alignment: (1) you get a LOT of insights into how learning works, if you view babies and kids as little 'machine learning systems', and if you read some developmental psychology, (2) you become much more longtermist and future-oriented, personally concerned about the fate of your kids and future grandkids, and more strongly motivated to minimize X risks, (3) you get a lot more credibility with parents when discussing X risks, longtermism, alignment, etc -- they don't want to be reassured that 'AGI will be safe, trust us!' or 'AGI is a big danger that deserves more attention, trust us!' by childless people with no skin in the game.</p>", "parentCommentId": "wDyYJteunWfn2bhje", "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "ukmxjQktomW8qeroe", "postedAt": "2022-09-27T01:28:29.213Z", "postId": "PxwdLvYA8HvRkWXnH", "htmlBody": "<p>PS for EAs considering having kids, I would strongly recommend two books by economist Bryan Caplan:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>'<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Reasons-Have-More-Kids/dp/0465028616/\">Selfish reasons to have more kids</a>' (2012), which explains that the high heritability of most psychological traits means you can relax and 'trust your genes' as a parent, without trying to hothouse and overschedule and push your kids the way that most American parents do</li><li>'<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Case-against-Education-System-Waste-ebook/dp/B07T3QRNLC/\">The case against education</a>' (2019), which explains why the exact types of schooling your kids get don't actually have much long-term impact on how they turn out, once you control for their cognitive and emotional traits -- e.g. it won't matter that much whether you do public school, private school, home school, or unschooling</li></ol><p>Also, for people curious about nature vs. nurture issues in how kids turn out, I'd recommend popular behavior genetics books such as '<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blueprint-new-afterword-How-Makes-ebook/dp/B08BT69SZK/\">Blueprint</a>' (2019) by Robert Plomin, or the classic '<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Blank-Slate-Modern-Denial-Nature-ebook/dp/B000QCTNIM/\">The blank slate</a>' (2001) by Steven Pinker.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "CTM4Q42aZxZyCbfux", "postedAt": "2022-09-27T02:02:04.471Z", "postId": "PxwdLvYA8HvRkWXnH", "htmlBody": "<p>I would love to hear any elaboration on how sleep deprivation is mostly avoidable.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "LmNKmYWKddDdb4zDG", "user": null}, {"_id": "RBSZJPSoMTniR2Qzd", "postedAt": "2022-09-27T02:22:00.901Z", "postId": "PxwdLvYA8HvRkWXnH", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you very much for this offer - I have many questions, but I don't want to eat away too much of your time, so feel free to answer as few or as many of my questions as you choose.

While this may increase your work load, I think that if you crossposted this on <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/\">LessWrong</a>, its members would also find this post valuable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Background&nbsp;</strong></p><p>My partner and I are both in our early-mid 20's (we are only 2 months apart in our ages) and are interested in having children. More specifically, we currently believe that our first child, should we have any children together, will likely be born 6.5 to 9.5 years from now. We are thinking about having 2-4 children, but the final number depends on my partner's experiences with childbirth and on our collective experience of raising the first, second, etc... child. Some members of my partner's family experience depression and my partner has a mild connective tissue disorder. Members of my family deal with some depression as well. My partner and I are thinking about using embryo selection to address for these things and to potentially optimize the IQ of our children, among other features that might have polygenic scores. We might also consider using gene-editing if it is available, but we definitely have to think more about this. The current health risks to both the host and embryo involved with IVF and egg extraction make my partner nervous, but she thinks she is more likely than not to follow through with the procedure. As for temperament, my partner and I are both relatively calm and inquisitive people and broadly share the same parenting values, though we haven't, of course, fully scoped these values out. I suspect that I might be more conservative or rigid than her with my future parenting practices, but much of this comes from me having not yet formed beliefs about what works and what doesn't with parenting and instead making precaution my default mode of operation. Now, onto the questions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Optimal Timing</strong></p><p>How much do my partner and I stand to lose in terms of our children's health and psychological development if we were to have our first child at age ~28 versus at age ~32. We might have up to 4 children, so assuming each child is 2 years apart in age: &nbsp;\"first child at 28\" scenario ==&gt; new child at ages 28, 30, 32, and 34; \"first child at 33\" scenario ==&gt; new child at ages 33, 35, 37, and 39. While I am unfamiliar with the details of the research, my current belief are \"risk of child having health defects due to older father only really begin to increase, on average, when fathers reach around the age of 40\" and \"risk of child having health defects due to older mother increase, on average, in early 30s\". I think it is important to consider how old my partner and I will when our youngest child is 10 in each scenario: 44 for the first scenario and 49 for the second scenario. I am unaware of how large the difference in physical ability / stamina is for the ages 20 vs. 30, 30 vs. 40, 40 vs. 50, etc... but I feel that 44 vs. 49 constitutes a large difference in stamina.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Embryo Selection and IVF</strong></p><p>Do you have any forecasts concerning embryo selection and IVF? Some example questions: How much do you think IVF will cost in 2027? in 2032? How do you think the risks associated with IVF and egg extraction with change in the next 6 years? In what ways do you think polygenic screening will improve in the next 6 years? What are you thoughts on the safety, morality, and practicality of embryo selection today, and how do you think this will change in the next 6 years?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nature vs. Nurture</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Can you provide a concise reflection of the current consensus of the genetics / biology community on this question? Your answer might contribute marginally to my parenting attitudes and behavior.</p><p><strong>Naming</strong></p><p>There are two primary questions I have on this. (1) In your experience, how much do you believe a person's name affects their life outcomes? My current belief is for the overwhelming majority of people the effect is marginal. (2) What do you think are the effects of having your children call you by your first name instead of by something like \"Mommy\" or \"Daddy\"? My partner and I intend to have our children call us by our first names.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Holidays</strong></p><p>Assuming that my partner and I raise our children in a sparsely populated suburb or rural region in the Eastern USA, do you think never celebrating holidays such as Christmas or birthdays would have a strong effect on the psychological development of our children? My partner and I intend to avoid celebrating any conventional holidays, except for Halloween, and to celebrate the Solstices and Equinoxes instead.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Twins&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If we had the option to do this, do you think it would be a good idea to have 2 pairs of twins instead of 4 children, i.e. generally speaking, do people who have a twin sibling experience higher levels of well-being, and if so, would recommend this option?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Birth Order</strong></p><p>From what I've read, it appears that, at least among many current indigenous societies, the demographic that predominantly plays with and cares for children beyond the mother and father are adolescent females. With this in mind, might it make more sense to have the first child be a female? Additionally, I've come across the idea that the last child of families with more than 2 children typically has more estrogen than other the children, on average. What are some of the consequences of birth order by sex, assuming that my partner and I have 4 children and that each of these children are born 2 years apart? For example, would you suspect that the well-being of the following group, in order of birth from 1st born to last born, (F, M, M, F) experiences higher well-being than (M, F, F, M), all other things controlled for, hypothetically?</p><p><strong>Geographical location</strong></p><p>My partner and I are considering forming some establishment in a region with forests, some terrain, a low population density, and low air pollution* that is at most 3 hours away from an urban area. Some regions in the Eastern US comes to mind here. The air pollution part has an asterisk next to it since I highly value this consideration for where to raise children. Generally speaking, what might be some disadvantages to raising children in such an area? I suspect that a potential lack of immediate access to healthcare services might be one.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Education and technology</strong></p><p>My partner and I plan to home-school our children until they are college age. We suspect that socialization might be a large issue if we follow through with this plan. I intend to instruct my children in many subjects and would very much like for them to develop strong critical thinking skills, a curiosity and wonder with the universe, and a general mental framework for how the world works. This is all standard though; do you have any recommendations for inculcating these things across the various developmental milestones? For example, it might be the case that I should primarily talk to an X year old in such a way because they have not developed Y capacity yet. Also, I am quite keen on limiting the access of my children when they are young (0-10, but this upper bound is something that I need to think about) to most of YouTube (except for educational channels), most of the Internet (except for educational websites or resources), and all of television. I intend to teach my children at least the basics of electronics and programming, so their engagement with the technology involved with these things would be openly encouraged. What would might be some consequences on the mental development of my children of me taking these actions? Of course, your answer is not the sole consideration for my decision.</p><p><strong>Emotions and Discipline</strong></p><p>My partner and I are both highly conflict avoidant. We are both quite calm most of the time and are not too affected by anger or frustration, though we do feel such things occasionally. We intend to not display frustration, anger, or intense exasperation in front of our children, but don't know if this a good idea. Are there some emotions or reactions that should not be shown to children as they may lead to a weakened ability to deal with / tolerate certain aspects of human interaction / the world? Also, my partner and I are both unaware of what the most developmentally beneficial forms of discipline are for children. For one heuristic, we are considering making an effort to enforce disciplinary action <i>immediately</i> in response to some undesirable action, and to always follow throw with what we promise and warn about.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a long list of questions, but thank you for reading it if you've gotten to the end.

As a woman, three of my greatest concerns are timing (the whole biological clock thing), paternal investment, and social environment for child rearing. Big shocker I know :)</p><ol><li>Someone else already asked about timing, but I think my question is slightly different. Regarding timing, I am keenly aware of the trade-offs between a) being younger and having more physical energy and strength but fewer financial resources accumulated and b) being older and having less physical strength but having greater financial resources. I\u2019ve pretty much accepted the fact that at some point I will have to take a physical hit and a career hit if I want to procreate, but I feel conflicted about when the best time for this is. Physically, earlier seems better. Financially, later seems better. Mentally, I\u2019m not sure.

I sometimes get the sinking feeling that even the most invested male partner I could ever find would not be able to deliver the kind of childcare or domestic skills that women are capable of delivering, which feel essential to the entire enterprise of procreating. The caretaking of both men, children, and the elderly seems to fall on women\u2019s shoulders disproportionately, which is frustrating for any woman who wants to do or be anything other than a caretaker, especially in countries with less governmental support. I\u2019m writing these things based on the structure and gender roles of our society, statistics on gender and families for which I would be happy to make a link post if anyone wants it, and in spite of men\u2019s best efforts (which in turn make me think that successful child rearing is not so much about selecting an invested mate as it is about finding a community of women to help with kids). Not trying to say that men aren\u2019t capable of being great parents or having good domestic skills (a lot of both great and inept dads out there), just sometimes that it feels this way from my perspective. <i><strong>My questions are, what do you think optimal paternal investment looks like or what do you think it should look like?

One is domestic work, and another is child care.&nbsp;</p><p>I think I largely feel this way because I see that men generally don\u2019t have as strong domestic skills, and are not socialized in a way that they either have or highly value these skills. Laundry, cooking, cleaning, stuff like that. I get the sense that most men pick up these skills later in life, whereas a lot of women seem to have (more of) them to begin with (I know that there are plenty of counter examples for this and that it is a generalization). I think men are less likely to care about maintaining a clean household, or \u201crunning a household,\u201d or engaging in domestic work largely for the sake of others. In some cultures, it even seems like children themselves contribute more domestic work (and/or childcare) than men do. Maybe domestic work isn\u2019t all that important to creating a good family environment. Maybe it is.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of childcare, I think men can be great, imaginative caretakers, but that on average first time fathers have much less experience with babies and children than first time mothers (again, I\u2019m sure there are many counter examples out there, but I am talking about averages). I also believe that men tend to be more risk taking than women, and that this can manifest in their child care. In some cases, letting children take more risks might be good developmentally speaking. In other cases, not so much. If women perceive men as both a) less skilled or experienced caretakers and/or b) more risk taking, then they may be disinclined to hand the babies over. (Again, speaking in generalizations, I know there are dads out there who are very nervous / careful / risk averse / protective.)</p><p>Some larger things underlying sex differences in domestic skills and/or caretaking skills might be developmental differences or cognitive differences (chemical changes caused by gestation?) or differences in empathy.

I allowed for the possibility I\u2019d change my mind, but I wanted to prioritize my career. Around 35 or 36 I started to want kids. I found that health issues meant that having kids is not an option now. I did test my fertility in my early 30s and it was normal, but things changed rapidly. I am quite heart-broken about it and expect this to be one of my greatest life regrets.</p>\n<p>If it helps anyone else, here were my reasons for changing my mind. (It wasn\u2019t just my biological clock, though of course that was part of it):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I didn\u2019t want kids because I expected to put ongoing, lifelong energy into my romantic relationship(s), career, and hobbies. I\u2019ve always had some health issues so I didn\u2019t expect to have surplus energy for kids. But in fact, I reached relative career stability and relationship stability by 35 and knew how to manage my health. I strongly desire personal growth. While I expect to continue to find that at work sometimes, the rate has slowed down more than I expected.  I felt a growing interest in adding another lifelong endeavor to my portfolio of projects, outside of work. I love contributing to others\u2019 development and my hobbies are compatible with kids. Kids started looking like a great addition to life that I would have energy for. Planning for kids actually made my work and hobbies feel more fun because I was excited to teach my kids about them at home and to discover their own related or differing interests.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The responsibility of parenthood seemed overwhelming to me. As I aged, I noticed that new responsibilities always feel overwhelming at first but that is something that can be overcome. This no longer seemed like a good reason not to parent.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I previously worried that parenting would reduce my impact. I now think that having a large impact is uncertain anyway due to my health issues and the kind of work I do. With less certainty about my impact at scale, I actually felt more motivated to keep pushing in my job because I thought I would be working toward supporting a family.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I previously thought kids might be boring or I might not be a very interesting or engaged parent. Seeing my nieces and nephews change over time has been really rewarding for me though and has brought a lot of happiness and engagement with my extended family. I noticed I found it really rewarding to contribute to the kids\u2019 learning, they inspire me to create more in order to share new experiences with them, and they make familiar experiences more engaging because they interpret the world in unexpected ways. I find myself very engaged in supporting and discovering who these people will become as they grow up!</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I worried I\u2019d lose my individual agency and identity to motherhood.  It is definitely true that I\u2019m less focused on my own needs and wants when I\u2019m around kids, so this is a real risk. However, my attitude changed about motherhood: having kids means creating new agents, and then (ideally) supporting them in becoming independent. I felt excited about taking on the goal of being a role model of agency to my kid(s).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As I age, I value stability more than I used to.  I saw that my social life and community would be more stable if I had kids. When I was planning to be child-free, I planned to build a community of close friends instead of a nuclear family. My partner and I both thought we\u2019d pursue a variety of potentially high-risk work projects as well. A lot of EAs probably want the same in their twenties and some do pull it off! I\u2019ve become less extroverted, less social, and more risk averse with age, however, which makes pulling that off less likely.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I underestimated how hard stable community is to maintain in the US. I underestimated just how much of US culture pushes against non-nuclear family structures and how much that\u2019s still  true even in an unconventional community like EA. I\u2019m the US, so much of society is organized around the atomized nuclear family that it is really much harder than I expected to buck the trend. In my circles, parents+kids create the bulk of social connections outside of work and generate a lot of common experiences, especially in secular communities. Even among my poly+EA+queer friends (where innovating around family is expected), it\u2019s most common for people to make long-term plans that default to a nesting partner and/or kids, rather than making long-term plans with multiple partners or friends.  My EA friends are also globalists who move to different states or countries fairly frequently. Those with kids tend to stay in one place more often.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I also overestimated how much I would <em>personally</em> feel motivated to buck nuclear family norms. I\u2019m not as interested in that as I expected to be! In my 20s, I was happy with innovating on various family and friend living arrangements. In my mid-30s, I find I\u2019d prefer to be able to focus on work, health, and home a lot of the time, but I\u2019d like to do that without being (a) lonely or (b) needing to deal with a lot of roommate turnover. While I have a fairly stable, small peer group of late 20-40yos who I care about a lot, we don\u2019t want to live together and we have ended up living in different neighborhoods or cities for a variety of reasons. Everyone is busy and we don\u2019t see each other as much as we did pre-COVID.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>COVID and working from home has made the world even more atomized! It\u2019s extra valuable to live with loved ones now.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I currently prefer to spend most of my downtime with a small, consistent, core set of people. My 20s were focused on meeting new people. Now, I\u2019d like to go through the daily ups and downs of life with an established core set of people, and keep doing that for a couple decades+. Raising kids through various life stages with my partner and extended family would have produced that dynamic, and likely attracted friends who valued stability as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>-In sum: US EAs who are pinning their hopes on stable, non-nuclear family structures maybe should expect it to be harder to coordinate that than you think. (This may also apply in most western countries; I just know the US context best).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I know there are EA group houses in a few cities now, and that\u2019s great! In my 20s, I predicted that I\u2019d love that. I don\u2019t want to have very many roommates anymore though. I value privacy and, again, stability more than I used to. I also want more separation between my home life and work life than I can get when I\u2019m living with past/present/future EA colleagues. I think EA neighbors in a cohousing community where couples/families each have their own house, would be great. I was excited about raising my kid(s) near EA neighbors.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>All that said, if you\u2019re positive you don\u2019t want kids, that\u2019s great! There are some good reasons not to have kids and people obviously create great lives without having kids. I personally expect I\u2019d have had more long-term happiness and actually plausibly more impact as a mom. Other men and women may find they have similar thoughts to mine in their 30s, even if they don\u2019t lean toward having kids now.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "nananana.nananana.heyhey.anon"}}, {"_id": "wwwzsP6PJCB8LMfaF", "postedAt": "2022-09-28T00:14:36.074Z", "postId": "PxwdLvYA8HvRkWXnH", "htmlBody": "<p>On (1), another consideration you don't mention is that having kids earlier means more years of overlap with your kids and, potentially, grandkids: you'd get to see more of their lives, which is something people usually find pretty rewarding.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "HoRd4KTa2fQJjbC6P", "user": {"username": "Jeff_Kaufman"}}, {"_id": "jKGiMCdZ74jgReswv", "postedAt": "2022-09-28T00:30:48.706Z", "postId": "PxwdLvYA8HvRkWXnH", "htmlBody": "<p>One confounding factor here is that the children that you might potentially adopt are pretty different from the children you might have biologically.

But kids are really good at finding was to frustrate you. I almost never yell at them, but I do get frustrated or exasperated and raise my voice, and it's genuinely unclear to me how anyone could parent a child without doing that.</p><p>In general I think the military wisdom \"no plan survives first contact with the enemy\" is a good rule of thumb for parenting, except substitute \"the enemy\" with \"these small lunatics I never imagined I could love so much.\" My wife and I had bold plans for how we would parent, how we would minimize screen time, how our children would eat healthy foods all the time, and so on. But a lot of that goes out the window when you're tired and have chores to do and the kids won't give you an inch of personal space or you need to make a quick dinner or one kid is potty training and needs near constant attention but your other kid is bored and also wants attention or whatever. We also know other parents who had big plans about how they would parent, and in the end made many compromises.</p><p>All that is to say that I think it's good that you're thinking about how you want to parent. Maybe you'll have more luck than I did sticking to your original plans. And maybe it's good to start with ambitious initial plans, that way if you deviate from them you're still mostly on track, I'm not sure. But I would just advise that I think a key part of parenting is flexibility and prioritizing which values you care about. If you let your three year old watch a TV show a few times a week so you can have some time to get the dishes done or get dinner made, how harmful is that really? If that helps you de-stress a little and leads to less exasperation it may be beneficial on net. Kids differ a lot in personalities and attitudes (it was surprising to me how different my kids can be), so the compromises you need to make may vary depending on what your kid is like, and I think it can help to be mindful of that going in.</p><p>On developing curiosity and wonder I think just sharing fascinating things with your kids whenever possible seems to work well. Sometimes I share something and I can tell my four year old isn't really interested or maybe doesn't understand, and that's fine. But other times I'll show her something cool I can tell she's echoing my excitement and interest in it and asking surprisingly thoughtful questions. I think the big thing is just sharing your excitement about it and trying to include your kid in it. In general making time to share your interests seems to work well, recently I've been watching football with my oldest and explaining the rules and how it works, and even though I don't think she fully understands it she seems to be really enjoying it and picking up a lot of stuff, and I think that's mainly just because she knows I'm trying to include her in it. The same thing happens when I show her pictures from the James Webb space telescope or show her videos of rocket launches or SpaceX landing their boosters or whatever and make the time to explain why I think it's so awesome.</p>", "parentCommentId": "RBSZJPSoMTniR2Qzd", "user": {"username": "Ryan Beck"}}, {"_id": "u67pKyzwxzkTpbmNS", "postedAt": "2022-09-28T03:48:41.532Z", "postId": "PxwdLvYA8HvRkWXnH", "htmlBody": "<p>Another thing is just I wonder: if a strong enough pronatalist argument was presented to me maybe that in itself would make me excited enough to have kids.

This is absolutely crucial in predicting how much longer one's likely to remain fertile -- it's a test of 'ovarian reserve'. AMH seems to be a stronger predictor of a woman's remaining fertility than her chronological age is. &nbsp;(In many countries, you can get an over-the-counter on in-lab <a href=\"https://www.findlabtest.com/lab-test/fertility-test/anti-m%C3%BCllerian-hormone-amh-endocrine-sciences-labcorp-500183\">AMH test</a> for about $100-200 that just requires a finger prick or blood draw.) &nbsp;It's also very helpful to know when one's mother, older sisters, or female relatives reached menopause. To risk-hedge, it can be helpful for women to freeze some eggs and/or embryos by age 30-35, which could use later by the woman herself or by a surrogate.</p><p>Likewise, for men, I think it can make sense to get sperm &nbsp;checked with a lab semen analysis (typically less than $200), to assess semen volume, and sperm count, &nbsp;vitality, motility, and morphology.&nbsp;</p><p>It baffles me that many smart young men and women who invest hundreds of hours into planning their work career won't spend a few hours getting the crucial tests that would allow much more accurate planning of their reproductive career.</p><p>Overall, I think the optimal time to start having kids depends much more on one's romantic partnership situation than on one's education/career. If you've found an excellent mate who's compatible, committed, reliable, pro-child, and likely to be at last moderately successful and financially stable, then the best time might be right after marriage, whenever that is. (Having a kid with someone, without the many legal protections of formal marriage -- protections which seem silly and outdated until the point when you really, really need them -- is &nbsp;foolish and often regretted, IMHO.)&nbsp;</p><p>I'm most familiar with the academic situation when smart young women are trying to decide whether to have kids in grad school, or after they get tenure -- they assume that the 6 years of intense tenure-track work as an assistant professor will make pregnancy impossible then. I think that is a very misguided way to think about it, for a few reasons (1) most universities are actually very generous with parental leave for faculty, and you can pause the 'tenure clock' multiple times before going up for tenure, (2) professors aren't actually that much less busy after tenure than before, (3) realistically, in the current job market, most people who get PhDs in most fields will never get a tenure-track job, so there's a huge danger that women get stuck in 'post-doc limbo' for several years in their late 20s and early 30s, then don't get a tenure-track job until their early/mid 30s, then don't get tenure until their early 40s... and then it might be too late to have kids.

This is not to say that people should pursue a 1950s-style male breadwinner/female housewife model in the 2020s.</p><p>Rather, it's to say that people should learn about the deep evolutionary history of sexual selection and parental investment, the sexual divisions of labor typically found in hunter-gatherer, pastoralist, and agricultural societies, the recent historical changes in parental care patterns, etc. This helps put any negotiations between modern moms and dads in a much more realistic, grounded context.</p><p>One key insight I got from evolutionary biology is that female mammals have evolved for about 70 million years to be very high-investing parents, in terms of gestation (pregnancy), lactation (breast-feeding), foraging (finding and preparing food for offspring), and general maternal care. Whereas, male mammals are typically focused on mating rather than parenting, and typically do either zero parental care, or very minimal protection against infanticide by other males. Human males are extremely unusual in having evolved much more intensive parental care, but this happened only in the last 2-3 million years or so, and it mostly involved increased effort in hunting, protecting the kids and family from rivals within the tribe, protecting the tribe from other tribes, and doing some care-taking and teaching of kids, especially in middle childhood (ages 6-12, roughly) and adolescence (ages 12-18).&nbsp;</p><p>So, from the viewpoint of a modern woman who doesn't appreciate the evolutionary history, it might be frustrating that a man is doing only 40% of the child care instead of 50%. Whereas any other female mammal might feel incredibly envious that a human male is doing 40% rather than 0% as in her own species. This is not to say that a mom shouldn't try to negotiate with the dad to do 50%. It's just to offer some context for why these imbalances often emerge.</p><p>In general, a frequent failure mode for busy couples with kids is that the mom and dad each feel like they're doing much more than their partner, because their own contributions are more salient to them. &nbsp;I think it's important for couples to switch duties and roles enough that they can cover for each other in emergencies, and so they have a full and salient appreciation of what each of them are doing day-to-day for their kids.</p>", "parentCommentId": "L84JaNsFTiqMmjBJy", "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "gEd5oE6tsShYAhoMd", "postedAt": "2022-09-29T10:34:56.530Z", "postId": "PxwdLvYA8HvRkWXnH", "htmlBody": "<p>It's not a question but just thought it'd be nice to share the perspective of somebody who decided not to have children. &nbsp;Always nice to showcase a wide range of views and decisions. Here's an excerpt from my interview with Julia Wise about it. Can read the whole thing <a href=\"https://juliawise.net/interview-with-kat-woods-decision-making-about-having-kids/\">here</a>.</p><p>\"I super, super wanted kids. I didn\u2019t want kids when I was younger, and then when I was about 20 I was in the park, minding my own business and a little toddler toddled up to me and he gave me this bent daisy. And my brain exploded! I was like, \u201cOh my God, I need babies now.\u201d</p><p>I just became absolutely obsessed. EA was my number one priority, and the next one was kids. I actually had a blog about parenting. I was reading all these books about it, reading studies and figuring out exactly how to deal with pregnancy and everything. I\u2019d sit out outside of playgrounds and do my homework next to the playground so I could watch the kids play, just be around them.&nbsp;</p><p>Then I was like: impact. I decided that I wasn\u2019t going to have kids because of impact. And that was the worst. For the longest time, this was the closest I ever felt to giving up because I just felt so resentful.</p><p>Every time I saw a kid, I just felt so horrible. I was like, why the fuck am I doing this? I don\u2019t even know if anything\u2019s working. And this is so important to me.<br><br><i>Julia: What kind of effects were you thinking about on your impact?</i></p><p>Kat: The main thing is just time and energy. Basically every spare amount of energy I had was going towards impact. So there was no room for kids. Any extra thing that I took on as a responsibility, it was definitely just going to have to come from the \u201chelping the world\u201d budget.&nbsp;</p><p>Then I just felt bad all the time. The thing that made me realize that I would actually have kids was realizing: I just have to have one willpower break. I just have to have a willpower break long enough to have a kid, and then it\u2019s over. Then I was like, well, I\u2019m probably going to have the willpower break anyway, so might as well just plan accordingly.</p><h2><strong>Goal factoring and practical experience</strong></h2><p>Kat: So then me and my husband at the time were planning on having kids. But it was never the right time. I thought, maybe I\u2019ll do the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/goal-factoring\">goal factoring</a>. I came up with this spreadsheet. I came up with a whole bunch of different options that you could do. I basically broke down, what are the things I want about children and what are the things that [my partner] wants about children? Because those are different. And then I came up with a whole bunch of like alternatives. Like what about a dog? What about fostering? Volunteering a lot with kids? All sorts of stuff. And that was to tide me over until we could have kids, and maybe find something that didn\u2019t require as much time investment.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we stumbled on babysitting. Oh man, I get to spend time with the kids and develop this relationship with them. But also I get paid for it. Amazing!</p><p>I babysat three separate sets of kids, and they were all perfectly ordinary kids. They were not kids with behavior problems or anything like that. But that was enough for me to realize: oh, I do <i>not</i> want to be a parent. I do not want children at all.&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019d had experience with kids before. I\u2019d been a summer camp leader. I\u2019d worked with 30 plus kids at a time for a whole summer, that sort of stuff. And I loved it, but what I realized when I babysat was that I was just the fun summer camp leader. I went and played games with them, and it\u2019s fun to play with kids. Playing with kids is the best.&nbsp;</p><p>But putting them to bed? Holy shit. Why is it so hard!? I\u2019d read all the books and I was like, oh, I\u2019ll appeal to intrinsic motivation and reason. Nope, does not work. Very quickly I ended up bribing them. I was like, I will give you candy if you go to bed, please.</p><p>Two things that happened:</p><p>The kid who I babysat the most, the first day I came, he was like, let\u2019s make potions. I was like, yeah, let\u2019s make potions! It\u2019s really fun. The next time I came, he\u2019s like, let\u2019s make potions. I was like, oh, we made potions last time. How about we do something different? He\u2019s like \u201cPOTIONS!\u201d Okay, fine. And then it was potions again. And potions again. And I was like, wow, this was fun the first time. And now this is really irritating. I just can\u2019t convince him to do anything else.&nbsp;</p><p>The other thing was one time I was there when his mom was still there and he was eating some cereal at the table. He\u2019s five, right? and he had said something that was kind of racist or sexist, I forget what it was.&nbsp;</p><p>And the mom was just perfect. She had clearly read all the parenting books, and she just responded in the most perfect way. She gave this great speech about how to think about it.</p><p>And I was like, wow, you gave a really good metaphor there, this is so inspiring, you\u2019re such a good mom!&nbsp;</p><p>And the kid just looked up and was like, \u201cMom, I want more sugar.\u201d He didn\u2019t care at all. He was not listening. He just wanted more dopamine.&nbsp;</p><p>I was like, ah, it\u2019s just so destroying.</p><p>I want to be that sort of mom. I want to impart important wisdom and stuff. Obviously I\u2019m sure eventually he\u2019s going to grow up to not be bad or anything. He\u2019s just five and it takes time. But argh!</p><p>So then I ended up not wanting kids at all \u2014 I totally switched. It went from my system one was like, \u201cI want kids,\u201d but my system two was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want them,\u201d to now both of them are in complete agreement.&nbsp;</p><p>I still like playing with kids. Occasionally I\u2019ll get this little twinge, like, aw, they\u2019re so cute. But just give it five minutes. Almost always within five minutes, they\u2019ll do something really annoying. And I\u2019ll be like: ah yes, this is why I don\u2019t want them.&nbsp;</p><p>I think the lesson from this that I took away is that before you have kids, it\u2019s really good to get some babysitting experience. It\u2019s a really good way to cheaply test being as close to being a parent as you can be without actually being a parent, that\u2019s pretty available to most people. Once you have them, you can\u2019t go back, there\u2019s no \u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201d\"</p><p>Full post <a href=\"https://juliawise.net/interview-with-kat-woods-decision-making-about-having-kids/\">here</a>.

IMHO, three big ways that 'babysitting as a parenting trial' doesn't quite work are that</p><p>(1) it feels qualitatively different to care for one's own biological children than other people's kids, partly because your own kids will be more genetically and phenotypically similar to you (not just in appearance, but in personality and cognitive traits, quirks, preferences, values, etc) than unrelated kids are, partly because your kids will also resemble whatever lover/spouse/partner you scrambled your genes with, and partly because the process of becoming a parent (being pregnant, giving birth, bonding with baby) activates a whole suite of evolved adaptations for parenting that depend on complex hormonal, epigenetic, and maturation pathways that basically rewire one's brain from non-parent mode into parent mode.</p><p>(2) babysitters don't have nearly as much authority and autonomy as parents in determining a kid's daily routine, schedule, feeding, clothing, discipline strategies, training strategies, household setup, etc., so parenting offers much broader scope for deciding over the longer term how to arrange one's life to optimize child care</p><p>(3) child care has a difficult and frustrating learning curve, so the first few hours (of first few hundreds of hours) of child care as a beginner aren't representative of how one can do child care as an expert (which most parents become by the time their kids are toddlers). Think of all the things you hated at first as a newbie, but learned to love. For example, the first two days of learning to ski or snowboard absolutely suck. You fall over a lot, it's awkward and scary, your muscles get exhausted, you get cold and wet, you can't pay attention to anything fun or scenic about the experience. But then skiing gets awesome from about days three onwards, and you suddenly understand why so many people enjoy it. Same with the first few experiences of public speaking, or the first few dates, or dances, or posts on EA Forum. It can be quite hard to predict how expert-level performance will feel from a few hours of beginner-level experience. (Not that this applies to Kat, who has a lot of babysitting experience; it's more of a cautionary point for EAs who think 'I'll just try babysitting my niece for a couple of hours are use that experience to update my probability of having kids.')</p><p>Another factor I haven't mentioned elsewhere is the issue of giving one's parents grandkids. I grew up in a very pronatalist family; my grandparents had 12 kids, and I have 30 cousins. I always felt a very strong traditionalist, almost deontological imperative to give my own parents grand-kids that they could enjoy, and not to let their bloodline die out with me. I figured, they'd made huge sacrifices to raise me, and I had a moral duty to them to have some kids of my own.&nbsp;</p><p>That might sound weird to some EAs, but think of it an analogous to an AI alignment problem. My parents invested a lot in creating and training me as a little AGI, partly (from an evolutionary perspective) so that I could create and train my own little AGIs in turn. They tried to train me as a good future parent, who had pronatalist values. If I'd decided not to have kids, that would represent a catastrophic alignment failure, from their point of view. And I felt, as a good AGI who felt some moral obligation to my creators, that I shouldn't just drift away from their values -- including the crucial value of becoming grandparents. Of course, in modern societies there's often a strong taboo against parents of adult kids putting much pressure on their kids to produce grandkids. But very few parents of adult kids will be delighted if their kids say 'Sorry, mom and dad, maximizing total future sentient utility in the cosmic light-cone is more important to me than continuing your bloodlines or letting you ever enjoy playing with grandkids'.&nbsp;</p><p>This doesn't mean that one's parents reproductive priorities should always over-ride one's own rational goals. But it does suggest that talking with one's parents (and siblings, and other family stakeholders) might be wise in deciding about the issue of having kids. Some parents might truly not care about grandkids (although this is probably quite rare); some might care a lot, and might suffer bitter, permanent disappointment if they don't get grandkids.

Taking a pill to enjoy drudgery</strong></p><p>On the \"you'll feel differently when it's your own child\" argument. This argument feels strange to me. Imagine some sort of drudgery you hate (e.g. filing taxes or cleaning the toilet). Imagine there's a pill that makes it feel like that's the most meaningful and enjoyable thing ever, and it will make you prioritize it over your existing values and spend millions of dollars on it and tens of thousands of hours on it for the rest of your life. People who take the pill say they love it and would never go back.&nbsp;</p><p>Would you take the pill?&nbsp;</p><p>Some people might because hey, what matters is things <i>feeling</i> meaningful. I wouldn't, because I don't want to add a competing goal thread in mind to compete with my current existing values, no matter how much I'd enjoy it later. (This of course doesn't address things like the learning curve you mentioned)</p><p><strong>2. Parents give biased answers</strong></p><p>Asking parents gives you a biased view because it's hard for parents to psychologically admit that they made a mistake, let alone tell somebody about it. It would just cause too much suffering on their part and would also make them a worse parent.</p><p>And it's more common than you think. I can't find it now, but I remember a survey I read saying that ~10% of parents regretted having children, and that's definitely an understimate, because there's such social desirability bias and most people can't even admit it to themselves.</p><p>To help counter that, I recommend checking out <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/regretfulparents/</a> and watching The Letdown (a funny and as far as I can tell, decently accurate view of the downsides of being a parent).&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, look at both sides.

If a 12-year-old is offered a pill that makes them gradually become sexually mature, so they'll spend huge amount of time, energy, and money for the next 60 years chasing sexual relationships, and thinking that was super meaningful and rewarding, rather than doing cool stuff that kids enjoy, how many would take the puberty-pill? They might think that sexual maturation, which makes all this tedious mating effort, dating, and relationship-investment <i>seem</i> rewarding, is really just self-deceptive nonsense.
