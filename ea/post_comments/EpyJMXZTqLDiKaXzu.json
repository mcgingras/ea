The reason for me doing this is so that I can hopefully do something useful to improve the situation in our community.

However, I think the discourse in EA isn\u2019t that mature yet!

Now being older and more experienced, I see many younger people in EA making the same mistake. By now, I'm convinced that e.g. interest in ethics and actual ethical behavior and character correlate only very mildly. Similarly, there are many people in EA who are not particularly ethical either. Humans are still humans.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "annaleptikon"}}]
