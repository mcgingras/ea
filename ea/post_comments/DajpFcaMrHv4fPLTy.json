A big bad thing happened to the EA community, so CEA is responsible, and so they had a pretty bad year.\u201d (I expect that this is a bit of an oversimplification of your view, but hopefully it helps make the direction clear.)</p><p>An oversimplification of my view is \u201cCEA is responsible for running EAG, EAGx, UGAP, groups support, virtual programs, the EA Forum, EA.org. A couple of these things had middling years, but many of them seemed to grow or improve significantly (like 5x, 2.9x growth). So CEA had a pretty good year, and \u201ca year of continued growth\u201d is a good summary.\u201d</p><p>The key way in which that is an oversimplification is that the Community Health &amp; Special Projects team does have a broader mandate: scanning for risks and trajectory changes to the community and trying to address them. As mentioned in that section, we clearly didn\u2019t prioritise or eliminate this risk - we\u2019re reflecting on how much that was a mistake, versus a good decision (to focus on other significant risks). We are reflecting on what we should do differently to reduce this and related risks in the future, and we\u2019ll communicate more about that in due course. As I say in response to Larks, there may well be things that we end up thinking were big mistakes here, that should cause us to course-correct (and should go on our mistakes page). But we\u2019re not yet confident in if/what the mistakes were, so we didn\u2019t want to add them in this post yet. I should have noted that in that section though - I\u2019ll go and edit.</p><p>So one way I think of this is, should CEA\u2019s annual review be kinda the same thing as EA\u2019s annual review? If I were writing EA\u2019s annual review, there would be a bunch of negative stuff in there, and the overall tone would be pretty different to the above. If this is what CEA\u2019s annual review should be, I did a pretty bad job and you\u2019re right.</p><p>Or should it be more like Rethink Priorities<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefld3lffas5r9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnld3lffas5r9\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;annual review? I think that Rethink Priorities could reasonably be like \u201cOur core work went well! (Footnote: though it's impact may be attenuated by one of EA\u2019s major funders blowing up in a very visible way. We\u2019ll reflect on what that changes for us.)\u201d I think there\u2019s a legit version of CEA\u2019s annual review that is like this, if you view CEA as more being responsible for running EAG, groups support, etc.</p><p>Overall, I think that CEA is clearly somewhere in between these extremes - we\u2019re more focused on and accountable for how EA overall goes than RP are. But my current take, based on how I view CEA's role/mandate, is that it\u2019s a bit more on the \u201cRethink Priorities\u201d end, whereas I guess you think it\u2019s more on the \u201cEA annual review\u201d end. I expect that this partly explains why I took a different approach to the annual review.</p><p>Going through your nitpicks:</p><ul><li>Agree that morale dipped around FTX stuff. My impression is that it\u2019s more back-to-normal, but we should probably have noted this. (And I think it\u2019s a caveat to the overall thing of \u201cdoubled the team size and maintained morale/retention\u201d thing though.)</li><li>Yep, some of the growth was due to FTX attention (but again, this feels like a bit of a footnote - a significant majority of the growth was not to do with FTX, and I think that the FTX growth was an example of the Forum providing real value, by helping people to process the news).&nbsp;</li><li>This is a fair point about Forum quality - I\u2019m aware that some people think this. Our current take, having looked into this a bit and looked over top post lists from previous years, is that the quality is pretty constant but that people are struggling to find the most interesting posts as post volume has increased. This is still a problem, and something that we\u2019re looking to fix. I think that this is an important amendment to the statement in the post, and something I\u2019ll correct.</li><li>Understatement of the FTX thing - I agree the tone is maybe a bit bland here, but I\u2019m not sure it really understates it? \u201cCommunity took a significant hit\u201d seems about the right level.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>To sum up, despite the big-picture disagreement above, I think that you\u2019re right that we should have added a bit more on the setbacks and caveats to the big picture.

Out of the four responses to nitpicks, I agree with the first two. I broadly agree about the third, forum quality. I just think that peak post quality is at best a lagging indicator - if you have higher volume and even your best posts are not as good anymore, that would bode very poorly. Ideally, the forum team would consciously trade off between growth and <em>average</em> post quality, and in some cases favouring the latter, e.g. performing interventions that would improve the latter even if they slowed growth. And the fourth, understatement, I don't think we disagree that much.</p>\n<p>As for summarising the year, it's not quite that I want you say that CEA's year was bad. In one sense, CEA's year was fine, because these events don't necessarily reflect negatively on CEA's current operations. But in another important sense, it was a terrible year for CEA, because these events have a large bearing on whether CEA's overarching goals are being reached. And this could bear on on what operating activities should be performed in future. I think an adequate summary would capture both angles. In an ideal world (where you were unconstrained by legal consequences etc.), I think an annual review post would note that when such seismic events happen, the standard metrics become relatively less important, while strategy becomes more important, and the focus of discussion then rests on the actually important stuff. I can accept that in the real world, that discussion will happen (much) later, but it's important that it happens.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "XJeBB9p2waGpHxEXg", "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "RhzdX7qTrcKDBYqwY", "postedAt": "2022-12-22T15:47:43.866Z", "postId": "DajpFcaMrHv4fPLTy", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>Ideally, the forum team would consciously trade off between growth and&nbsp;<strong>average</strong> post quality [emphasis added]</p></blockquote><p>I disagree.
