As you mention, older people might be especially susceptible to them.

I don't think voters are at all prepared for how vicious, surreal, and damaging these could get.&nbsp;</p><p>To most EAs, deepfakes might sound like a weird branch of the porn industry, or a minor political annoyance, compared to flashy AI developments like GPT. However, I think they really could have an utterly corrosive effect on public discourse, partisanship, and trust in news media.

I don't know if the average adult knows what a deepfake is. If spammed with deepfakes, people might think the world is even crazier than it actually is and I think that could get ugly.

I think that bucket may already be impacting the average adult a fair amount.
