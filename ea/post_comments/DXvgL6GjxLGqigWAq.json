And one YouGov survey (December 2022) showed that 31% of 18-24 year-old Britons described themselves either flexitarian, pescatarian, vegetarian or vegan (53% described themselves as a meat-eater, and 15% as none of the above), and 12% of non-vegans of this age category would like to attempt Veganuary (going vegan for the month of January) in 2023.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmpu9atynmzr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmpu9atynmzr\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p>Additionally, I found <a href=\"https://betterfoodfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Exec-Summary_Serving-Up-Plants-by-Default.pdf\">this interesting study (summary)</a> which investigated the consumer effects of university dining halls serving plant-based meals as the default option. It studied three US universities (Tulane University, Lehigh University, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute). It found that</p><blockquote><p>On Control Days, only 26.9% of dishes served were plant-based. In comparison, on Plant Default Days, 57.6% of dishes served were plant-based. At Tulane and Lehigh, the proportion of plant-based dishes served on Plant Default Days jumped to 81.5%</p></blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote><p>We calculate that food-related greenhouse gas emissions declined by 23.6% on Plant Default Days.</p></blockquote><p>They also say that spillover effect is also taken into account, whereby a proportion of students who would have visited an intervention station on a Control Day decided to avoid the intervention station on a Plant Default Day in search of meat options elsewhere in the dining hall.</p><p>Other key findings of this study include:</p><ol><li>With incorrect implementation, the impact of the default on dish choice vanishes</li><li>Students\u2014including meat eaters\u2014are open to plant-based options</li><li>Dining hall staff found a plant-based default easy\u2014and enjoyable\u2014to implement</li><li>Eating and serving meat continues to be the social norm in campus dining, despite openness by students and staff to shift toward plant-forward choices, which indicates a considerable untapped opportunity for effective interventions, like defaults, to change consumption behaviour<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpddu9d3lro\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpddu9d3lro\">[7]</a></sup></span></li></ol><p>So I guess that yeah there may be some who would be disgruntled about this but the last study mentioned (which was partly commissioned by Sodexo North America by the way), shows that students\u2014including meat eaters\u2014were significantly more likely to express satisfaction with plant-based meals on days when plant-based meals were the default.&nbsp;And Sodexo have also publicly committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by making its college campus planned menus 50% plant-based by 2025.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftcbf241l8l\"><sup><a href=\"#fntcbf241l8l\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;So I do believe that shifting behaviour on an institutional level can force a shift in behaviour on an individual level in the same or a similar direction.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li

could be wrong as I have no concrete evidence). Just shifting away from red meat (even if not fully/partially replaced with plant-based food) could provide a bit of a momentum boost in bringing about institutional climate action regarding food systems change, and could encourage other universities to go even further and try for fully plant-based. Also it could give campaigners at the now red-meatless university a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foot-in-the-door_technique\">foot-in-the-door</a> to go further and push for the removal of all animal products. Removing red meat could also get people thinking about the food/drink they consume when thinking about climate change. Of course, all this can provide a bridge for other issues which animal agriculture exacerbates to become gradually more mainstream too. However, yes there could definitely be (short-term) downsides to a university removing just red meat (and further downsides if the removal of red meat was what was initially campaigned for, though even this still has many positives).</p>", "parentCommentId": "7TuERgqomSsBxfwjT", "user": {"username": "Ois\u00edn Considine"}}, {"_id": "eagFXySNfbFnEiMwn", "postedAt": "2023-09-07T04:40:16.080Z", "postId": "DXvgL6GjxLGqigWAq", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>In policy spaces, this is known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels_effect\">Brussels Effect</a>; that is, when a regulation adopted in one jurisdiction ends up setting a standard followed by many others.</p></blockquote><p>I am not clear how the Brussels effect applies here, especially since we\u2019re not talking manufacturing a product with high costs of running different production lines.
