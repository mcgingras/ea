However, it seems to be based on a model of human motivation that is very dubious, empirically false, and deeply sex-negative.</p><p>You claim that \"Status is sexy<strong>.</strong> Predatorily-minded people know this. Thus, they are incentivized to climb the social EA ladder for the wrong reasons. If we set norms that make it harder for people to leverage their social status for romantic purposes, we can correct for this.\"</p><p>Well, you're right that signaling intelligence, creativity, wisdom, and moral virtues is sexually and romantically attractive. Indeed, what we evolutionary psychologists call 'mating effort' (investing in difficult, challenging behaviors to attract mates) seems to be a major driver of human innovation, insight, and moral progress. (I've spent the last 35 years of my academic &nbsp;career studying this, and published 5 books on it.)</p><p>So, it's not just 'predatorily-minded people' who invest mating effort in giving good talks, writing good EA Forum posts, running podcasts, doing public outreach, offering helpful insights, doing social networking, refining their moral virtues, and defending against existential threats to their group. It is, to a first approximation, all of us.&nbsp;</p><p>Is trying to be romantically attractive the \"wrong reason\" for doing excellent intellectual work, displaying genuine moral virtues, and being friendly at meetings? Well, if they're wrong, what would count as the \"right reasons\" for doing these things? Should we rely instead on careerism? Economic ambition? Intellectual vanity? Pure curiosity? A totally dispassionate, disinterested commitment to maximizing ultra-long-term cosmic sentient welfare?&nbsp;</p><p>People generally do good stuff because they're motivated to get some kind of survival benefit or reproductive benefit from doing good stuff. Mating effort is one of the most powerful and effective motivations -- if it's harnessed in productive ways.</p><p>My concern is that if we sexually neuter all EA groups, meetings, and interactions, and sever the deep human motivational links between our mating effort and our intellectual and moral work, we'll be taking the wind out of EA's sails. We'll end up as lonely, dispirited incels rowing our little boats around in circles, afraid to reach out, afraid to fall in love.</p><p>Put another way, human intellectual and moral culture has already spent centuries figuring out effective ways to tame and channel our mate-seeking, status-seeking, and validation-seeking into positive-sum, socially-beneficial work -- rather than into zero-sum competition, aggression, and warfare. This is basically the story of civilization: sublimating our sexual motivations into doing work for the greater good. (This is one of those rare occasions when Sigmund Freud got something right.)</p><p>The social costs of overt sexual harassment, stalking, and coercion are obvious. So there's a temptation to clamp down on all sex and romance within any subculture that values mutual respect, consent, and professionalism. However, there may be hidden motivational costs and relationship costs to going too far in that sex-negative, romance-deterring directions. &nbsp;</p><p>(Disclosure: I fell in love with my wife Diana Fleischman partly because we were both passionate about EA. I admired her work. She admired my work. If EA had been a more sex-negative, romance-negative subculture, we might not have formed a relationship, gotten married, or had our daughter. I would hate for other EAs not to be able to find like-minded mates within the EA community.)</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "F4jnSkg3C4ugRKLNE", "postedAt": "2023-03-08T07:36:15.442Z", "postId": "EQPY63WzxmqQnWsmS", "htmlBody": "<p>Really good to see some concrete suggestions and experiences, thank you for sharing</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "jooke"}}, {"_id": "HGYiPieRpt95CBSRA", "postedAt": "2023-03-08T10:48:32.319Z", "postId": "EQPY63WzxmqQnWsmS", "htmlBody": "<p>Interesting idea.

I think if someone is taking a particular action, or \"investing in difficult, challenging behaviors <strong>to attract mates</strong>\", it does seem clear there are contexts where the added intention of \"to attract mates\" changes how the interaction feels to me, and contexts where that added intention makes the interaction feel inappropriate. For example, if I'm at work and I think someone is friendly at the meeting because they primarily want to attract a mate vs if they are following professional norms vs if they're a kind person who cares about fostering a welcoming space for discussion, I do consider some reasons better than others.</p><p>While I don't think it's wrong to try to attract mates at a general level, I think this can happen in ways that are deceitful, and ways that leverage power dynamics in a way that's unfair and unpleasant (or worse) for the receiving party.

I appreciate (and am happy for you &amp; Diana!) that there will be folks who benefit from finding like-minded mates in EA. I also agree that often there are overt actions that come with obvious social costs, and \"going too far\" in the other direction seems bad by definition. But I also want to recognise that sometimes there are likely actions that are not \"overtly\" costly, or may even be beneficial for those who are primarily motivated to attract mates, but may be costly in expectation for those who are primarily interested in EA as a professional space, or as a place where they can collaborate with people who also care about tackling some of the most important issues we face today. And I think this is a tradeoff that's important to consider - ultimately the EA I want to see and be part of is one that optimises for doing good, and while that's not mutually exclusive to trying to attract mates within EA, I'd be <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/omoZDu8ScNbot6kXS/beware-surprising-and-suspicious-convergence\">surprised </a>if doing so as the primary goal also happened to be the best approach for doing good.</p>", "parentCommentId": "CcxczRwdxeroR3ZJc", "user": {"username": "bruce"}}, {"_id": "ThKSYLJBEoCCh3gPr", "postedAt": "2023-03-08T13:20:03.344Z", "postId": "EQPY63WzxmqQnWsmS", "htmlBody": "<p>I like the suggestion of new mechanisms for handling this well (don't do X within Y time period).

This motivation state evolved because it tends to promote successful reproduction in prehistory -- even if we're not usually making any conscious connection in the modern world between 'giving an excellent, inspiring talk at an EA Global meeting' and 'maximizing genetic self-replication through attracting mates'.</p><p>Mating effort is often unconscious <i>by evolutionary design</i>, because people benefit from having plausible deniability about whether they're really trying to attract mates (e.g. to minimize interference from sexual rivals, to save face after sexual rejections, &amp; to keep any current mates from being jealous). This leads to 'adaptive self-deception' about what they're really doing, and why. But we can still empirically study the effects of mating effort by seeing how it's influenced by the contextual/environmental factors (e.g. it tends to be lower when local sexual norms inhibit courtship).&nbsp;</p><p>So what I'm really trying to argue here is that if EA's sexual norms over-correct for sexual harassment issues by going in an extremely sex-negative direction, &nbsp;without any understanding or acceptance of how mating effort drives a lot of human intellectual, moral, and social life, then we will (1) reduce the formation of happy romantic relationships within EA (which is a significant cost in terms of sentient well-being), and (2) take some of the (unconscious) motivation for excellence and morality out of EA work and social networking.</p>", "parentCommentId": "NCqkhp8RBfjMvJmsv", "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "fttfA935AXvxrnFoT", "postedAt": "2023-03-08T16:57:55.011Z", "postId": "EQPY63WzxmqQnWsmS", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>Well, you're right that signaling intelligence, creativity, wisdom, and moral virtues is sexually and romantically attractive.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Signaling intelligence, creativity, wisdom, and moral virtues is not the same as signaling social power by leading events.</p><p>To the extent that people have power through their roles, that's not directly about signaling intelligence, creativity, wisdom, and moral virtues.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "CcxczRwdxeroR3ZJc", "user": {"username": "ChristianKleineidam"}}, {"_id": "QuBxEm7fhnBYNvMWc", "postedAt": "2023-03-08T16:59:12.926Z", "postId": "EQPY63WzxmqQnWsmS", "htmlBody": "<p>This is anecdotal, but a similar rule &nbsp;was implemented in a non-EA community group I was in a long time ago, and &nbsp;the level of misconduct decreased significantly.
