However, it has recently been shown that data and code used in economics papers frequently contains errors, making it difficult for readers to confirm the findings (Chang and Li 2015). We therefore hired two graduate students to audit the data and code for this paper. They were compensated on an hourly basis, and paid a bonus for any errors they identified. We report the errors they identified and changes they suggested in Online Appendix Section 20. The errors were minor and did not materially change the results and interpretation. We also report which suggested changes we rejected, and why.</p></blockquote><p>so I assume a similar level of care in Egger et al., on which he is coauthor</p>", "parentCommentId": "RTLsytMYhTW93hscg", "user": {"username": "setgree"}}, {"_id": "GF8ghfkgJSExdgfkx", "postedAt": "2023-11-17T19:11:51.127Z", "postId": "W2FD7oGoSCW2QLHbo", "htmlBody": "<p>The effect of health insurance on health, such as the old RAND study, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Medicaid_health_experiment\">Oregon Medicaid expansion</a>, the India study from a couple years ago, or whatever else is out there.</p><p>Robin Hanson likes to <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/karnataka-hospital-insurance-experimenthtml\">cite these studies as showing</a> that more medicine doesn't improve health, but I'm skeptical of the inference from 'not statistically significant' to 'no effect' (I'm in the comments there as \"Unnamed\").
