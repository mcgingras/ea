This seems to actually encapsulate the core idea of AI safety / alignment, roughly that a system which is capable of engendering vasts amounts of scientific and economic gains for humanity need not be (and is unlikely to be) aligned with human values and flourishing by default and thus is capable of taking actions that may cause great harm to humanity. &nbsp;The Future of Life's page on the <a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/background/benefits-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/\">Benefits and Risk of AI</a> comments on this:</p><blockquote><p><strong>The AI is programmed to do something beneficial, but it develops a destructive method for achieving its goal:</strong>&nbsp;This can happen whenever we fail to fully align the AI\u2019s goals with ours, which is strikingly difficult.</p></blockquote><p>Needless to comment on this further, but the worst outcomes possible from unaligned AI seem extremely likely to exceed unemployment in severity.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "rodeo_flagellum"}}, {"_id": "fHdsmnMmpkf68kGAC", "postedAt": "2022-09-26T00:41:53.837Z", "postId": "ZEdeivnidwsbsGyuD", "htmlBody": "<p>I don't think it's just about \"methods\".
