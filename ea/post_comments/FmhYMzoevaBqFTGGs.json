Really shocking. Appalling, really. It's worth taking a few minutes to soak in the dark implications.&nbsp;</p><p>It's hard to imagine any other industry full of smart people in which researchers themselves realize that what they're doing is barely likely to have a net positive impact on the world. And in which a large proportion believe that they're likely to impose massive suffering and catastrophe on everyone -- including their own friends, families, and kids.</p><p>Yet that's where we are with the AI industry. Almost all of the ML researchers seem to understand 'We might be the baddies'. And a much higher proportion seem to understand the catastrophic risks in 2022 than in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet they carry on doing what they're doing, despite knowing the risks. Perhaps they're motivated by curiosity, hubris, wealth, fame, status, or prestige. (Aren't we all?) Perhaps these motives overwhelm their moral qualms about what they're doing.</p><p>But IMHO, any person with ethical integrity who found themselves working in an industry where the consensual prediction among their peers is that their work is fairly likely to lead straight to an extinction-level catastrophe would take a step back, re-assess, and re-think whether they should really be pushing ahead.&nbsp;</p><p>I know all the arguments about the inevitability of AI arms races, between companies and between nation-states. But we're not really in a geopolitical arms race. There are very few countries with the talent, money, GPU clusters, and determination to pursue advanced AI. North Korea, Iran, Russia, and other dubious nations are not going to catch up any time soon. China is falling behind, relatively speaking.&nbsp;</p><p>The few major players in the American AI industry are far, far more advanced than the companies in any other country at this point. We're really just talking about a few thousand ML researchers associated with OpenAI/Microsoft, Deepmind/Google, and a handful of other companies. Almost all American. Pushing ahead, knowing the risks, knowing they're far in advance of any other country. It's insane. It's sociopathic. And I don't understand why EAs are still bending over backwards to try to stay friendly with this industry, trying to gently nudge them into taking 'alignment' more seriously, trying to portray them as working for the greater good. They are the baddies, and they increasingly know it, and we know it, and we should call them out on it.</p><p>Sorry for the feisty tone here.
