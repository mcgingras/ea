It's also a matter of embracing broader public communication values -- e.g. respect for the audience's time, good will, and ability to contribute to the conversation, and respect for their varying levels of knowledge, backgrounds, levels of fatigue, distraction, and mood, neurodiversity, etc.</p><p>This is a crucial time when the EA, Rationalist, and X risk communities either make a positive &amp; decisive impact on the public discourse -- or when we confuse, alienate, and aggravate people.&nbsp;</p><p>One good heuristic when communicating on social media is to try to cultivate more self-aware about which technical terms, arguments, and writing styles are more intended to do status-signaling and virtue-signaling for one's ingroup (e.g. other EAs), versus which are actually intended to communicate effectively with ordinary folks outside the ingroup. Almost always, there's a tradeoff. What's impressive to our EA peers typically won't be persuasive outside EA.
