But, don't rely on (visual) oversimplifications, see for yourself.'</p><p>The former is more conducive to limited critical thinking, while the latter can stimulate it.</p><p>Further, the arrow-anchor setup can be understood as normalizing abuse (as the only viable option) (an arrow can symbolize a direction without the request for or agreement to such and an anchor can symbolize threat of the use of force and limited consideration, since it is a heavy sharp object not related to the topics). The normalization of abuse could worsen epistemics within EA and limit the community's skills in cooperation on positive impact.</p><p>In general, viewers can pay the most attention to the portrayal of threats, even if that is not apparent or they are not consciously aware of it. Under threat/stressed, viewers may be more likely to click on content, seeking to resolve the negative feeling that compels them to action.</p><p>Another reason why viewers may be paying attention to content that can be interpreted as abusive but where that is not <i>prima facie</i> apparent is that they seek assurance in the positive intent of/ability to trust the resource (or advertisement). For example, if one feels that an ad is threatening abuse but the text is positive, they can be more likely to read it, to confirm positive intent/seek trust.</p><p>These attention captivation techniques motivate impulsive/intuitive decisionmaking (based on chemical/hormonal processes?) and limit reasoning and deep thinking. These techniques can also motivate impulsive sharing of content, because it evolutionarily makes sense to share threats first and because people seek to affirm positive intent when they share the resource with others who will likely not describe the possible abuse.</p><p>According to this theory, using setups that can be interpreted as threatening but not at first apparently is the most effective way of growing the EA community.</p><p>However, it can be also that the newsletter audience more likely engages with and shares content that is conducive to reasoning and deep thinking.</p><p>For instance, the High Impact Professionals newsletter uses descriptive emojis and the organization is popular in EA.</p><p>While conducting an RCT on the variety of emojis and readership/click-through rate/thoughtfulness of a response requested by the newsletter can be a bit too much, it is one way to test the hypothesis.</p><p>--</p><p>Let me actually also illustrate what I mean on the example of the image used in this post. The image can cause distress but that is not at first apparent.</p><p>The image has feminine symbolism, the flowers and possibly the light. The viewer has not requested or agreed to view this symbolism but viewed it (these are prominent). Highlighted is also the figure's chest. These two aspects can engage the viewer, who may be compelled to pay further attention.</p><p>The leaves on the left side of the image resemble reptiles and birds hiding with the possibility of attack. That can cause cognitive dissonance, because birds and reptiles are considered likely (due to evolution and media) to attack than mammal predators by humans. The leaves near the flower in the bottom left corner resemble a bird with its beak directed toward the figure (who does not pay attention to it). The reader can be compelled to look at the leaves to assess for any threat and freeze in the anticipation of/to prevent the bird's action.</p><p>Some of the figure's fingers can be considered as disfigured. From the perspective of the viewer, the second to the left finger on the figure's hand near the flower is bent and the thumb on the same hand elongated. The other hand is the one that would 'confirm' that there is nothing weird. The hand looks relatively normal, except for the swollen second finger from the top (that also can make one think of literal or metaphorical rotting) and the thumb with the small red pointy end.&nbsp;</p><p>That thumb can be considered as a 'hidden weapon' of the feminine figure. That can make people think of betrayal by those who are traditionally trusted (females). Another form of betrayal/weapon can be the left flower, which is 'going' from the side in the general direction of the viewer, like a snake with an open mouth. The viewer may be compelled to look at it, to make sure that it does not go at them. If you zoom in on the inside of the flower (the violet, purple, yellow, and red shapes), further attention captivation can be analyzed.</p><p>A viewer of this image can become aware of their body and consider it vulnerable. That is because of the bent back of the figure but prominent/highlighted chest. The figure's right side of the chest is the 'assurance' of limited prominence, while the left side portrays significant prominence. (This could be vice versa but that perception can be limited.) This is gender neutral, although the shape can allude to male body fat, which is portrayed as something which should be covered, due to vulnerability (often used in advertisement).</p><p>The figure looks like an authority which is practically impossible to be convinced by reason and must be obeyed, by the facial expression. One may regret engaging with this environment but can be more compelled to 'stay' since seems pointless to 'argue against.'</p><p>The vertical blue stripe on the right side of the image, which coincides with the figure's sleeve, can be interpreted as AI threat. It is like the flickering of the screen. The figure embodies the 'appropriate' reaction to this, which is to do nothing and advance the norms that one cannot argue against.</p><p>There are other things that I could and could not analyze.</p><p>Of course, one can disagree and simply say that it is a normal image of a lady.</p><p>However, I suggest that one stares at the image in peace for a few minutes and observes their emotions and impulses (including motions and intended motions). If the above can be leading, a different DALL-E or prominent advertisement image can be used. One can feel negative emotions/negatively about an environment and physical sensations (such as finger twisting). That is a good reason to understand these techniques rationally but not emotionally and avoid long emotionally focusing on state-of-art AI images (but look e. g. on groups of fashion models where techniques relate mostly to gender norms, body image judgment, and racial stereotypes).</p><p>If one is quite aware of these techniques, considered using various alternatives in the newsletter, and still choses the arrow-anchor framework, then they have the reasoning for it. However, if one is simply influenced by AI and unknowingly advances an abusive spirit, possible impact of the newsletter should be related to its intended objectives and alternatives considered.</p><p>--</p><p>It can also be argued that an arrow and an anchor is nothing like a complex advertisement but that powerful people may like a form of traditional power, while their intents are good. I watched interviews with the 100 top Forbes billionaires and while many enjoy traditional exhibits of power and their intents are good, perhaps only four would actually enjoy abusive newsletter marketing, of which two would not understand it as anything that should be felt or suboptimal for anyone, and one would not seek to advance the abuse further. Two seems vulnerable to being influenced by this marketing, if they happen to be subscribing, which is very unlikely for one and possible but not very likely for the other.</p><p>I have also listened to podcasts with prominent EA funders and while impactful work can be a must, abuse is not (rather, positive relationships and impact is). So, using abusive newsletter emoji marketing is unlikely to please EA funders but can motivate them to repeat this 'tone from the top.'</p><p>--</p><p>In conclusion, the EA newsletter emojis can be reviewed.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "brb243"}}, {"_id": "qdAXtsQSJBfpFvDcB", "postedAt": "2022-10-20T18:19:03.928Z", "postId": "aFu9ejXKHxKQEpzGF", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi everyone, I'm new to the forum.</p>\n<p>Having read a few forum posts over the past couple of weeks, I wanted to become a bit more active and start commenting.</p>\n<p>I've recently started the process of reviewing EA career options (over at 80k hours), and plan to pivot to a more EA-aligned role in a year or so.

Then, I ran across Dr. Tony Seba, who was one of the only people to accurately predict the massive price declines of solar, electric cars, and batteries. He\u2019s now doing fantastic research into the coming disruptions in energy, transportation, and other areas with an organization called RethinkX.&nbsp;</p><p>RethinkX has predicted, among other things, that there will be almost no gas cars sold by 2030, &nbsp;and that the animal agriculture industry is headed into widespread bankruptcy (which would be very good for animal welfare interests). They've found that disruption generally happens when any system proves 5X better than the incumbent one, thus opening a huge opportunity space.&nbsp;</p><p>The nonprofit I founded, is designed to leverage the disruptive potential of the most cost-effective anti-poverty intervention in developed countries (guaranteed income), and use it to make a big impact against homelessness and then poverty over time.

The combination of this type of privacy preserving digital identity infrastructure with smart contracts is what enables peer-smart contract-to-peer distribution of scholarship funds conditional on students reaching learning milestones, thus enhancing accountability and trust and removing costly middlemen and the leakages associated with which.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://directed.dev/\">https://directed.dev/</a>\n<a href=\"https://linktr.ee/directeddevelopment\">https://linktr.ee/directeddevelopment</a></p>\n<p>Please feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn,  Twitter, email, pigeon mail, snail mail\u2026 you name it!:)\n<a href=\"https://uk.linkedin.com/in/simon-s%C3%A4llstr%C3%B6m-3659b616b\">https://uk.linkedin.com/in/simon-s\u00e4llstr\u00f6m-3659b616b</a></p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Simon S\u00e4llstr\u00f6m"}}, {"_id": "m8rhJv4feLnPs24u6", "postedAt": "2022-11-26T09:11:35.213Z", "postId": "aFu9ejXKHxKQEpzGF", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Simon,<br><br>your playlist starts with video no. 3, 2, 1 and ends with 4.

It is not. It is not a blockchain identity system (unlike so-called Soul-bound tokens). It is decentralised public key infrastructure. Blockchain only as a tiny part of it. For those interested in learning more about self-sovereign identifiers (AKA Decentralised Identifiers). Here is the official W3C standards recommendation for those who want to learn what it is, approved in July 2022 &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.w3.org/2022/07/pressrelease-did-rec.html.en\">https://www.w3.org/2022/07/pressrelease-did-rec.html.en</a>&nbsp;<br><br>The QZ article on similarly showing very superficial understanding of the technology.
