As someone who's applied for (many) dozens of EA and non-EA jobs over the past 2 years, I can identify and empathise with your story here.</p><p>From my experience, I think EA orgs do use 'work tests' way more often than non-EA orgs (I very rarely had to do a work test for non-EA job hiring, only interviews). There are obviously pros and cons to using work tests, and in my short time at a couple of different EA orgs, I've been part of pretty frequent discussion about how/when/why we should use work tests in hiring rounds (to their credit, I think).</p><p>The main thing that I'm surprised by in your post is the high frequency that you report to have done unpaid work tests. In recent times I've been really happy to see most EA orgs offering compensation for work tests, and I think the vast majority of work tests that I did were compensated.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\"but it feels that organizations use my work without them having the intention to hire me. \"&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>^This quote is pretty concerning .In general, I don't think I've seen anyone use the product of work tests for anything other than assessing them for hiring purposes. &nbsp;Are you saying that orgs have used the product of your work tests for other purposes? In that case, it does seem especially bad for that work test to have been uncompensated, and I'd assume (and hope) that most other EA's would agree with me.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Kaleem"}}, {"_id": "5Pm42u549JH8Cwj9G", "postedAt": "2022-12-21T17:04:25.004Z", "postId": "RAoonyKjurXMA73gq", "htmlBody": "<p>I personally only offer paid work trials, and this is the norm in the orgs I've seen (e.g. OpenPhil).

If organisations are having you do major unpaid (or e.g. minimum-wage) work trials, that seems like a serious problem.</p><p>There are also two broad categories of paid work tests I've seen, and I think the distinction between them is important:</p><ol><li>The first is standardised \"trial tasks\", in which every candidate is given an identical task that functions like an exam. These are typically purely for assessment and have little to no practical benefit to the organisation; they also typically come earlier in the process.</li><li>The second is an on-the-ground \"work trial\" in which the candidate works closely with members of the hiring org over one to a few days. These trials more commonly involve work that's useful to the organisation, since the goal is to see how the candidate works in a more realistic setting with their potential new teammates. These typically come later in the process.</li></ol><p>In my opinion, both of these should be paid, with the importance of providing payment increasing with the length and arduousness of the trial. I also think (2) should only be used with a small number of finalist candidates the org is genuinely excited about. If an org is instead giving these kinds of trials to significant numbers of candidates with lower probability of hiring, then I agree that seems quite problematic, especially if the trials aren't fairly compensated (the need for fair compensation also creates an incentive to be selective with the candidates that get asked to take a trial, which I think is helpful for reducing the concerns raised here).</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "willbradshaw"}}, {"_id": "NkZq3aM7tEFmKEKav", "postedAt": "2022-12-21T17:50:18.890Z", "postId": "RAoonyKjurXMA73gq", "htmlBody": "<p>I think work tests are a great way to hire people (because they are less biased than the alternatives) but I agree they should be paid for.
