Unfortunately I suffered from various executive dysfunction and mental health issues both at school and uni but didn't legitimise them and therefor didn't devote the necessary resources to resolve them. This led to me declining my Cambridge offer as I knew there was no way I was going to get the required grades, and subsequently also led to me dropping out of Lancaster University about halfway through my second year, at which point I went from having a solid life plan to no plan whatsoever as well as some potent mental health struggles.</p><p>Fast forward a few years and I'm a software engineer at a big tech company, which seems to be a significantly better fit for me than being a barrister. It's a great time to be a programmer - it's well paid and relatively low stress, building things is rewarding, it suits me as someone who has a quantitative worldview combined with a decent chunk of social anxiety. Being in big tech also appears to give me a reasonably clear pathway towards career success, by building career capital I can later parlay into impact, founding a start up or similar.</p><p>In general it's hard to evaluate the counterfactual of dropping out/remaining at uni, however one of the posts Gavin linked mentioned shame around dropping out that strongly resonates with me. At various points in the last 6 years I have considered if I ought to try to find a way to get a degree, and often find myself thinking that had I actually acquired a degree from Cambridge, my career might be significantly more advanced than it is now. It's also worth noting that not having an undergrad can make it harder to immigrate, for example it is very difficult for me to get a H1-B visa for the US.</p><p>I also think Eli is completely correct that much of the value of university is in the people rather than the education. The sense of belonging I felt as part of a sports team at university was one I've been wholly unable to replicate since, despite various attempts to do so. I suspect the majority of the value of an Oxbridge or similar degree is in the networking opportunities, particularly in the long term.&nbsp;</p><h3>Advice to my 17 year old self</h3><ol><li>Think about what you want out of your life, even if it seems hard to imagine a life outside of school. Talk to people you find interesting, ask them difficult questions, try to imagine if being in their shoes would make you happy. Your parents want you to make the most stable possible option, which might not be the best.</li><li>Take a year out to work on your mental health. Your career will be long, and a year spent wisely will more than pay for itself. Do anything you can to make those around you see that this is valuable. This is potentially also good advice for my 27 year old self.</li><li>The opportunity to go to university is likely once-in-a-lifetime, and thus you should make sure that you go to the right one and study the right subject. I think I would've enjoyed, maths, economics and computer science <i>significantly</i> more than law.</li><li>Equally, it is not the be-all and end-all. If you're smart, curious and hard-working then you'll land on your feet. You have a big safety net so you shouldn't be scared of falling.</li></ol><h3>Takeaways</h3><ol><li>I think at least trying to do an undergrad is worth it, for the people more than the education.&nbsp;</li><li>Degrees are pretty clearly more valuable to some people than others, and this depends on how credentialist your field is and whether you have traits that would be sufficient to overcome your lack of degree when looking for opportunities.</li><li>Most 17 year olds I know and have known do not seem well equipped to deal with big decisions like this.</li></ol>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jonny Spicer"}}, {"_id": "29CtF7HCBzFaJdX4z", "postedAt": "2022-09-21T19:16:27.491Z", "postId": "2jWLvBH8abzscDbPs", "htmlBody": "<p>I agree that self study without a peer group is really problematic.</p><p>And yet so many people work from home alone.</p><p>This is surely solvable, and, I think, worth someone's attention in solving.</p>", "parentCommentId": "hjg8tMCGaMP3FkbsZ", "user": {"username": "hibukki"}}, {"_id": "YoiegNqMuCFRu9YPJ", "postedAt": "2022-09-22T06:09:53.740Z", "postId": "2jWLvBH8abzscDbPs", "htmlBody": "<p>This was amazing.

I'd hope the quality of information obtained through uni courses is much better than random selection of reading material, as profs who have spent many years studying a subject should know which are the key texts to read, the most important facts to understand and the key arguments on each side of controversial issues. I think a random selection approach would generally yield information low in importance. (Perhaps articles from certain blogs wouldn't do too badly, but how would you know which blogs to choose and avoid getting sucked into ones that sound plausible but are terrible?) Edit to add: But doing some reading around the internet before deciding whether to embark on a course of further study could perhaps be a good thing to do.<br><br>I don't really see working in different jobs for a few months doing much to broaden thinking in the ways a uni education would - people I know in regular jobs seem to mostly be focussed on getting narrowly defined tasks done and not much on reflective thinking. Though it may be quite complementary as it could highlight things that an academic education wouldn't (George Orwell's writings of working in various jobs come to mind - but it seems rare for workers to take on this journalistic mindset). Edit to add: I also think workplaces will tend to have people with more correlated mindsets (e.g. work in an AI lab and most people around you will probably think developing AI is great), which isn't very good for developing an accurate worldview, whereas at a university I think you'd be more likely to be exposed to a greater variety of views. Though I don't have a measure for how well this works in practice (and I think people probably do cluster into groups with similar views to a fair extent). Of course, uni profs and students will tend to be correlated in thinking that uni is good ;-)<br><br>Of course that's not to say there aren't plenty of profs who focus on unimportant info, are poor at explaining, are biased etc. And as I said I think narrow uni courses are less good for getting a broader perspective. Honestly, I'm not sure how good an average uni education is by this measure (including at \"top\" unis).
