My name is Dermot and I\u2019m from Ireland. Pandemics (and how to stop them) have brought me to the EA Forums.</p><p>My professional background is in the financial markets \u2013 I am an investment risk manager by trade \u2013 so I have none of the skills or training one would normally associate with infectious disease and outbreak control. But, like a lot of people, I started to take an interest in Covid-19 during the first lockdown (what else was there to do?). My initial reaction was that we had screwed this one up, but the long-term question remained: how do we make sure a catastrophe like this never happens again?</p><p>Over the following weeks and months (and years, now), I tracked the Covid-19 outbreak through the datasets and the research papers. I reached out to journalists, politicians, and Covid activists to discuss policy reform. I wrote articles for the news media. For a few months, I found myself working on a policy proposal with a group of prominent Irish academics. As an outsider on the inside of academia, it was an enlightening experience.</p><p>Over the course of my journey, I became increasingly confident that pandemics were the kind of problem that could be solved \u2013 completely and permanently. Unfortunately, that solution would require perspectives and skillsets which seemed to be rare among the prevailing pandemic policy-making establishment\u2026&nbsp;which brought me to EA. Within EA there is a focus on long-term thinking and existential risk management, and these are exactly the kinds of perspectives we will need to solve a problem of this nature.</p><p>So, I am here to share my experiences and analysis, but I\u2019m also here to learn from domain experts, to give and receive feedback on key ideas, and to discuss pandemic prevention and preparedness with people who have also spent a lot of time thinking about it. There aren\u2019t many platforms where it is possible to have a rational, informed conversation about the Covid-19 pandemic, pandemic-potential pathogens, and global pandemic policy these days. I\u2019m hoping that I can find that here.</p><p>Pandemic prevention is entirely achievable, and within our lifetimes (I\u2019m a Millennial).

One is the world\u2019s most promising cancer researcher while the other, to be polite, has far less potential to improve humankind. Most people would wisely choose the cancer researcher.</p><p><strong>Yet the fashionable </strong><i><strong>Effective Altruism</strong></i><strong> movement focuses on lower-potential people\u2014typically, people who are struggling in poor countries. That implies the belief that all lives have roughly equal value. Of course, our hearts go out to \u201cthe least among us,\u201d but they face so many barriers. If we care to maximally benefit humankind, we\u2019re wiser to invest in people with great potential for </strong><i><strong>ripple effect</strong></i><strong> who, importantly, would not otherwise get fully funded.</strong></p><p>For example, leading lights in the Effective Altruism movement are far from downtrodden, for example, William McCaskill, Holden Karnofsky, Peter Singer, and Zvi Moshowitz. Effective altruism might fund such people to develop ever more \u201cripply\u201d altruism.</p><p>Some other possibilities for more ripply and thus more effective altruism:</p><p>\u2014 SuperCourses: online versions of standard school courses taught by dream teams of transformational instructors, augmented by vivid demonstrations and gamification. Of course, instruction would be individualized, not just in pace but in teaching approach. Machine learning would make that individualization ever better, and automatic translation would make SuperCourses available in many languages. The development of SuperCourses would enable every student, rich and poor, kindergarten through college, Alabama to Zululand, to get a world-class education. The private and government sectors haven\u2019t funded this\u2014I have proposed SuperCourses to top U.S. and California education officials and gotten nowhere. One reason is the fear that the teacher\u2019s union would use its might to try to stop it to preserve teacher jobs. But if developed and disseminated worldwide, SuperCourses could be very effective altruism indeed.</p><p>\u2014 Independent researchers studying solutions that are promising but have a poor chance of success. Governmental and corporate funding sources tend to invest in institution-based researchers whose projects have higher probability of near-term success. But if the focus is on long-term risk-reward, effective altruism would include independent, unaffiliated researchers working in their home-office or garage who are exploring novel ways to, for example, lower the cost of nuclear fusion energy, develop better AI-driven models for predicting and foiling terrorism and even for assessing a war\u2019s worthiness, e.g., the U.S. entering World War II versus the war in Vietnam or Afghanistan.</p><p>\u2014 People developing ever better mental health apps, for example, using ChatGPT. Such apps could be distributed worldwide to countries rich and poor\u2014Cell phones are ubiquitous even in poor nations. Private sources are funding development of such apps, but such development deserves greater funding given the apps\u2019 potentially great ripple effect.</p><p>\u2014 Researchers studying the enhancement of reasoning ability, impulse control, and altruism. For largely political reasons, those research areas are underfunded by government and corporations but, with sufficient ethical guardrails, such research has great ripple potential to provide major benefit to humankind.</p><p>\u2014 People developing software that matches mentors with <i>prot\u00e9g\u00e9s,</i> available worldwide. It would be like match.com but for mentor/<i>prot\u00e9g\u00e9,</i> relationships\u2014Many <i>prot\u00e9g\u00e9s&nbsp;</i>and mentors say that mentorship has been among their life\u2019s greatest learning experiences. Such software would facilitate that. Alas, the matching industry, despite having been around for decades, has remained focused on romantic relationships. That makes mentor-matching apps a good candidate for effective altruism.</p><p>Again, it\u2019s understandably tempting to want to help \u201cthe least among us,\u201d those with the greatest deficits. After all, we feel good in helping them and it\u2019s a fashionable form of virtue signaling. But if we truly care about humankind and are willing to focus on the greatest ultimate benefit, ripple should be the core criterion for determining what is maximally effective altruism.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Marty Nemko"}}, {"_id": "xADQbXpiiREqEbWCQ", "postedAt": "2024-02-28T15:01:41.684Z", "postId": "SfCFwKACAgWowgke4", "htmlBody": "<p>Hello!

Honestly, I'm a bit daunted by the knowledge and insight of posters here, but might push myself to put out a quick-take in Draft Amnesty Week, as I'd like to develop my writing abilities.</p><p>I work as a Physiotherapist, but am now on a maternity career break, and in this time, am trying to develop my knowledge and skills for a career transition to a more effective path. The cause area I'm most interested in is Biosecurity but I am pretty open-minded to anything high impact that is also a good personal fit. Working on mini-projects to test my abilities in advocacy and policy.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "MarinaKissin"}}, {"_id": "ATBdohp5HfthP4mwD", "postedAt": "2024-03-08T17:03:55.909Z", "postId": "SfCFwKACAgWowgke4", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Dermot, I'm Ois\u00edn. Are you aware of Ireland's EA chapter, EA \u00c9ire? I'm part of it myself, so if you'd like and if you are not already part of it, I can get you added to the EA \u00c9ire WhatsApp groupchat. Also we have some meetups in Dublin (some in Cork too I think for those down south) so you'd be welcome to join us. One of the organisers has actually written a syllabus for and run a proto-biosecurity fellowship in the past, so you could probably talk to him about that a bit more about pandemic prevention stuff I'd say. Anyways, welcome to the EA community!</p>", "parentCommentId": "hma3gBnDPFXJGq66G", "user": {"username": "Ois\u00edn Considine"}}, {"_id": "7PncZS3mzqkkRFFKq", "postedAt": "2024-03-12T18:11:33.443Z", "postId": "SfCFwKACAgWowgke4", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Ois\u00edn, thanks for getting in contact.

So far, it seems like whatever it is that I don't know or can't see about it will reveal itself through interactions with the community.

I started a 'Superhero Global Citizens' club last week and keen to share these ideas with the children and the wider community which offers fantastic potential for leverage and impact. I'm surprised how little is known of EA from my initial conversations with others. I'd be grateful for any support anyone is able to offer to help me get this started or gain traction.

I've been following EA for more than six years now. I am not sure how it started, but I think the first contact was a TED talk from Peter Singer.

I love the conceptual frameworks of EA - such as the importance, traceability, and neglectedness framework, or the idea of guiding young people on what impact their job might have before they make the choice.
