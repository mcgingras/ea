I\u2019m a woman who has in the past enjoyed sleeping around and would have potentially been saddened to have slightly fewer options in the EA community (my own initiation notwithstanding). However, I think it\u2019s important to note that I think that this loss is worth it to alleviate some of the discomfort that women can feel in this community, which applies even more to younger and more vulnerable women than me.&nbsp;</p><p>I also want to note the importance of age, which wasn\u2019t discussed explicitly in the post. If you have more than a 6 year age gap (depending on your age group of course) or are in different stages of life (undergrads and college graduates come to mind) then you are in a position of power over that person. When I was in my early 20s and younger, I had several interactions with people where I didn\u2019t realize that they were hitting on me because they seemed like kind, reasonable people and the power differential was very obvious to me. It was scary and saddening to realize that people who I saw as friends and mentors saw me as a sexual prospect.&nbsp;</p><p>As someone who has been interested in EA for a long time but only recently started attending in-person events, I can also concur that that being hit on constantly as a newcomer to the community is extremely frustrating and demoralizing.

Sexual assault is obviously a huge issue, but I don't think of it as something like \"a subset of sexual behaviour\" or \"sex gone wrong\", but instead something qualitatively different. Sexual harassment is somewhat trickier as it can be more grey (what's appropriate flirting in one context can be sexual harassment in another), but the main things I was thinking of were more like people being creeped out/feeling uncomfortable or bad community dynamics as opposed to things like people being abused (I don't know that my proposals would decrease abuse).</p><blockquote><p>you only really have so many dumb mistakes to make and I would prefer it if, unlike Owen, people could get these out of their system while young and not yet in leadership positions</p></blockquote><p>I would prefer it if people made more of their awkward mistakes outside of the community. You didn't bring this up, but I'd especially prefer this if people are \"practicing their dating skills\" or similar (which is a thing some people do). I think online dating provides a place for people to make awkward mistakes with very low relative harms, as neither of you have to see each other again if it becomes awkward.

Maybe?</p>\n<p>Against: According to the point you're making, people's first (or earliest) relationships are the most risky because of not yet having developed reasonable expectations of what relationships should be like. Casual norms (and greater tolerance of dating across asymmetric power dynamics) encourage less careful selection, which makes it more likely the partner is a bad match?(As many commenters point out, casual can turn into serious/long-term unexpectedly, so it's not like casual means you don't run the risk of ending up in a bad long-term bond.)</p>\n<p>In favor: I find it hard to articulate why, but I think you still have a point. Maybe there's something about how casual norms lead to more discussions about sex and relationships? If so, maybe it's less about what you end up doing (actually \"sleeping around\") and more about seeking out advice from others around you, discussing difficult topics openly, etc.? (Sure, firsthand relationship experience is invaluable, but if the first one is bad for you and you have the sort of personality to \"get stuck\" \u2013 seems like you're in danger in environments with both types of norms?)</p>\n<p>Either way, I don't think this is the sort of thing that one can (or should) easily engineer from the top down. Feels kind of dystopian if the rules are too restricting.

There's a thing that happens where people are trying to imagine the effect of a change where they think about how that change would affect a central example.

This kind of thinking reliably gets the wrong answer, because instead of typical bread consumers the ones whose purchasing behavior is most likely to change are the ones who are most on the fence about whether to buy bread.

You should strongly consider not engaging in \"random\" and \"not well thought through\" sexual activities within the community with anyone towards whom you are in a direct position of power.&nbsp;<br>2. While engaging in any random or not well thought through activities, please: a) if you are not a master of social interactions, do your best to learn mechanisms which prevent harm b) if you are in a position of power in EA in general, never ignore this dynamics and learn how to address it. If you are much older than the person you hook up with, remember - even if they seem mature, you are in a position of power. If you suspect you may fail to understand somebody's boundaries, stop engaging in random encounters immediately and go ask for help. This is a skill which can be learned. c) if you are not in a position of power, do your best to learn how to clearly and assertively state your boundaries. If you suspect that you'll have trouble doing that, stop engaging in random encounters immediately and ask for help. This is a skill which can be learned.&nbsp;<br>3. Poly relationships pose a set of different challenges than monogamy and our general culture provides very little guidelines on how to do them well. If you are engaging in a complex polyamorous dynamics, make sure you have mental space to do so appropriately. Take social misconceptions about polyamory and metaamorus dynamics into consideration. They can be hard, so if you are not ready to take it, consider possible monogamy/address your concerns in a safe setting.&nbsp;<br><br>In the same time, I strongly acknowledge that people have right to make mistakes and sexual interpersonal interactions are difficult and sexual usually full of emotions, so there will be conflicts, misunderstandings, mistakes. I believe no social or religious rules on the world change that, \"a culture of being more modest \" certainly doesn't. Education, communication, empathy and emotional maturity from both sides on the other hand, works wonders.

But I realized I focused exclusively on consensual casual sex within the community because that is the only piece I view as possibly worth engaging with, and it is what the post is about. I don't have notable-feelings about in-company relations or COI relations so I wouldn't go out of my way to defend them, and I do NOT think anti-poly-feelings hold water so I'm not wasting my time on that. There is no reason to feel the need to defend polyamory on ethical grounds. It's as ethical as monogamy, period. That said, I <i>will</i> push back on the lumping together of poly and casual sex in the first place. In my mind, the people who have the most casual sex historically have been like... college kids and people between relationships. These are both groups who will probably end up in monogamous relationships for life. I really don't get why people conflate casual sex and poly. Casual sex and open relationships? Sure, that's kind of their thing. Casual sex and single people (both mono and poly)? Sure, that's how a lot of modern dating gets started and how people blow steam off when they aren't ready for a relationship. Casual sex and in-relationship poly people? I'm not sold because each relationship has its own rules and for the most part people do go on dates and think carefully of where to spend their time, time which is limited greatly by already having a partner.]</p><p>Why do you think casual sex is bad for utility of the movement? It actually doesn't go without proving. I admit that was my intuition too, when I started thinking about it. But tbh after considering the other hypothesis equally (my gf <i>facetiously</i> was like \"lmao EA is really gonna lose what it has going for it without sexual freedom\" and I went \"wait what\" and thought about it), I have changed my mind.</p><p>So anyway I'll make the \"sexual freedom within community is good for utility\" argument:</p><p>[At first glance and often in practice,] EA is either (pick your poison): (1) a doomery apocalypse cult or (2) a morally strict self-flagellating mass of tithers and minimalists. On the other hand, we do poly and flexible sexual connections and those of us who are engaged in those things will even try and help you figure out if it's for you. Poly is fun<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcdxeithzrym\"><sup><a href=\"#fncdxeithzrym\">[1]</a></sup></span>. Sex is fun. Play and curiosity are fun. These are some of the major fun things our community does have going for it when comes to hedonism [and utopian way of life, over the rest of society.]</p><p>[I want to clarify the term \"fun\". I'm afraid that people will think that \"fun\", cuz it's a one-syllable word used by children, is a trivial experience. It isn't. It's a complex experience pairing joy with surprise and with acute presence and focus in the world and with lightness of being. Fun is the ultimate \"being in the present moment joyfully\" experience. It's basically the hedonic holy grail.]</p><p>I'm also, in thinking it aids impact, not talking about using sex as a lure to get people out to events or something. I'm talking about making the lifestyle sustainable and nice and liberating for the people in it. Increasing connection. Increasing joy and laughs. Sex is something special and it leads to special things, not just moans and groans. Even if you do it casually it leads to special things. It's a shortcut to connection. [More than sexual connection--I mean real human-to-human connection that comes after you've engaged intimately. Then a new type of interpersonal comfort emerges. This is very similar to the point made in the top comment of this post, but I'm trying to explain the mechanism and ground it so people who have not experienced it can see it as real and these types of casual explorations as inherently valuable. You know it yourself if you have ever had a new friend who you have stayed up all night with after hooking up, or who, the new hookup opened space in your friendship for increased texting/memesharing/asking each other big questions about the world/etc. I even know one couple in the animal welfare sector who I think are now engaged whose relationship started out with casual sex: they went on a date but it was really lame according to them and they had \"no chemistry\". But they (consensually and both knowing what it meant to go back to someone's place after a date) decided to go back to his and have a one-night stand anyway. Yano for kicks, in a may-as-well-get-some-pleasure kind of way. But then something shifted after they hooked up and they pulled an all nighter talking together. At least, this is what they told me (and some others around). As I say, IIRC they are now engaged, but either way they have been in an enriching relationship for 3+ years now which they surely treasure deeply and which has surely helped with their animal welfare impact.]</p><p>Now the apocalypse thing: Many EAs especially want this interpersonal connection shortcut and freedom when a lot of us are afraid we don't even have that many years left on this earth even. I'm sorry but I'm already hearing friends talk about reducing their interest in AI safety work because they want to cross things off their bucket list before we all die. People are literally spending down their retirement accounts and we've just begun to see real worrying AI progress. You make EA and longtermist spaces sex-negative,and I'm just not sure people are gonna keep giving it their all til the end. We may see darker nights ahead than we are now and yet those nights might still have hope and we wouldn't want people to leave EA the way normies will be flocking away from corporate jobs and stifling culture. Who keeps their 9-to-5 when the world ends ~next month? Nobody. They go and hang out with their loved ones. This will sound dramatic at first glance. But I'm not saying people will leave EA as soon as it becomes more sex negative, I'm saying that the more sex-negative EA becomes, the lower the critical mass of dread is required to abandon your post.*</p><p>Now the tithing, self-flagellation thing: Let's be real, getting involved in this community has been known to prompt onset of a lot of burnout at best and serious mental health struggles at worst. [And this might unfortunately be a bug of the philosophy. It might be stifling by nature, at least in early stages. Read the section \"Bad\" EAs Caught In a Misery Trap\" here: <a href=\"https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/\">https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/</a> So, firstly, I don't want EA to become more stifling than it already can feel, or not more stifling in a way that actually <i>feels</i> stifling (there are other norms we could adopt). This seems bad for the weirdos in it (and yup we are basically all weirdos for now). Second, the more deep connections people make with eachother in the beginning (and I argue connections are shortcutted via consensual sex, these are adults after all), the more help people can get moving from [early EA full of shame] to [experienced EA happy to make tradeoffs and prioritize their own wellbeing]. This was actually my experience. I came into EA a hardcore minimalist who was using my altruism obsession to suppress myself, so much so I was really ineffective. Then after hooking up with a certain EA which led to to-this-day friendship and an ongoing romantic relationship at-that-time with that EA, I ended up witnessing how to do EA more sustainably from that person and their friends. It was a big relief, at first I could hardly trust that it was morally okay to say, order random things on amazon or go out for fancy dinner or hire a house cleaner, I had so shamed myself about altruism and money. I think I'd have learned anyway how to make my altruism more sustainable and efficient (I'd have had to), but getting consensually involved with one person who knew the rhythm of it all probably helped me skip a lot of guilt and just move forward faster.]</p><p>That we are all high in the \"openness to new experience\" personality trait, and nonjudgmental about alternative lifestyles including dating styles, actually matters too. I think few people are gonna want to sign up to EA if it's also a constant HR meeting with the same \"you can only bring one partner to the Christmas party\" vibe. The people who stick hardest to EA are the weirdos and the people with a healthy distrust in authority and prescribed standards. Despite the ivy league outreach, I think that remains the case. For people like that, social scripts just raise question marks and side-eyes, and seem unhealthy. We want to attract early adopter types. We can't do that by trying to pattern-match everyone else. I think EA might fall into a trap of trying to \"please all of the people all of the time\" and that isn't going to work. We can't be everything. And if we can't be everything, it will be a lot more efficient to be ourselves rather than pretend to be something we are not. Give the new members caveats to reduce feelings of discomfort, and kick out the grifters trying to just get laid, but our existing members (the actual EAs tryna work on stuff, not the EAdjacents/grifters) still are served by being who they are. I don't think you can remove one of the weirdest aspects of EA and expect the other weird and good ways of thinking to flourish in the same way tbh. I really value what EA has going for it and I don't even want to risk making big cultural changes like that without really good <i>proven</i> reason. Forum reflections are not enough reason for changes so big as a swathe of people forcing themselves to change their preferences and increase their disgust reactions or whatever, anything to get themselves to uphold arbitrary norms about sexual connection within community. At least, I don't want to risk it <i>yet</i>. I might change my mind next week, but right now it feels rash. The norms of allowing casual sex within community (it's not even a huge thing tbh but my point is that it's <i>allowed</i> and many people don't look twice at you for giving it a go) evolved <i>with</i> effective altruism, in the past say half-dozen years especially. If you think EA kind of discovered a lot in that time, we should be very wary to push back on the norms we have. Maybe our growth and what has been figured out is a <i>little bit</i> due to sexual connection which created a little innovator soup that gave us a lot of great ideas and curated high-trust ingroup spaces to discuss them in. Just maybe an effect like that is enough to tip the scale toward \"these norms are actively net positive.\" I don't know that yet, but I at least won't say confidently that they are net negative so I'll stay out of people's business.</p><p>Also finally, this is maybe the best reason to destigmatize casual sex within the EA community. I want EA to be the future. I want the philosophy to spread such that almost every person is, by some degree, an EA. I know that we don't need 100% of humanity working on the world's most important problems. But I do want future humans to value doing good efficiently. I do want EA to become way way bigger than it is now. We shouldn't think EA is going to remain tiny and there will always be other people to fool around with if that's a fundamental life experience you want to have. We should take on a mantle of trying to not only impact the future, but be the future, because we can't even protect the future if our values don't spread into it and broaden to more universal ways of life. We should figure out how to live our lives coherently, when we want, within EA just fine, rather than fractioning EA into a smaller box of one's life. If people want to separate EA from their broader life, that's fine! But don't force people who don't want to, to do it. Those are the people who I think are doing the work of figuring out how to integrate EA with a vision of social utopia. We will doubtless fumble a few balls on the way to the goal, but that doesn't mean we should advocate for people to get off the field and stop trying. Sex-positivity will be an aspect of a utopia. I believe that anyway. So sex-positivity should be a part of EA. And anyway, if EA grows so big, this rule about not hooking up with community members won't even be sustainable, it would cut out too many people from the population and we'd have people twiddling their thumbs for want of people to test the waters and explore sexuality with. That would, I think, be net negative. Well, I argue it's a difference in scale, not of kind, to stigmatize casual sex today, from a moral POV.</p><p>I don't even want to see terminology like \"sleeping around\" on the forum tbh, which to me is inherently stigmatizing at worst, and at best trivializes the niceness and essential humanness of the experience people are <i>trying</i> to have. Even if they are mistaken in how they are using the tool, how can we surely say yet that the tool has little use? Sure, maybe some people are trying to have causal sex stupidly and riskfully (although I have seen nothing of the sort myself), and perhaps some people don't want casual sex and need a piece like the above post to help them consider what they really want. But maybe we can help people do what they want less stupidly and find what they really want, without stigmatizing casual sex.</p><p>You might not buy these arguments but people who have casual sex might. Let them decide. If you don't feel too awkward, you can ask people about it. Same as I might ask an EA \"Why do you eat meat?\" If they say \"I think it's better for my impact\" I will drop the question. But If they say \"yeah I'd really like to go veg actually\" I will help them with that, or if they say \"it's too hard to go veg\" I will ask them if they would like to know how easy it can be to go lactovegetarian. Similarly you can ask someone something about their casual connections (or poly) and if they say \"I think it's better for me and does no harm, we both had fun, and it's none of anyone's business also\" you can drop it. If they say \"yeah tbh I'm actually trying to find a relationship\", \"yeah I'm worried about my career and this helps me feel more sure in mentoring and the like\", or (big oof) \"IDK she's hot right?\" then you can totally offer to talk with them about those things and suggest ways of being which are kinder to themselves and others.</p><p>So let people pick what makes them happy where they can get it, I think there are better solutions if we keep looking than cultural mandates about consensual bedroom practices.</p><p>But I have other norms I think would work way better than [blanket increased finger wagging at people sleeping around] plus [increased guilt and self-suppression for those interested in sleeping around who are most vulnerable to guilt]. Those two are what I think this suggestion will amount to. I can write those alternative other norms up if people are interested.</p><p>Oh yeah, fyi I also have no horse in this race personally. Not these days for sure. I'm ambiamorous and I don't really feel a deep burning need to love and create fun sexy times with anyone but my partner, and I haven't dated (at least) anyone else basically our whole relationship. So if it were negative utility to not have casual sex in the community obviously I'd abide. But I do have an ethical compass that all people be treated well, including people with minority sexual inclinations, and people who want to dip their toe into things casually to learn about each other and learn how things work. My ethical compass demands that these people should be allowed to craft their own futures without stigmatization. Even if all that is precisely forseeable about that future at the moment of diving in is just one night of fun (again, fun being one of the most precious things ever), if there aren't blatant costs in that particular interest (again like COI or in-company relationships), let people figure it out themselves.

I\u2019ve been to 5 in person conferences and many adjacent social events (after parties etc.) I\u2019m a young woman, and am pretty used to attention from guys. Before creating a dating doc I had been asked out by EA guys four times. Three were very nice and respectful, and were in no position of social or professional status over me. One was in a position of social status and pressured me into making out after I had already turned him down\u2014I certainly doubt he was the kind who would have refrained from doing this if there were a norm against sleeping around in EA, since he was a real Transgressor of Norms.  (he\u2019s since lost his status and demoted himself to EA-adjacent, in part because of other harassment allegations).</p>\n<p>After I created a dating doc I was approached by someone who I had long admired greatly and who I absolutely considered high status. This was for the purpose of perhaps forming a serious relationship which certainly could not have been portrayed as \u2018sleeping around\u2019. However, he did ask me about my sexual preferences for purposes of determining compatibility and I somewhat exaggerated my interest in sex (I have very little &amp; generally call myself asexual) because I was starstruck. I similarly downplayed others of my relationship preferences that conflicted with his. Again, a norm against sleeping around would not have helped, and in this case I would happily take the blame for not being good enough at honestly expressing my preferences.</p>\n<p>As far as being hit on by random people at ea events: I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever knowingly experienced this? It\u2019s possible I am very bad at knowing when I\u2019m being hit on, as an aspie asexual. But if I were to guess I would say no, I\u2019m only a little bad at this, since I am socially sophisticated for an aspie and have experience with guys being interested in me.  So if I have been flirted with it was probably on the subtle side and therefore unlikely to make a person uncomfortable even if they were aware of it. In general when it comes to my interactions with men in EA, I have felt very respected and treated much more as a person and intellectual discussion partner than as a sexual prospect. The idea that other women might be getting driven out of EA from being hit on or seen primarily as a sexual prospect is surprising and feels contrary to my experience (not saying anyone who reports having this experience is lying or wrong).</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "IsabelHasse"}}, {"_id": "sKHpziDBnvDTkyA2i", "postedAt": "2023-02-26T10:42:02.285Z", "postId": "aGkLx2hfr9s3mSdng", "htmlBody": "<p>Yeah, in Finnish contexts (nude) sauna is a normal option for an afterparty of a professional conference or similar context :) but in these cases, there is a gender separation of sauna turns (or different saunas) for men and women, just like at Finnish public swimming pools.

If poly for you in the community is this fantastically amazing, then it is a tragedy of a vastly worse degree than many EAs might even realize that they can't be part of it.</p>\n<p>I'm reminded of some study I read about years ago that showed that the mental health of people in third world countries decreased markedly when they were shown just how much better off people in first world countries are. Those in the control group that showed clear ignorance over how Europeans lived were... Happier.</p>\n<p>Honestly, after reading so much poly-discourse on the forum lately I'm very surprised this point hasn't been raised. An obvious model for what is going on, in my head, is that the poly-backlash is part of a larger backlash against the \"moral fulfillment and life fulfillment and career fulfillment and hedonism fulfillment and just-everything-important fulfillment\" that is perceived to be held and disproportionately concentrated among few in EA.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "4GzCArdmR25uLdvKD", "user": {"username": "Cornelis Dirk Haupt"}}, {"_id": "nxxqiEHtPwaHdyKqJ", "postedAt": "2023-02-28T15:33:55.893Z", "postId": "aGkLx2hfr9s3mSdng", "htmlBody": "<p>\"not having norms\" and \"I failed to see the norms\" would look very similar from the perspective of a socially clumsy actor.</p>\n<p>I may be seeing things that don't exist, but generally the groups I belong to have really strong norms against dating.

I've been thinking similarly kind of and your reflections help me put it together? Like I think it ties into the fears about <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gwbaySuugjxJAjkgQ/why-people-use-burner-accounts-a-commentary-on-blacklists\">gatekeeping</a> which I think are maybe unconsciously comparative-resentment-based too. I think there is some counterargument to what I'm saying which goes something like: this sex positivity <i>does</i> create unequitable situations. It's the opposite problem of sexual harrassment if it is true. But I'm not sold on that counterargument either.. if I could snap my fingers and sprinkle the value created from sex-positivity/sexual connection evenly throughout the community, I would do so. But I don't think it works like that. I think there is actual new value created. Unfortunately sex-positivity is not <i>yet</i> one of those features where \"a rising tide floats all boats\". It's more like (to me) some boats are sped up by the sex positive-current and other boats miss the wave and just reach their destination the same time they counterfactually would have. That's because I don't see EA positions and social cohesion as win-lose situations, again I think value is just created. I think figuring out how to balance equity with overall prosperity, and how to frame it so no one feels jilted is a fundamental human problem I hope we keep toying with things to make it work.<br><br>That said, I will add that I've been poly for 15 years, but EA for only 5 years, so I never really <i>tried</i> to \"get in\" to EA poly or EA sex-positive spaces. I also don't really identify the EA community as specifically poly or sex-positive, I just don't want it to lose that streak it has and stifle the EAs who are living that way. Since people are now talking about it and I have had a few key experiences within the community (but more outside of it), I feel comfortable commenting on sex-positivity within the community culture. Maybe it is really hard to get into the specifically-EA poly community and that's okay. I mean it takes most people a lot of time and strategy to get integrated to any sex-positive community (kink, swingers, private parties, OKC-based polycules lmao). Maybe if people are feeling resentful about it, those people can ask us poly people what's up and we can send them links and stuff and they can do their exploring outside of the EA community. I don;t want this to be like \"an EA infrastructure project\" or something, but in my free time if people DM me I always try to help people figure out if poly is right for them.<br><br>Also, you are right that speaking in the way I have about poly is almost.. concerning. And I don't want to be one-sided. I'm actually ambiamorous (but I still say poly cuz I hold a poly ethical position about freedom of my partner, regardless of whether I care about getting a new partner that month/year).. Monogamy can be fun too! I will add a little footnote like &nbsp;\"poly is fun [if you are suited to it.

I can think of at least one EA woman off the top of my head who has been poly with multiple prominent EAs, who has social status because of this, and whose professional career hasn't benefited at all. If anything it hindered her professional life's growth because God knows being polyamorous means being an unpaid therapist to multiple people, which takes time and energy away from other endeavors.</p>\n<p>Just because someone gains social status from something in some group that said group thinks is cool doesn't mean that this increased status translates into easier professional success in any meaningful way we need to be worried about.</p>\n<p>People gain status in LGBTQ social circles if they come out as gay, especially if the coming out story makes for a compelling story (hell, in any social setting where you can tell a compelling story you gain status).

What I think you're talking about is a problem where power dynamics is involved including mentor/mentee relationships and coworkers etc etc. This is a separate topic from the social status increase and feeling-dejected by it that Ivy and I are talking about.</p><p>I'll try an illustrate why with an example:</p><p>When I was at an EA party the other night a woman I had just met brought up the topic of orgies. I immediately found her more interesting and it opened the span of conversation to many other varied topics not even related to sexuality. She didn't break any norms, she didn't try to make people feel uncomfortable, she brought the topic up in a funny socially intelligent way. Her social status in the group in this setting increased. EAs trend towards being open-minded enough to talk about anything. Nothing wrong with this. Another pertinent example: When I met one of my closest EA-adjacent friends in the world for the first time: within 5 minutes we were both talking about the topic of suicide and our own personal struggles. Naturally I also immediately found her more interesting and it opened the span of conversation to many other varied topics not even related to suicide. Her openness increased her social status at said party where people were EAs and EA-adjacent open-minded types.<br><br>If these women had been at a conservative catholic social gathering their social status would have decreased with this behaviour. And there is nothing wrong with a different social setting having different status hierarchies.</p><p>I bring up this example because your comment begs the question: do you think it is problematic these women brought up these topics and that status hierarchies should be different in EA as a community, as a whole? &nbsp;Because we don't allow this kind of talk at EA conferences and it has finally come down (as it should) that where power dynamics are concerned this kind of talk between coworkers is likely to be problematic. But if what you're saying is that absent any professional setting, absent any coworker or mentee/mentor relationship, people who identify as \"EAs\" should <i>still </i>not grant anyone any social status for being interesting when the topic of sexuality is brought up... what you're effectively demanding is for thousands of people around the world to change their personality and become less sexually liberal and less open-minded.&nbsp;</p><p>Now mind you, when I was in my early twenties, <i>I would have felt left out and dejected </i>at these EA parties where people are freely talking about said sexual topics where I don't have any status because of factors outside of my control. I certainly would have <i>felt</i> like my dating life is some sort of proxy for not being good enough to be part of EA and that it was locking opportunities away from me. But how I <i>feel</i> and how things are are two different things.</p><p>It would have been <i>wrong</i> for me to make the leap from \"I feel like I'm not high status and not good enough at this EA party\" to \"EAs wont hire me because I'm not high status enough and sexually liberal enough at their EA parties.\" I think this is the mistake you are making when you say \"Status and success are fairly related in many ways in the real world, because status opens doors and signals greater opportunity.\" This is an obviously true statement in some contexts (e.g. mentor/mentee or grant/grantee relationships etc) and an obviously false statement in the context that Ivy and I are talking about.</p><p>That said, an obvious crux here that would convince me that we have a problem that requires action is if the number of women in EA does indeed dwindle or show a downward trend. I don't see that happening.</p><p>If anything the EA Community's gendar ratio over the years (including at EA casual socials) is trending towards becoming more women-heavy suggesting to me that women are feeling more comfortable as a whole in the movement rather than less so.</p><p>This doesn't mean that there haven't been incidents that have made some women feel unwelcome or unsafe. These are serious and need to be dealt with. But I'm unconvinced this is indicative of a larger trend.

I don't think that my choice / programming of sexuality is something that needs work, I love being monogamous, just like how I don't feel lesser because of my gender or ethnicity.

I'd hate to make anyone feel otherwise. I'm not using them interchangeably. I said \"sexually liberal and less open-minded\" indicating two separate things, not two synonymous things. Private sexual preferences can totally be related to someone's interestingness, sexually liberal mindset and open-mindedness and there is nothing wrong with that. Some things correlate and this is hardly controversial. And just because I acknowledge they correlate for me (interestingness is subjective after all) does not mean I'm saying other groups cannot be interesting, sexually liberal or open-minded. Likewise poly people can be dull and closed-minded as well.</p><p>People just aren't black-and-white enough to be easily categorized.<br><br>I kinda also just want to stop here and point out that it is a private <i>relationship </i>preferences, not sexual preferences. A lot of polyamorous people aren't even sexual. There are poly people that just sleep together cuddling, yet have full blown loving relationship polycules complete with horrendously messy breakups like any monogamous relationship.</p><p>I met a a poly man this year that - to my shock - is asexual. Mostly shocking because he presented to me as interested in sex like me but when I talked to one of the (many) women he is or has dated I found out he doesn't care much for sex.</p><p>And there is nothing wrong with me being more interested in this asexual poly man with multiple girlfriends (some of &nbsp;said girlfriends whom I might add are interested in sex) as a direct consequence of his relationship dynamics. Me assigning him more status in my social circles is no more a moral problem than traditionally monogamous people giving status to people who are traditionally married. Different social groups have different social status hierarchies. Both are as valid as any preference you might have where everyone is consenting to be a part of a social dynamic.</p><blockquote><p>I am not just talking about professional relationships. I'm also talking about what the community should value. Treating women differently as higher/lower status based on their sexuality is simply wrong.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>You cannot police people's preferences when nobody is being harmed. That is wrong. If there are zero problematic power dynamics (e.g. no professional relationships), consenting adults can do as they please. A woman, just like any man, has every right to assign status to different people based on whatever reasons they choose. We all do this instinctively and automatically. The problem is <strong>not</strong> that that treating women differently as higher/lower status based on whatever preference you might have is wrong - it is that doing so insensitively can hurt someone and that hurting others is wrong.</p><p>In eras long forgotten I've had brief but magical \"poly-heaven\" moments where I'm dating multiple people and everyone is happy and it is sheer bliss, but I <i>don't </i>go loudly proclaiming it all to all my friends who aren't happy with their dating lives. That would be incredibly insensitive of me. Just because someone is lower status on some subjective metric doesn't mean I want them to viscerally feel it. We should all be kindly helping lift each other up.</p><blockquote><p>A lot of people are intentionally monogamous ( like me). Assigning them default lower status due to their private relationship preference is an awful practice that shouldn't be adopted community wide.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>So I'll start by saying it is absolutely awful you feel like the EA community is assigning you lower status for being a monogamous woman. I have to ask though, isn't this something where you can look at the individuals who were this insensitive towards you and call them assholes without calling the EA community as a whole asshole-ish?</p><p>When I, as a poly person, hang out with my more conservative mono friends, they don't make me feel lower status. I'm their friend. However, I <strong>am</strong> lower status around them relative to their status hierarchy, <i>especially</i> when it comes to my viability as a mate. I <i>accept </i>and <i>respect </i>that I'm lower status around them.&nbsp;</p><p>A perhaps better example (\"more conservative mono\" is a bit too vague) is that when I a hang out with my death metal friends who have crazy tats and know everything about metal music and playing instruments I likewise have lower relative social status. And perhaps an illustrative example here is that yes, <i>some </i>in the death metal community do put more status on tattoos while some do not - which, like polyamory to EA, is wholly separate from what the core of the community is actually focused on, namely death metal music. I <i>accept </i>and <i>respect </i>that to some people within the metal community I'm lower status due to not having tattoos. They aren't being mean to me by assigning me lower status.</p><p>However, if a particular strictly monogamous person or death metal friend went out of their way to highlight or was insensitive about my relative low status, I'd call them an asshole. I would not however call the death metal community as a whole asshole-ish for assigning me lower status due to my private preference of not wanting to have tattoos. And I wouldn't say they are wrong to value tattoos and should only appraise my social status based on my love of death metal.</p><p>Assigning people status based on their private relationship preference is not something that is adopted community-wide in EA. Assigning status based on your tattoos is not something adopted community-wide in the death metal community. In both cases though there might be an epiphenomenon where the people you hang out within the EA/Death Metal community just happen to also be into polyamory/tattoos, but that doesn't mean their personal preference and the status hierarchies you experience because of those preferences are a community-wide practice.</p><p>You might immediately want to counter-argue that \"the sum aggregate of statuses being assigned is what takes something from individuals practising it to it being a community-wide practice.\" In anticipating this counter-argument, let's look at my death metal analogy and see how it can come crashing down:<br><br>Let's assume that women with tattoos disproportionately find themselves in favourable <i><strong>career</strong></i> positions in the death metal community which is <i>not</i> relative to their actual career skill. Women without tattoos do not see this advantage. Let's assume this is a result of increased professional networking opportunities afforded to women with tattoos as a direct result of many high in power and status in the death metal community disproportionately giving social status to women with tattoos (And it is only due to this and <i><strong>NOT </strong></i>due to problematic romantic relationships with problematic power dynamics). Consequently we enter vicious feedback loop of women without tattoos feeling dis-empowered and unfair pressure to get tattoos to get ahead. And those that wont put up with this obvious bullshit just decide to leave the Death Metal Community altogether despite their talent.</p><p>I think we are now looking dead in the eye at something much more like what you're afraid of is happening in the EA community. You're saying that even absent problematic power dynamics and the <i>appearance</i> of nobody is being harmed, actually women are still being harmed.</p><p>So I think there are a few further steps we need to take before we start calling out the entire Death Metal community:</p><ul><li>Women with tattoos actually have to be less competent than women without that aren't getting said career positions. It's totally possible that actually there are just more competent Death Metal women with tattoos and their tattoos are completely unrelated to their getting their positions<ul><li>Women who feel pressured to get tattoos might just be pattern-matching on something that isn't actually relevant to their professional success in the Death Metal Community<ul><li>In the EA community I have not seen broad evidence of poly women being treated preferentially professionally <i>because </i>they are poly</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>It has to be broadly systemic and not just a feature of some subset of the community&nbsp;<ul><li>It shouldn't be something like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BxRS5HQZgEc&amp;t=1s\">Sonia points out</a> appears to occur mostly in The Bay Area which appears to have features conducive to abusive dynamics<ul><li>If there was some city where a scandal took place in the Death Metal community where some women appeared to have gotten preferential treatment due to their tattoos, it would be pretty unthinkable for anyone to conclude \"The Death Metal Community is abusive\" instead of \"The Death Metal Community in this city is abusive\"</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Nobody caring to course correct, no action being taken.<ul><li>I really doubt I need to make a case that concerns of women are being taken seriously. If they weren't the number of women in EA wouldn't be growing.</li></ul></li></ul><p>If &nbsp;things were true, however, we are no longer talking about individuals who are assholes but an entire community that has a deep rot.</p><p>But for sub-points I added I don't think any of them hold for the EA community.&nbsp;</p><p>Ergo, I think the correct response is to call out individuals. Which has happened in the EA community a bunch of times leading to said individuals being banned from the EA community (or other punishments that make sense)</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>Which also speaks to a broader point: if you're poly you're interesting and get invited to speak on the Clearer Thinking podcasts etc etc</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>May be you're struggling to understand my point, so let me try to demonstrate why this sort of language is troubling.

All other things being equal, I want to be given equal status as someone else with a different sexuality, just like how I want the same status as a man / white person / a person of different nationality. That's all.</p></blockquote><p>Thank you for trying to make your point clearer. I appreciate this a lot. I'm beginning to think we have an unusually high <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/inferential-distance\">inferential distance</a> between us, but actually at the object-level we don't disagree on a lot at all.&nbsp;</p><p>So, actually, all those do occur and frequently. Certain black (ethnicity), women (gendar), homosexual (orientation) people have interesting stories to tell because of their experience tied to their ethnicity/gendar/orientation and get invited to podcasts because of it. So the sentence doesn't strike me as \"wrong\" per se. It strikes me as <i>feeling </i>wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>But, if it isn't <i>just </i>because of some protected characteristic, it is totally ok for people to assign others more social status, in part, because of protected characteristics. People assign people who are women/black/homosexual &lt;insert-reason-here&gt; more status because their experience as a &lt;insert-category-here&gt; is essential to whatever they have to share - e.g. it is something where they are oppressed</p><p>Likewise, polyamory is quite stigmatised and we don't really have many role-models or representation. So, when someone is speaking for us and they do so eloquently, it is only natural that we assign this person more status because they can do so - and doing so is intricately tied to their identity in being poly. Someone who isn't poly that can still \"talk as well\" wouldn't get the status. This would be problematic for the same reason that we don't assign status to a white man who can \"talk as well\" about the experience of being black as someone who is black.</p><p>I guess the question then is, if you possibly don't feel it wrong to assign a women more social status for being a good role-model for women as a woman, why do you feel uncomfortable when poly people are assigned more status for being a good role-model for poly people as a poly person themselves? This, like AI Alignment in the EA community, is status working in the right way and incentivising good and worthwhile behaviour in the poly community.</p><p>I might feel bad or left out due to this, but that is not really that different from a woman feeling bad and left out when they compare themselves to other women who have gained social status in part for sharing their experiences as women.</p><p>Also I just want to explicitly state I didn't mean for anything I wrote to imply I think your programming of sexuality is something that needs work. I'll also add, in case you're worrying whether you've offended me, nothing you've written thus far has made me feel like you think my programming of sexuality is something I need to work on.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>This is actually status working the right way.

Humans are going to throw out incentives to get what they want. The answer is not to quash it, it is to teach people to do so maturely, tactfully and with kindness. I like big-tent EA so people with near any preference might also like doing EA stuff. They might even be EA leaders. But we shouldn't let their preferences automatically lead us to conclude that is the preference of the community as a whole.</p><p>And maybe I'm too woke but I'd caution against trying to decouple doing good from sexuality / race / ethnicity / orientation completely. A full understanding of people's identities, I think, is important to doing good better. A sex-race-ethnic-orientation blind approach might invalidate people's experiences, especially those that are marginalized.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For anyone that actually read this whole damn comment, if you are in the Bay Area for the next month I'd love to meet you at the EA Taco Tuesday meetup and give you an appreciative high five, lol, even if you disagree with me.

They are being mean to me and thousands of monogamous women they're recruiting / want to recruit / who are dedicated EAs by assigning us lower status.

I'm also confused you think individuals who assign me lower status are assholes after saying above yourself that may be I should be ok with being assigned lower status like you're ok being lower status elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm sorry but the death metal-tattoo analogy got lost on me. You can get a tattoo if you chose to, many people can't change their sexual preference, so it's a false comparison. It's like you're saying white people have higher status and you should be ok with that, but I can't paint my face white and become a white person if I wanted to. Secondly tattoos are nothing like sex. Sex involves two people ( often) and conveys a relationship where you can benefit a higher status individual. Your getting a tattoo is not pleasurable to high status men.

That is very different from \"if you're a good role-model for poly people as a poly person...\". Good role models should get status, I agree, but that's not what you said.

But in your justification, sharing experiences gets status. Sharing experiences should get more status, but just being poly/mono shouldn't. Being a good role model for monogamous people and sharing that experience should also get higher status, but tell me dear friend, are they getting invited to podcasts? I am amazing at monogamy, the absolute best, do get me an invite.
