Uncertainty remains over the ultimate safety, cost, and real-world effectiveness of different GUV systems and wavelengths of UV light. Far-UVC in particular may have large upside but also risks, suggesting a \"wavelength-agnostic\" approach focused on catalyzing safety studies, market incentives, and large-scale government funded research could maximize impact.<br><br><strong>Key points</strong>:</p><ol><li>GUV can suppress airborne pathogen spread by 30-75%, a historically neglected priority despite heavy disease burden. It offers unique biosecurity benefits as a passive, pathogen-agnostic defense.</li><li>Key forms are far-UVC full room systems, conventional UV upper room systems, and in-duct systems. Each has tradeoffs in safety, cost, installability. Overall potential is high but uncertainties on real-world effectiveness remain.</li><li>Evidence suggests far-UVC is likely safe, but studies are needed on subgroups, eye effects, ozone risks, and indoor air pollution created. Its cost is dropping but still high compared to proven conventional UV.</li><li>Funders should take a \"wavelength-agnostic\" approach focused on safety studies, market incentives, public advocacy for government research on transmission reduction across systems. Rapid deployment without public confidence risks backlash.</li><li>Prioritizing high-income countries first allows leveraging resources and expertise for trials and development. Later focus should ensure equitable global access.</li><li>Impact depends on indoor spaces mapped, air movement dynamics understood. Variable systems expected for different users.

On the other hand, there are reasons funders might want to focus attention on far-UV, without disregarding the usefulness of conventional-wavelength GUV: since far-UV requires more research than conventional-wavelength systems at this time, but might ultimately be easier to install, the far-UV research payoff could be very large for increasing adoption of GUV in general. I expect that conventional-wavelength systems would benefit from investment into R&amp;D for easier installation, but that's not obviously a place for philanthropic funding. The safety studies necessary for far-UV are too expensive for the current market size, so if far-UV research does not get more philanthropic funding than conventional-wavelength GUV, far-UV safety studies might not be performed in a rigorous way. However, I would agree that funders should be wavelength-agnostic if they are directly funding installations.</p><p>Because of the challenges facing comprehensive far-UV analysis, I was surprised that you didn't think it would be very impactful for philanthropists to fund studies--broadly speaking, I agree about the lack of expertise, but this is a small enough field that the informed voices are fairly well-known within the field and I think interested philanthropic bodies would be able to consult those informed opinions. Again, I don't have insight into the funding side of the process, so that may be optimistic. I am certainly biased, since 1Day Sooner does regularly apply/advocate for philanthropic funding for technical research! On the reverse side, personal experience has left me pessimistic about policy advocacy for GUV research, but your report has swayed me somewhat to at least consider the fact that there is not a <i>concerted</i>, heavyweight policy advocacy effort in this area. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I appreciated the argument on capturing the bulk of the risk by later deployment; it was a very helpful presentation of the case. I do think that there is a learning-by-doing element to GUV rollout (for either type of GUV), where rollout and analysis in select environments is necessary for better understanding broader GUV use cases. Identifying those environments is an element of the current 1Day Sooner IAQ project. I also would love to see the cost of GUV installation fall sooner rather than later in order to address endemic disease burden worldwide, e.g. via widespread installation in TB clinics. (I'm fully aware that this use case might remain impractical, but it's nice to consider the potential to address global health! Of course if a funder is <i>specifically</i> trying to fight TB, I\u2019d still recommend sinking their money into vaccine research or treatment.)</p><p>Finally, this report was extremely helpful for a current 1Day Sooner project! We're working on a report to assess the potential for market shaping techniques to accelerate the adoption of indoor air cleaning technology. This post, and writing up this comment, really helped clarify some of my thinking about the possible directions we'd been tossing around, so a huge thank you for that!&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Gavriel Kleinwaks"}}, {"_id": "Nxs2usMQ9GY3qZEFc", "postedAt": "2024-01-17T03:00:28.401Z", "postId": "EZZveBtxoZJjSighP", "htmlBody": "<p>This was very helpful!
