Those requests sparked a debilitating liquidity squeeze.</p><p>FTX told investors that it was hoping to raise up to $4 billion in equity to fill the shortfall, people familiar said.</p><p>The implosion of the Binance rescue deal weighed on financial markets already rattled by uncertainty around the outcome of U.S. midterm elections. The Nasdaq dove around 2.5% Wednesday while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 both fell around 2%.</p><p>Bitcoin, the biggest and best-known cryptocurrency, fell around 16%, bringing its value below $16,000 for the first time since November 2020. It is now down around 75% from an all-time high reached in November 2021.</p><p>Also on Wednesday, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler issued a stern warning to crypto platforms, after more than a year of encouraging them publicly to register with his agency. He also likened the broader crypto market to a stack of Jenga blocks that gets weaker with each failure.<br>Once seen as a shining survivor in a struggling industry, FTX\u2019s fall has sent shockwaves through the cryptocurrency industry. Just months ago, Mr. Bankman-Fried committed nearly a billion dollars to bail out struggling cryptocurrency lenders and was an active lobbyist considered widely to be the face of crypto in Washington.&nbsp;</p><p>Binance\u2019s retreat now leaves FTX\u2019s fate unclear; the cause and full extent of FTX\u2019s financial problems are unknown. FTX declined to comment.</p><p>In an internal FTX slack channel, Mr. Bankman-Fried on Wednesday wrote, \u201cWe obviously just saw Binance\u2019s statement; they relayed that to the media first, not to us, and had not previously informed us or expressed those reservations,\u201d according to a copy of the message reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.<br>Mr. Bankman-Fried wrote that he was working on next steps and doing what he can to protect customers, employees and investors. \u201cI\u2019m deeply sorry that we got into this place, and for my role in it. That\u2019s on me, and me alone, and it sucks, and I\u2019m sorry, not that that makes it any better.\u201d</p><p>Besides the firm and Mr. Bankman-Fried, well-known institutions that invested in the exchange are on the hook for potentially big losses. Among investors in a $900 million fundraising last year were SoftBank Group Corp., Sequoia Capital, hedge fund Third Point and tech-oriented private-equity firm Thoma Bravo.</p><p>Individual traders could also lose funds. FTX has halted withdrawals of both crypto and fiat currencies from the exchange, according to a pinned post in its official Telegram channel.</p><p>Michael Tursk\u00fd, a European crypto trader, said he hasn\u2019t been able to withdraw his nearly $11,000 from FTX since midday Wednesday. Those funds represented around 70% of his liquid net worth, he said.</p><p>He said he tried to withdraw his cash multiple times, to no avail. \u201cKnowing FTX\u2019s brand and name, I would have never thought it would go under in a few days,\u201d Mr. Tursk\u00fd said. \u201cEven if it did, I would have never expected them to stop all withdrawals\u201d</p><p>Losses related to FTX spread beyond the firm itself. Stock investors dumped shares of publicly-traded companies that are tied to cryptocurrencies with holdings of them or that derive fees from trading them.</p><p>Shares in Coinbase Global Inc. fell almost 10% despite assurances from its chief executive on Twitter that the company has sufficient assets for customer withdrawals and doesn\u2019t have any material exposure to FTX. Coinbase closed at its lowest level since going public last year when it fetched an $85 billion valuation. Its market value Wednesday was around $10 billion.</p><p>Shares of Silvergate Capital Corp., the closest U.S. bank to the crypto world, dropped 12% and have shed some 75% of their value this year. Shares of MicroStrategy Inc., which pivoted from business software into largely a buy-and-hold vehicle for bitcoin, fell nearly 20%.</p><p>Brokerage app Robinhood Markets Inc., which offers trading in more than just crypto, was burned by fears that one of its biggest shareholders, Mr. Bankman-Fried, would have to dump his shares. Robinhood shares dropped nearly 14% on Wednesday, bringing losses for the week to more than 30%.</p><p>The cause of the FTX liquidity squeeze still isn\u2019t known, but some investors and crypto holders are asking if links between the exchange and a related company, Alameda Research, could have contributed to the crisis. Alameda is majority owned by Mr, Bankman-Fried, and he founded both FTX and Alameda.</p><p>Questions about the depth and extent of FTX and Alameda\u2019s financial relationship grew last week after CoinDesk published a report that indicated much of Alameda\u2019s balance sheet was made up of FTT, a cryptocurrency created by FTX.</p><p>Cryptocurrency exchanges, like their counterparts in the world of traditional, regulated finance, rely on a mix of partners to provide digital assets for trading, like bitcoin or ether. So-called market makers help traders buy and sell. They get paid by collecting a small difference between the bid and offer price.</p><p>Having ties between an exchange and market maker raised governance issues and the potential for conflicts of interest. In theory, such ties could allow a market maker to potentially trade on privileged information or use the exchange to inflate or deflate prices of a given security.</p><p>\u201cThese related-party relationships are all red flags that any regulator would recognize,\u201d said Larry Harris, a finance professor at the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business and a former Securities and Exchange Commission chief economist.</p><p>In traditional financial markets for equities and futures, exchanges are required to be neutral platforms. Regulators discourage them from being intertwined with trading firms. In the unregulated world of crypto, though, there aren\u2019t any such constraints.</p><p>There were other links between FTX and Alameda, which besides being a market maker traded for its own purposes. The firm used FTX\u2019s FTT tokens as collateral for loans it took out from other crypto lenders, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p>FTT went into freefall in the days after the CoinDesk report and has lost around 90% of its value.</p><p>Mr. Bankman-Fried previously rebutted the idea Alameda was intertwined with FTX, saying to the Journal in February that none of FTX\u2019s market makers have access to any nonpublic market data. And while Alameda trades on FTX, he said, \u201ctheir volume is a very small fraction of overall exchange volume, and their account\u2019s access is the same as others.\"\"</p>", "parentCommentId": "FWQauoxKTqNMTqmrs", "user": {"username": "Charles He"}}, {"_id": "qnaKwKsaEsJLL6HpJ", "postedAt": "2022-11-10T09:12:23.017Z", "postId": "axMM3wzqetWwtbXis", "htmlBody": "<p>At this point FTX turning into a PFG would be very bad optics for the movement and maybe a net negative.&nbsp;<br><br>I turned to FTX because I knew what SBF would do with the profits, but many don't know that, and I think they could have done better if they advertised that fact to consumers.
