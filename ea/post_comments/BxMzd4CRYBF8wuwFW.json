[...] we make three\nassumptions which will be further fleshed out in the following sections:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u2022 <strong>There seems to be a relatively unified cortical algorithm which is capable\nof processing different types of information.</strong> Most, if not all, of the\ninformation processing in the brain of any given individual is carried out using\nvariations of this basic algorithm. Therefore we do not need to study hundreds\nof different types of cortical algorithms before we can create the first version of\nan exocortex.<br />\u2022 <strong>We already have a fairly good understanding on how the cerebral cortex\nprocesses information and gives rise to the attentional processes underlying consciousness.</strong>  We have a good reason to believe that an exocortex\nwould be compatible with the existing cortex and would integrate with the\nmind.<br />\u2022 <strong>The cortical algorithm has an inbuilt ability to transfer information\nbetween cortical areas.</strong> Connecting the brain with an exocortex would therefore\nallow the exocortex to gradually take over or at least become an interface\nfor other exocortices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In addition to allowing for mind coalescence, the exocortex could also provide\na route for uploading human minds. It has been suggested that an upload can be\ncreated by copying the brain layer-by-layer [Moravec, 1988] or by cutting a brain\ninto small slices and scanning them [Sandberg &amp; Bostrom, 2008]. However, given\nour current technological status and understanding of the brain, we suggest that\nthe exocortex might be a likely intermediate step. As an exocortex-equipped brain\naged, degenerated and eventually died, an exocortex could take over its functions,\nuntil finally the original person existed purely in the exocortex and could be copied\nor moved to a different substrate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to avoid the objection of it being too hard to scan the brain in all detail. If we can replicate the high-level functioning of the cortical algorithm, then we can do so in a way which doesn't need to be biologically realistic, but which will still allow us to implement the brain's essential functions in a neural prosthesis (here's some <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/8/4/046017/meta\">prior</a> <a href=\"http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2560/10/6/066013/meta\">work</a> that also replicates some aspect of brain's functioning and re-implements it in a neuroprosthesis, without needing to capture all of the biological details). And if the cortical algorithm can be replicated in a way that allows the person's brain to gradually transfer over functions and memories as the biological brain accumulates damage, the same way that function in the biological brain gets reorganized and can remain intact <a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(07\\\">even as it slowly accumulates massive damage</a>61127-1), then that should allow the entirety of the person's cortical function to transfer over to the neuroprosthesis. (of course, there are still the non-cortical parts of the brain that need to be uploaded as well)</p>\n<p>A large challenge here is in getting the required amount of neural connections between the exocortex and the biological brain; but we are already getting relatively close, taking into account that the corpus callosum that connects the two hemispheres &quot;only&quot; has on the order of 100 million connections:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Earlier this year, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) launched a project called Neural Engineering System Design. It aims to win approval from the US Food and Drug Administration within 4 years for a wireless human brain device that can monitor brain activity using 1 million electrodes simultaneously and selectively stimulate up to 100,000 neurons.
