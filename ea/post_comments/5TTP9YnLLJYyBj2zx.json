If Musk or someone can set up a space economy that gradually gives people real incentives to fly there and back, it's not that hard to imagine the free market effectively covering this cost many times over. That doesn't have to mean something like 'people on Earth pay to transport materials from the surface of Mars to the surface of Earth'. If you have a bunch of individuals living on the surface for whatever reason (initially scientific research, say), they could make a living in any number of ways such that some of the value is exportable to earth - low gravity research or industry, xenobiology, web development, art, or whatever - and you can bet they'd be spending a very high proportion of that on urgently reducing the number of ways that their environment could kill them.</li><li>Feedback loops: we know that Earth has a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_laboratory_biosecurity_incidents\"><strong>terrible</strong> record</a> of keeping important-to-isolate areas actually isolated. You could spend the GDP of a mid-sized nation on creating a network of theoretically isolated bunkers, but if one sleepy resident calls out for pizza, leaves a vent off or whatever, the entire thing could be compromised, at least to biological hazards. On the other hand, space settlements, unlike bunkers, <strong>force</strong> isolation. Obviously mistakes can still be fatal, but unlike on Earth they're going to have a fast and hard-to-ignore feedback loop if they're doing something existentially risky. On an offworld colony if you make a serious mistake a bunch of people will probably&nbsp; die very soon after. On an Earth bunker if you make a serious mistake the whole of the bunker might all die at some indefinite point after - which is exactly what it was supposed to safeguard against.</li><li>Relatedly, lack of any serious proposal to make such disaster shelters on Earth. This is maybe just human motivation, or the 'forcing function' people like Robert Zubrin have described: you put people on a remote frontier where their lives are in danger every day, and they're just going to be a lot more productive than people who vaguely think their project might matter someday.</li><li>Also relatedly, in-atmosphere biodefence seems hopeless. We seem quite close to it being terrifyingly easy to create extremely viral and extremely lethal pandemics and nowhere near being able to regulate the ecosystem to the degree that would defend against them.</li><li>Long-term value: a bunker system is ultimately way more limited as a backup mechanism. At its apotheosis, the residents might be able to help humanity leapfrog some of the way towards the modern era (which may not actually bypass that much of the existential risk, per my argument <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/gWsTMm5Nbgdxedyns/p/YnBwoNNqe6knBJH8p\">here</a> and the subsequent post I'm still working on in that series). Whereas the apotheosis of offworld colonisation is basically our end goal - colonising the Virgo supercluster. And it would only take a century or two at most - and possibly only a few decades on optimistic timelines - to far surpass the best defence a bunker system could provide.&nbsp;</li><li>'Self-sustainingness' is more of a spectrum than a hard line. If some 100% lethal pandemic or other such event killed all humans on Earth, an offworld colony would still be able to repopulate it if they had the capacity for a couple of trips back and the wherewithal to outlast the catastrophe. It seems plausible that an offworld colony could start providing meaningful backup (without yet being fully self-sustaining) by 2050-2060.</li></ul><p>If you also think AI timelines might substantially longer than EAs typically think or that AI could be less 'extinction event' and more 'global catastrophe on the order of taking down the internet' (which seems plausible to me - there are a lot of selection effects in this community for short-timeline-doomers and evidence for some quite <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kCAcrjvXDt2evMpBz/a-tale-of-2-5-orthogonality-theses\">strong groupthink</a>) then it starts to look like a reasonable area for further consideration, especially given how little serious scrutiny it's had among EAs to date.</p>", "parentCommentId": "5tqwHiPiFcoWxBngr", "user": {"username": "Arepo"}}, {"_id": "WrWyotDmfqJCk3e8t", "postedAt": "2023-12-09T23:53:13.646Z", "postId": "5TTP9YnLLJYyBj2zx", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for the comment.<br><br>I'd like to stress that it seems at least plausible to me that encouraging space colonization could be a worthwhile cause area.

Eg the matter at hand: space colonisation is a confluence of a huge number of areas, including public opinion, funding, engineering, political will, etc. In fact, there's very little academic research that needs to be done to make it happen. I think this is normally the case when EAs dismiss something as 'not neglected' (cf also climate change)</li><li>For technology-ish areas, public opinion-ish areas &nbsp;(ie almost any practical issue) I think you should have something much more like an S-curve prior, which requires you to make more assumptions than a log returns prior, and to do more empirical research to justify them.

This means that, while we have many people in the community who want to use their time and their talents to do good, we lack the organisations that can provide the work. There are opportunities abroad, but not enough, and the fact they are abroad limits their capacity to absorb talent located in the Netherlands.' Another way of looking at this would be 'EA field building and organisational development in the Netherlands is hugely neglected, and therefore and extremely high-leverage opportunity for doing such things'.
