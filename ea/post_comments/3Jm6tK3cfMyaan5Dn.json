I have been beating a similar drum for some years. I am a humanist/Universalist but previously I was a Christian pastor, and I have No negative thoughts toward religion, in fact as a Universalist I admire all religions and as a humanist no religion. But like you I understand there is so much good useable stuff to be mined from religion. I think Anabaptists are also similar in many ways to Quakers and I\u2019ve learned so much from them, though never a member myself.</p>\n<p>As a community of Altruists wanting to reach peak effectiveness it seems so obvious to me we should do what you\u2019re saying. The single greatest altruist communities on earth today are religious communities and it\u2019s always been that way\u2026Universities as a thing, hospitals as a thing directly created by religious groups. Research and Science all comes from religious origins. Of course religion in Europe got so toxic just at the same point the scientific revolution took off that science was a meaningful refuge away from religion\u2026you could have a life that made sense and do good things in the world for the first time away from the toxic religious situation at that time so educated people began fleeing religion. That set up the current unfortunate situation of secular humanists looking down their noses at religious people, culture, etc. I feel it\u2019s a pendulum thing where they had to swing away, to escape the toxicity of hundreds of years of European religious wars following the reformation in 1500\u2019s but now we can swing back and realize how much good was in religion as you\u2019ve shown.</p>\n<p>Religion has these swings itself, where it goes good for some years and then usually gets a taste of political power and swings towards doing bad. I experienced this swing when the religious right in the 80\u2019s discovered they could elect Presidents and Legislators and grabbed the power leading to the current poor state. I was in a big movement in the 90\u2019s and 00\u2019s where basically a bunch of us ejected ourselves out of the horrible directions things were going and started an alternative movement much inspired by Quakers, Anabaptists and others, called the Emerging Church Movement. It was a bunch of young leaders wanting to go in a way different direction and lead to a lot of great things. Unfortunately it was too white and male and we decided to lay it down and let others not white and male lead us forward\u2026a very good death.</p>\n<p>One example of a useful thing for EA is cross cultural communication. For millennia religious people have crossed borders to communicate their messages\u2026motivated by pure pragmatism they slowly but surely got good at it. My Bachelors degree is 50% exactly that\u2026we got into it at a deep level. It has helped me so much in so many areas of life over the years. I think EA needs it in this way \u2014 to cross the cultural divide between Elite/STEM culture and creative/business and working class culture. For EA to grow and prosper these folks need to come in and there is a lot of work to be done to be able to communicate to them in ways they feel culturally comfortable with. That\u2019s the goal of cross cultural communication- for the other to hear you in their own language and culture, the place they feel comfortable.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s where I think the trajectory of your post can be very fruitful\u2026it\u2019s not so much setting up a bunch of EA groups to study Quakerism\u2026I doubt that would happen, rather it\u2019s just to culturally swing the pendulum to a place where elite academic STEM people just feel comfortable and are more accepting of religious people and ideas, and lose their penchance to dismiss them, but rather have a new curiosity and openness.</p>\n<p>This becomes pragmatically hugely important if you found a new charity in Africa or South America or Asia and find yourself needing to work with stakeholders locally that are frequently going to be religious.  Then you are forced to get more religion friendly\u2026why not start now and be ready.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "JeffreyK"}}, {"_id": "y8taqZk3s6DvauHPw", "postedAt": "2022-10-06T04:40:43.974Z", "postId": "3Jm6tK3cfMyaan5Dn", "htmlBody": "<p>You've mentioned upthread that you're uncertain what exactly EAs should do to be \"more like peak Quakerism\", but can you take a stab at some concrete suggestions that illustrate what you mean?

Even at their peak, they were maybe most notable for dressing funny.

Similar to other religious minorities that sometimes do well after being cornered into one part of the economy.<br>- Businesses did well partly because they were so fastidious about honesty, so they had a reputation for fairness.

I think that EA ideas and Quaker values do have some amount of modern overlap which would be potentially useful to look at further.&nbsp;<br><br>I have a comment on nonviolence:&nbsp;<br><br>You write: \"They were non-violent, considered, calm but <i>principled</i>. They had beliefs that were well constructed, well founded and considered - and beliefs they held <i>strongly to</i>, but never violently.\"&nbsp;<br><br>Something to add, for context about Quakers -- while they are deeply committed to nonviolence, historically this was not always calm, and the meaning of nonviolence held and still holds a good deal of plurality within it.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, Quakers were ahead of the moral curve on some things like abolition of slavery.&nbsp;<br>However, we should be careful not to believe that this was a monolithic view strongly held within the community from the outset. It took time and advocacy within Quakers to see it this way. Benjamin Lay, one of the first Quakers seriously outspoken against slavery in the states was extremely passionately outspoken, seriously shamed his fellow Quakers who held slaves and, as I have heard, was indeed kicked out of multiple meetings for his passionate exhortations.&nbsp;<br><br>Benjamin Lay was nonviolent but he was he was not calm. His tactics of the time involved such things as <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/quaker-comet-greatest-abolitionist-never-heard-180964401/\">spraying fake-blood on fellow meeting goers who held slaves </a>and laying infront of the meeting house door so that people would need to step on him to exit.&nbsp;<br><br>He isn't representative of the median Quaker, of course, but I think in reasoning out the origins of Quaker abolitionism, it was likely that some tactics like Lay's were instrumental to getting the rest of the mass of the group to pay attention and start taking different kinds of actions. There are other Quakers in the tradition of taking \"radical\" action to spark change or push the group, such as <a href=\"https://www.quakersintheworld.org/quakers-in-action/15/Mary-Dyer\">Mary Dyer</a> who was hanged after advocating for religious freedom.&nbsp;<br><br>I think the answer the question of \"How did they best ensure they were on the right-side of the moral curve?\" involves at least some amount of \"there were people with radical views who expressed them extremely strongly and vividly in ways that caught attention and sparked conversation and action among the masses\"&nbsp;AND because this religion believes that God speaks through people, sometimes passionately, people with strong and consistent views were often taken seriously in their moral convictions.&nbsp;<br><br>That's a bit of a rough/crude take, and is no where near complete.

At the time of its establishment Quakerism was a very outward looking sect seeking for radical renewal of the world in the aftermath of the English Civil War. At one point perhaps 25% of the population of England were convinced of the truth of the tenets of Quakerism. However, this period was short lived and the movement faltered in size and importance and became highly insular shortly afterwards.<br><br>This insularity is not at all unrelated to the successes you talk about. For instance, one of the key aspects of Quaker business successes was that the society (Quakers refer to ourselves as The Religious Society of Friends) provided a very strong social network with a high degree of interpersonal trust. Quakers would know that they could seek one another out wherever they were and arrange business transactions on favourable terms. If anyone was found to have been acting in bad faith they would be 'cast out' and shunned by other Quakers, which due to the highly insular nature of the society would generally mean losing contact with all their family and friends and quite likely a good deal of their property as well. There was also a tradition that if a Quaker business were to fail then other Quakers would pay its debts off, which again was generally very good for business. While some Quakers still did act highly dishonourably (e.g. The famous mid-victorian case of Overend, Gurney and Company) these advantages were of significant value, especially to bankers and merchants, and explain &nbsp;lot of Quakers commercial successes.</p><p>One can make a similar argument about Quaker opposition to the slave trade. One of the things that caused Quakers to produce some of the earliest corporate statements in opposition to slavery was that slave owning was a huge problem for individual Quakers and their communities. Quakers, especially in the US, were among the most prolific slave owners. However, other Quakers were also convinced that slavery was abhorrent and needed to be abolished. The insular nature of the Society meant that in many meetings in the US these two groups were in close connection with one another and it was very difficult for either group to escape from this connection. This meant that individual meetings had to work to resolve such disagreements if they were going to survive. There were many instances in which meetings resolved them by ejecting those who were opposed to slavery (again have a look at the history of Benjamin Lay, perhaps the most 'cast out' Quaker in history). However, within time the dispute was eventually settled largely in favour of the anti-slavers and this is often what lead to these early statements. When the society was finally lead to go further and say that not only was slavery not fit for Quakers but that it should be abolished in society as a whole (this certainly did not happen overnight) it's dense social networks also provided highly valuable as a means of organising the anti-slavery movement and local meetings became valuable resources.</p><p>I could go further, it is a fascinating history. I am a longstanding Quaker and I love the society and our history. However, I do think that a lot of people have a very limited view of how the society operates and why it has had some notable successes. For what it is worth my personal view is that Quakers have a lot to teach those who are willing to patiently come to understand these things but that there are also many many examples of people drawing the wrong conclusions. The Quakers are, and always were, a peculiar people and in many ways the society is a failure. At only 300,000 members worldwide and divided into many factions, most of which do not see eye to eye on a great many things, the society is a long way from peak anything. However, we still have our successes (for instance I was directly involved in successful efforts to use our special marital exemptions to force the UK government's hand on introducing equal marriage, since we believed that we could go ahead and do it anyway if they didn't change the law), and I am glad of that.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Simon_Beard"}}, {"_id": "iHqhu8ciropEdvYwJ", "postedAt": "2022-10-28T11:12:05.170Z", "postId": "3Jm6tK3cfMyaan5Dn", "htmlBody": "<p>I think it's important to consider the counterfactual when considering the impact of religious groups.
