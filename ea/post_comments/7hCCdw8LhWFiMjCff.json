First of all, they're cute (see diagram). You didn't even mention that they're cute, yet you claim to present a fair and balanced case? Hedgehog hogwash, I say.</p><p>Anyway, I think the skills required for forecasting vs model-building are quite different. I'm not a forecaster, so don't trust me on this. But if I were, I believe I would try to read much more and more widely so I'm not blindsided by stuff I didn't even know that I didn't know. Forecasting is caring more about the numbers; model-building is caring more about how the vertices link up, whatever their weights. Model-building is for generating new hypotheses that didn't exist before; forecasting is discriminating between what already exists.</p><p>I try to build conceptual models, and afaict I get much more than 80% of the benefit from 20% of the content that's already in my brain. There are some very general patterns I've thought so deeply on that they provide usefwl perspectives on new stuff I learn weekly. I'd rather learn 5 things deeply, and remember sub-patterns so well that they fire whenever I see something slightly similar, compared to 50 things so shallowly that the only time I think about them is when I see the flashcards. Knowledge not pondered upon in the shower is no knowledge at all.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:439.219px\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/81a89762c410688074e8051fbddf5c4216d02de125aaa2ba.jpg\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/81a89762c410688074e8051fbddf5c4216d02de125aaa2ba.jpg/w_112 112w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/81a89762c410688074e8051fbddf5c4216d02de125aaa2ba.jpg/w_192 192w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/81a89762c410688074e8051fbddf5c4216d02de125aaa2ba.jpg/w_272 272w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/81a89762c410688074e8051fbddf5c4216d02de125aaa2ba.jpg/w_352 352w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/81a89762c410688074e8051fbddf5c4216d02de125aaa2ba.jpg/w_432 432w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/81a89762c410688074e8051fbddf5c4216d02de125aaa2ba.jpg/w_512 512w\"></figure>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Emrik"}}, {"_id": "PgRGAiS5BgaAvPy2P", "postedAt": "2022-11-05T15:44:23.332Z", "postId": "7hCCdw8LhWFiMjCff", "htmlBody": "<p>John von Neumann was a hedgefox.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe spectacular thing about Johnny [von Neumann] was not his power as a mathematician, which was great, or his insight and his clarity, but his rapidity; he was very, very fast.
