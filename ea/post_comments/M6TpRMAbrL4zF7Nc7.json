I relate to some of your considerations regarding philosophy (although I personally don't consider my philosophical education to be a mistake), programming, medical school, and law.</p>\n<p>You wrote about doctors being &quot;to a large extent replaceable,&quot; and taking this consideration at face-value in the past has made me give less consideration to the possibility of becoming a doctor. However, if you were a doctor, presumably you could be an earning-to-give doctor?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also, just focus on what you're good at. Don't think so much in terms of what you want to do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I like this suggestion if it's construed abstractly (e.g., I've come to a point where I see thoughts of the form &quot;I am good at , so I could do &quot; as potentially better than &quot;I happen to be good at , so I should try to do &quot;). I think reading about effective altruism might also sometimes lend a sense of urgency to EAs that may hamper their long-term development. An example of this sense: &quot;So, a lot of bad things seem to be happening, and I need to employ my current skillset ASAP to help ameliorate them.&quot; This sort of thinking might constrain the possibilities that someone might think of.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You also can't get too hung up on comparing yourselves to other people. When I was in high school, I was super good at math. I went to national-level math meets. But then I got to these meets and saw people who were even better than I was. Then I'm like, &quot;Oh, man!&quot; It's really discouraging.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have been discouraged at times as well and probably underestimated my abilities because I was often reading things from high-ability types. So, regarding writings, there was sort of a selection effect in that I was comparing myself to people who, by virtue of the process of seeking out their thoughts, were more developed than me in various ways. I raise this consideration so that others might recognize this component in their own self-assessments and persist in their development. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "dneylon"}}, {"_id": "ThcYcYz4bsbipKPcL", "postedAt": "2014-09-20T20:52:48.350Z", "postId": "M6TpRMAbrL4zF7Nc7", "htmlBody": "<p>A great talk!

Greg Lewis, a British doctor, estimates that earning to give in medicine beats direct medical work by a considerable margin. As he put it in an interview I had with him recently, &quot;the chequebook can likely beat the stethoscope.&quot; He also believes medicine is a reasonably good earning to give career, though probably not as good as other lucrative careers prospective doctors can pursue instead.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "vCpY28KBKnMptovwN", "user": {"username": "Pablo_Stafforini"}}, {"_id": "6LxtYvGARTXLYikxJ", "postedAt": "2014-09-20T22:35:14.744Z", "postId": "M6TpRMAbrL4zF7Nc7", "htmlBody": "<p>That's wonderful that you are doing talks/blog posts promoting earning to give.

Circumstances could conspire to make the direct impact win in a few cases. If your top priority cause is developing world health, and you are prepared to practice medicine in a developing nation, then I might lean toward direct action. If you're particularly talented in a highly leveraged area like public health medicine or cost-effectiveness research, then you could make a case either way. We might be able to have a better discussion about this after Greg publishes more on the topic.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "9DkYeZAXwRyabTrYY", "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}]
