The conference capacity is around 500, we've admitted 404 people so far, and CEA have told me that usually 95% of accepted applicants register and 95% of registered attendees show up to the conference. Therefore we have 500-404*0.95*0.95 = 135 spots left, so ideally we'd like to admit another 150 people.</p><p>Our acceptance rate is currently 80%, with another 10% waitlisted and 9% rejected.</p>", "parentCommentId": "HggqEszJSJErtHjSS", "user": {"username": "robirahman"}}, {"_id": "cMv5v5c4gwT7S3KbW", "postedAt": "2023-07-29T08:06:53.096Z", "postId": "LZxXjkZDzvdEDFpxz", "htmlBody": "<p>Alright Robi, that's excellent!
