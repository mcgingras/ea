That would be several tens of thousands of dollars of value to me and would half my income, which would be a hardship to me. But it should only take <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ROI6dRdKsNfXg5gIyBa1_7eYOjowfbw5n65zkrLnvc/edit#gid=1680005064&amp;range=B19\">~$285.92</a> to \"offset\" that harm to me personally, by doubling someone else's income - theoretically the harm i experience for losing one day's labor can be fully offset by giving a givedirectly recipient <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sNB40ot0sfa4v3OdF0Pv9F99hSKImbrjyTVfnISJeFU/edit#gid=1326347579&amp;range=B213\">0.78</a> cents. Obviously my own labor is <i>worth </i>more than 0.78 cents a day on the market, but matters being how they are, 0.78 cents seems to be around what it takes to \"offset\" the humanitarian cost to me personally (and the same to any volunteer, with respect to them-personally) of losing a day's labor.</p><p>Having established that, how much unpaid labor are we talking about?</p><blockquote><p>5-12 people who meet for 90 minutes a week, over six sessions.</p></blockquote><p>Assuming 8 hours of capacity-to-work per day, a volunteer does 5.6-13.5 days of labor per client treated. 1.5 hours \u00d7 6 sessions \u00d7 (5 to 12 people) / 8 hour workday = 5.6-13.5 days of labor per client treated&nbsp;<br><br>So if we imagine that volunteers are actually missing work opportunities and sacrificing income in order to do this, $4.37-$10.53 donation to GiveDirectly per client treated might represent the cost to \"offset\" these potential \"harms\". But hopefully volunteers <i>aren't</i> actually choosing to forgo vital economic opportunities and taking on hardship in order to take on volunteer labor, and are doing it because they like it and want to and get something out of it, so maybe the true opportunity cost/disvalue to them is &lt;20% of the equivalent labor-hours, if not zero?<br><br>anyway, this all seems kind of esoteric and theoretical - just something i had considered adding to the analysis (because at first I had an intuition, perhaps one which you had as well to motivate your question, that volunteer labor isn't <i>really</i> free, just because it is unpaid), and then discarded because it seemed like the effect would be too negligible to be worth the complications it added. Like i said in the other comment, all of that is quite different from the other matter of what it might cost to <i>pay </i>a staff member or volunteer - staff and volunteers presumably have more earning potential as givedirectly recipients who are selected to be low income, and might be able command salaries much higher than that. And I don't, actually, know the answer with respect to what the program might cost if all volunteers were instead paid, or exactly to what extent main costs are actually about the labor of people directly playing therapist roles (total staff salaries vs other costs might be easier to grab, but that's answering a different quesiton than you asked, staff infrastructure won't be all about leading &nbsp;therapy sessions).&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "drJFfZ6GvLFkQTSD9", "user": {"username": "ishaan"}}]
