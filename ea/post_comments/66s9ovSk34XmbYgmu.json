There are positive-sum games with win-win outcomes, negative-sum games where all parties lose, and complex \"meta-games\" where zero-sum competitions are part of larger non-zero-sum systems.</p><p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p><ol><li>Zero-sum games like chess have clear winners and losers where one's gain equals the other's loss. Common sayings reflect zero-sum thinking.</li><li>Positive-sum games result in win-win scenarios, like two collectors swapping card doubles to complete their collections.</li><li>Negative-sum games are lose-lose situations, like a bar fight resulting in injuries and damages. Identifying and avoiding these games can be beneficial.</li><li>Meta-games consist of embedded games within wider systems. A zero-sum competition can become part of a larger non-zero-sum industry.</li><li>In the real world, properly understanding complex multi-layered meta-games helps decide which games to play or avoid.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This comment was auto-generated by the EA Forum Team.
