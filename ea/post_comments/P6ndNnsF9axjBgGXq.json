I'm an EA and also a neuroscience PhD student who studies astrocytes. As you might imagine, I totally agree that neuroscience perspectives are valuable for EA decisions.

Any ideas?</p>\n<p>Regarding the ethics of animal experiments, I'm working on a project to create educational materials about the importance of environmental enrichment (IMHO the most important welfare issue for laboratory animals). I've actually applied to EA Grants for funding to create a website aimed at educating life scientists about this issue.</p>\n<p>On the topic of astrocytes, you'll be happy to know that I asked Adam Marblestone about glia after his talk at EA Global in Boston. :) <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0eX1UqMmaLM?t=21m27s\">https://youtu.be/0eX1UqMmaLM?t=21m27s</a></p>\n", "parentCommentId": "RzpPkh7cQmYwhdkrn", "user": {"username": "greg_fitzgerald"}}, {"_id": "SgguXMDceBiR9arDd", "postedAt": "2017-06-28T16:01:53.505Z", "postId": "P6ndNnsF9axjBgGXq", "htmlBody": "<p>Update: the AMA is now live, <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1c3/hi_im_luke_muehlhauser_ama_about_open/\">here</a>.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "lukeprog"}}, {"_id": "DFj5CA28SkTTfSxcs", "postedAt": "2017-06-28T23:41:54.475Z", "postId": "P6ndNnsF9axjBgGXq", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Evan, your question has now been posted to the AMA <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1c3/hi_im_luke_muehlhauser_ama_about_open/b9r\">here</a>.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "WS9L2qmJM5B9uA7ku", "user": {"username": "lukeprog"}}]
