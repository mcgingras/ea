The team also assisted with and vetted the language of the 2012 bill and made sure that weak policy proposals did not supplant strong ones. Pew accomplished these goals largely by capitalizing on their expertise and by deploying the multi-pronged strategy [explained in this report]. Pew did not act alone. It had the assistance of strong industry partners, FDA officials, and key congressmen and senators\u2026 [Pew] became the single most important non-government and non-industry player in the field.

We <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/translational-science-and-valley-death\">previously</a> wrote about the alleged \u201cvalley of death\u201d that makes it challenging to translate academic insights about biology into new medical technologies. This post is about a different issue, one that has come up in the vast majority of conversations I\u2019ve had with scientists: <strong>it is believed to be extremely difficult to do what this post will call \u201cbreakthrough fundamental science\u201d in the existing life sciences ecosystem.</strong></p><p>Breakthrough fundamental science is the term I\u2019m using for what I believe many of the people I\u2019ve spoken to have meant when they\u2019ve used terms such as \u201cbasic research,\u201d \u201chigh-risk/high-reward research\u201d and \u201crevolutionary/path-breaking research.\u201d My subject matter knowledge is extremely limited, so I can\u2019t be confident that I\u2019ve correctly classified the comments I\u2019ve heard as having a consistent theme or that I\u2019m correctly defining the theme, but I\u2019m attempting to do so anyway because the theme has seemed consistent and important. In brief, \u201cbreakthrough fundamental science\u201d (in the context of life sciences) refers to <strong>research that achieves important, broadly applicable insights about biological processes, such that the insights bring on many new promising directions for research, yet it is difficult to anticipate all the specific ways in which they will be applied and thus difficult to be assured of \u201cresults\u201d in the sense of new clinical applications.</strong> This type of work stands in contrast to research that is primarily aimed at producing a particular new drug, diagnostic or other medical technology.</p><p>This definition doesn\u2019t lend itself to fully objective classifications, but a couple of illustrative examples would be: (a) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_code\">understanding the genetic code and the structure of DNA</a>; (b) (more recently) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR\">work on the CRISPR/CAS system</a> and developing it to the point where it can be used to \u201cedit\u201d an organism\u2019s DNA. Each of these has opened up many possible directions for research, while not having immediately clear relevance for a particular disease, condition or clinical application.</p><p>This post will:</p><ul><li>Give examples of the wide variety of people who have noted the difficulty of securing support for attempts at breakthrough fundamental science in the current system.</li><li>Discuss what the roots of this \u201cgap\u201d might be.</li></ul><h1>Comments about breakthrough fundamental science</h1><p>Many of the conversations we\u2019ve had, as I\u2019ve interpreted them, have stressed the difficulty of securing support for attempts at breakthrough fundamental science in the current system. It has been a common theme in discussions with relatively junior scientists we interviewed as potential advisors (off the record), including those who serve as our advisors now. It has also been emphasized by a number of very senior scientists with substantial credentials and authority. Some examples of the latter follow. Quotes are not verbatim; they are taken from our <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/conversations\">public conversation notes</a>, which paraphrase the points made by the speaker.</p><p><a href=\"http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Susan%20Desmond-Hellmann%204-18-14%20(public).pdf\">Susan Desmond-Hellmann</a>, current CEO of the Gates Foundation (then Chancellor of UCSF, and formerly president of product development at Genentech):</p><blockquote><p><i>The NIH faces a large number of applicants for a relatively small number of grants. Its current methods for selecting recipients have difficulty ensuring fairness and reliable support for good scientists. In addition, these methods are likely biased toward incremental and established research over higher-risk, higher-reward research. It is particularly difficult for young researchers to secure adequate funding.</i></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Neal%20Lane%204-16-14%20(public).pdf\">Neal Lane</a>, currently Provost at Rice University, who has headed both the National Science Foundation and the White House\u2019s Office of Science and Technology Policy:</p><blockquote><p><i>The National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), as well as the Department of Energy\u2019s Office of Science, NASA and other agencies support basic research. But, increasingly, these agencies have been challenged to ensure that the research they support has potential practical benefits for the country. As a result, support for bold, sometimes called \u201chigh risk,\u201d research has suffered. There has been a growing pressure to identify outcomes, and that discourages potentially path-breaking investigations.</i></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Alberts%201-29-14%20(public).pdf\">Bruce Alberts</a>, currently of UCSF, formerly Editor-in-Chief of <i>Science</i> and President of the National Academy of Sciences:</p><blockquote><p><i>The current funding system for scientific research is biased toward supporting short-term, translational research (research that looks for practical applications of basic science) \u2026 I am painfully aware of the huge gaps in our understanding of fundamental life processes. Many great opportunities to advance this understanding through basic research in biology are not receiving funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the largest funder of biomedical research. Changing incentives to more effectively recognize the critical importance of such understanding would have a strong effect on researchers\u2019 choices and help produce more outstanding basic research.</i></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Howard%20Hughes%20Medical%20Institute%2006-03-13.pdf\">Robert Tjian and Cheryl Moore</a>, President and Chief Operating Officer of <a href=\"https://www.hhmi.org/\">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a> (which I believe is the largest private science funder in the U.S.):</p><blockquote><p><i>One of the major issues in biomedical research is that biology is not understood well enough to get to the root of problems \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of pressure to push science in applied or clinical directions before it\u2019s ready, which can result in money being poorly spent.</i></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/16/5773.full.pdf+html\">A paper in PNAS</a> co-authored by Bruce Alberts (listed above), Harold Varmus (former Director of the National Cancer Institute and former Director of the National Institutes of Health) and others:</p><blockquote><p><i>The system now favors those who can guarantee results rather than those with potentially path-breaking ideas that, by definition, cannot promise success. Young investigators are discouraged from departing too far from their postdoctoral work, when they should instead be posing new questions and inventing new approaches. Seasoned investigators are inclined to stick to their tried-and-true formulas for success rather than explore new fields \u2026 Many surprising discoveries, powerful research tools, and important medical benefits have arisen from efforts to decipher complex biological phenomena in model organisms. In a climate that discourages such work by emphasizing short-term goals, scientific progress will inevitably be slowed, and revolutionary findings will be deferred (3).</i></p></blockquote><p>A few notes based on my recollections, though largely not captured in public records:</p><ul><li>My recollection is that many were particularly energized about the difficulty of funding <i>research aiming to improve tools and techniques</i>, which I discussed in a <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/path-biomedical-progress\">previous post</a> (see classification (A) in that post).</li><li>Nobody claimed that there is a <i>small amount</i> of research projects attempting breakthrough fundamental science, only that there ought to be far more due to the high importance.</li><li>In addition, it\u2019s worth noting that breakthrough fundamental science is often greatly rewarded in the long run; for example, many <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-laureates-in-physiology-or-medicine\">relevant Nobel Prizes</a> seem to be for work that broadly fits in this category. (That is to say, many of the Prizes seem to have gone to work with broad applications for understanding biological processes in general, but no obvious application to a particular disease, condition or applied medical technology.) But having a chance at a Nobel Prize decades down the line isn\u2019t necessarily helpful for a scientist seeking to do breakthrough fundamental research; the work needs to be funded today in order to be practicable.</li><li>The concept of \u201crisk\u201d is somewhat ambiguous in some of the quotes above. It could refer to the risk that a project will fail on its own terms (e.g. failing to answer its own question or effectively test its own hypothesis). It could also refer to the uncertainty involved in the <i>applications</i> of particular research. My sense is that most attempts at breakthrough fundamental science are risky in both senses, but particularly the second. Regarding the first - it seems likely that attempts to make major breakthroughs will rarely be able to stick with familiar approaches and be assured of useful results. Regarding the second - when one\u2019s goal is to achieve major insights useful for understanding biological processes in general, it may often be difficult to say in advance just what sorts of clinical applications these insights will have. This could be a problem for funders focused on the most direct, high-confidence paths to new drugs, diagnostics and other medical technologies.</li></ul><h1>What is the underlying dynamic?</h1><p>As noted above, there are a good number of people voicing support for the idea of supporting more attempts at breakthrough fundamental science. However, the problem arguably derives from factors that are fairly deep and difficult to change.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/16/5773.full.pdf+html\">PNAS paper mentioned in the previous section</a> lists multiple \u201csystemic flaws\u201d in the current system. The one it focuses most on is increasing competitiveness between scientists, brought about by an imbalance between supply and demand for academic positions:</p><blockquote><p><i>There is now a severe imbalance between the dollars available for research and the still-growing scientific community in the United States. This imbalance has created a hypercompetitive atmosphere in which scientific productivity is reduced and promising careers are threatened \u2026 Now that the percentage of NIH grant applications that can be funded has fallen from around 30% into the low teens, biomedical scientists are spending far too much of their time writing and revising grant applications and far too little thinking about science and conducting experiments. The low success rates have induced conservative, short-term thinking in applicants, reviewers, and funders.</i></p></blockquote><p>As <a href=\"http://report.nih.gov/NIHDatabook/Charts/Default.aspx?showm=Y&amp;chartId=124&amp;catId=13\">this chart from the NIH shows</a>, success rates for research project grants have fallen from ~30% to just under 20% since 1998, and the change has been driven by a growing number of applicants for a fairly constant number of annual awards. One might imagine that more applicants and more competitiveness would be a good thing, if the process consistently funded the most promising projects. However, my impression is that the NIH grant review process isn\u2019t necessarily optimized for identifying the <i>most</i> promising projects and applicants, as opposed to simply eliminating the <i>least</i> promising ones. Thus, it may be poorly suited to such a high level of competitiveness. For example, <a href=\"http://grants.nih.gov/grants/peer_review_process.htm#scoring2\">grant applications are given scores on a 1-9 scale by all reviewers, and then ultimately funded (or not) based on the <i>average</i></a>; this arguably privileges incremental science (likely to appear clearly worthwhile to large numbers of people) over higher-risk science (which might appear extremely promising to some and not at all promising to others).</p><p>The PNAS paper lists multiple problems brought about by high competitiveness, in addition to the risk aversion discussed above:</p><ul><li>It argues that competing for publication in top journals has caused scientists to \u201crush into print, cut corners, exaggerate their findings, and overstate the significance of their work\u201d, contributing to <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/meta-research-update\">issues with reproducibility that we\u2019ve written about before</a>.</li><li>It points to the <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0029738\">increasing domination of the field by later-career scientists</a>, and states that early-career scientists now face poor prospects and long time frames for getting substantial support for their research. I believe this sort of dynamic risks driving out the most promising scientists (who may have other career options) while retaining less promising ones; it also risks mis-allocating support, by funding scientists whose most productive years are behind rather than ahead of them.</li><li>It discusses the \u201ccrippling demands on a scientist\u2019s time\u201d brought on by the increasing difficulty of grant applications (it also cites an increasing regulatory burden as being relevant here). It argues that in addition to reducing time for scientific reflection, the increasing administrative burdens on senior scientists reduce the time they have available for peer review, which worsens the quality of the peer review process.</li><li>It explicitly argues that there is excessive interest in <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/translational-science-and-valley-death\">translational science</a>, and that this is another \u201cmanifestation of [a] shift to short-term thinking,\u201d which in turn may be another outgrowth of increased competitiveness.</li></ul><p>In my view, all of the above represent different aspects of <strong>distortion caused by the disconnect between what science is most valuable and what science is most straightforward to evaluate.</strong> Breakthrough fundamental science is characterized by being highly innovative (making it difficult to form a consistent framework for judging it), and by having far-in-the-future and difficult-to-predict ultimate impacts. It may be possible for top scientists to evaluate it using their judgment and intuitions, but any system that seeks consistent, well-defined, practically important outcome metrics will likely struggle to do so. Instead, such a system risks rewarding those who can game it, as well as those who can show more quick and consistent (even if ultimately less important) results.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting that the criticism of \u201crewarding the measurable, rather than the important\u201d has often been leveled at GiveWell\u2019s work on <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a>. I have long felt that focusing on the measurable is quite appropriate when (a) serving individual donors seeking somewhere they can give without having to invest a lot of time in learning; (b) working on issues related to global health and development, where <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2009/02/21/the-root-causes-of-poverty/\">higher-risk/higher-reward approaches have a history of coming up empty</a>. However, the world of scientific research is very different. In this environment, it seems to me that insisting on accountability to meaningful short-term metrics could easily do more harm than good.</p><h1>Should we focus on funding breakthrough fundamental science?</h1><p>The idea that breakthrough fundamental science is under-supported makes a good deal of sense to me, and I perceive a great deal of consensus on this point among scientists. However, evaluating - and implementing - the goal of \u201cfunding breakthrough fundamental science\u201d is fraught with challenges. Defining just what constitutes potential \u201cbreakthrough fundamental science\u201d seems to be extremely difficult and to require a good deal of scientific expertise and judgment. It would be a major challenge to estimate how much is being spent, vs. how much \u201cshould be\u201d spent, on potential breakthrough fundamental science - far more so than with <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/investigating-neglected-goals-scientific-research\">neglected goals</a>, and more so even than with <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/translational-science-and-valley-death\">translational research</a>.</p><p>In addition, it certainly isn\u2019t the case that this type of work is <i>highly neglected</i>. After all, it appears that breakthrough fundamental science is well-represented among <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/lists/all-nobel-laureates-in-physiology-or-medicine\">Nobel Prize winners</a>, and as the quotes above show, it is a major concern of some very large funders. It\u2019s highly possible that there are still far too few attempts at breakthrough fundamental science, but it\u2019s far from clear how to determine this.</p><p>At this time, our biggest focus is on trying to improve our general capacity to investigate scientific research, which we\u2019re working on <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/investigating-neglected-goals-scientific-research\">as described previously</a>. We\u2019re also trying to get more context on the history of major breakthroughs in biomedical sciences, and the role of different kinds of science in these breakthroughs. We will hopefully be better equipped for more investigation of breakthrough fundamental science after we\u2019ve made more progress on those fronts.</p><p>One more note: while the \u201cbreakthrough fundamental science\u201d idea is often presented as a contrast to <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/translational-science-and-valley-death\">focusing on \u201ctranslational research\u201d</a>, the two are not mutually exclusive. It could easily be the case that the existing system under-supports both, while focusing most of its resources on a particular kind of research that fits in neither category. My current picture is that, when looking at the <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/path-biomedical-progress\">stages of research I laid out earlier</a>, the existing system is quite focused on stage (C) - identifying the cause of particular diseases and conditions of interest - while potentially underinvesting in multiple other stages (some of which might be classified as \u201cbreakthrough fundamental science\u201d and some of which might be classified as \u201ctranslational research\u201d).</p>", "user": {"username": "HoldenKarnofsky"}}, {"_id": "cLdpcxiAqmjfKvuXG", "title": "Translational Science and the \u201cValley of Death\u201d", "postedAt": "2015-04-09T12:58:08.351Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Note: Before the launch of the Open Philanthropy Project Blog, this post appeared on the </i><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/\"><i>GiveWell Blog</i></a><i>.

Speaking very broadly, the basic idea is that:</p><ul><li>The world of life sciences research has become increasingly complex, with a widening gulf between traditional academic research - which aims at uncovering fundamental insights - and industry work, which is focused on developing drugs and other marketable products.</li><li>There is a lot of work that could be done on figuring out how to apply insights from academia and therefore close this gap. However, this \u201ctranslational science\u201d tends not to fit well within the traditional academic ecosystem - perhaps because it focuses on useful applications rather than on intellectual novelty - and so may be under-supported.</li><li>As a result, the world is becoming increasingly inefficient at translating basic research into concrete applications, and this explains why drug development has seemingly been slowing despite increasing expenditures on biomedical research (though <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmunos/2015/01/02/the-fda-approvals-of-2014/\">recent data</a> suggests that this trend may be changing).</li></ul><p>For examples of this basic argument, see <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080611/full/453840a.html\">Translational Research: Crossing the Valley of Death</a> (<i>Nature</i> 2008) and <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/helping-new-drugs-out-of-academias-valley-of-death/\">Helping New Drugs Out of Research\u2019s \u2018Valley of Death\u2019</a> (New York Times 2011). In particular, the <i>Nature</i> article contains a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080611/full/453840a/box/1.html\">pair of charts</a> giving a rough illustration of two basic trends that may represent the causes and consequences of the growing \u201cvalley of death\u201d: (a) rising government expenditures on research, increasingly supporting pure academics as opposed to medical practitioners, and (b) declining drug development production despite rising pharmaceutical R&amp;D expenditures. (As noted above, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmunos/2015/01/02/the-fda-approvals-of-2014/\">more recent data may indicate</a> that these trends are changing.)</p><p>We find this theory extremely challenging to assess for several reasons. One is that there doesn\u2019t appear to be any one clear definition of \u201ctranslational science\u201d or of the \u201cvalley of death,\u201d and some \u201ctranslational science\u201d seems quite well-suited to industry - to the point where it\u2019s not entirely clear why we should think of it as a candidate for philanthropic or government funding at all. Another is that there has been growing interest in the issue over the last decade, including the <a href=\"http://www.ncats.nih.gov/about/about.html\">2011 debut of NCATS, a new institute at NIH dedicated to translational science</a>; it\u2019s hard to say whether translational science still represents one of the main \u201cgaps\u201d in the existing system.</p><p>Finally, there are other strong explanations for the observed decline in pharmaceutical output. The most <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v11/n3/full/nrd3681.html\">comprehensive article I\u2019ve seen on the subject</a> names multiple possible explanations for the decline, many having to do with regulatory issues as well as the inherent challenges of improving on already-available drugs. The \u201cvalley of death,\u201d as outlined above, doesn\u2019t figure prominently in its account.</p><p>I am skeptical of some of the arguments people have made for the importance of translational science. These arguments often do not distinguish between different possible definitions of \u201ctranslational science,\u201d and often do not make a strong case that nonprofit funding (as opposed to industry funding) is what\u2019s needed. In addition, it seems quite possible to me that the goals of promoting \u201ctranslational science\u201d might be better served by policy change (on regulatory and intellectual property law, for example) than by scientific research. With that said, I think the idea of translational science is worth keeping in mind, and that certain kinds of research in this category could be under-invested in because they do not fit cleanly into an academic or for-profit framework.</p><p>The rest of this post will:</p><ul><li>List several different definitions of \u201ctranslational science\u201d that I\u2019ve come across, noting that in some cases it isn\u2019t clear why a proposed sort of research is a fit for the nonprofit as opposed to for-profit world. <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/translational-science-and-valley-death#Sec1\">More</a></li><li>Briefly discuss the recent creation of the U.S. government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ncats.nih.gov/\">National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)</a>. <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/translational-science-and-valley-death#Sec2\">More</a></li><li>List some other potential reasons for the decline in pharmaceutical output, which may point to solutions outside of \u201ctranslational science.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/translational-science-and-valley-death#Sec3\">More</a></li></ul><h1>Five different definitions of \u201ctranslational science\u201d</h1><p>The <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080611/full/453840a.html\">Nature article on translational science</a> states, \u201cAsk ten people what translational research means and you\u2019re likely to get ten different answers.\u201d Here I give five definitions I\u2019ve come across that seem quite distinct from each other - particularly in terms of what they imply about the appropriateness of nonprofit funding.</p><p><strong>1. Not-for-profit </strong><i><strong>preclinical research</strong></i>. \u201cPreclinical research\u201d here refers to categories D-E (mostly E) from my <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/path-biomedical-progress\">previous post on different phases of scientific research</a>. A possible new medical treatment is often first tested \u201cin vitro\u201d - in a simplified environment, where researchers can isolate how it works.

But ultimately, a treatment\u2019s value depends on how it interacts with the complex biology of the human body, and whether its benefits outweigh its side effects. Since testing with human subjects is extremely expensive and time-consuming, it can be valuable to first test and refine possible treatments in other ways, including animal testing.</p><p>The idea of carrying out this kind of work outside of industry - both in vitro screening to identify potential new medical technologies, and other tests to improve estimates of their promise - appears to be one of the most common definitions of translational research.</p><ul><li>The <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080611/full/453840a.html\">Nature article</a> states \u201cFor basic researchers clutching a new prospective drug, it might involve medicinal chemistry along with the animal tests and reams of paperwork required to enter a first clinical trial \u2026 In some sense much translational research is just rebranding \u2014 clinical R&amp;D by a different name.\u201d</li><li>The <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/helping-new-drugs-out-of-academias-valley-of-death/\">NYT article</a> states, \u201cFor a discovery to reach the threshold where a pharmaceutical company will move it forward what\u2019s needed is called \u201ctranslational\u201d research \u2014 research that validates targets and reduces the risk. This involves things like replicating and standardizing studies, testing chemicals (potentially millions) against targets, and if something produces a desired reaction, modifying compounds or varying concentration levels to balance efficacy and safety (usually in rats). It is repetitive, time consuming work \u2014 often described as \u201cgrunt work.\u201d It\u2019s vital for developing cures, but it\u2019s not the kind of research that will advance the career of a young scientist in a university setting.\u201d</li><li>The examples of translational research <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/site/marketing/stm/definition.xhtml\">listed by the <i>Science: Translational Medicine</i> journal</a> seem to fit this basic framework, as does much of the activity described in <a href=\"http://www.ncats.nih.gov/files/NCATS_2012-2013_Report.pdf\">the most recent annual report for NCATS</a> (the recently created government institute focused on translational science).</li></ul><p>I don\u2019t feel that there\u2019s a clear case for supporting this kind of work with nonprofit (government or philanthropic) funds. Unlike much basic research, this sort of work seems generally to have a very specific medical application in mind, and I believe that companies are often able to monetize the value created by new technologies they develop (especially drugs). Therefore, when looking at this kind of \u201ctranslational science,\u201d I think it is fair to ask: \u201cIf this research is generating more expected value than it costs, why isn\u2019t industry investing in it? Why the need for nonprofit funds?\u201d</p><p>There are a few possible answers. One is that that this kind of research may have positive expected value, but it is too risky for any one investor to take on - even the large industries that consider investing in it. This may be true, but I\u2019ve rarely seen it spelled out by comparing the level of risk in particular kinds of research to the level of risk that various industry players are likely to bear. In addition, if risk is the key issue, this doesn\u2019t necessarily call for a nonprofit solution. An <a href=\"http://www.argentumlux.org/documents/FernandezSteinLo_NBT_2012.pdf\">economics-and-financed-focused group at MIT has proposed</a> that a large enough for-profit fund - perhaps made possible via financial engineering - could result in much more investment in this type of research. This group <a href=\"http://cancerx.mit.edu/ncats/\">appears to be working on a collaboration with NCATS</a>. I am unsure about whether (and if so, for what diseases) financial engineering could ever turn a set of biomedical research investments (which I believe will generally have fairly correlated odds of success) into a high-grade-bond-quality investment, but I think it is an interesting approach.</p><p>There are other possible answers to the question. Perhaps industry can\u2019t fully monetize the benefits its products bring, for reasons including the fact that (a) there may be many beneficiaries who can\u2019t afford to pay (and don\u2019t have insurance for paying) full price; (b) patents on medical products eventually expire. Taking existing health care and intellectual property law as a given, this could serve as some defense of investing nonprofit funds in \u201cindustry-style\u201d research. I haven\u2019t explicitly seen this argument made anywhere, except in <a href=\"http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Health/Discovery-and-Translational-Sciences\">cases where a disease has a clearly disproportionate impact on very low-income people</a>.</p><p>In my limited readings on translational science, I\u2019ve felt that this basic issue - the question of why we ought to support research with nonprofit funds when it appears to be a fairly good fit for industry - is rarely addressed.</p><p><strong>2. Research on public goods - such as new tools and techniques - for preclinical research.</strong> The <a href=\"http://www.ncats.nih.gov/files/NCATS_2012-2013_Report.pdf\">2012-2013 annual report from NCATS</a> cites several projects aimed at developing generally-useful tools and insights, that might be taken up by industry for a broad variety of purposes. For example, improving general methods for predicting how toxic a drug will end up being (page 7). In cases where such research aims to release public insights that others can build on, the case for a nonprofit model seems stronger than with the above category (targeted preclinical work with more specific aims).</p><p><strong>3. Improving communication between clinical and academic professionals, via multidisciplinary groups as well as multidisciplinary career tracks.</strong> The idea here is that academics might do more useful research if they had more observations about how medical care works in practice - not only in terms of understanding the greatest needs, but also in terms of potentially drawing scientific inspiration from observing the effects of treatments on patients. It could be argued that there were more medical breakthroughs in the past, before academic biology and clinical medicine became as separated as they are today. A related idea is that it might be productive to provide academics with more support in understanding market demand for the kinds of technologies they\u2019re working toward, via market research, competition analysis, etc.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080611/full/453840a.html\">Nature article states,</a></p><blockquote><p><i>Back in the 1950s and 60s, basic and clinical research were fairly tightly linked in agencies such as the NIH. Medical research was largely done by physician\u2013scientists who also treated patients. That changed with the explosion of molecular biology in the 1970s. Clinical and basic research started to separate, and biomedical research emerged as a discipline in its own right, with its own training \u2026 Science and innovation have become too complex for any nostalgic return to the physician\u2013scientist on their own as the motor of health research. Reinventing that culture is therefore the focus of the CTSCs [CTSCs are centers </i><a href=\"http://www.ncats.nih.gov/files/NCATS_2012-2013_Report.pdf\"><i>supported by NCATS</i></a><i>] in the form of larger, multidisciplinary groups, including both basic scientists and clinicians, but also bioinformaticians, statisticians, engineers and industry experts. Zerhouni says he expects them to be breeding grounds for a new corps of researchers who will effectively stand on the bridge and help others across.</i></p></blockquote><p>This issue was a major focus of a <a href=\"http://www.nap.edu/catalog/9967/summary-of-the-june-2000-meeting-of-the-clinical-research-roundtable\">2000 roundtable on clinical research as well</a>.</p><p><strong>4. Conducting academic research in the \u201cstyle\u201d of industry research.</strong> The <a href=\"http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/02/helping-new-drugs-out-of-academias-valley-of-death/\">NYT article</a> highlights research-focused nonprofits that are \u201cintensely goal-directed and collaborative; they see the creation of new cures as a process that needs to be managed; and they bring a sense of urgency to the task.\u201d The <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080611/full/453840a.html\">Nature article</a> mentions that CTSCs (the same NCATS-supported centers discussed above) will evaluate scientists \u201cwith business techniques, such as milestones and the ability to work in multidisciplinary groups, rather than by their publications alone.\u201d The focus on collaboration and setting specific goals seems conceptually distinct from a focus on the preclinical phases of research, though I\u2019ve generally seen the two side by side in discussions of translational science.</p><p><strong>5. Supporting and improving clinical trials.</strong> Clinical trials (category F from my <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/path-biomedical-progress\">previous post on different phases of scientific research</a>) are generally the most expensive part of developing new medical technologies, and they are traditionally paid for mostly by industry. <a href=\"http://www.ncats.nih.gov/files/NCATS_2012-2013_Report.pdf\">NCATS reports</a> (page 10) working to improve their cost-effectiveness and usefulness in a variety of ways, including improving data sharing and recruitment of participants: \u201cinvestigators work together on data sharing, multisite trial regulatory hurdles, patient recruitment, communication and other functional areas of research to enhance the efficiency and quality of clinical and translational research \u2026 the University of California Research eXchange (UC ReX) Data Explorer is a secure,online system that enables cross-institution queries of clinical aggregate data from 12 million de-identified patient records derived from patient care activities.\u201d</p><h1>The recent creation of NCATS</h1><p>The <a href=\"http://www.ncats.nih.gov/\">National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)</a> was <a href=\"http://www.ncats.nih.gov/about/about.html\">established in December 2011</a>, making it \u201cthe newest of 27 Institutes and Centers (ICs) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\u201d Its <a href=\"http://www.ncats.nih.gov/files/NCATS-FY16-justification.pdf\">annual budget</a> is in the range of $600 million (page 4). Going over its <a href=\"http://www.ncats.nih.gov/files/NCATS_2012-2013_Report.pdf\">2012-2013 annual report</a>, I note quite a broad variety of activities, seemingly including all five of the categories described above (note that it spends <a href=\"http://www.ncats.nih.gov/files/NCATS-FY16-justification.pdf\">over $400 million per year (page 5)</a> on clinical research centers, which I believe are the same as the centers referred to under #3 and #4 from the previous section). NCATS also appears to engage in attempting to improve policy (e.g., regulation and intellectual property law - see page 22). It appears to pay special attention to rare diseases (pages 13-16), though the reasons for this are not obvious to me.</p><p>It appears to me that the creation of NCATS was met with some negative reaction from the scientific community, as evidenced by three posts (<a href=\"http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2011/02/01/the_nihs_new_drug_discovery_center_heading_into_the_swamp.php\">1</a>, <a href=\"http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2011/02/14/new_cures_faster_faster.php\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2011/02/23/gonna_focus_on_reengineering_the_tools_for_the_process.php\">3</a>) by chemist Derek Lowe. The negative reaction appears to be based partly on a perceived vagueness of mission and partly on fears of diverting funding from other science.</p><p>Most discussion I\u2019ve seen of the \u201cvalley of death\u201d and need for translational science pre-dates the creation of NCATS. It is unclear to what extent the creation of NCATS has addressed the relevant gaps.</p><p>I should also note that there are longer-running NIH mechanisms for supporting translational science, such as <a href=\"https://sbir.nih.gov/about/what-is-sbir-sttr\">SBIR and STTR grants for \u201cdomestic small businesses [that] engage in R&amp;D that has a strong potential for technology commercialization.\u201d</a></p><h1>Why has pharmaceutical productivity been declining in recent years?</h1><p>Advocates of translational science often point to the seeming paradox of declining pharmaceutical productivity despite an ever-growing world of academic research (<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080611/full/453840a/box/1.html\">example</a>). It appears that the decline in productivity has been real, and concerning (though there is also <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmunos/2015/01/02/the-fda-approvals-of-2014/\">preliminary data that the situation may be changing</a>). However, the decline has multiple possible explanations. The most useful-seeming paper I\u2019ve seen on this topic is <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v11/n3/full/nrd3681.html\">Scannell et al. 2012</a>, and I highly recommend it to those interested in the subject. A brief summary:</p><ul><li>Over the past 60 years, \u201cR&amp;D efficiency, measured simply in terms of the number of new drugs brought to market by the global bio- technology and pharmaceutical industries per billion US dollars of R&amp;D spending, has declined fairly steadily.\u201d The authors call this \u201cEroom\u2019s law\u201d (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law\">Moore\u2019s Law</a> reversed).</li><li>The decline has occurred despite major improvements in efficiency on many fronts, from better understanding of biology to more efficient methods for screening large numbers of potential drugs. The authors are skeptical that there is any easy fix, noting that many potential fixes have been explored. They believe the magnitude and consistency of the decline in productivity \u201cindicates that powerful forces have outweighed scientific, technical and managerial improvements over the past 60 years, and/or that some of the improvements have been less \u2018improving\u2019 than commonly thought.\u201d</li><li>One of the major explanations the authors offer is the \u201cbetter-than-the-Beatles problem\u201d: each potential new drug has to compete with the best drugs developed to date in order to justify its development. It has to compete in clinical trials (making the trials challenging and expensive), and it has to compete for patients (making it hard to recoup revenue). The authors list some classes of drugs that \u201ccould have been blockbusters\u201d 15 years ago, but today are not worth the costs and risks of development because there are existing drugs that are probably nearly as good.</li><li>The authors also hypothesize that drug development has transitioned to a fundamentally different new kind of approach, and that this approach - while superficially seeming clearly superior - may actually be inferior. In the past, drug development consisted largely of testing a relatively small number of potential drugs in animals (and humans), and observing results via trial-and-error. Today, there are more attempts to logically segment the process: for example, it is common to first identify a biological \u201ctarget\u201d via academic research, then look for compounds that do an outstanding job binding to the target in a lab environment, and only then to move on to animal/human trials. The authors believe that the old process may in fact have been more efficient (their arguments are somewhat complex and I do not summarize them here). It\u2019s worth noting that if true, this hypothesis calls for a different approach to drug development, but does not necessarily call for \u201ctranslational science\u201d as defined above.</li><li>Many of the other explanations offered by the authors have to do with increasingly cautious regulation, which is likely responsible for longer, more expensive, more challenging clinical trials. From my limited readings on the history of biomedical research, it seems to me that getting drugs tested and approved used to be much easier than it is today, and that many key experiments were highly speculative and dangerous; such experiments would have been much more difficult to carry out with today\u2019s regulation and social norms.</li></ul><p>If the authors were right, it wouldn\u2019t necessarily mean translational science isn\u2019t valuable. It does seem true that academic biology has gotten far more complex, and translational science may be crucial in taking advantage of improved basic science and thereby improving pharmaceutical productivity. But I believe it is far from clear that translational challenges are the <i>source</i> of the productivity decline we\u2019ve seen.</p>", "user": {"username": "HoldenKarnofsky"}}, {"_id": "Ti452WTLC38er5zEL", "title": "Not because you \"should\"", "postedAt": "2015-05-31T05:00:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<p>A few months ago, a friend of mine was describing her motivational issues to me.

Only mostly, because as far as I can tell most people don't tend to use \"I should X\" to mean \"X is my best option.\" More frequently, I see people use it to mean \"I would conclude that X is my best option <i>if I knew more facts</i>,\" or \"I would conclude that X is my best option <i>if I thought longer</i>\", or \"I would conclude that X is my best option <i>if I really cared about what I say I care about</i>.\"</p><p>Regardless, all these various interpretations of \"I should X\" share one property: It's extremely difficult to make these claims about X <i>while you're still deliberating.</i></p><p>If you ever happen to figure out which option is best, then don't slap the label \"should\" on it and go back to thinking about your options!

Shoulds are for retrospectives, not for deliberation.</p><p>What you <i>should</i> do is the option that actually seems best when you're done weighing your options, regardless of whether or not it has a \"should\" label attached. You can't figure out which action actually seems best by slapping \"should\" labels on options willy-nilly and then feeling bad when you ignore them.</p><p>Imagine you're trying to solve an algebra problem, with the following method:</p><ol><li>Say to yourself, \"The answer is going to be x=17.

For example, they might say \"well I <i>want</i> to buy this ice cream, but I <i>should</i> donate the money to the Against Malaria Foundation instead.\"</p><p>I say, this is a false conflict. Imagine this person precommiting to never doing anything just because they \"should.\" How might they feel?</p><p>They might feel relieved, because they <i>actually didn't</i> care about helping others, not even a little bit. So they discharge their guilt, buy their ice cream, and go on their merry way.</p><p>But more likely (in someone who thought they \"should\" give to AMF), that would feel a little bad, and a little hollow. This person, when committing to never do things because they \"should,\" might feel a bit of fear. They might worry that if they didn't keep themselves in check then they'd <i>never</i> do anything to help those less fortunate than themselves. That might seem bad, to them.</p><p>Which lets them actually see the true problem, for the first time: they <i>both</i> want to buy the ice cream <i>and</i> help those who are worse off than them. Now they can actually weigh both desires on the scales, or search for clever third options that fulfill both desires, and so on.</p><p>This is a big part of where guilt-free effective altruism comes from, I think: instead of forcing yourself to give to charities sporadically when the guilt overcomes you, promise yourself that you <i>won't</i> give sporadically due to guilt, and then <i>listen</i> to the part of you that says \"but then when will I help others!?\" Don't force yourself to be an altruist \u2014 instead, commit to <i>never</i> forcing yourself, and then work with the part of you that protests, and become an altruist <i>if and only if you want to help.</i></p><p>Some people, when they stop forcing themselves to do things because they \"should,\" will do a bit less to improve the world. They'll bow a bit less to social pressure, and insofar as the social pressure was pushing them to do what you think is good, you might count that as a loss. Some people <i>don't</i> care about things larger than themselves, and that's <i>perfectly fine</i>, and making them more resilient to social pressure might lose the world some charity.</p><p>But I expect that far <i>more</i> charity is lost from people convincing themselves that their altruistic desires are external obligations and then resenting them. I expect that <i>most</i> people who feel obligated to improve the world and only do it because they \"should\" will become much more effective if they stop forcing themselves.</p><p>It might take them a while. There might be some backlash from years of using internal violence to fulfill a moral obligation that felt more like a bitter duty than a deep desire. Maybe when they first cut themselves free of the \"shoulds\" they'll go on a self-indulgent hedonistic spending spree. But most of them, I expect, will make their way back. Maybe they'll have to struggle through the listless guilt, maybe they'll have to do a lot of soul searching in order to figure out what they're <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/youre-allowed-to-fight-for-something/\">really fighting for</a>, but once they do, they'll be back stronger than ever.</p><p>A <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/on-caring/\">little while back</a>, I said</p><blockquote><p><i>And most importantly, guilt doesn't seem like a good long-term motivator: if you want to join the ranks of people saving the world, I would rather you join them proudly.

Is your mind saying \"but wait, if I don't force myself to do what I should, then I'll never get anything done, and I'll lose my job, and I'll never help those less fortunate than myself, and that's bad!\"? Because in that case, <i>listen to those concerns</i> when you're making your choices. Engage with that part of yourself. You may still decide to do a bunch of unpleasant work, but at least now you'll be doing it because it's better than the alternative, rather than because you're forcing yourself.</p><p>(There's still this one hitch where you decide A is best and find yourself doing B anyway; we'll get to this a few posts down the line.)</p><p>When you're making a decision, never let the force of action come from a \"should.\" The \"should\" label is what you place on actions <i>after</i> you decide they're best.

Imagine someone who thinks they should stop watching Netflix (because they <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/caring-about-some/\">care about something important</a>, and watching Netflix isn't helping), but who can't seem to stop.

People seem to use it to put themselves in direct and unnecessary conflict with themselves.</p><p>For example, imagine the person who wakes up feeling a bit sick. They may well say to themselves, \"ugh, I should go to the pharmacy and pick up medication before work.\" Now picking up meds feels like an obligation: if they don't get meds, then that's a little bit of evidence that they're incompetent, or akrasiatic, or bad. Now they <i>must</i> go get meds, if they want to be a competent person. In the lingo of <a href=\"http://rationality.org/\">CFAR</a>, this \"should\" is the exact opposite of an urge-propagation: it disconnects the reason from the task, it abolishes the \"why\". The person feeling sick now feels like they have an obligation to pick up medication, and so if they do it, they do it grudgingly, resenting the situation.

Now the reason remains attached to the task. Now neither option makes them \"bad,\" and both options are tradeoffs.</p><p>I see lots of guilt-motivated people use \"shoulds\" as ultimatums: \"either I get the meds, or I am a bad person.\" They leave themselves only two choices: go out of their way on the way to work and suffer through awkward human interaction at the pharmacy, or be bad. Either way, they lose: the should has set them up for failure.</p><p>But the actual options aren't \"suffer\" or \"be bad.\" The actual options are \"incur the social/time costs of buying meds\" or \"incur the physical/mental costs of feeling ill.\" It's just a choice: you weigh the branches, and then you pick. Neither branch makes you \"bad.\" It's ok to decide that the social/time costs outweigh the physical/mental costs. It's ok to decide the opposite. Neither side is a \"should.\" Both sides are an option.</p><p>Don't say \"I really should finish this paper.\" Say \"if I don't finish this paper, I'll get a worse grade than I was planning to, and my teacher will frown at me, and my parents will frown at me.\" Then weigh your options. Then choose.</p><p>This is not necessarily easy! Breaking a \"should\" into its component goals, tasks, and desires may be particularly difficult for people who are still <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/half-assing-it-with-everything-youve-got/\">confusing the quality line with the preference curve</a> and forgetting that it's possible for their preferences to diverge from the expectations of others. I've often seen people confuse \"an authority figure expects me to try hard to do X\" or \"my friends expect me to do X\" with \"I should do X,\" and many people find it very hard to tease these apart. (Future posts will touch on this a little.)</p><p>Unpacking a \"should\" can also be very difficult for a reason that's a little harder to articulate. Have you ever seen a person who can't even <i>imagine</i> the thought of failure start to fail? They start to panic, their actions get rushed, their hands start to shake (which is particularly fatal if their task is one requiring dexterity), they put on blinders to the fact that they're about to fail as they frantically repeat an action they wish would succeed over and over.</p><p>The ironic thing is, especially in timed, dexterity-based tasks, if the person <i>didn't</i> panic, they would have a better chance of succeeding. It seems to me that, more often than not, it's the fact that they can't even <i>consider</i> their failure that is harming them most. If only they had come to terms with failure beforehand, then they could keep a level head as failure looms, and this would buy them one or two more shots at success.</p><p>This is related to <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/should-considered-harmful/lesswrong.com/lw/o4/leave_a_line_of_retreat/\">leaving yourself a line of retreat</a>: If you find yourself <i>unable to think</i> about a certain outcome, it can be very useful to think all the way through the painful outcome \u2014 not to convince yourself that everything would actually be fine, but just so that you can <i>actually think about it.</i> It's the thoughts you can't think that really screw you.</p><p>Similarly, it's the options you can't weigh that really cost you. People often seem to use the word \"should\" to assign a value of \"negative infinity\" to all alternative actions. They should do X, so if they don't do X, they're <i>bad</i>, end of story. Some people have trouble unpacking a should for the same reason they have trouble staring at a failure: they have a mental geis against seriously considering alternatives, against weighing them on the scales. One common symptom of this behavior is a tendency to do a fake unpacking of the should, e.g. by translating \"I should finish this paper\" to \"I <i>need</i> to finish this paper\": notice how this trades one negative-infinity analysis for another, without ever reconnecting the task to the goal or acknowledging the alternatives.</p><p>I'm not saying that the alternatives are always good: perhaps the should unpacks into \"I want to finish this paper, becaues if I don't, then I will very likely fail my course, lose my scholarship, get kicked out of college, disappoint my parents, and destroy my job prospects.\" The alternative options might be <i>really bad.</i> Yet, I claim that there is power in laying them all out, no matter how bad they are. Make the values finite, so you can actually weigh them on your scales. When you should yourself without looking at the alternatives, you run a high risk of making yourself feel obligated and resentful. When you lay out all the options you can think of and choose the best, then it's much easier to work with yourself rather than against yourself \u2014 sometimes you have to settle for the best of a bad lot, but this is much easier once you've actually <i>looked at the whole lot.</i></p><hr><p>If you often suffer from guilt, then I strongly suggest cashing out your shoulds. Get a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Champion-Sports-TC-Tally-Counter/dp/B000A7NWKS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1432518448&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=sports+counter\">tally counter</a> and start training yourself to notice when you say the word \"should,\" and then once you're noticing it, start training yourself to unpack the sentence. \"I should call my father this week\" might cash out to \"if I don't call my father this week, he'll feel disappointed and lonely.\" \"I shouldn't play that video game\" might cash out to \"if I play that video game, I'll lose lots of time that I was planning to use for studying.\" \"I should work on my homework right now\" might cash out to \"I want to have my paper finished by tomorrow, and I also want to go socialize right now, and these goals are mutually exclusive.\"</p><p>You can almost always re-state a should-sentence without the should. It may seem like a trivial transformation on sentences, but it might also really help remove the burden of an obligation.</p><p>Of course, cashing out your shoulds isn't all it takes to stop feeling guilty \u2014 not by a long shot. Once you've cashed out a should, you're often left with conflicting interests (remember that it's quite possible to disagree with yourself! I've seen people should themselves simply because they refuse to acknowledge that they might be under internal conflict). Frequently, after unpacking a should you're still left with a really hard choice. Furthermore, it's also quite common to cash a should out, weigh both options, decide that one option is better, and then <i>still find yourself doing the worse thing.</i> (This last problem is a doozy, and I'll discuss it more in future posts.) I'm not handing you a silver bullet, here.</p><p>But it's still a bullet. Don't use shoulds as an ultimatum! Your options are not divided up into \"choices which make you good\" and \"choices which make you bad\": your options are stratified by how much they move you towards the goal. So pick your shoulds apart into their component tasks and desires, and keep the tasks connected to the goal: don't say \"I should get meds,\" say \"I need to get meds if I want to feel good.\"</p><p>I've found it very helpful to treat almost all shoulds as a toxic attempt to blind me to the alternatives. Be careful: the thoughts you can't think do you harm, and the options you can't weigh cost you dearly.</p><p>So cash out your shoulds, and weigh <i>all</i> your options on the scales \u2014 and then choose what is best, free of obligation.</p>", "user": {"username": "So8res"}}, {"_id": "oY7SzXFA87WBpeduH", "title": "You don't get to know what you're fighting for", "postedAt": "2015-05-17T05:00:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<p>A <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/on-caring/\">number</a> of my <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/the-value-of-a-life/\">recent</a> <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/the-stamp-collector/\">posts</a> may have given you the impression that I know exactly what I'm <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/caring-about-some/\">fighting for</a>. If someone were to ask you, \"hey, what's that Nate guy trying so hard to do,\" you might answer something like \"increase the chance of human survival,\" or \"put an end to unwanted death\" or \"reduce suffering\" or something.</p><p>This isn't the case. I mean, I am doing those things, but those are all negative motivations: I am <i>against</i> Alzheimer's, I am <i>against</i> human extinction, but what am I <i>for?</i></p><p>The truth is, I don't quite know. I'm for <i>something</i>, that's for damn sure, and I have lots of feelings about the things that I'm fighting for, but I find them rather hard to express.</p><p>And in fact, I highly doubt that <i>anyone</i> knows quite what they're fighting towards \u2014 though it seems that many people think they do, and that is in part why I'm writing this post.</p><p>When I wrote <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/desire-is-the-direction-rationality-is-the-magnitude/\">on rationality</a>, one commenter replied:</p><blockquote><p><i>I would just note upfront that</i></p><p><i>&gt; Reasoning well has little to do with what you're reasoning towards.</i></p><p><i>and</i></p><p><i>&gt; Rationality of this kind is not about changing where you're going, it's about changing how far you can go.</i></p><p><i>are white lies, as you well know.

Or that both of us should find other partners.</i></p><p><i>\"How to help my neighborhood out of poverty\" might become \"How to make the most money\" in order to donate as much as possible.</i></p></blockquote><p>This is a fine point. Humans are well-known for their ability to start out pursuing one goal, only to find that goal shift drastically beneath them as their knowledge of the world increases. In fact, this is a major plot point in many stories (such as, say, The Foundation Trilogy, The Dresden Files, and The Neverending Story). The goal you think you're pursuing may well not survive a close examination.</p><p>I claim this is true even if you think your goals are simple, objective, obvious, high-minded, or sophisticated. Just as the theist setting out to do the most good might deconvert after deciding that they would still want humanity to flourish even without a divine mandate, so may the utilitarian setting out to do the most good discover that their philosophy is incoherent.</p><p>In fact, I suspect this is <i>inevitable</i>, at least at humanity's current stage of philosophical development.</p><p>It's nice and clean and <i>easy</i> to say \"I'm a total hedonic utilitarian,\" and feel like you know exactly what you value. But what does it mean, to be a utilitarian? What counts as a mind? What counts as a preference? Under whose interpretation, under whose process, are preferences extracted? Do you feel an obligation to create people who don't exist? Does a mind matter more if you run two copies of it side by side? I doubt these questions will have objective answers, but subjective resolutions will be complex and will depend on what we value, in which case \"total hedonic utility\" isn't really an answer. You can <i>say</i> you're fighting for maximum utility, but for now, that's still a small label on a complex thing that we don't quite know how to express.</p><p>And even if we could express it, I doubt that most humans are in fact total hedonic utilitarians. Imagine that an old friend of yours eats a sandwich which (unexpectedly) alters their preferences so that all they want to do all day is stare at a white wall and not be disturbed. Do you feel a moral obligation to help them find a white wall and prevent others from disturbing them? If there was a button that resets them to as they were just before they ate the sandwich, would you press it? I sure as hell would \u2014 because I feel loyalty not only to the mind in front of me, but to the <i>person</i>, the <i>history</i>, the <i>friend</i>. But again, we have departed the objective utilitarian framework, and entered the domain where I don't quite know what I'm fighting for.</p><p>If I am loyal to my old friend over the person who sits in front of the white wall, then am I also obligated to \"save\" people who naturally want to wirehead? Am I obligated to the values they had as a teenager? Am I obligated to maximize the utilities of babies, before they grow up?</p><p>I'm not saying you can't answer these questions. I'm sure that many people have. In fact, I'm sure that some people have picked simple-enough arbitrary definitions and then bitten all the associated bullets. (\"Yes, I care about the preferences of rocks a little bit!\" \"Yes, I maximize the utility of babies!\", and so on.) And I'm picking on the utilitarians here, but the same goes for the deontologists, the theists, and everybody else who thinks they know what they're fighting for.</p><p>What I'm saying is, even if you <i>say</i> you know what you're fighting for, even if you <i>say</i> you accept the consequences and bite the bullets, <i>it's possible for you to be wrong about that.</i></p><p>There is no <i>objective</i> morality writ on a tablet between the galaxies. There are no objective facts about what \"actually matters.\" But that's because \"mattering\" isn't a property of the universe. It's a property of a <i>person.</i></p><p>There <i>are</i> facts about what we care about, but they aren't facts about the stars. They are facts about <i>us.</i></p><p>There is no objective morality, but also your morality is <i>not</i> just whatever you say it is. It is possible for a person to say they believe it is fine to kill people, and <i>be lying.</i> <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/the-brainmind-distinction/\">The mind is only part of the brain</a>, and it is possible to have both (a) no objective morality, and (b) people who are wrong about what they care about.</p><p>There are facts about what you care about, but you don't get to know them all. Not by default. Not yet. Humans don't have that sort of introspective capabilities yet. They don't have that sort of philosophical sophistication yet. But they <i>do</i> have a massive and well-documented incentive to convince themselves that they care about simple things \u2014 which is why it's a bit suspicious when people go around claiming they know their true preferences.</p><p>From here, it looks very unlikely to me that anyone has the ability to pin down exactly what they really care about. Why? Because of where human values came from. Remember that one time that Time tried to build a mind that wanted to eat healthy, and accidentally built a mind that enjoys salt and fat? I jest, of course, and it's dangerous to anthropomorphize natural selection, but the point stands: our values come from a complex and intricate process tied closely to innumerable coincidences of history.</p><p>Now, I'm quite <i>glad</i> that Time failed to build a fitness maximizer. My values were built by dumb processes smashing time and a savannah into a bunch of monkey generations, and <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/caring-about-some/\">I don't entirely approve of all of the result</a>, but the result is also where my approver comes from. My appreciation of beauty, my sense of wonder, and my capacity to love, all came from this process.</p><p>I'm not saying my values are dumb; I'm saying you shouldn't expect them to be simple.</p><p>We're <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/l3/thou_art_godshatter/\">a thousand shards of desire</a> forged of coincidence and circumstance and death and time. It would be <i>really surprising</i> if there were some short, simple description of our values. Which is why I'm always a bit suspicious of someone who claims to know exactly what they're fighting for. They've either convinced themselves of a falsehood, or they're selling something.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, our values are not <i>inscruitable.</i> They are not <i>inherently unknowable.</i> If we survive long enough, it seems likely that we'll eventually map them out.</p><p>But we don't know them <i>yet.</i></p><p>That doesn't mean we're lost in the dark, either. We have a hell of a lot of <i>evidence</i> about our values. I tend to prefer pleasure to pain and joy to sadness, most of the time. I just don't have an exact description of what I'm working towards.</p><p>And I don't <i>need</i> one, to figure out what to do next. Not yet, anyway. I can't tell you exactly where I'm going, but I can sure see which direction the arrow points.</p><p>It's easier, in a way, to talk about the negative motivations \u2014 ending disease, decreasing existential risk, that sort of thing \u2014 because those are the things that I'm pretty sure of, in light of uncertainty about what really matters to me. I don't know exactly what I want, but I'm pretty sure I want there to be humans (or post-humans) around to see it.</p><p>But don't confuse what I'm <i>doing</i> with what I'm <i>fighting for.</i> The latter is much harder to describe, and I have no delusions of understanding.</p><p>You don't get to know exactly what you're fighting for, but the world's in bad enough shape that you don't <i>need</i> to.</p><p>In order to overcome the listless guilt, I strongly recommend remembering that you have <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/youre-allowed-to-fight-for-something/\">something to fight for</a>, but I also caution you against believing you know exactly what that thing is. You probably don't, and as you learn more about the world, I expect your goals to shift.</p><p>I'll conclude with a comic by Matt Rhodes:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://mindingourway.com/content/images/2015/05/MyHero.jpg\"></figure><p><br>(<a href=\"http://mattrhodesart.blogspot.co.uk/\">source</a>)</p>", "user": {"username": "So8res"}}, {"_id": "ccnFHmfmNRZ3NbLK6", "title": "Caring about something larger than yourself", "postedAt": "2015-05-10T05:00:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<p>In my <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/youre-allowed-to-fight-for-something/\">last post</a>, I said that in order to address the listless guilt, step zero is believing that you can care about something, and step one is finding something to care about. This post is about step one.</p><p>There are many different ways to care passionately about one thing or another. Parents in particular are usually good at step one, and often care strongly about the welfare of their children. Others care strongly about their family, or the environment, or what-have-you. Many others claim to care about all humanity or about all sentient life.</p><p>On the other hand, some people have significantly more trouble caring about big things. They don't have any children to die for and they don't see the point in caring about everyone, and yet many of them still possess the listless guilt. When I suggest to such a person that they address their guilt by searching their motivations and finding something to care about, the response, more often than not, is simply \"Why?\"</p><p>This post is for them.</p><p>In order to answer, I'm going to talk about <i>my</i> answer to this \"why?\". Before we continue, I stress that my answer is not the only one, that my cause is not the only one, and that I endorse anyone's desires to pursue whatever it is they care deeply about, regardless of their cause. As with previous posts, don't treat this as a sermon about why you <i>should</i> care about things that are larger than yourself; treat it as a reminder that you <i>can,</i> if you want to.</p><hr><p>I often encounter people who don't care much about humanity at large (or the future of sentient life), but seem vaguely curious as to why somebody would. When I suggest that it is possible for them, too, to care about things greater than themselves, the most common response by far, is \"sure, but why would I want to do that?\"</p><p>Why fight for humans? Why care about the fate of the Earth, or the fate of people we will never meet? Why care about the callous species that invented war and torture? Why care for people at large, when most of them are stupid or annoying or members of the wrong political party or possessing of incorrect beliefs? Most humans are <i>annoying</i>, so why would you possibly want to care about them?</p><p>I have encountered many people who claim that they only care for their immediate friend group.</p><p>Now, if you <i>actually</i> only care about your immediate friend group, then be it not upon me to change your preferences. Yet, in my experience, people who <i>think</i> they only care about their immediate friend group tend to be confused.</p><p>One friend of mine insisted that he only cares about the people he's close to, while simultaneously putting privacy concerns (e.g. privacy of communication over the internet) very high on his priority list. When I asked why, he claimed (after some exploring) that it's because he cares about the autonomy and freedom of people in general. Noticing the inconsistency, he quickly added that he only cares about autonomy and freedom for the masses <i>because of the pleasurable feeling this creates within him;</i> it was of course a <i>selfish</i> desire, and he <i>still</i> only cared about the people close to him. (That was in fact the conversation where I first concocted the <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/the-stamp-collector/\">allegory of the stamp collector</a>.)</p><p>What's going on, here? One thing, I think, is a tendency to confuse <i>feelings</i> with <i>caring.</i> Most people only have strong feelings of affection for their close friends, and they don't have feelings that are nearly so strong for nameless strangers, and so they conclude that they must not care about strangers. They forget that <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/on-caring/\">feelings and caring are separate things</a>! I reassure you that I, too, have deeper feelings for people close to me than for strangers \u2014 but I still care about the strangers anyway. In fact, I suspect this is true of nearly everybody who claims to care about humanity at large. Courage isn't about not being afraid, it's about being afraid and doing the right thing anyway; and similarly, caring isn't about being overwhelmed by emotion, it's about not having the emotional compulsion and <i>doing the right thing anyway.</i> It's possible to both lack deep feelings of affection for strangers <i>and still care for them nearly as much as you care for friends.</i></p><p>This is at least one reason why I think people tend to insist that they don't care about strangers, but it still doesn't answer the \"why.\" Even once people admit it's <i>possible</i> to start acting like they care about humanity at large, they still tend to wonder why in the world they would ever want to do such a thing.</p><p>And I can't tell you whether or not you want to do this. But I can tell you why <i>I</i> wanted to do this, and at least help you understand why someone would.</p><p>We humans are reflective creatures: we get to examine what we feel and what we care about, and choose to change ourselves. As it happens, when I reflect upon myself and my desires, I find many that I approve of, and some that I don't.</p><p>I, like many, spend a large chunk of time frustrated by other human beings (especially when they fail to read my mind). I have unconscious biases against people who don't look sufficiently similar to the people I grew up near. I automatically bristle at members of my outgroup. I'm uncomfortable around vast segments of the population. And yet, <i>at the same time</i>, I care about all people, about all of Earth's children, about all sentient life.</p><p>Why? In large part, by choice. My default settings, roughly speaking, make it easy for me to feel for my friends and hate at my competitors. But my default settings <i>also</i> come with a sense of aesthetics that prefers fairness, that prefers compassion. My default feelings are strong for those who are close to me, and my default sensibilities are annoyed that it's not possible to feel strongly for people who <i>could have been</i> close to me. My default feelings are negative towards people antagonizing me, and my default sensibilities are sad that we didn't meet in a different context, sad that it's so hard for humans to communicate their point of view.</p><p>My point is, I surely don't lack the capacity to feel frustration with fools, but I <i>also</i> have a quiet sense of aesthetics and fairness which does not approve of this frustration. There is a tension there.</p><p>I choose to resolve the tension in favor of the people rather than the feelings.</p><p>Why? Because when I reflect upon the source of the feelings, I find arbitrary evolutionary settings that I don't endorse, but when I reflect upon the sense of aesthetics, I find something that goes straight to the core of what I value.</p><p>Because when I reflect, I see that I am an inconsistent mess of a brain born of a long and blind evolutionary process, full of desires and feelings and fears that capture everything I hold dear, and also a bunch of arbitrary junk that was kind of tacked on there. In making me, Time coughed up a <i>reflectively unstable</i> mind: the causal process of my past constructed me to value everything I value, and some things that I (upon reflection) don't.</p><p>So I look upon myself, and I see that I am constructed to both (a) care more about the people close to me, that I have deeper feelings for, and (b) care about fairness, impartiality, and aesthetics. I look upon myself and I see that I <i>both</i> care more about close friends, <i>and</i> disapprove of any state of affairs in which I care more for some people due to a trivial coincidence of time and space.</p><p>And I am constructed such that when I look upon myself and find inconsistencies, I care about resolving them.</p><p>So, why do I care about humanity? Because, for me, resolving this inconsistency is easy. My strong feelings are in conflict with my quiet aesthetics, but when push comes to shove, the quiet aesthetics win hands-down. To me, the feelings look like they are arbitrary remnants of the tribal days, while the aesthetics look like they are echoes of my deeper values. I know which one <i>I'm</i> more loyal to.</p><p>This is not a knock-down argument, by any means. One person's modus ponens is another person's modus tollens, and some people, looking upon themselves, would prefer to forgo a sense of fairness and impartiality instead of choosing to care about strangers. But I, and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Most-Good-You-Can/dp/0300180276\">many</a> <a href=\"http://effectivealtruism.org/\">others</a>, don't <i>want</i> to care only about our friends. We feel more loyalty to our aesthetics than our default feelings \u2014 and so the choice is easy.</p><hr><p>Caring about others may sound great in theory, but for jaded and cynical people (who can't stand interacting with idiots), the points above probably aren't enough.</p><p>And you know what? It can be <i>really hard</i> to muster any feeling of caring for humans, even if you've decided that you want to.</p><p>It's too easy to look at them and see the tarnished, ugly, greedy, stupid species.</p><p>It's too easy to look at individuals and see idiots.</p><p>(I have this feeling too, sometimes.)</p><p>But here's something strange:</p><p>Imagine you've had a pet dog that you've raised from a puppy, and grown close to over the course of a decade. Imagine somebody napped your dog and started harming it, for fun.</p><p>How would this make you feel? How much would you like to find this person, and bring them to justice?</p><p>Most people are able to feel a much larger burst of empathy and caring for suffering animals than for suffering humans.</p><p>Imagine you're being mugged by a homeless man in an alley. Someone notices, comes to help, push comes to shove, they scare the man off, and then ask if you're all right. Now imagine a stray dog growling at you in an alley. Someone notices, comes to help, kicks the dog when it won't back down, scares it off, and asks if you're all right.</p><p>Does it feel inconsistent to you, the difference between the way you feel for mistreated animals, versus the way you feel towards mistreated humans? Does it seem strange, how easy it is to like dogs, how difficult it is to like men?</p><p>You may, of course, conclude that you actually don't like men. But you don't <i>have</i> to. You can, as before, listen to the quiet sense of aesthetics that is in conflict with your default feelings. Why are our default feelings hooked up how they are? I can't say for sure, but here's a theory:</p><blockquote><p><i>An influential version of social theory is the 'Machiavellian Intelligence' hypothesis (Byrne and Whiten 1988; Whiten and Byrne 1997). Social interactions and relationships are not only complex but also constantly changing and therefore require fast parallel processing (Barton and Dunbar 1997). The similarity with Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli (1469\u20141527), the devious adviser of sixteenth-century Italian princes, is that much of social life is a question of outwitting others, plotting and scheming, entering into alliances and breaking them again. All this requires a lot of brain power to remember who is who, and who has done what to whom, as well as to think up ever more crafty wiles, and to double bluff the crafty wiles of your rivals \u2014 leading to a spiralling arms race. 'Arms races' are common in biology, as when predators evolve to run ever faster to catch their faster prey, or parasites evolve to outwit the immune systems of their hosts. The notion that some kind of spiralling or self-catalytic process is involved certainly suits what Christopher Wills (1993) calls 'the runaway brain', and this idea is common among theories that relate language evolution to brain size.</i></p></blockquote><p>(<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dtkeLWVMlcsC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74\">Sue Blackmore, <i>The Meme Machine</i></a>)</p><p>I mean, look at us. Humans are the sort of creature that sees lightning and postulates an angry sky-god, because angry sky-gods seem much more plausible to us than Maxwell's equations \u2014 this despite the fact that Maxwell's equations are <i>far</i> simpler to describe (by a mathematical standard) than a generally intelligent sky-god. Think about it: we can write down Maxwell's equations in four lines, and we can't yet describe how a general intelligence works. Thor <i>feels</i> easier for us to understand, but only because we have so much built-in hardware for psychologically modeling humans.</p><p>Our brains are hard-wired to see human-like agents <i>everywhere.</i> Cartoons work: we see them as people (and attribute feelings to them) despite their simplicity. We see intentionality everywhere \u2014 religious folks have no trouble finding apparent affirmation that their mundane actions are part of some grand plan, superstition runs rampant, and many different types of mental disorders (schizophrenia, mania, etc.) are characterized by delusions that either everybody is against you or that your entire life has been carefully engineered \u2014 symptoms of a brain over-eager to see things in terms of human plots and schemes.</p><p>When we look at humans, we see them as plotters or schemers or competition. But when we look at puppies, or kittens, or other animals, none of that social machinery kicks in. We're able to see them as just creatures, pure and innocent things, exploring an environment they will never fully understand, just following the flow of their lives.</p><p>If you back a puppy into a corner and frighten it, and it snaps at you, it's easy to feel a wave of compassion rather than hatred.</p><p>But when a <i>human</i> snaps at you, the social machinery engages. It's easy to get stuck inside the interaction. When a human is backed into a corner and lashes out, we tend to lash back.</p><p>Which is why, every so often, I take a mental step back and try to <i>see</i> the other humans around me, not as humans, but as innocent animals full of wonder, exploring an environment they can never fully understand, following the flows of their lives.</p><p>I try to see people in the same way I would see a puppy, reacting to pains and pleasures, snapping only when afraid or threatened. I try to see the tragedies in humans who have been conditioned by time and circumstance to be suspicious and harmful, and feel the same compassion for them that I would feel for an abused child.</p><p>I look at my fellow humans and strive to remember that they, too, are innocent creatures.</p><p>Someone told me once that, in order to feel compassion for others, it's useful to visualize them as having angel's wings. I think there's something to this. There's something powerful about looking at people and seeing the angels that never had a shot at heaven \u2014 though I prefer to see not angels, but monkeys who struggle to convince themselves that they're comfortable in a strange civilization, so different from the ancestral savanna where their minds were forged.</p><p>Some use 'animal' as a derogatory, and may think that it's demeaning to try to see humans as animals instead of people. For me, the opposite is true, for the same reason that it's easier to feel compassion for a homeless dog than a homeless man \u2014 it helps me, to detach my automatic impulses to see other humans as competitors or allies or enemies, and just look at them the same way I would look at a kitten, as a pure creature possessing of the same wonder and innocence.</p><hr><p>Why do I care about humans and humanity, about Earth and all its children, about all sentient life? How can I say I do given that I, too, often feel more strongly for friends than strangers, and more compassion for dogs than men?</p><p>When I look upon myself, I see a tension between what I feel and a sense that my feelings are ill-calibrated. When I look closer, I find that the feelings are calibrated in ways I don't endorse, in a tribal setting, where it was important to love the ingroup and hate the outgroup. But when I look at the sense that those feelings are ill-calibrated, I find <i>good</i> reasons, and a sense that this is <i>actually</i> what matters, that it is not arbitrary but valuable.</p><p>And so for me, \"why care?\" has an easy answer.</p><p>Let me stress again that you don't have to resolve your internal tensions in the same way I do.

Either way, if you <i>listen</i> to that internal sense of friction, if you use your feelings as a guide rather than an answer, if you figure out why you feel and care as you do, and reflect upon your reasons, and separate feeling from caring, and choose to care about what seems right and good to care about \u2014</p><p>then you may find that \"why care?\" has an easy answer for you, too.</p>", "user": {"username": "So8res"}}, {"_id": "ChWTJ9aDT4NAxGJsa", "title": "You're allowed to fight for something", "postedAt": "2015-05-03T05:00:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The first sort of guilt I want to address is the listless guilt, that vague feeling one gets after playing video games for twelve hours straight, a guilty feeling that you should be doing something else. Many people in my local friend group don't suffer from the listless guilt, because many people in my sphere are <a href=\"http://effectivealtruism.org/\">effective altruists</a> who feel a <i>very acute and specific</i> sense of guilt when they think they've spent their time poorly. Specific guilt tends to be as bad or worse than the listless guilt, but before I address specific guilt, I need to confront the listless guilt.</p><p>It seems to me that the listless guilt usually stems from not doing anything in particular. I'm not sure how to remove that feeling of guilt in people who aren't doing anything in particular. But if they shift the guilt to being guilty about not doing <i>one thing in particular</i>, then I have some tools that might help.</p><p>Warning: in this post, I'm going to encourage people with listless guilt to find something to care about, and to shift their guilt away from a vague sense of not doing anything towards a specific sense of not doing one thing in particular. If you already have strong specific guilts, consider skipping this post.</p><hr><p>The message of the <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/the-stamp-collector/\">allegory of the stamp collector</a> is this: <i>you can care about things in the world.</i> There is no difference in kind between steering reality towards futures where there are more happy-chemicals in your head, and steering reality towards futures where there are lots of happy humans outside your head. Your decision process is implemented by the lump of meat between your ears, but it builds a map of the entire universe, and you can act (according to the map) towards whatever end you please.</p><p>You only ever see the map, but you walk the territory.</p><p>Many people will say that humans only ever do what they want. They wheel out phrases such as \"revealed preference\" and say that no matter what people do, they do it because they wanted to. But here's the thing:</p><p>If you use the word \"want\" to mean \"whatever humans actually do,\" then I need new words to differentiate activities-I-do-for-personal-enjoyment (stargazing, studying physics, tinkering, cavorting) from activities-I-do-for-the-sake-of-others-I-care-about (attempting to reduce existential risk, donating to charities, community service). These are very different clusters of behavior that feel very different, and I need words to distinguish between them.</p><p>If a word describes everything, then it distinguishes nothing, and is useless. If you use the word \"want\" to mean \"whatever people do,\" then it can't be used for talking about actions. In order for \"wants\" to be <i>about</i> goals humans are trying to achieve for various purposes, it must apply to some goals and not others.</p><p>I'm happy to <i>split</i> the word \"want,\" because it's a pretty loaded word. Sometimes I use it to distinguish between the stargazing/cavorting cluster and the charity/altruism cluster, and other times I use it to distinguish between tasks-I-reflectively-approve-of-doing (such as studying an interesting topic) and tasks-I-reflectively-disapprove-of-doing (such as procrastinating by reading boring web pages), which is a different way of cutting up things-I-do that I also find useful.</p><p>Distinguishing between clusters of things is what words are <i>for.</i> If anything, we need to make the word \"want\" <i>more</i> specific, not less specific.</p><p>Nihilists may tell you that nothing matters, that there is no altruism, that people only do what they want to, and these are all traps that lead to the listless guilt. They help people half-convince themselves that nothing matters, and then the other half of them, which fails to be fooled, goes on yearning for something more.</p><p>So if you're experiencing nihilism along with a vague sense of discomfort or guilt, consider taking a moment to remind yourself that it <i>is</i> possible for you to care about things beyond yourself, for non-selfish reasons.</p><p>I've been surprised, in the past, by how many people vehemently resist the idea that they might not actually be selfish, deep down. I've seen some people do some incredible contortions in attempts to convince themselves that their ability to care about others is actually completely selfish. (Because iterated game theory says that if you're in a repeated game it pays to be nice, you see!) These people seem to resist the idea that they could have selfless values on general principles, and consistently struggle to come up with selfish explanations for their altruistic behavior.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, selfishness is fine. Yet, true selfishness doesn't lead to the listless guilt. If you think you <i>must</i> be selfish, and you also feel vaguely guilty about life, then perhaps you care about what goes on beyond your head.</p><p>In case you're skeptical, here's a little thought experiment:</p><blockquote><p><i>Imagine you live alone in the woods, having forsaken civilization when the Unethical Psychologist Authoritarians came to power a few years back.</i></p><p><i>Your only companion is your dog, twelve years old, who you raised from a puppy. (If you have a pet or have ever had a pet, use them instead.)</i></p><p><i>You're aware of the fact that humans have figured out how to do some pretty impressive perception modification (which is part of what allowed the Unethical Psychologist Authoritarians to come to power).</i></p><p><i>One day, a psychologist comes to you and offers you a deal. They'd like to take your dog out back and shoot it. If you let them do so, they'll clean things up, erase your the memories of this conversation, and then alter your perceptions such that you perceive exactly what you would have if they hadn't shot your dog. (Don't worry, they'll also have people track you and alter the perceptions of anyone else who would see the dog, so that they also see the dog, so that you won't seem crazy. And they'll remove that fact from your mind, so you don't worry about being tracked.)</i></p><p><i>In return, they'll give you a dollar.</i></p></blockquote><p>Under the assumption that you will in fact believe and perceive the same things you would have if they hadn't shot the dog, <i>and</i> have an extra dollar for your trouble, would you take the offer?</p><p>Most people reject it. You're allowed to reject it! You're allowed to reject <i>arbitrarily good</i> amounts of faked pleasure-experience in order to avoid bad real-world outcomes. You're allowed to care about whether your beliefs are <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/ephemeral-correspondance/\">actually hooked up to reality</a>. You're allowed to care about things outside of you!</p><p>One friend of mine, after probing around in thought experiments such as this one, said \"Huh. Well, so I definitely care about myself experiencing pleasure, and also I seem to care about other people actually existing and experiencing pleasure, though I don't know why.\"</p><p>She seemed surprised and confused to notice that she cared about others, as though this fact demanded explanation.</p><p><i>You don't need an excuse.</i> You can just care about things outside yourself.</p><p>If you have the listless guilt, if something seems like it's missing in life, if it seems like there's something else you should be doing with your time, then probe the feeling. Figure out what's missing.</p><p>Maybe start by saying, aloud, \"I can care about how the world is,\" and \"I want the world to be different than it currently is,\" if that helps unstick something. And then <i>listen</i> to that listless feeling saying there must be something more, and look at the world <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/k7/original_seeing/\">with fresh eyes</a>, and ask yourself what is wrong. Ask yourself what you would like to see changed.</p><p>Is the world totally perfect? No? What would you change, if granted omnipotence? Do you want to acquire power, fame, or riches? Do you want to reduce inequality? Do you want to make it easier for humans to connect? Do you want to reduce loneliness and despair? Do you want to put an end to disease and suffering? Do you want to slay <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">Moloch</a>, the avatar of a runaway civilization that chews humans to pieces, twisted them into bitter shells of their former selves by forcing them to take degrading jobs in order to survive?</p><p>Don't just look for ideas that sound nice. Look for changes in the world that <i>compel</i> you, ideas such that thinking them makes something move in your chest. Look for places where the world is <a href=\"http://mindingourway.com/the-value-of-a-life/\">broken</a> and in need of fixing. Look for things in the world that are <i>unacceptable</i>. Reject the natural order.</p><p>It doesn't have to be a grand and ambitious desire. Maybe you'll just want more personal gain. Maybe you'll find that there's one person in particular who you want to save, one person trapped in a hellhole that you want to shield them from. Or maybe you'll decide that you want to save the entire damn world. I don't know. But if you want to remove the listless guilt, then step one is finding something to fight for.</p><p>Step zero is <i>believing that you can.</i></p><p>Lots of people seem to have these blinders on: the world is big and they are small, and they're just trying to scrape together a living or get by with skills that don't seem particularly relevant to their ambitions, and they don't have the time or ability or energy to make things better. And so they try not to think about it, and then they forget that they're allowed to have a way they want the future to be, that they're allowed to have a specific vision for what they want to achieve.</p><p>They forget that they're allowed to desperately want the future to be different from the present.</p><p>Finding something to fight for won't <i>eliminate</i> the listless guilt. In fact, it may do the opposite: it may refine the listless guilt into a more pointed thing, a guilt about not making the world better <i>right now.</i> It may make you feel guilty about there being so much wrongness and badness that you're not confronting, that you <i>can't</i> confront. That's OK: the goal of this exercise is not to eliminate the listless guilt, but to <i>shift</i> it. The pointed guilt is more painful, but easier to replace with intrinsic motivation.</p><p>The listless guilt is a guilt about not doing anything. To remove it, we must first turn it into a guilt about not doing <i>something in particular.</i></p><p>If, instead of feeling vaguely guilty for binging netflix due to the feeling that there must be more to life, you feel <i>specifically</i> guilty because you could have been pursuing some concrete end, then we've made progress. The latter guilt, though often much more painful, is easier to address.</p>", "user": {"username": "So8res"}}, {"_id": "6xFFL55AoAYzynPBi", "title": "The stamp collector", "postedAt": "2015-04-27T06:35:18.516Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Once upon a time, a group of na\u00efve philosophers found a robot that collected trinkets. Well, more specifically, the robot seemed to collect stamps: if you presented this robot with a choice between various trinkets, it would always choose the option that led towards it having as many stamps as possible in its inventory. It ignored dice, bottle caps, aluminum cans, sticks, twigs, and so on, except insofar as it predicted they could be traded for stamps in the next turn or two. So, of course, the philosophers started calling it the \"stamp collector.\"</p><p>Then, one day, the philosophers discovered computers, and deduced out that the robot was merely a software program running on a processor inside the robot's head. The program was too complicated for them to understand, but they did manage to deduce that the robot only had a few sensors (on its eyes and inside its inventory) that it was using to model the world.</p><p>One of the philosophers grew confused, and said, \"Hey wait a sec, this thing can't be a stamp collector after all. If the robot is only building a model of the world in its head, then it can't be optimizing for its real inventory, because it has no access to its real inventory. It can only ever act according to a model of the world that it reconstructs inside its head!\"</p><p>\"Ah, yes, I see,\" another philosopher answered. \"We did it a disservice by naming it a stamp collector. The robot does not have true access to the world, obviously, as it is only seeing the world through sensors and building a model in its head. Therefore, it must not <i>actually</i> be maximizing the number of stamps in its inventory. That would be impossible, because its inventory is outside of its head. Rather, it must be maximizing its <i>internal stamp counter</i> inside its head.\"</p><p>So the na\u00efve philosophers nodded, pleased with this, and then they stopped wondering how the stamp collector worked.</p><hr><p>There are a number of flaws in this reasoning. First of all, these na\u00efve philosophers have made the homunculus error. The robot's program may not have \"true access\" to how many stamps were in its inventory (whatever that means), but it <i>also</i> didn't have \"true access\" to its internal stamp counter.</p><p>The robot is not occupied by some homunculus that has dominion over the innards but not the outards! The abstract program doesn't have \"true\" access to the register holding the stamp counter and \"fake\" access to the inventory. Steering reality towards regions where the inventory has lots of stamps in it is the <i>same sort of thing</i> as steering reality towards regions where the stamp-counter-register has high-number-patterns in it. There's not a magic circle containing the memory but not the inventory, within which the robot's homunculus has dominion; the robot program has just as little access to the \"true hardware\" as it has to the \"true stamps.\"</p><p>This brings us to the second flaw in their reasoning reasoning, that of trying to explain choice with a choice-thing. You can't explain why a wall is red by saying \"because it's made of tiny red atoms;\" this is not an <i>explanation</i> of red-ness. In order to explain red-ness, you must explain it in terms of non-red things. And yet, humans have a bad habit of explaining confusing things in terms of themselves. Why does living flesh respond to mental commands, while dead flesh doesn't? Why, because the living flesh contains <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89lan_vital\">\u00c9lan Vital</a>. Our na\u00efve philosophers have made the same mistake: they said, \"How can it possibly choose outcomes in which the inventory has more stamps? Aha! It must be by choosing outcomes in which the stamp counter is higher!,\" and in doing so, they have explained choice in terms of choice, rather than in terms of something more basic.</p><p>It is <i>not an explanation</i> to say \"it's trying to get stamps into its inventory because it's trying to maximize its stamp-counter.\" An explanation would look more like this: the robot's computer runs a program which uses sense-data to build a model of the world. That model of the world contains a representation of how many stapms are in the inventory. The program then iterates over some set of available actions, predicts how many stamps would be in the inventory (according to the model) if it took that action, and outputs the action which leads to the most predicted stamps in its possession.</p><p>We could <i>also</i> postulate that the robot contains a program which models the world, predicts how the world would change for each action, and <i>then</i> predicts how <i>that</i> outcome would affect some specific place in internal memory, and <i>then</i> selects the action which maximizes the internal counter. That's possible! You could build a machine like that! It's a strictly more complicated hypothesis, and so it gets a complexity penalty, but at least it's an explanation!</p><p>And, fortunately for us, it's a <i>testable</i> explanation: we can check what the robot does, when faced with the opportunity to directly increase the stamp-counter-register (without actually increasing how many stamps it has). Let's see how that goes over among our na\u00efve philosophers\u2026</p><hr><blockquote><p><i>Hey, check it out: I identified the stamp counter inside the robot's memory. I can't read it, but I did find a way to increase its value. So I gave the robot the following options: take one stamp, or take zero stamps and I'll increase the stamp counter by ten. Guess which one it took?</i></p></blockquote><p>\"Well, of course, it would choose the latter!\" one of the na\u00efve philosophers answers immediately.</p><blockquote><p><i>Nope! It took the former.</i></p></blockquote><p>\"\u2026 Huh! That means that the stampyness of <i>refusing</i> to have the stamp counter tampered with must worth be more than 10 stamps!\"</p><blockquote><p><i>Huh? What is \"stampyness\"?</i></p></blockquote><p>\"Why, stampyness is the robot's internal measure of how much <i>taking a certain action</i> would increase its stamp counter.\"</p><blockquote><p><i>What? That's ridiculous. I'm pretty sure it's just collecting stamps.</i></p></blockquote><p>\"Impossible! The program doesn't have access to how many stamps it really has; that's a property of the outer world. The robot <i>must</i> be optimizing according to values that are actually in its head.\"</p><blockquote><p><i>Here, let's try offering it the following options: either I'll give it one stamp, or I'll increase its stamp counter by Ackermann(g<sub>64</sub>, g<sub>64</sub>) \u2014 oh look, it took the stamp.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>\"Wow! That was a very big number, so that almost surely mean that the stampyness of refusing is dependent upon how much stampyness it's refusing! It must be very happy, because you just gave it a <i>lot</i> of stampyness by giving it such a compelling offer to refuse.\"</p><blockquote><p><i>Oh, here, look, I just figured out a way to set the stamp counter to maximum. Here, I'll try offering it a choice between either (a) one stamp, or (b) I'll set the stamp counter to maxi \u2014 oh look, it already took the stamp.</i></p></blockquote><p>\"Incredible! That must there must be some other counter measuring <i>micro</i>-stampyness, the amount of stampiness it gets <i>immediately</i> upon selecting an action, before you have a chance to modify it! Ah, yes, that's the only possible explanation for why it would refuse you setting the stamp counter to maximum, it <i>must</i> be choosing according to the perceived immediate micro-stampyness of each available action! Nice job doing science, my dear fellow, we have learned a lot today!\"</p><hr><p>Ahh! No! Let's be very clear about this: the robot is predicting which <i>outcomes</i> would follow from which actions, and it's ranking them, and it's taking the actions that lead to the best outcomes. <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/l4/terminal_values_and_instrumental_values/\">Actions are rated according to <i>what they achieve</i>. Actions do not <i>themselves</i> have intrinsic worth!</a></p><p>Do you see where these na\u00efve philosophers went confused? They have postulated an agent which treats <i>actions</i> like <i>ends</i>, and tries to steer towards whatever <i>action</i> it most prefers \u2014 as if actions were ends unto themselves.</p><p>You can't explain why the agent takes an action by saying that it ranks actions according to whether or not taking them is good. That begs the question of which actions are good!</p><p>This agent rates actions as \"good\" if they lead to outcomes where the agent has lots of stamps in its inventory. Actions are rated according to what they achieve; they do not themselves have intrinsic worth.</p><p>The robot program doesn't contain reality, but it doesn't need to. It still gets to <i>affect</i> reality. If its model of the world is correlated with the world, and it takes actions that it predicts leads to more <i>actual</i> stamps, then it will tend to accumulate stamps.</p><p>It's <i>not</i> trying to steer the future towards places where it happens to have selected the most micro-stampy actions; it's just steering the future towards worlds where it predicts it will actually have more stamps.</p><hr><p>Now, let me tell you my second story:</p><p>Once upon a time, a group of na\u00efve philosophers encountered a group of human beings. The humans seemed to keep selecting the actions that gave them pleasure. Sometimes they ate good food, sometimes they had sex, sometimes they made money to spend on pleasurable things later, but always (for the first few weeks) they took actions that led to pleasure.</p><p>But then one day, one of the humans gave lots of money to a charity.</p><p>\"How can this be?\" the philosophers asked, \"Humans are pleasure-maximizers!\" They thought for a few minutes, and then said, \"Ah, it must be that their pleasure from giving the money to charity outweighed the pleasure they would have gotten from spending the money.\"</p><p>Then a mother jumped in front of a car to save her child.</p><p>The na\u00efve philosophers were stunned, until suddenly one of their number said, \"I get it! The immediate micro-pleasure of <i>choosing that action</i> must have outweighed \u2014</p><hr><p>People will tell you that humans always and only ever do what brings them pleasure. People will tell you that there is no such thing as altruism, that people only ever do what they want to.</p><p>People will tell you that, because we're trapped inside our heads, we only ever get to care about things inside our heads, such as our own wants and desires.</p><p>But I have a message for you: You can, in fact, care about the outer world.</p><p>And you can steer it, too.

Lots of the reasons might apply to effective altruism too:</p>\n<p><em></em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><em><em>The time lag is huge; it&apos;s measured in months, or even years.</em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em>Most academic publications are inaccessible outside universities.</em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em>Virtually no one reads most academic publications.</em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em>It&apos;s very unusual to make successful philosophical arguments in paper form.</em></em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em>Papers don&apos;t have prestige outside a narrow subset of society.</em></em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em><em>Getting people to read papers is difficult.</em></em></em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Academia selects for conformity.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>The current community isn&apos;t academic in origin.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Our ideas aren&apos;t academic in origin.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em>Papers have a tradition of violating the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/js/the_bottom_line/\">bottom line</a>&#xA0;rule.</em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></li>\n<li><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><em><span><em>Academic moderation is both very strict and badly run.</em></span></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></em></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of these, four is debateable and eight is less true for effective altruism than for LessWrong. But the rest seem as true and pertinent for today&apos;s effective altruists as they were for the author.</p>\n<p>Diego Caleiro recently suggested that books might be superior to papers for promoting his ideas.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Books] are long enough to convey interesting ideas (of a more philosophical type) second, though they also follow exponential distributions, there are several marketing strategies that can aid publication and increase number of readers. They can be, like papers and unlike blogs, cited as decent academic evidence in good standing. They can be monetized as well, whereas one must pay to publish papers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He continues to put his point in the strongest possible terms:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am glad to hear counterarguments, because as it stands, this seems like the ultimate no-brainer, there is not a single thing papers are better than books for.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of readers</li>\n<li>Conveying complex ideas</li>\n<li>Getting feedback on ideas</li>\n<li>Money</li>\n<li>Career prospects</li>\n<li>Author&apos;s name being remembered and sought after</li>\n<li>Resilience over long stretches of time</li>\n<li>Compatibility with Technological advances (current and expected)</li>\n<li>Odds of finding collaborators in virtue of having written them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>...&#xA0;The few properties like &quot;peer feedback&quot; and &quot;short and easier to write&quot; that papers beat books at have are completely dominated by blogging, &apos;specially on public science or philosophy blogs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So are books simply superior to academic papers for conveying world-changing ideas? Now that people have been trying to advance the case for the importance of safe development of artificial intelligence (arguably one of the most important ideas, and one that has been quite controversial), we can ask which texts have most helped to advance that idea so far.</p>\n<p>Instinctually, Bostrom&apos;s book Superintelligence seems to have been most helpeful for this. Although it has only been <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=oQwpz3QAAAAJ&amp;cstart=20&amp;citation_for_view=oQwpz3QAAAAJ:1yQoGdGgb4wC\">moderately cited,</a> it&apos;s influence was felt in the discussions that it provoked from Musk, Hawking, Wozniak and an array of other scientists and technologists. It was also a bestseller, and seems to have been a major contributor to the change in discourse on this topic in the last couple of years. The book stood out as a landmark event. The Puerto Rico was similarly groundbreaking - both helped grow the reach of Bostrom&apos;s ideas in a way that dozens of papers would not (and had not).</p>\n<p>Rather, Bostrom&apos;s papers have tended to be nonconformist, and their degree of readership and reputation has suffered from this to a greater degree than his new book. In two other points of concern to Alyssa Vance, his book was also more widely available, and was accessed in much wider parts of society. It was also advantaged on some counts raised by Diego: it allowed Bostrom to convey unusually complex ideas, and made his name more well-known.</p>\n<p>The example of AI safety seems to speak to the value of books and in-person conversation.</p>\n<p>If we look at the founding of CEA, we see a similar story, of initial connections being made between Toby Ord and William MacAskill, as well as with some in-person student groups at Oxford University. Even though the context was academic, journals were not the main mode of passing information or inspiration. However, it journalistic publication does seem to have helped people like Ord and MacAskill to earn a living and maintain their academic career prospects. Moreover, in the cases of Bostrom and CEA, it may have been valuable to gain a significant academic reputation before performing outreach activities. Such would certainly be the case for Peter Singer, who also admittedly gained most of his eventual reputation through books.</p>\n<p>So academic papers aren&apos;t generating big breakthroughs in interest, but a lot of the leading thinkers tend to be academics.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>So how helpful does being an academic seem to be? Well, it&apos;s not strictly necessary. If we look at the inception of MIRI (when it was the Singularity Institute), we see Eliezer, who was writing on online messageboards, and was allergic to academia. Despite often writing in a way that was technical and informed by science, he was not in any academic role, and had no academic prestige. Eliezer is as always a bit of an anomaly, though, as his writing talents have repeatedly proven to be extremely popular, and this may have allowed his writing to cut through in the absence of academic status. If you look somewhere like <a href=\"http://edge.org/\">Edge</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/\">TED</a> or <a href=\"http://bigthink.com/\">Big Think</a> a lot leading public intellectuals and writers are academics. However, it&apos;s hard to discern the causation. It could be that academia is equipping them to better promote their useful thoughts, or it could just be that academia sucks in more than its share of the best thinkers in the first place.</p>\n<p>So what reasons do we see for writing academic papers? For a start, they can help one to identify an academic expert, which is possibly useful. MIRI, CSER, FHI and others derive a lot of their reputation (which in turn gives them some political and persuasive strength) in this way, as have Ord and Bostrom, and this might be good for anyone who wants to be a public intellectual. Another reason to write academic papers would be to be able to point to the existence of an academic field. This seems to be what MIRI wants to be able to do - to point technical and conscientious AI researchers to such a body of work. These kinds of investments will not pay off for some time, and may prove hard to evaluate. For the rest of us, why write papers? Well, it could be strategically useful for those who wish to secure an otherwise undemanding professorial position. They might help us secure a research-based job. But otherwise, and especially from an altruistic point of view, they don&apos;t seem to do much. So Alyssa and Diego&apos;s reservations about the value of papers seem pretty compelling to me.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "RD9ztxR4y6jYaPbT7", "title": "Room for more funding: Why doesn\u2019t the Gates foundation just close the funding gap of AMF and SCI?", "postedAt": "2015-06-03T14:48:07.317Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>This is my personal opinion and does not reflect the opinions of Giving What We Can or any particular other organisation.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i><strong>Erratum: </strong>A previous version of this document falsely stated that Givewell.org based their room for more funding analysis on certain considerations.

In other words, people who think that we won't really know where we should put our money after just a few million dollars, should not be worried. If we were to move significantly more money, we would probably would find other giving opportunities.</p><p>Before we discuss why this is, we first need to answer a different question.</p><h2><strong>Why are some room for more funding estimates only in the low millions, while others are in the billions?</strong></h2><p>Some room&nbsp;for more funding projections, which are in the low millions, could maybe be more fittingly described as <i>short-term</i>&nbsp;room for more funding projections for a particular charity. These projections differ from <i>long-term</i>&nbsp;room for more funding projections for the overall area such as neglected tropical diseases, malaria, or micronutrient fortification, which are in the billions of dollars (see appendix). Some people may be confused when they see <i>short-term</i>&nbsp;room for more funding projections and see how they differ from <i>long-term </i>room for more funding projects. Concretely, the Against Malaria Foundation and the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative only have room for more funding in the tens of millions in the short-term, and would certainly have some trouble spending their resources, if they were to each receive $100 million tomorrow. However, that does not mean that they could not significantly scale-up in the next few years or that generally the funding gap for the distribution of bednets generally is only in the tens of millions. Bigger organisations such as UNICEF or the END fund could probably spent that much money on very effective interventions very quickly- I will return to that point in the conclusion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are some good reasons for why large donors would want to not give too much money to a charity at once:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Avoiding excessive reserves:</strong>&nbsp;Because of the opportunity costs (other charities could use money productively <i>sooner</i>), it is undesirable to have a charity having excessive reserves. Ideally, they would be promised a steady stream of funding if they meet specific targets over many years in order for them to be able to plan ahead.</li><li><strong>Risk diversification:</strong>&nbsp;Funds should be distributed to several high impact organisations in order to diversify the risk of one of them not performing well.</li><li><strong>Incentivizing others to join the cause area:</strong><ol><li><i>Countries: </i>By restricting funding to a particular country, one incentivizes the country to invest in very effective health interventions themselves and use their (often very limited) domestic resources to close the funding gap between donations and the full cost of delivering effective health interventions. Poorer, low-income countries (such as Ethiopia) are less able to do this than low-to-middle income countries (such as India).</li><li><i>Charities: </i>By restricting funding to charities, they\u2019re being kept on their toes, so that they do not rely on a particular foundation or big grant giver exclusively and apply for other grants. For instance, in the past, the Gates foundation has heavily funded the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative. However, Gates later discontinued SCI\u2019s funding not because of too little effectiveness, but because, since their effectiveness had been established, other funders would more readily fund them.</li><li><i>Other donors: </i>By restricting funding to particular charities, other donors are incentivized to also invest in the effective charities. For instance, the Against Malaria foundation has a broader appeal to small private donors than more high-expected-value interventions. Thus, even though theoretically, the Gates foundation, which is the largest private foundation in the world with an endowment of US$42.9 billion<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[4]</a></sup></span>, could buy every person in Africa a bednet every two years (population of Africa (1 Billion) * Cost of Bednet (5 Dollars) = 5 Billion dollars) that would rapidly deplete their limited resources and then they could not spend their money on other very effective causes. They might reason that (small) more risk-averse donors (who want to be certain that their money will have an impact) will close the funding gap of very effective and established interventions and that they can instead spend more money on riskier, high expected value areas.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Technological Innovation: </strong>New technological innovations\u2014such as a very effective malaria vaccine\u2014might be discovered, and these might be more cost-effective.</li><li><strong>High risk, high reward project:</strong></li></ol><p>For these reasons, one needs to come up with short-term room for more funding estimates.</p><p>Crucially, many room-for-more-funding numbers do not include scale-up and seem to be an estimate of how much money the charities can use to fund projects in the short-term (i.e. in the next couple of years).&nbsp;In other words, these estimates do not take into account potential mid-term scale-up of their interventions into other countries or into more projects (see for instance<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[5]</a></sup></span>,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[6]</a></sup></span>). For instance, Givewell reports that AMF\u2019s room for more funding in the next year is $25 Million, which translates to roughly 5 million bednets. Because AMF has reported to be constricted in terms of funding in the short-term, they had not been actively reaching out to other countries to discuss new net programs in the beginning of 2015<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[7]</a></sup></span>.

For instance, one might estimate that SCI's funding gap is in the low millions this year. However, SCI could intensify their efforts of existing projects, expand to other countries, and be only marginally less effective.

A recent WHO report<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[13]</a></sup></span><u>,</u><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[14]</a></sup></span>, &nbsp;has a better estimate of the true <i>funding gap</i>&nbsp;for neglected tropical diseases, which I define as what would not be funded if we don\u2019t fund it. This takes into account that the high costs for universal coverage against NTDs as shown above will be covered to a large extent by domestic funds from lower-middle income countries. Lower-middle income countries such as India often just need technical assistance. In contrast, lower income countries cannot fund mass drug administrations, bednet distributions etc. themselves at all, because they're too poor and it is politically not feasible to spend massively on poor rural populations. Even taking this and increasing western aid budgets into account there's a big funding gap. Nobody knows where the money needed to achieve somewhat universal coverage from NTDs is supposed to come from.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The WHO writes:</p><p>\u201cThe commitment of foreign donors and community volunteers to NTD control will continue to be important in scaling up access to those products that are available. However, it is unlikely that they can mobilize resources at the scale implied by universal coverage against NTDs. Universal coverage against NTDs will fail if it fails to mobilize domestic investment.\u201d It is unclear whether poorer countries will be able or whether it will be politically feasible to mobilize sufficient domestic investment to close the funding gap.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995327/mirroredImages/RD9ztxR4y6jYaPbT7/a9xbkt3o5ypw7xtv80kq.png\"></p><p><strong>The funding gap that you see in green above is the</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>a better approximation of the real funding gap that could be closed by effective altruists, which is in the hundreds of millions. The counterfactual here would be that this funding gap would not be closed even if foreign aid increases above 2014 levels. Narrowing in on this target will obviously lead to decreased effectiveness (for instance, a key driver of cost-effectiveness of bednet distributions and mass deworming is disease prevalence). It is difficult to estimate when an intervention becomes much less cost-effective. However, it seems as if there is ample room for more funding before we hit those diminishing marginal returns on investment.</strong></p><p>Of course, the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative might be overwhelmed by spending so much more money and we would probably have to find bigger organisations in the schistosomiasis space, such as the END fund, UNICEF, who could absorb more money for effective NTD interventions (I return to this point in the conclusion).</p><h2><strong>What happens after universal coverage against neglected tropical diseases and Malaria?</strong></h2><p>After moving many more millions to Malaria and Deworming charities, and establishing universal coverage against Malaria and NTDs (some of which are probably not much more ineffective to treat than schistosomiasis), there are many more very effective health interventions that one could fund.</p><p>Here are just some random examples of health interventions whose cost-effectiveness estimations might be somewhat off and potentially worse, but that are probably still very effective:</p><ul><li>Antenatal syphilis screening: $50 per DALY averted<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[15]</a></sup></span></li><li>Introduction of auto-disable syringe that cannot be reused and reduces needle sharing: $46-48 per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[16]</a></sup></span></li><li>Female condom distribution programmes in Zimbabwe: US$146 per DALY averted<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[17]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>There are many more examples such as these and it will take quite a long time to fund them.</p><p>But even after such \u2018distribution of stuff\u2019 health interventions are funded there are some incredibly effective health interventions to fund.

As the number of people who want to give effectively increases steadily, we will be able to conduct more research into finding out which cost-effective charities in the global health field are executing these interventions. Having more funds would also give us leverage to donate ring-fenced funding for effective interventions, such as bednet distributions, to bigger charities. For instance, AMF has only distributed about 6 million nets overall so far. In contrast, between 2002 and 2013, UNICEF procured over 213 million bednets and its share of the total global bednet delivery ranges from 20 to 37 per cent every year<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[25]</a></sup></span>. However, while UNICEF implements a wide range of very effective global health interventions (bednets, vaccines, autodisable syringes, Vitamin A supplementation, etc.), they also support less effective interventions. A foundation or the collective bargaining power of a number of effective altruists, could ask UNICEF to implement an additional, very effective bednet distribution programme in an extra country, but with more limited resources one\u2019s donations would just go to UNICEF as a whole and so the effectiveness would be diluted<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref[object Object]\"><sup><a href=\"#fn[object Object]\">[26]</a></sup></span>.

I attended my first MIRI workshop in December of 2013 while I was still working at Google, and was offered a job soon after. Over the last year, I wrote a dozen papers, half as primary author. Six of those papers were written for the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/technical-agenda/\">MIRI technical agenda</a>, which we compiled in preparation for the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/misc/ai_conference\">Puerto Rico conference</a>&#xA0;put on by FLI in January 2015. Our technical agenda is cited extensively in the<a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/static/data/documents/research_priorities.pdf\">research priorities document</a>&#xA0;referenced by the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/misc/open_letter\">open letter</a>&#xA0;that came out of that conference. In addition to the Puerto Rico conference, I attended five other conferences over the course of the year, and gave a talk at three of them. I also put together the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/research-guide/\">MIRI research guide</a>&#xA0;(a resource for students interested in getting involved with AI alignment research), and of course I spent a fair bit of time doing the actual research at workshops, at researcher retreats, and on my own. It&#x2019;s been a jam-packed year, and it&#x2019;s been loads of fun.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve always had a natural inclination towards leadership: in the past, I&#x2019;ve led a F.I.R.S.T. Robotics team, managed two volunteer theaters, served as president of an Entrepreneur&#x2019;s Club, and co-founded a startup or two. However, this is the first time I&#x2019;ve taken a professional leadership role, and I&#x2019;m grateful that I&#x2019;ll be able to call upon the experience and expertise of the board, of our advisors, and of outgoing executive director Luke Muehlhauser.</p>\n<p>MIRI has improved greatly under Luke&#x2019;s guidance these last few years, and I&#x2019;m honored to have the opportunity to continue that trend. I&#x2019;ve spent a lot of time in conversation with Luke over the past few weeks, and he&#x2019;ll remain a close advisor going forward. He and the management team have spent the last year or so really tightening up the day-to-day operations at MIRI, and I&#x2019;m excited about all the opportunities we have open to us now.</p>\n<p>The last year has been pretty incredible. Discussion of long-term AI risks and benefits has finally hit the mainstream, thanks to the success of Bostrom&#x2019;s&#xA0;<em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies\">Superintelligence</a></em>&#xA0;and FLI&#x2019;s Puerto Rico conference, and due in no small part to years of movement-building and effort made possible by MIRI&#x2019;s supporters. Over the last year, I&#x2019;ve forged close connections with our friends at the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">Future of Humanity Institute</a>, the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://futureoflife.org/\">Future of Life Institute</a>, and the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://cser.org/\">Centre for the Study of Existential Risk</a>, as well as with a number of industry teams and academic groups who are focused on long-term AI research. I&#x2019;m looking forward to our continued participation in the global conversation about the future of AI. These are exciting times in our field, and MIRI is well-poised to grow and expand. Indeed, one of my top priorities as executive director is to grow the research team.</p>\n<p>That project is already well under way. I&#x2019;m pleased to announce that Jessica Taylor has accepted a full-time position as a MIRI researcher starting in August 2015. We are also hosting a series of summer workshops focused on various technical AI alignment problems, the second of which is just now concluding. Additionally, we are working with the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://rationality.org/\">Center for Applied Rationality</a>&#xA0;to put on a&#xA0;<a href=\"http://rationality.org/miri-summer-fellows-2015/\">summer fellows program</a>designed for people interested in gaining the skills needed for research in the field of AI alignment.</p>\n<p>I want to take a moment to extend my heartfelt thanks to all those supporters of MIRI who have brought us to where we are today: We have a slew of opportunities before us, and it&#x2019;s all thanks to your effort and support these past years. MIRI couldn&#x2019;t have made it as far as it has without you.

In the previous month, and in nearly every month since, protests against racism in the criminal justice system have roiled nearly every major U.S. city. This comes in a decade when the national conversation has already been shaped profoundly by the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#xA0;</span><span>It&apos;s common to view participation in mass protests as a choice. I want to argue that, sometimes, participation in protests is not a choice: it is wrong not to participate.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#xA0;</span><span>I don&#x2019;t claim that community or solidarity or anything like that has inherent importance. Instead, I want to argue that it may be immoral to stay home from a protest because doing so causes harm.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#xA0;</span><span>To start, I offer perhaps the most influential thought experiment of contemporary times &#x2013; one that has led thousands of people associated with a movement called Effective Altruism to commit their lifetime earnings to addressing extreme poverty. The thought experiment comes from Peter Singer&apos;s&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1972----.htm\">Famine, Affluence and Morality</a><span>:</span></p>\n<p><span>If I am walking past a shallow pond and see a child drowning in it, I ought to wade in and pull the child out. This will mean getting my clothes muddy, but this is insignificant, while the death of the child would presumably be a very bad thing.</span></p>\n<p><span>By analogy, Singer argues, we are obligated to save children in developing countries by donating our money, even if it comes at the cost of our own wants.</span></p>\n<p><span>In&#xA0;<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=JOMDsm5Gn9kC&amp;dq=more+than+good+intentions+drowning+child&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s\">More Than Good Intentions</a>, economist Dean Karlan extends this pond analogy. Suppose I don&apos;t know how to save the child - I can jump in after him or I can throw something to him in the water. Knowing which is more effective could save his life. By analogy, if we are obligated to help those suffering from extreme poverty, we are obligated to figure out the most effective way to help them. Unsurprisingly, Karlan is the founder of&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.poverty-action.org/\">Innovations for Poverty Action</a>, a nonprofit (where, full disclosure, I work) that is dedicated to finding effective solutions to global poverty.</span></p>\n<p><span>I&apos;d like to extend the pond analogy in a different way. Suppose I am walking past a deep pond and see a child drowning in it. The child is drowning in the middle of the pond, where I would have to swim in to get him. This is not safe - I&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.swimmersdaily.com/2014/02/12/simple-step-by-step-guide-on-how-to-save-someone-who-is-drowning/\">risk being pulled in by the drowning victim</a><span>. Instead, I see a large plank of wood that I could throw to the child as a flotation device. With a group of about 10 people, we could throw the wood to the middle of the pond to reach the child. Any less, and we would not be strong enough for it to reach the child. There is no time to run and get any additional people.</span></p>\n<p><span>If there are nine other people around the lake determined to help, I ought to assist them in throwing the plank of wood. The choice isn&apos;t much different from that in the original analogy. If there are eight&#xA0;people, and I really know that we need at least ten to throw it, then it seems I am under no obligation to assist. If there are ten or more, then I am again under no obligation to assist, because they will save the child on their own.</span></p>\n<p><span>Now the number should not really matter for this decision - if it takes one million people to throw the plank of wood and I am the millionth person, then my obligation is equally strong. Similarly, it should not matter whether the child is in a far away country, living in the far future, or of a different species.</span></p>\n<p><span>Clearly, this example is both trivial and unrealistic. So we can relax some the assumptions. Maybe I don&apos;t know how many people it will take to throw the plank of wood. In that case, if there is still a significant chance I am the threshold person, and I don&#x2019;t have an equally pressing need to rush off to, I am obligated to help the group.</span></p>\n<p><span>We can modify the thought experiment in another way: maybe there isn&apos;t a sharp cutoff where we can suddenly throw the plank, but each additional person helps get the plank a little bit closer. Again, this modification is easily dealt with - if I significantly increase the chance that the plank reaches the child, I am obligated to assist (and given that a child&apos;s life is on the line, I don&apos;t need to make much of a contribution for it to be wrong to sit out).</span></p>\n<p><span>We can modify this hypothetical in further ways, but the basic idea is clear: if collective action can produce major change, and my potential contribution is large enough, it is wrong to stay home. If a collective action&#x2019;s potential impact is great, even a tiny contribution to it may be morally required.</span></p>\n<p><span>Singer&#x2019;s pond analogy makes very salient our individual obligation to those in need. The growing numbers of people &#x2013; termed</span><span>&#xA0;</span><a href=\"/\">Effective Altruists</a><span>&#xA0;</span><span>&#x2013; who take his analogy seriously are changing the world in a meaningful way. I would identify myself as an EA and encourage readers of my blog to join this compelling and rapidly growing movement. Effective Altruists (EAs) are collaborating more and more to build a community. But EAs&#x2019; outward engagement with the world tends to focus overly narrowly on ways to act alone. Donating to effective charities and eating a vegan diet are important and necessary ways to relieve suffering, but sometimes, more traditional collective action is required too. I fear a movement centered around doing the most good risks doing far less good for overlooking more traditional forms of protest.</span></p>\n<p><span>The months following the People&#x2019;s Climate March saw a new accord between the U.S. and China, the defeat of the Keystone XL pipeline in the U.S. Senate, and the growth of a</span><span>&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2015/4/16/harvard_students_expand_blockade_calling_for\">vibrant fossil fuels divestment movement</a><span>&#xA0;</span><span>across the U.S. The #blacklivesmatter marches that have swept the country are leading police departments even in cities untouched by the national spotlight to revise their training. And there is</span><span>&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.hks.harvard.edu/fs/dyanagi/Research/TeaParty_Protests.pdf\">evidence</a><span>&#xA0;</span><span>that not just the Tea Party movement but specific Tea Party protests altered the course of national and local politics.</span></p>\n<p><span>It is far from rare that collective action changes the world. If we can contribute meaningfully to it &#x2013; which if we cannot do as an individual activist, we almost certainly can as an organizer &#x2013; we have no choice but to do so.</span></p>\n<p><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <o:OfficeDocumentSettings> <o:AllowPNG /> </o:OfficeDocumentSettings> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:WordDocument> <w:Zoom>0</w:Zoom> <w:TrackMoves>false</w:TrackMoves> <w:TrackFormatting /> <w:PunctuationKerning /> <w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridHorizontalSpacing> <w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing>18 pt</w:DrawingGridVerticalSpacing> <w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayHorizontalDrawingGridEvery> <w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery>0</w:DisplayVerticalDrawingGridEvery> <w:ValidateAgainstSchemas /> <w:SaveIfXMLInvalid>false</w:SaveIfXMLInvalid> <w:IgnoreMixedContent>false</w:IgnoreMixedContent> <w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText>false</w:AlwaysShowPlaceholderText> <w:Compatibility> <w:BreakWrappedTables /> <w:DontGrowAutofit /> <w:DontAutofitConstrainedTables /> <w:DontVertAlignInTxbx /> </w:Compatibility> </w:WordDocument> </xml><![endif]--><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml> <w:LatentStyles DefLockedState=\"false\" LatentStyleCount=\"276\"> </w:LatentStyles> </xml><![endif]--> <!--[if gte mso 10]> <mce:style><! /* Style Definitions */ table.MsoNormalTable {mso-style-name:\"Table Normal\"; mso-tstyle-rowband-size:0; mso-tstyle-colband-size:0; mso-style-noshow:yes; mso-style-parent:\"\"; mso-padding-alt:0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; mso-para-margin:0in; mso-para-margin-bottom:.0001pt; mso-pagination:widow-orphan; font-size:12.0pt; font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; mso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; mso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;} --> <!--[endif] --> <!--StartFragment--> <!--EndFragment--></p>\n<p><span>&#xA0;</span></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "zdgroff"}}, {"_id": "8MXhcnLearxSbeePe", "title": "Solving donation coordination problems", "postedAt": "2015-05-28T01:04:42.999Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>In <a href=\"/ea/j9/giving_what_we_can_needs_your_help/3s2\">a comment on GWWC&apos;s recent fundraising appeal</a>, I asked whether prospective donors were holding off on donating until the end of the fundraiser, out of the worry that it would hit its goal early and thus their donation would not have any counterfactual impact.

It means a lot to us, and it will mean a lot to the charities that we support.</p>\n<p>If you&apos;ve considered giving to Giving What We Can, now is a great time to do it. Fundraising takes a considerable amount of time and energy. The longer it takes for us to reach our fundraising targets, the more time we have to spend on fundraising activities, and the less time we can devote to inspiring donations to our recommended charities. With our members contributing an average of over $60,000 in lifetime donations to top charities (time discounted and counter-factually adjusted), every member that we don&apos;t convince to join up is around 11,000 bednets that won&apos;t be distributed, nearly 80,000 people that won&apos;t be treated for Schistosomiasis, or 20 lives that won&apos;t be saved.</p>\n<p>If we fall short of our fundraising goal, we will not be able to offer a long-term position to our current Director of Communications. He has invaluable experience as a Communications Director for several high-profile Australian politicians, which has given him skills in web-development, public relations, graphic design, public speaking and social media. Amongst the things he has already achieved in his three months with us are: he has automated the book-keeping on our Trust (saving huge amounts of time and minimising errors), very much improved our published materials, written a press release and planned a media push to capitalise on our getting to 1000 members and Peter Singer&#x2019;s book release in the UK. His wide variety of skills mean that there are a large number of projects he would be capable of doing which would increase our member growth, and we are keen for him to test a number of these. But his first, if we can keep him on, is to optimise our website to make the most of the increased attention effective altruism will be generating over the summer and turn that into people actually donating 10% of their incomes to the most effective causes. In the past we have had trouble finding someone with such a broad set of crucial skills. Combined with how swiftly and well he has integrated into our team, it would be a massive loss to have to let him go and later down the line need to try to recruit a replacement.</p>\n<p>We believe that Giving What We Can is one of the most effective places you can donate - we calculate that for every dollar we spend on our operations, around $60 is donated to effective charities.

It is particularly related to Helen Toner&apos;s&#xA0;<a href=\"/ea/9s/effective_altruism_is_a_question_not_an_ideology/\">Effective Altruism is a question, not an ideology</a>.</address><address><br></address>\n<p>A confusion I hear frequently from new EAs working on movement building takes the following form:&#xA0;</p>\n<p>1) Effective Altruism is a movement</p>\n<p>2) Other movements have done this or that (say, accelerate movement growth using this technique X), should Effective Altruism be doing the same?</p>\n<p>3) Other movements failed in thing Z and now most people in them are not sane, how can we avoid this?</p>\n<p>These claims and questions rest on a reference class assumption that is false.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>It is false that the reference class to reason about Effective Altruism is the&#xA0;<em>movements</em>&#xA0;class</strong>.</p>\n<p>Not all movements are made alike. Although EA has many movement characteristics, such as growth rates, core groups, a need to mobilize people, some epistemic and value alignment, a desire to grow, a sense of identity etc, it also has additional features that makes it different from most - not all - movements that came before. One of them I want to bring to surface and make salient in everyone&apos;s minds.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Effective Altruism is an intensional movement, not an extensional movement&#xA0;</h2>\n<p>This distinction comes from philosophy of language and psycholinguistics, and goes like this: &quot;two to the power of three&quot; and &quot;the number of planets in the solar system&quot; are intensions, both of which capture the same extension, the number 8.</p>\n<p>An intension is the way in which a symbol, a sign, or a gesture captures an object. An extension is the object that it captures in that way.</p>\n<p>&quot;The morning star&quot; and &quot;the evening star&quot; are both intensions, it just so happens that, though nobody knew about it when they named them, both ended up being the same thing in the world. Both of them capture the same celestial object, which curiously happens to be the planet Venus! Venus is the extension of &quot;the evening star&quot; and &quot;the morning star&quot;. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>So what does it mean to say that Effective Altruism is more like an intension than like an extension? It means that the things which unify the different people, thinkers, researchers and donors that compose the EA movement are ways of reasoning, or methods, or perspectives, but they are not ultimately and fully pre-determined and established states of the world. They are not the object, but the means through which we intend to reach the object and capture it - those who were at the 2014 EA Global (Summit) have seen this exposed for instance in Rob Wiblin&apos;s talk when he mentioned different moral philosophies all of which compatible with being an EA, but I want to emphasize this again here, given how many times I&apos;ve found people asking me something to which this was the explanation again. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>The same intension has a very important property when distinguishing movements, it <em>can refer or point to different things at different times. </em>That is, the extension to which the intension is currently pointing can change. &quot;The number of planets&quot; used to point to the number 9, it now points to 8. Effective Altruism as a practice will also necessarily change over time, because the largest marginal returns on effort and resource usage to do the best thing are not stable, and even if they were stable, we don&apos;t have immediate perfect direct access to them.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Effective Altruist currently refers to some groups of people who are aligned on many dimensions, but Effective Altruism is not prescriptive in the way religious movements are, where the object-level behaviors are already established, or the facts are declared known in advance. The thing that unifies for instance the Catholic church is a series of beliefs about extensions, about the behaviors, objects, saints and deities themselves. When a growth planner plans to make the Catholic movement grow, they need to impart that extension into the convertee&apos;s mind. When the racial equality movement wants more people to join their cause, the goal is to change people&apos;s behaviors and beliefs at the extensional level; they want people to know that and behave as if racial prejudice was unjustified. I use these two examples to clarify that being an extensional movement doesn&apos;t mean actually referring to a thing in the world, the Catholic Saints are not actual deities, whereas racial prejudice in fact is unjustified. One false and one true example.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Why does being an intensional movement means a different reference class for EA?</h2>\n<p>1) It means there is a much more nuanced border between who is an EA or not.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>2) It means EAs will form a gradient of level of EA-ness, as opposed to a binary clustering. Whereas religious movements will measure how central a member is by how intense a person&apos;s commitment to not change their mind, for instance how elated they feel about their true belief, how intense their devotion is, EA will see a person as more EA if they hold more beliefs within a large cluster of methodogical beliefs to be right.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>3) It means that people can be persuaded to be EAs even without agreeing with the current priority agenda, if they believe that the EA intension, will, over time, shift towards a better extension, which they currently believe is more valuable.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>4) It means that it is better to compare the growth of EA and how to go about it with the growth of other intensional movements, such as the advent of peer-review, the general adoption of the scientific method or the propagation of universities. These are movements in a sense of course, but it is a narrower sense with very different properties from movements like feminism or socialism.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>5) A different way to see this is that for extensional movements, if my core movement belief is that a sentence P is true, and you believe ~P, then the <em>only</em>&#xA0;way for you to join my movement is if you start believing P and abandon ~P. Not so for EAs. If we currently believe (let&apos;s call this G) that the far future is important and we should try to colonize the galaxy, and you believe ~G, it is perfectly reasonable to envision a day two years from now where you continue to believe ~G and you are now an EA, and I who used to believe G have been persuaded by your argument that present people matter more than future people. I do not lose my EA identity by changing my core beliefs about what matters or what should be done. This is not the case for racial, religious or political movements. It is impossible to not believe there is a God and be a full-fledged Catholic, no matter how elated you are, or how careful the procedure through which you arrived at the conclusion of God&apos;s inexistence. If you persuaded all Catholics of God&apos;s nonexistence, you would not have changed Catholicism; you would have ended it.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>6) EA is in a narrower reference class than that of movements, and many of the intuitions that work for other movements break for EA. There are however other movements that are also about the way in which you capture what you want, not directly about the state of the world that you want. &#xA0;These should be taken as much more valuable when trying to take the outside view on the development of EA in the long run.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Some intensional movement examples for ease of reference class availability</h2>\n<p>When we think of movements and movement building some salient ones come to mind: feminism, political equality, racial equality, scientology, religious movements and socialism are the most salient in my mind. None of these are intensional. So here is a historical list of intensional ones to give a sense of what that class looks like. These are ones which don&apos;t pre-establish the behaviors and world states beforehand, but are open-ended and figure them out as they go.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>1) Peer-review</p>\n<p>2) Universities</p>\n<p>3) Open source software community</p>\n<p>4) Academic philosophy</p>\n<p>5) Lesswrong&#xA0;</p>\n<p>6) MIT</p>\n<p>7) US Army&#xA0;</p>\n<p>8) Gates Foundation</p>\n<p>When in doubt as a heuristic, try to use the P to ~P shift. MIT and the US army could completely re-design their strategic considerations on how to go about being a great university or protecting American lives and they would still be MIT and the US Army. Now the following examples are cases where it isn&apos;t clear immediately, so I suggest you try to think if they are intensional or extensional movements before reading on.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>a) Singularitarians</p>\n<p>b) Transhumanists</p>\n<p>c) Longevity alliance</p>\n<p>d) 80,000 Hours.</p>\n<p>These were selected because though they are related to the EA community, they are about specific ways for the world to be. The longevity alliance won&apos;t advocate shorter lifespans, and transhumanism will not advocate maintaining the status quo of the human condition, and avoiding being better than well. 80,000 Hours is a career adviser. All the members could decide it needs not exist and continue to be EAs, but 80,000 Hours would be dissolved as a consequence. The four examples above are all extensional movements/institutions.</p>\n<p>I hope I hear over the course of the next weeks more discussions using examples and drawing valuable conclusions from the narrow set of intensional movements. The EA movement will still change its extension quite a few times until it maybe reaches a more stable desired world state. But no matter how long and how stable, how convergent it ends up being at the end of the day, it will always be open to further scrutiny and change. The outside view on EA should be the outside view on intensional movements, not on all movements. Those who are planning where to direct its movement-aspects have to take that factor into account. I hope from now on everyone will.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Examples where the distinct reference class of intensional movements makes a difference</h2>\n<p>Roxanne and Oliver suggested that I give some examples where the emphasis on &quot;intensional movement&quot; makes a difference, and to mention that these are not all the examples, just the intuition pumps to start the engine.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>a) When considering strategically how to interact with members of other movements, there is ample room for collaboration and less need for competition, because frequently one can become an EA without recanting their previous affiliation with some extensional movement. So it changes strategic collaboration considerations.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>b) Intensional movements are more nuanced in how much buy-in individuals need. The transition processes both inwards and outwards towards core community are smoother, and can happen without deep epiphanies, or large cognitive dissonance.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>c) Paul Christiano argues that&#xA0;<a href=\"http://rationalaltruist.com/2013/06/13/against-moral-advocacy/\">moral advocacy</a> may turn out to not be the best way to go about building EA, an intensional movement, even though it seems needed for most extensional movements.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>d) Fluid hierarchical positions and merit-based judgement structures are more valuable for intensional than they are for extensional movements. It is better to have one pope until he dies, but several university deans over a decade, preferably not arbitrarily selected. Guru&apos;s are frequently attached to the extension of which they are gurus, although it is possible to become a guru-like figure without attaching yourself to any particular extension - e.g. Putnam, Neumann, Feyman.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>e) Intensional structures can be more long-lived without need for cognitive dissonance, they are more epistemically robust to changes in weltanschauung(worldview). Yuval Harari&apos;s&#xA0;<em>Sapiens</em> (2014)&#xA0;is a good history book to capture that intuition, it recaptures the whole of history and shows the relative causal unimportance of reactive extensional movements like most religions in the very long run.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>f) Related to the previous point, intensional structures are more dynamic, and permit more action to originate from the inside. Borrowing from Dennett, the intuition here is that intensional movements are not a leash, but a trampoline which enlarges the scope of actions that a group can have.</p>\n<p>With these examples I hope the intuition that Effective Altruism is an intensional movement can be steelmanned in your mind into a powerful concept. Sometimes - say, to make hiring decisions - it may well be fine to use movements at large as your reference class, but frequently it is more valuable to think of Effective Altruism as an intensional movement. &#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Diego_Caleiro"}}, {"_id": "uLxjjdq6s94X5Yyoc", "title": "On everyday altruism and the local circle", "postedAt": "2015-05-24T14:09:48.083Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>An experience this week suggested to me that, far from alienating me from suffering closer to home, the ideas of Effective Altruism have an important interplay with the way I respond to those in need who I encounter in my everyday life.</p>\n<p>Somebody somewhat-near-me* suffered an incredible tragedy this week, with the loss of a child who was only a few months old. Her boy suffered congenital heart disease. He had been lucky to be born in a country where his condition was recognised at birth, and where he could be treated by experts. He and his family were lucky to live in a country with universal health care, so that they were not forced to decide between open heart surgery for a child and the shelter or feeding of the rest of their family. But despite luck and expertise his life was cut very short.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s hard to comprehend the suffering of his parents. I can&#x2019;t encompass it. The urge to &#x2018;do something&#x2019; is swift and strong. After some thought I decided to do the only useful thing I could think of: since I don&#x2019;t know them well enough to be a big emotional support, I prepared a few nourishing meals and a cake, and made a doorstop drop of food and beer.</p>\n<p>I did this because I thought it would help them a tiny bit not to have to put a meal together, and because I hoped it would help them feel not alone. I did this because it helped me to feel that by rallying in someone&#x2019;s distress I was helping hold back the sense of despair that confronted us in the wake of such a loss.</p>\n<p>When I reflected today though, I realised that these same motivations are an important part of why I continue supporting charities like AMF and SCI. As Julia Wise writes, those other mothers love their babies just as hard. Those babies have the same enchanting smiles of promise that my baby flashes in the morning, and their deaths are just as awful as this boy&apos;s passing. &#xA0;And for a relatively small sum I can help - not just to take the edge off a day of grief for that other mother, but to keep her baby alive.</p>\n<p>For me, it strengthens and fosters my compassion &#x2013; my literal feeling with &#x2013; families far away, to offer support and care to those who are physically close to me. There is no dissonance about it: the feelings come from the same place.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>*We are in a large music group together, and also are both part of a small online parents group started by a mutual friend.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Bernadette_Young"}}, {"_id": "gubonEBHXt6epehmS", "title": "Meetup : Drinks & Discussion on Animal Welfare as an Effective Cause", "postedAt": "2015-05-24T13:52:37.165Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/2u\">Drinks &amp; Discussion on Animal Welfare as an Effective Cause</a></h2>\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHEN:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>31 May 2015 04:00:00PM (-0500)</span><br>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHERE:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>3136 Patty Lane, Middleton, WI 53562</span>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .meta -->\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t    <div><p>How do we compare human welfare with non-human animal welfare? \nShould we care about the suffering of animals in the wild?

He noticed a lack of diversity (within effective altruism) on lines such as age, career, lifestyle, socioeconomic class, level and type of education, etc. He notes everyone else might feel crowded out by some perceived mono-culture, and while like any community effective altruism might tend toward this failure mode by default, it&apos;s in everyone&apos;s interest to go beyond typical thinking in brainstorming new ways to welcome others.<br><br><span> </span>On some object-level issues Mr. Kuhn mentioned, debate broke out among commentators. Despite trying to quell or improve the quality of this debate as a moderator, Mr. Kuhn feels it degraded into acrimony, vitriol, and strawmanning. Indeed, some commentators expressed they might leave effective altruism behind entirely. He felt this fiasco discouraged him more than any explicit counter-argument that trying to build and hold together effective altruism as a singular community isn&apos;t worth it if there will be so much collateral damage to the movement and its adherents. Several dozen people appeared to agree with Mr. Kuhn&apos;s newfound pessimism, or at least they didn&apos;t disagree with it. I, on the other hand, strongly disagree. While I acknowledge effective altruism needs to look at itself, and thus strong optimism about its self-awareness may not be justified, I don&apos;t believe a doom-and-gloom outlook is justified either.<br><br>Below is my open letter to Ben Kuhn and effective altruism as a whole to not give up on the value of building community. It&apos;s been edited for brevity, and clarity. Note that I never originally discussed the object-level issues in debates which originally so discouraged Mr. Kuhn. I encourage you not to make your discussion of this open letter about that, as the pattern of falling into a debates in which we misrepresent each other is what urged this letter in the first place.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span>Hello&#xA0;<span>Ben</span></span><span>. I hope you&apos;re doing well. I&apos;m Evan Gaensbauer.</span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span>I</span><span> read your last blog post, and all the comments on it. It appears no more than five anonymous persons participated in these fights online you cited. Posting anonymously allows people to feel they can write comments online they otherwise wouldn&apos;t feel comfortable with.They may be expressing more extreme views than what they really hold in their everyday thoughts. Anyway, five anonymous people having a debate about one or two issues doesn&apos;t strike me as sufficient to stop trying to make the effective altruism community more welcoming. Maybe no one individual should try so hard to hold people together if it strains their willpower and capacity to handle stress. However, I don&apos;t think that&apos;s sufficient for all of us to stop trying, though. I don&apos;t want to get rid of having one thing called &quot;the EA community&quot;. </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Effective altruism could become a movement of multiple communities, in which people of different political stripes or cluster-groups stick to their own. However, I&apos;d be fine with that if everyone kept donating money to effective charities, discussed and debated what those were, while still largely agreeing with one another, and kept thinking about how they can lead lifestyles and careers which are more effectively altruistic. I think such a movement could be welcoming, as multiple communities, because when effective altruism stops being correlated with particular ideologies, it stops being an ideology itself, and people would think of it as common-sense. It stops being perceived as politics, and starts being perceived as the sensible mechanics of doing good. That would be great news.</span></p>\n<div>\n<p><span><span> </span> <span> </span></span>Five people debating in the comments on one blog? I bet, collectively, they spent less than five person-hours writing those comments. I can scarcely think of one individual in this community who hasn&apos;t spent dozens, if not hundreds, of hours learning more about effective altruism, ethics, and research to inform not just where they donate, but how to inject more altruism into lots of parts of their lives. That effort trumps political debate. For whatever reason, five people were drawn to one blog time and again over the course of five days, likely there for only minutes at a time, to have a debate which was refereed, rather than just deleted. These people weren&apos;t calling each other names, or swearing, or launching ad hominem attacks all the time. That&apos;s what I think of as &quot;calm&quot; and &quot;level-headed&quot;. If you&apos;re in a bubble of people like that, even the most pessimistic people drawn to flame wars are more polite to one another than people I&apos;ve witnessed arguing my entire life.</p>\n<p><span> </span>We can&apos;t measure how much &quot;acrimony&quot; is captured in these comments. Maybe these people went on with their days, slightly grumpy, but in a regular mood within the hour. Maybe not. We don&apos;t know, though, and I don&apos;t think that&apos;s substantial enough evidence to become so pessimistic. Surely someone was effected, as one or two commentators wrote they might leave effective altruism if it continues to be like this. If having these conversations in person isn&apos;t an option because these anonymous commentators aren&apos;t in the Bay Area, you or I could reach out personally, let them know an email or something, and chat with them on Skype. That takes the misinterpretation and misplaced vitriol out of Internet debates. Based on how dearly they consider their relationship with effective altruism, I imagine they&apos;re people we could trust personally and in discussion, and people we might already know.</p>\n<p><span> <span> </span></span>If people feel scared, threatened, and vulnerable, those are things which make effective altruism unwelcoming, but can be addressed.</p>\n<p>I have made hundreds of friends on Facebook through effective altruism. &quot;Facebook friends&quot; often means little, but what I mean is there are hundreds of individuals, strangers and acquaintances and role models, who want me to be part of their professional and personal networks, because they assume through association effective altruism makes us kindred spirits. I&apos;ve met dozens of them in person. We lean on each other for emotional and moral support. Nobody is taking for granted the contributions of others. I&apos;m honored people like yourself I aspire in my methods of thought and care to become more like treat me no less well than anyone else.</p>\n<p><span> </span>While there is a share of effective altruists who feel unwelcome, I think people can and do make enough friends and allies in this movement to keep their ear to the ground about effective altruism news. Never have I ever encountered someone who didn&apos;t feel welcomed by effective altruism, but then also abandoned their drive to do good works, or a desire for clearer thinking in assessing their own choices. Even if someone stops publicly affiliating with &quot;effective altruism&quot; the movement, if they still donate to effective charities, if they still make ethical lifestyle choices like vegetarianism or something else as it suits their values, then I think effective altruism has done it&apos;s job. In engaging the public, effective altruism&apos;s mission is use its passion to inspire confidence in others to take substantially effective action, not just symbolically signal association with a special group. Even if someone exits effective altruism, they can still donate to effective charities, they can still spread messages professionally and privately about quantifying efforts and evidence-based interventions, and they can still advocate. A piece of effective altruism can be left with them in all the good works they do for the rest of their lives.</p>\n<p><span> <span> </span></span>I&apos;m not saying we should be totally optimistic about making effective altruism more welcoming. Effective altruism will never be perfect, and more struggles may come. I just mean five commentators this one week among the thousands of people becoming involved with effective altruism doesn&apos;t seem enough evidence to justify massive pessimism either. Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Evan Gaensbauer</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<hr>\n</div>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p><em>When I wrote:<br></em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>I&apos;m honored people like yourself I aspire in my methods of thought and care to become more like treat me no less well than anyone else.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span><span><em>this extends to anyone now reading this as much as it does Ben Kuhn.

That&apos;s why I think of these people as role models I can aspire to be like, not great men on a pedestal who have a status I can never achieve. I reflected on how personal friends I knew before getting involved with effective altruism, like Joey Savoie and Xio Kikauka, who founded Charity Science, or others who have donated thousands of dollars, like Andrew McKnight, of volunteered dozens of hours, like Eric Chisholm and Max Carpendale, should be my role models, too. </em></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><em></em></span></span><em><span> </span>Even very different people who I sense sincerely wish to make an effort, even if they can&apos;t always make the most effort, are kindred spirits in challenging themselves to do good even when they must make great effort to change their minds and actions to do so.

We&apos;re not close to failing in that regard to give up hope, so let&apos;s keep trying.</em></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "t3wFMBPR3LJwntHwk", "title": "Impact Purchase: Round 2", "postedAt": "2015-05-21T20:07:40.495Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Round 2 of the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://impactpurchase.org/\">impact purchase</a>&#xA0;is over.

As usual, this is a very rough and quick evaluation. No one involved with EA Melbourne has endorsed this as an account of their impact, and we expect that this evaluation would change significantly if we put in more time.</p>\n<h2>Evaluation of Founding EA Melbourne</h2>\n<p>We think the EA community in Melbourne has had a significant impact, with many people either making large donations or working on EA projects full time who would not have done so otherwise. We&apos;re evaluating this impact at around $100k / year, even considering only donations+replacement costs at EA organizations, which we expect to significantly understate the real impact.</p>\n<p>Many of these effects seem likely to be long-lasting, and we feel comfortable extending the benefits over at least 5 years.</p>\n<p>It is much harder to attribute these impacts to the formal EA Melbourne group, as compared to the informal community, the LW group, TLYCS, the actions of individual EA&apos;s in Melbourne, and so on. We had a few conversations to try to get a better sense of this allocation of responsibility. In the end we certainly didn&apos;t get a confident answer, but we got a vague intuitive feeling for the situation.</p>\n<p>Based on this impression, we allocated 10% of the responsibility to the formal organization of EA Melbourne. Interpreted narrowly we think this is more likely to be an overestimate than an underestimate.</p>\n<p>But we think that there are other benefits from EA Melbourne that can justify this estimate, and which will tend to be on the same scale as the direct effect. For example, the broader EA community in Melbourne clearly had a positive effect; but EA Melbourne looks like it will have a big impact building and growing a similar community in the future. And to the extent that other organized communities and the online presence of EA played a big role, it seems that EA Melbourne has made similar contributions back to the broader EA community.</p>\n<p>Our estimates concern the impact of EA Melbourne during its first 6 months. We assumed that Brayden and Ryan were almost entirely responsible for the founding of EA Melbourne. People other than Brayden and Ryan were clearly involved with the operation of EA Melbourne over this period. Conversely, EA Melbourne continued to exist after this initial period and it seems likely that its founding will continue to have positive impacts going forward beyond those already mentioned. In the end we called this a wash.</p>\n<p>Overall, we evaluated EA Melbourne at $70k in stimulated EA donations. In this round, we purchased impact at a rate of one dollar per &#xA0;dollar of stimulated EA donations, for a total price of $70k. This was about half of the price paid in the previous round.</p>\n<h2>Some notes on our evaluations:</h2>\n<p>We are more concerned with future generations than with current suffering, and have valued &quot;dollars moved to GiveWell top charities&quot; several times lower than &quot;EA donations stimulated.&quot; We welcome submissions with both kinds of benefits, but wanted to explain why they have not been purchased so far. We do believe that donations to GiveWell&apos;s top charities have positive direct and indirect effects on the future, and we also value reductions in current suffering. But these benefits seem substantially smaller than the direct and indirect benefits of more focused interventions, or of organic growth of the EA movement that generates additional donations.</p>\n<p>Some submissions involved impacts that have not yet materialized, for example positive effects on people who haven&apos;t yet done anything differently as a result, but who may do something differently in the future. For the most part, we have held off on purchasing these.</p>\n<p>We continue to evaluate influencing people at a discount based on an uncertain allocation of responsibility.

It&#x2019;s not always obvious from the outside how approachable many people and organizations in EA are, or what&#xA0;problems are waiting for solutions. &#xA0;But once you have that knowledge, it&#x2019;s really hard to remember what it was like when you didn&#x2019;t, which makes it hard to figure out what to do about the problem.</p>\n<p>This is my attempt to address that. &#xA0;Below I have listed info&#xA0;on the major EA organizations, with emphasis on what problems they are interested in, how to learn more about them, and what kind of contact they encourage. &#xA0; I would be surprised if this was enough to enable someone to go from 0-to-implementation on its own, but my hope is that it will provide some scaffolding&#xA0;that speeds up the process of learning the rest of it.</p>\n<p>Institutions: did I get something about you wrong? &#xA0;Miss you entirely? &#xA0;Please let me know and I will update, I want this to be as accurate as possible.</p>\n<h3>General/Misc</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>&#xA0;&#x2018;s most public work focuses on identifying the best charities working on&#xA0;third world poverty, but they have spun off a subgroup called the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/\">Open Philanthropy Project</a>. &#xA0;OPP investigates not just specific interventions, but causes, trying to determine which areas have the crucial combination of importance, tractability, and neglected-ness. &#xA0;The good news is that you can read about it in detail on their blog. &#xA0;The bad news is that you can read about a great many&#xA0;things in a great deal of detail on their blog, so&#xA0;if you&#x2019;re looking for a particular thing it can be hard to find. &#xA0;To that end, here&#x2019;s are some links to get you started \n<ul>\n<li>List of OPP&#x2019;s&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/labs/causes\">cause investigations</a>&#xA0;(<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NpcmVO3DnOmtKRbYGkNbR0NTitclT5mwGBwBEwYlKHg/edit#gid=0\">summary spreadsheet</a>).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/05/14/the-importance-of-committing-to-causes/comment-page-1/\">The Importance of Committing to Causes</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/04/18/challenges-of-passive-funding/\">Active vs. Passive Funding</a>: &#xA0;Together these two convey a lot about how OPP is approaching unknown unknowns.</li>\n<li>How GiveWell is (was) approaching&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/10/10/deep-investigations-of-new-causes/\">deep dives on new causes</a>&#xA0;(may be out of date).</li>\n<li>GiveWell&#x2019;s reports on&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs\">specific interventions</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">Centre for Effective Altruism</a>&#xA0;has spun off or collaborated with a number of important projects in EA: Giving What We Can, 80,000 hours, Animal Charity Evaluators, Life You Can Save, Global Philanthropy Project, EA Ventures&#x2026; &#xA0;all of which I have included in this document. &#xA0; Their&#xA0;<a href=\"https://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/homepage/special-projects/\">current plan</a>&#xA0;appears to be that, plus some outreach.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.eaventures.org/\">EA Ventures</a>&#xA0;is a new agency dedicated to matching up&#xA0;people with EA projects, people with money, and people with relevant skills. &#xA0;EAV&#x2019;s official areas of interest are the effective altruism trinity: global poverty, animal suffering, and existential risk, and a lot of the things on the list&#xA0;of&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/fr/a_call_for_ideas_ea_ventures/\">community suggestions</a>&#xA0;they solicited fall into those&#xA0;three +&#xA0;meta-EA work. &#xA0; And yet, the list is almost 10 pages long. &#xA0;Even within those spaces (one of which the rest of the world already looks at pretty closely), there are a lot of ideas. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m also heartened to see &#x201C;mental welfare&#x201D;

&#xA0;FHI is attempting to get ahead of that. &#xA0;They&#x2019;re concerned about malicious AI, but also the more mundane potential problems&#xA0;like technology induced systemic unemployment and Big Brother. &#xA0; &#xA0;You can read about their research&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/research/research-areas/\">here</a>. &#xA0;They appear to be operating on academic-style collaboration rules, which mean you have to talk to the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/about/staff/\">individual person</a>&#xA0;you want to work with.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/\">Global Priorities Project</a>&#xA0;is a collaboration between FHI and CEA, and its goal is to bring their academic work to governments and industry. &#xA0; It focuses specifically on prioritization of competing proposals, including research into how to prioritize when there are so very many unknowns. &#xA0;You can read about their research&#xA0;<a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/our-work/\">here</a>. &#xA0;They have an&#xA0;<a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/\">active interest</a>&#xA0;in collaboration or helping people (especially government and industry) use their results.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://cser.org/\">Center for Study of Existential Risk</a>&#xA0;(Cambridge). &#xA0;Did you expect Cambridge to let Oxford have something they didn&#x2019;t?

Also very roughly drafted. <a href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/log-normal-lamentations/\">Cross</a>]</p>\n<p>Normally, things are distributed normally. Human talents may turn out to be one of these things. Some people are lucky enough to find themselves on the right side of these distributions &#x2013; smarter than average, better at school, more conscientious, whatever. To them go many spoils &#x2013; probably more so now than at any time before, thanks to the information economy.</p>\n<p>There&#x2019;s a common story told about a hotshot student at school whose ego crashes to earth when they go to university and find themselves among a group all as special as they thought they were. The reality might be worse: many of the groups the smart or studious segregate into (physics professors, Harvard undergraduates, doctors) have threshold (or near threshold)-like effects: only those with straight A&#x2019;s, only those with IQs &gt; X, etc. need apply. This introduces a positive skew to the population: most (and the median) are below the average, brought up by a long tail of the (even more) exceptional. Instead of comforting ourselves at looking at the entire population to which we compare favorably, most of us will look around our peer group and find ourselves in the middle, and having to look a long way up to the best.&#xA0;<a title=\"As further bad news, there may be progression of &#x2018;tiers&#x2019; which are progressively more selective, somewhat akin to stacked band-pass filters: even if you were the best maths student at your school, then the best at university, you may still find yourself plonked around median in a positive-skewed population of maths professors &#x2013; and if you were an exceptional maths professor, you might find yourself plonked around median in the population of fields medalists. And so on (especially &#x2013; see infra &#x2013; if the underlying distribution is something scale-free).\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/log-normal-lamentations/#note-241-1\"><span>1</span></a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://gregoryjlewisdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/normal.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Yet part of growing up is recognizing there will inevitably be people better than you are &#x2013; the more able may be able to buy their egos time, but no more. But that needn&#x2019;t be so bad: in several fields (such as medicine) it can be genuinely hard to judge &#x2018;betterness&#x2019;, and so harder to find exemplars to illuminate your relative mediocrity. Often there are a variety of dimensions to being &#x2018;better&#x2019; at something: although I don&#x2019;t need to try too hard to find doctors who are better at some aspect of medicine than I (more knowledgeable, kinder, more skilled in communication etc.) it is mercifully rare to find doctors who are better than me in all respects. And often the tails are thin: if you&#x2019;re around 1 standard deviation above the mean, people many times further from the average than you are will still be extraordinarily rare, even if you had a good stick to compare them to yourself.</p>\n<h1>Look at our thick-tailed works, ye average, and despair!&#xA0;<a title=\"I wonder how much this post is a monument to the grasping vaingloriousness of my character&#x2026;\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/log-normal-lamentations/#note-241-2\"><span>2</span></a></h1>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>One nice thing about the EA community is that they tend to be an exceptionally able bunch: I remember being in an &#x2018;intern house&#x2019; that housed the guy who came top in philosophy at Cambridge, the guy who came top in philosophy at Yale, and the guy who came top in philosophy at Princeton &#x2013; and although that isn&#x2019;t a standard sample, we seem to be drawn disproportionately not only from those who went to elite universities, but those who did&#xA0;<em>extremely well</em>&#xA0;at elite universities.&#xA0;<a title=\"Pace: academic performance is not the only (nor the best) measure of ability. But it is a measure, and a fairly germane one for the fairly young population &#x2018;in&#x2019; EA.\" href=\"http://www.thepolemicalmedic.com/log-normal-lamentations/#note-241-3\"><span>3</span></a>&#xA0;This sets the bar very high.</p>\n<p>Many of the &#x2018;high impact&#x2019; activities these high achieving people go into (or aspire to go into) are more extreme than normal(ly distributed): log-normal commonly, but it may often be Pareto. The distribution of income or outcomes from entrepreneurial ventures (and therefore upper-bounds on what can be &#x2018;earned to give&#x2019;), the distribution of papers or citations in academia, the impact of direct projects, and (more tenuously) degree of connectivity or importance in social networks or movements would all be examples: a few superstars and &#x2018;big winners&#x2019;, but&#xA0;<em>orders of magnitude</em>&#xA0;smaller returns for the rest.</p>\n<p>Insofar as I have &#x2018;EA career path&#x2019;, mine is earning to give: if I were trying to feel good about the good I was doing, my first port of call would be my donations. In sum, I&#x2019;ve given quite a lot to charity &#x2013; ~&#xA3;15,000 and counting &#x2013; which I&#x2019;m proud of. Yet I&#x2019;m no banker (or algo-trader) &#x2013; those who are really good (or lucky, or both) can end up out of university with higher&#xA0;<em>starting</em>&#xA0;salaries than my&#xA0;<em>peak</em>&#xA0;expected salary, and so can give away more than ten times more than I will be able to. I know several of these people, and the running tally of each of their donations is often around ten times my own. If they or others become even more successful in finance, or very rich starting a company, there might be several more orders of magnitude between their giving and mine. My contributions may be little more than a rounding error to their work.</p>\n<h1>A shattered visage</h1>\n<p>Earning to give is&#xA0;<em>kinder&#xA0;</em>to the relatively minor players than other &#x2018;fields&#x2019; of EA activity, as even though Bob&#x2019;s or Ellie&#x2019;s donations are far larger, they do not overdetermine my own: that their donations dewormed 1000x children does not make the 1x I dewormed any less valuable. It is unclear whether this applies to other &#x2018;fields&apos;: Suppose I became a researcher working on a malaria vaccine, but this vaccine is discovered by Sally the super scientist and her research group across the world. Suppose also that Sally&#x2019;s discovery was independent of my own work. Although it might have been&#xA0;<em>ex ante</em>extremely valuable for me to work on malaria, its value is vitiated when Sally makes her breakthrough, in the same way a lottery ticket loses value after the draw.</p>\n<p>So there are a few ways an Effective Altruist mindset can depress our egos:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is generally a very able and high achieving group of people, setting the &#x2018;average&#x2019; pretty high.</li>\n<li>&#x2018;Effective Altruist&#x2019; fields tend to be heavy-tailed, so that being merely &#x2018;average&#x2019; (for EAs!) in something like earning to give mean having a&#xA0;<em>much</em>&#xA0;smaller impact when compared to one of the (relatively common) superstars.</li>\n<li>(Our keenness for quantification makes us particularly inclined towards and able to make these sorts of comparative judgements, ditto the penchant for taking things to be commensurate).</li>\n<li>Many of these fields have &#x2018;lottery-like&#x2019; characteristics where<em>&#xA0;ex ante</em>&#xA0;and<em>&#xA0;ex post</em>value diverge greatly. &#x2018;Taking a shot&#x2019; at being an academic or entrepreneur or politician or leading journalist may be a good bet<em>&#xA0;ex ante</em>&#xA0;for an EA because the upside is so high even if their chances of success remain low (albeit better than the standard reference class). But if the median outcome is failure, the majority who will fail might find the fact it was a good idea<em>&#xA0;ex ante</em>&#xA0;of scant consolation &#x2013; rewards (and most of the world generally) run&#xA0;<em>ex post facto.</em></li>\n</ol>\n<h1>What remains besides</h1>\n<p>I don&#x2019;t haven&#x2019;t found a ready &#x2018;solution&#x2019; for these problems, and I&#x2019;d guess there isn&#x2019;t one to be found. We should be sceptical of ideological panaceas that can do no wrong and everything right, and EA is no exception: we should expect it to have&#xA0;<em>some</em>&#xA0;costs, and perhaps this is one of them. If so, better to accept it rather than defend the implausibly defensible.</p>\n<p>In the same way I could console myself, on confronting a generally better doctor: &#x201C;Sure, they are better at A, and B, and C, &#x2026; and Y, but I&#x2019;m better at Z!&#x201D;, one could do the same with regards to the axes one&#x2019;s &#x2018;EA work&#x2019;. &#x201C;Sure, Ellie the entrepreneur has given hundreds of times more money to charity, but what&#x2019;s she like at self-flagellating blog posts, huh?&#x201D; There&#x2019;s an incentive to diversify as (combinatorically) it will be less frequent to find someone who strictly dominates you, and although we want to compare across diverse fields, doing so remains difficult. Pablo Stafforini has mentioned elsewhere whether EAs should be &#x2018;specialising&#x2019; more instead of spreading their energies over disparate fields: perhaps this makes that less surprising.&#xA0;<a title=\"Although there are other more benign possibilities, given diminishing marginal returns and the lack of people available.

I&#x2019;ve tried being vegan in the past, but I&#x2019;ve never managed to keep it up for more than a few months - I always end up slipping out of it when it becomes too inconvenient (or, to be honest, when I just really want some cheese...)</p>\n<p>I think there&#x2019;s a good chance I should be a vegan, given my values and beliefs, and I feel kind of uncomfortable about the fact that I eat dairy and eggs.

I tried to break it up into key sub-sections and summarise my main uncertainties at the end of each section so that it&#x2019;s fairly skim-able.)</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>Considerations in favour of being vegan</h1>\n<h2><strong>1. The impact of my diet on animal suffering</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>My main motivation for being vegan is that I care about animals, I believe they suffer, and I specifically believe that the way the meat/dairy/egg industry treats animals generally causes them to suffer a lot.</strong> I&#x2019;m assuming that most people here will broadly agree with me on these points, so I&#x2019;m not going to defend them here.</p>\n<p>There&#x2019;s a question of how my personal consumption habits affect the industry - by eating eggs and milk, to what extent am I directly causing animals in farms to suffer? If I were to stop eating eggs and milk, would doing so cause fewer animals to suffer? This gets us into some slightly complicated questions about the elasticity of demand in the dairy and egg industries.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>According to&#xA0;<a href=\"http://global.oup.com/academic/product/compassion-by-the-pound-9780199551163?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;\">Compassion By The Pound</a> ( <a href=\"http://asp.okstate.edu/baileynorwood/misc1/Mexico/Compassion%20by%20the%20Pound%20%28Final%29.pdf\">pd</a>), for every egg you eat, you increase egg production by 0.91 - demand for eggs is highly elastic, which basically just means that my consumption habits can have a large effect on others&#x2019; consumption habits and broader production.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Demand for milk products is less elastic, but still significant - for every pound of milk you buy, you increase production by 0.56 pounds.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>So for every egg I give up, I reduce egg production by 0.91, and for every pound of milk I give up, I reduce milk production by 0.56 pounds.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So it seems that whether I eat eggs and milk or not clearly has some effect on egg and dairy production. In order to understand this in terms of impact on animal welfare, though - which is what I really care about - we also need to understand how bad the quality of life for those cows and hens is.</p>\n<p><strong>At a certain point, we can approximately say that me buying fewer eggs will mean that one less chicken ends up having a horrible life on a factory farm</strong> (I don&#x2019;t have the exact figures on this - I&#x2019;ve heard that 2 eggs = 5 days for a hen on a factory farm - but would be interested if anyone has numbers &amp; good evidence on this to hand). But what&#x2019;s really crucial here - and what I think a lot of people don&#x2019;t get intuitively - is that the alternative to that chicken being on a factory farm isn&#x2019;t living a nice free life in some beautiful pastures. The alternative is that chicken not existing at all. When we farm animals for meat and for their dairy products, we bring animals into existence that would not have existed otherwise. Really, then, the important question isn&#x2019;t, &#x201C;Are these animals suffering?&#x201D;, but &#x201C;Are these animals suffering so much that they would be better off never having existed?&#x201D;. This is a much more difficult question to answer, and ultimately involves a subjective judgement (as well as some messy ethical issues when you really get down to it, about whether it&#x2019;s really a good thing to have millions of chickens exist whose lives are just barely worth living...)</p>\n<p>Bailey Norwood, author of Compassion By the Pound, thinks that dairy cows have fairly decent lives: on a scale from -10 to 10, he places them at a 4. Egg-laying hens he&#x2019;s a bit more uncertain about: in a cage-free system, he thinks hens lives are worth living (2 for a market animal, 3 for a breeder animal), but in a cage system, their lives may well be incredibly negative (-8 for a market animal, though still 3 for a breeder animal.) However, Brian Tomasik <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/comments-on-compassion-by-the-pound/\">thinks these numbers are far too optimistic</a> - especially for chickens - and that Norwood fails to account for the pain of slaughter and the length of their lives. <strong>It seems pretty likely to me that the lives of egg-laying hens in factory farms in the US are significantly negative, but I&#x2019;m not certain of this.</strong></p>\n<p>Adding to the uncertainty is the fact that most of the considerations Norwood and Tomasik give are based on US factory farming conditions. I&#x2019;m in the UK, and European regulations on the treatment of farm animals seem to be stricter, suggesting that they probably suffer less.</p>\n<p>My very tentative conclusion based on all of this is that from a purely consequentialist perspective, there&#x2019;s probably a pretty clear argument for me to give up eggs - because demand is fairly elastic and egg-laying hens probably have pretty bad lives. The consequentialist argument against eating dairy is much less convincing since it seems plausible that dairy cows have lives that are worth living (though I find it pretty hard to believe this when I hear emotive stories about calves being taken away from their mothers at birth...). Also, since one cow produces a large amount of milk, the number of cows that have to suffer to produce the small amount of dairy products I currently consume is probably pretty small - I haven&#x2019;t worked out the numbers on this, though.</p>\n<p><strong>Main uncertainties here:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How bad are the lives of dairy cows and egg-laying hens in the EU - i.e. those that provide the milk &amp; eggs I&#x2019;m actually eating?</strong> If anyone has looked into this or knows of good sources of information I&#x2019;d really appreciate suggestions.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>2. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t want to be part of this&#x201D;</strong></h2>\n<p>Consequentialist considerations aren&#x2019;t the only thing motivating me. <strong>To be honest, a huge part of my motivation comes from a strong emotional sense of &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t like this, and I don&#x2019;t want to be part of it.&#x201D;</strong> The more I think and learn about the industry that produces my milk and eggs, the more uncomfortable and upset I feel about it, and the more I feel that I want to completely disassociate myself from it.</p>\n<p>I know this isn&#x2019;t exactly in line with the EA mentality of using reason and evidence to determine the ethical choices we make. But I also don&#x2019;t think we should completely ignore these kinds of emotions, and I think it&#x2019;s ok to be motivated by them, as long as we&#x2019;re not being entirely driven by our feelings at the expense of other strong considerations.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2><strong>3. Signalling and encouraging others</strong></h2>\n<p>When I first tried being vegan, one of the key things that motivated and helped me was the fact that I was spending a lot of time around other vegans. <strong>By going vegan myself, therefore, there&#x2019;s some chance I&#x2019;ll encourage others to think more about their dietary choices and reduce their consumption of animal products</strong>. I&#x2019;m never going to be a militant vegan who tries to persuade everyone else she meets to go meat-free - it&#x2019;s just not my personality and I think it&#x2019;s unlikely to be effective - but I&#x2019;m happy to strike up non-confrontational conversations and discuss my reasons with people.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s unclear, though, whether being vegan really gives me much benefit here over being vegetarian. In fact, being vegan might even be worse because it seems to weird, and too unachievable for most people - whereas vegetarianism is something it&#x2019;s easier for most people to get on board with.</p>\n<p><strong>Main uncertainties here:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>To what extent will me being vegan lead others to consider their dietary choices more seriously compared to if I&#x2019;m just vegetarian?</strong> Could it even be worse, if I seem too &#x201C;weird&#x201D; or &#x201C;extreme&#x201D; for people to seriously identify with?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<h1>Considerations against being vegan</h1>\n<h2>1. Inconvenience, enjoyment, willpower</h2>\n<p><strong>The only real reason I have for not being vegan is that it&#x2019;s somewhat inconvenient, takes some willpower, and requires me to put a bit more effort into planning and preparing meals</strong>. I also enjoy eating animal products, so there&#x2019;s some cost there too. There are a few different things here, but I think they&#x2019;re broadly the same issue, so I&#x2019;m lumping them under the same heading.</p>\n<p>I won&#x2019;t go into lots of detail here (though happy to do so if people are interested), but being vegan has a few different costs to me in this area:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It makes it harder to eat out with other people, since many restaurants don&#x2019;t offer vegan options.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I tend to cook and eat meals with my housemates (who aren&#x2019;t vegan), which is a great way to save time and money, and also a nice sociable thing to do. Being vegan would make it a bit more difficult for me to do this, and I might end up eating alone more often.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Making sure I maintain a healthy vegan diet is likely to take more time and energy than being vegetarian - it requires more planning ahead, and probably more cooking (but not necessarily loads, and I&#x2019;m generally quite happy cooking.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Being vegan requires some willpower - I like eggs, cheese, ice cream etc. - and since most people around me aren&#x2019;t vegan, that means I&#x2019;m often offered or around these foods, so have to put effort into resisting them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I enjoy eating animal products and get some pleasure out of them.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of these are huge costs by any means, but they are costs. One argument that I hear from some vegans is that if you really care about animals, concerns about &#x201C;inconvenience&#x201D; and &#x201C;enjoyment&#x201D; should really be trivial - what is a minor inconvenience to you compared to a life of suffering for a chicken? While I&#x2019;m somewhat sympathetic to this argument, I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s quite this simple. If, for example, the effect my diet has on animal suffering is really small or very uncertain, but costs me a lot of willpower and/or time that could be spent on other altruistic activities, the benefit might plausibly not be worth the cost.</p>\n<p>I broadly agree <a href=\"https://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2014/11/21/when-should-an-effective-altruist-be-vegetarian/\">with Katja Grace</a> that if one can use the time/energy/willpower etc. that one would spend being vegetarian/vegan more effectively towards other altruistic activities, then it probably makes sense not to be vegetarian/vegan. But in my personal case, I&#x2019;m really not sure that the costs of veganism are fungible in this way - perhaps just because they really are relatively small. But I haven&#x2019;t thought about this a lot, and it&#x2019;s possible that I could find some way to use the time and/or willpower I&#x2019;d expend being vegan in an even better way.</p>\n<p><strong>Main uncertainties here:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Is the willpower I&#x2019;d be using to sustain a vegan diet something that could be actually be transferred to other things?</strong> Is this a possibility I should consider more seriously?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Health?</h2>\n<p>Though many people worry about the health risks of cutting out animal products, <strong>I actually think that on balance I&#x2019;m probably healthier vegan</strong>. The healthiest components of my diet are mostly vegan anyway - most of my meals are some combination of vegetables, beans/pulses, tofu, and carbs. Where animal products come in is mostly unnecessary additions - some cheese on top of my pasta, some cheese in a sandwich that could easily be replaced by something else, a splash of milk in my tea, eggs for brunch on the weekend every now and then, and the odd baked good. In most of these cases, the animal product could either be cut out or replaced with something healthier - I&#x2019;d just have pasta without cheese, I&#x2019;d put more avocado in my sandwich. When I&#x2019;m vegan, it gives me a great excuse not to eat various unhealthy things I tend to regret later anyway - cake, chocolate, cookies etc.</p>\n<p>Of course, I need to make sure I get the right supplements and get a balanced diet - but I enjoy cooking, and naturally enjoy experimenting with variations on my diet for health, so I don&#x2019;t imagine this would be too difficult. I could also totally be missing something really important here, so I&#x2019;d love to hear if people think I&#x2019;m not taking this consideration seriously enough.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>95% vegan?</h1>\n<p>I don&#x2019;t think it necessarily have to be an all-or-nothing decision between either being fully vegan or not at all. I could probably get most of the benefits of being vegan by cutting out most of the animal products I eat and allowing myself these things occasionally when it&#x2019;s particularly inconvenient or I have particularly low willpower for some good reason.</p>\n<p>In theory this seems like it could work, but my main concern is that it&#x2019;s much easier to stick to a very simple rule - &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a vegan&#x201D; - than it is to stick to a vaguer one - &#x201C;I&#x2019;m 95% vegan.&#x201D; Without clear rules for when the &#x201C;exceptional&#x201D; cases occur, it&#x2019;s easy to just end up slipping into eating more and more animal products. It&#x2019;s also harder to develop negative associations around animal products - which might help with sustaining motivation - if you&#x2019;re eating them every now and then. I&#x2019;ve tried doing something like this in the past - just eating dairy and eggs &#x201C;occasionally&#x201D;, and found that my definition &#x201C;occasionally&#x201D; just becomes more and more frequent...</p>\n<p>One way to get around this might be to have very strict rules for when the 5% applies. For example, I&#x2019;ve considered having the strict rule of being vegan in everything I buy and cook myself but allowing myself to eat animal products when I go out. My main concern with this still is that it&#x2019;s easy to let those rules slip, or just to develop a stronger taste for eating those things if you&#x2019;re still having them semi-regularly. Perhaps one way to get around this would be to have regular &#x201C;check-in times&#x201D; when you reassess whether you&#x2019;ve been sticking to the rules you laid out, and make any tweaks or recommit to what you originally planned. Of course, all of this takes some time and energy, but it could well be worth it. Publicly committing to these rules, or telling a few other people about them, might also help me to ensure I stick to them.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;d be particularly interested in hearing from others who do something like this - who are broadly vegetarian/vegan, but have strict rules for when exceptions can be made. What cases do your rules apply to? And how easy do you find it to stick to those rules?</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>Overall...</h1>\n<p>I&#x2019;m still pretty uncertain, and I&#x2019;d love others&#x2019; thoughts. Essentially, I think that the costs to me of being vegan in terms of willpower/inconvenience etc. are sufficiently low that I could easily do it if I were pretty convinced that the positive consequences were pretty large - but they&#x2019;re high enough that it&#x2019;s not totally easy for me to do it otherwise. I think the main things that would help me get clearer on this would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>If it turns out that I&#x2019;m substantially underestimating the consequentialist benefits of me giving up milk and eggs</strong> - i.e. it makes much more difference, or the difference it makes, is much more certain than I think.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>If it turns out there are other substantial benefits of me being vegan that I&#x2019;m missing</strong>, or I&#x2019;m underweighting other benefits like e.g. signalling benefits</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br> At the moment, my best guess is that I should try doing something like &#x201C;95% vegan&#x201D; (in reality probably an even higher percentage), but setting some very strict, clearly defined rules for exceptions.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Jess_Whittlestone"}}, {"_id": "zn53hrbQBfNngo4f3", "title": "Meetup : 2015 EA Survey Deep Dive and General Discussion", "postedAt": "2015-05-15T05:34:22.446Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/2t\">2015 EA Survey Deep Dive and General Discussion</a></h2>\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHEN:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>24 May 2015 02:00:00PM (-0700)</span><br>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHERE:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>San Francisco</span>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .meta -->\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t    <div><p>On Sunday, 24 May at 9pm UTC (2pm Pacific, 5pm Eastern, 10pm London), .impact will be doing a brainstorming meeting for the 2015 EA Survey.

Although I still agree with its points, I would write a somewhat different article today, in framing and substance.</p>\n<p>On the framing, this article uses effective interventions to relieve global poverty as the main example of an idea one might to bring attention to. At the time this seemed the canonical central example for the effective altruism community, who were a good fraction of my audience. Even then I guessed it was not the most important idea to draw attention to, and I have become more confident since. Of course all of the arguments still apply to effective poverty interventions; I just wouldn't lend them so much implicit endorsement.</p>\n<p>On the substance, I omitted an important consideration: that larger movements come with increased overhead costs for communication and coordination within the movements. Combined with diminishing returns from effort within an area, this reduces the value of making a movement very large: doubling the size might be substantially less than doubling the value. Moreover if one realizes that different people have different amounts to contribute to work on a given problem, the effect is that the value of bringing different types of people in varies significantly. The ideal for a given community might be to include as many as possible of the people who are very well placed to contribute, and not so many people beyond that so as not to impede coordination between that core. For some ideas or problems that might in practice mean quite a small community; for others a large one. The central example of global poverty made this omission less salient since it benefits from more supporters even when large.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I think the original article contains useful ideas which I continue to make use of in my own thinking. I hope it remains useful to others.</p>\n<p><em>Owen Cotton-Barratt, November 2017</em></p>\n<h2><strong>Executive Summary</strong></h2>\n<p>Movement growth may be very important for young social movements. It\u2019s obvious that movement building cannot always be better than direct work, but knowing how to compare them presents a challenge.</p>\n<p>In this article I introduce and explore a model of movement growth which tracks individuals\u2019 awareness of and inclination towards the movement. I aim to understand when movement building activities are better or worse than direct work, and apply the model to give my views on movement growth in the effective altruist and related communities.</p>\n<h3><strong>Part 1: Theory</strong></h3>\n<p>In the first half of this paper I introduce a model for thinking about movement growth, and terminology to refer to critical concepts. We model individuals as having varying levels of <em>awareness</em> about the movement, and varying <em>inclinations</em> towards it. We assume that these two characteristics can represent the major drivers of interaction with the movement. We explore the consequences of this Awareness/Inclination Model (AIM), particularly looking at the long-term counterfactual effects of direct work compared to <em>\u2018publicity\u2019</em>, which aims at increasing awareness of the movement, and <em>\u2018advocacy\u2019</em>, which aims at improving inclinations towards the movement. This involves analyzing different possible long-term trajectories the movement may be on.</p>\n<p>If we accept the model, this has some general implications:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For early-stage movements, the effects on movement growth are a key consideration in deciding between different activities. For relatively mature movements, direct work is usually better than movement growth.</li>\n<li>It is more important to focus on increasing awareness than improving inclination, if:\n<ul>\n<li>the movement has a natural maximum size that we cannot change; or</li>\n<li>essentially everyone will join the movement after they know enough about it; or</li>\n<li>direct work earlier is much more important than direct work later; or</li>\n<li>it is very hard to change inclination relative to awareness.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Otherwise improving inclination may often be better than increasing awareness (this is sensitive to beliefs about some parameters).</li>\n<li>It is particularly key to avoid being controversial and focus on improving inclination rather than increasing awareness, if:\n<ul>\n<li>the views of people around them have a significant effect on the inclinations of people towards the movement; or</li>\n<li>the movement might plateau at a wide range of sizes, depending on how well-perceived it is; or</li>\n<li>building political consensus will be useful for the direct work.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Part 2: Application</strong></h3>\n<p>In the second half of the paper, I apply the conceptual tools developed in Part 1 to answer questions about how to find the best work for the young effective altruism movement and related areas. The conclusions here are not certain, but represent my informed best judgement. Some of them are driven purely by qualitative considerations, and some are based in part on numerical estimates.</p>\n<p>My conclusions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Getting movement growth right is extremely important for effective altruism. Which activities to pursue should perhaps be governed even more by their effects on movement growth than by their direct effects.</li>\n<li>Increasing awareness of the movement is important, but increasing positive inclination is at least comparably important. Therefore we should generally:\n<ul>\n<li>prefer <em>advocacy</em> to <em>publicity</em>;</li>\n<li>strive to take acts which are seen as good by societal standards as well as for the movement;</li>\n<li>avoid hostility or needless controversy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Direct work has a very important role to play in movement building. It is likely to increase positive inclination, by:\n<ul>\n<li>Demonstrating commitment, and showing that the people engaged in the movement think the work is valuable;</li>\n<li>Increasing the credibility of the area by demonstrating that there is productive and valuable direct work that can be done.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Within global poverty, work focusing on movement growth may be more effective than direct work for most people (at the margin today).</li>\n<li>Within areas that seem promising but do not have an established track record, direct work aimed at demonstrating that there are credible interventions may be one of the most effective forms of movement building.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Acknowledgements</em>: Thanks to Tom Ash, Daniel Dewey, Seb Farquhar, Michelle Hutchinson, Josh Jacobson, Toby Ord, and Kerry Vaughan for helpful conversations and comments.</p>\n<p><em>Read the full article <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/MovementGrowth.pdf\">here</a>.</em></p>\n", "user": {"username": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt"}}, {"_id": "TERTGRjggtF4FHLcX", "title": "Meetup : 'The most good you can do\"", "postedAt": "2015-05-14T16:49:56.581Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/2s\">&apos;The most good you can do&quot;</a></h2>\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHEN:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>31 May 2015 02:00:00PM (+0200)</span><br>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHERE:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>Utrecht</span>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .meta -->\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t    <div><p>We&apos;ll discuss Peter Singer&apos;s new book about effective altruism.

I give tips on how they can use dissociation to  put altruism on a more scalable&#xA0;basis. (<a href=\"http://claviger.net/dissociation-for-altruists.html\">Cross-posted from my blog.</a>)<br></em></p>\n<p>Books like Peter Singer&#x2019;s <em>The Life You Can Save</em> mostly  aim to break through people&#x2019;s compartmentalization to allow them a  glimpse of the real importance of problems like poverty. This is one of  the most common outreach strategies and it may also be the most widely  applicable one. Some of you, however, may be well aware of the  importance of the enterprise but are too sensitive to face the suffering  that the most effective interventions necessarily bring to&#xA0;mind.</p>\n<p>Repeatedly I&#x2019;ve heard that people think effective altruism is great,  but that they would become emotional wrecks if they allowed themselves  to care about more than the well-being of their closest friends,  Wikipedia, and <span>SETI</span>@home.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve been there. The suffering in the world is enormous, and all the  while even the suffering of a single chicken in industrial agriculture  is unfathomable to me. I watched a video of seals being flayed alive  once. For weeks I slipped through the world in a&#xA0;haze.</p>\n<p>However, when we want to donate time and money to alleviate this  suffering effectively, then we have to acknowledge it. My solution to  overcome this &#x201C;squeamishness&#x201D; has been to not &#x201C;feel about&#x201D; the things I  think about, a form of dissociation. It was more a decision for me than  something I had to train, but if it doesn&#x2019;t come easy to you, then I&#x2019;ve  collected some tips for you as well. (Peter Singer touches on this in  chapter 7, &#x201C;Is Love all We Need?,&#x201D; of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Most-Good-You-Can-Effective/dp/0300180276/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1431534189&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+most+good+you+can+do&amp;tag=s4charity-20\"><em>The Most Good You Can Do</em></a>.)</p>\n<h2>Permitting Yourself to&#xA0;Dissociate</h2>\n<p>When I still thought that it was virtuous to empathize emotionally, I did a version of <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/l30/on_caring/\">Nate Soares&#x2019;s experiment</a> where, time and time again, I invented an individual family to  represent the statistical victims of poverty and disease that I knew  about. Thus I tried to prove to myself that my brain was not a cold dead  place. I was overwhelmed and paralyzed with their suffering. I hadn&#x2019;t  even started to imagine the ten-fold suffering of ten families or the  ten million&#x2013;fold suffering of ten million families, yet my  &#x201C;care-o-meter,&#x201D; as Nate calls it, was maxed out already. As these  emotions preoccupied me and weighed me down, my productivity suffered  and it threatened to impact, among other things, my&#xA0;fundraising.</p>\n<p>Consequentialism saved me. Empathy doesn&#x2019;t have to take the form that  lets you break down sobbing and clawing the floor, or whatever it looks  like for you. In fact our recent advances in transport and  communication mean that we need a more advanced form of empathy too. <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/l30/on_caring/\">As Nate puts it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Prominent altruists aren&#x2019;t the people who have a larger care-o-meter, they&#x2019;re the people who have <em>learned not to trust their care-o-meters.</em> Our care-o-meters are broken. They don&#x2019;t work on large numbers. Nobody  has one capable of faithfully representing the scope of the world&#x2019;s  problems. But the fact that you can&#x2019;t <em>feel</em> the caring doesn&#x2019;t mean that you can&#x2019;t <em>do</em> the caring. &#x2026; You can still <em>act</em> like the world&#x2019;s problems are as big as they are. You can stop trusting  the internal feelings to guide your actions and switch over to  manual&#xA0;control.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The realization that there&#x2019;s nothing virtuous about having these  emotions, that all I was doing was trying to electrocute myself with a  broken voltmeter, freed me and allowed me to get stuff done&#xA0;again.</p>\n<p>Medical students have to learn that too. One of them <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/2aiyai/doctorssurgeons_of_reddit_are_you_squeamish/ciwai6t\">told themselves</a> &#x201C;if I don&#x2019;t dissociate myself from this patient&#x2019;s pain, then I will not  be able to take care of them the way I need to.&#x201D; Intellectualizing this  decision repeatedly in a small pep talk before each surgery helped them  shut it off, and only that way they were able to perform as highly as  possible. As Nate puts it&#xA0;again:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&#x2019;s a common trope that courage isn&#x2019;t about being fearless, it&#x2019;s about being afraid but <em>doing the right thing anyway.</em> In the same sense, caring about the world isn&#x2019;t about having a gut  feeling that corresponds to the amount of suffering in the world, it&#x2019;s  about <em>doing the right thing anyway.</em> Even without the feeling. [Especially without the&#xA0;feeling.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There may be other hurdles for you, as there were for&#xA0;me:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you&#x2019;re worried that your altruism may be selfishly motivated,  then that&#x2019;s just fine so long as it helps the beneficiaries as much as  differently motivated forms of altruism&#xA0;would.</li>\n<li>If you&#x2019;re worried that this supposed nonaltruistic motivation may be  less lasting than extreme poverty, then put some effort into getting  all your finances organized and then <a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/\">file a pledge</a>. A &#x201C;further&#x201D; pledge may even be less risky if you anticipate periods of low&#xA0;income.</li>\n<li>Finally, sabotage your supposed motivation. Today the selfish  motivation I used to suspect seems absurd to me. It ceased to apply at  some point, and my enthusiasm for <span>EA</span> was as great as ever. Q.e.d.,&#xA0;fscker!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And in case you&#x2019;re worried, I don&#x2019;t think that practicing  dissociation has impacted my social abilities in any way. On the  contrary, I&#x2019;ve become able to talk about things that used to be so  emotional I hardly dared to think about them&#xA0;before.</p>\n<h2>Dissociation&#xA0;Tips</h2>\n<p>For me, not feeling was mostly a choice, but there are some precautions I make anyway and some more tips I&#x2019;ve gleaned from&#xA0;MDs.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get the tools from the abstraction toolbox. It helps to think in  terms of DALYs and funding gaps when you read a statistic. That way you  can think about it without automatically imagining what it means for the  beings it&#xA0;describes.</li>\n<li>If it makes you feel safer, imagine, just once, a unit of suffering  that you can envision without going to pieces, like a nonfatal episode  of malaria, to understand what a sixth of a <span>DALY</span> means. Once you&#x2019;ve thus anchored the unit, you can stop thinking about  the thing itself altogether and only operate with the&#xA0;abstraction.</li>\n<li>Avoid images and videos unless you&#x2019;re sure you can dissociate sufficiently. Academic prose is&#xA0;safer.</li>\n<li>Don&#x2019;t visit the countries where you&#x2019;re helping. There is great value  in understanding the local conditions better to run better  interventions, but the top charities and GiveWell are doing that already  so you don&#x2019;t have&#xA0;to.</li>\n<li>Related to that, try not to get to know anyone you might be helping.  The decision to donate someplace and not someplace else may consign  some to death so others (and hopefully more) can live. It helps to not  know either to make better&#xA0;decisions.</li>\n<li>A common technique is to create a clear donation budget so that you  only have to think about these issues in depth once or a couple times  per&#xA0;year.</li>\n<li>Donating to a trust like GiveWell&#x2019;s or Giving What We Can&#x2019;s might also help increase the&#xA0;abstraction.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_-Rsy4xMONwJ:www.medscape.com/viewarticle/714098+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk\">Sara Cohen</a>, <span>MD</span>,  recommends distraction in addition to dissociation: &#x201C;When I started  feeling queasy, I did a simple trick: I counted to 10. Deep  breath,&#xA0;1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10.&#x201D;</li>\n<li>Another one of her strategies is to desensitize herself, which she  did in a controlled, low-risk fashion with videos. When you feel up for  it, you can try that too,&#xA0;carefully.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Sara Cohen concludes somewhat self-contradictorily that &#x201C;like my own  advisors, I can now assert that it&#x2019;s true that everyone eventually gets  over it. And if not, there&#x2019;s always radiology.&#x201D; There may be some  selection bias involved here (due to medical students who can&#x2019;t  dissociate sufficiently changing degrees), and many surgeons also  indicate that there are still certain procedures that they can&#x2019;t  perform. But even these surgeons have surely made great progress since  their first semesters of medical school, and the combination of  dissociation and avoidance that they practice works well for them and  can surely also work well for&#xA0;you.</p>\n<p>If you have any more of such tips to share, please do so in the  comments.

Whether they regard EA actions as an obligation or an opportunity? How they respond to the trolley problem? What kind of jobs they have?

To which organisation should one donate their money to, in order to do the most good for the global poor?

Thus, I propose we build an epic list of every relevant group at every top university and in the world in general.</span><br><br><span><a href=\"http://eaglobal.org/\">EA Global</a> provides some urgency to finish this task soon: marketing the event is an excuse to put up the EA Bat Signal for all of these groups and to get many of them involved. However, this list will also act as a communications backbone for an enormous amount of future projects.</span><br><br><span>I&#x2019;m not going to lie to you: building this list will be an arduous, tedious task. You will be researching groups on the Internet and then copy-pasting info on them into a Google Sheet.</span></p>\n<p><span>But once built, EA will have an incredibly effective communications platform.

Suppose that, thanks to a day&#x2019;s work by you, we&#x2019;re able to let 50 mailing lists (containing 1000s of people) know about EA Global. Then we screen a bunch of these people for potential EA-ness and then admit them to EA Global. Out of this bunch, let&#x2019;s say that we get only 1 new EA who becomes a Giving What We Can pledger - a measly conversion rate of less than 0.1%. (Note: I made this conversion rate up as one that could feasibly be far below the conversion rate we might actually get to avoid overselling the project. A less than 0.1% conversion rate would be terrible for most companies.)</span></p>\n<p><span>Today I emailed Giving What We Can&#x2019;s Michelle Hutchinson for the latest approximation of what adding an average new pledger is worth. Her reply was about $68,000. About how much good does $68,000 yield? (The numbers below are estimates from <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\">The Life You Can Save&#x2019;s Impact Calculator</a>, and are not to be taken too literally.)</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>20</strong> lives saved from malaria by AMF</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>261,538</strong> people provided with micronutrient fortification for one year by PHC</span></li>\n<li><span><strong>680,000</strong> children dewormed by DtW (more people than the population of Boston)&#xA0;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><br><span><strong>This is more bang for your buck than most EAs can hope for doing an entire year of earn-to-give.</strong> Imagine yourself remembering the day you saved 20 lives.

To do that I will use personal stories, as I did in <a href=\"/ea/9l/types_of_planners_and_plans_for_eas/\">my last post</a>.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Let us assume for the time being that you care about the far future a substantial amount. This is <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/834447989944893/\">a common trend</a> that many though not all EAs have converged to after a few years of involvement with the movement. We are assuming this to steel-man the case against the importance of the next 2 years. If what matters is over a 100 years into the future, which difference could 2015 to 2017 make?</p>\n<h3>Why what I do now, relatively, doesn&apos;t matter anymore</h3>\n<p>I believe the difference to be a lot. When I look back at the sequence of transformations that happened to me and that I caused after being a visiting fellow at the old version of MIRI, the birth of EA me, one event stands as more causally relevant than, quite likely, <em>all others put together</em>. Giving a short TED on Effective Altruism and Friendly AI. It mattered much. It didn&apos;t matter that much because it was good or not, or because it conveyed complex ideas to the general public - it didn&apos;t - or whichever other thing a more self-serving version of me might have wanted to pretend.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>It mattered because it happened soon, because it was the first, and because I nagged the TED organizers about getting someone to talk about EA at the TED global event (the event was framed by TED as a sort of pre-casting for the big TED global 2013). TED 2013 was the one to which Singer was invited. I don&apos;t know if there was a relation. <br>If &#xA0;I went to the same event, today, that would be a minor dent, and it hasn&apos;t been three years yet.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Fiction: Suppose now I continue my life striving to be a good, or even a very good EA, I do research on AGI, I talk to friends about charity, I even get, say, one very rich industrialist to give a lot of money to Givewell recommended charities in late 2023 at some point. It is quite likely that none of this will ever surpass the importance of making the movement grow bigger (and better) by that initial acceleration, that single one night silly kick-starter.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>The leveraging power you can still have</h2>\n<p>Now think about the world in which Toby Ord and Will MacAskill did not start Giving What We Can.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The world in which Bostrom did not publish Superintelligence, and therefore Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Steve Wozniak didn&apos;t turn to &quot;our side&quot; yet.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The EA movement is growing in number, in resources, in power, and in accessing the people in positions of power. You can still change the derivative of the growth curve so it grows faster, like they could have done in the joke below:&#xA0;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://frivolousendeavour.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/dark-ages.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>But not for long. Soon we will have exhausted all incredibly efficient derivative increasing opportunities. We will have only the efficient ones.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Self Improvement versus Effectivity</h2>\n<p>It is commonly held among EAs that self-improvement is the route to being a maximally powerful individual, which then means becoming a maximally causally powerful individual so you can do your Max altruistic good. A lot of people&apos;s time goes to self-improvement.</p>\n<p>Outreach and getting others to do work are neglected because of that, in my opinion. Working on self-improvement can be tremendously useful, but some people use it to enter a cocoon from which they believe they will emerge butterflies long later. They may even be right, but long later may be too late for their altruism.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Does not this argument hold, at any point in time, for the next two years?</h2>\n<p>Yes. Unless you are say, going to finish college in two years, or repaying a debt so you can work on the FAI team three years from now, or something very unusual, most of your power involves contacting the right people now, having ideas now, and getting people as good as you to join your cause now. &#xA0;</p>\n<p>Recently I watched a GWWC pledge event, where expected &#xA0;one million dollars were raised in future expected earnings. This was the result of a class on Altruism given to undergrads in Berkeley (hooray Ajea and Oliver by the way). You can probably get someone to teach a course on EA, or do it yourself now etc... and then all the consequences of those people turning into EAs now versus in five years, or for some people never, are on you.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>If it holds at any time, does it make sense?</h2>\n<p>Of course it does. What Singer did in 1972 has influenced us all more than anything he could do now. But he is alive now, he can&apos;t change the past, and he is doing <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Most-Good-You-Can/dp/0300180276\">his best</a> with the next two years.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The same is true of you now. In fact, if you have a budget of resources to allocate to effective altruism, I suggest you go all in during the next two years (or one year, if you like moving fast). Your time will never be worth the same amount of Altruistic Utilons after that. For some of us, I believe that there will be a crossover point, a point at which your actions are mattering less than how much you want to dedicate effort to them, this is your EA-retirement day. This depends on which other values you have besides EA and how old you are.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>But the next two years are going to be very important, and to start acting on them now, and going all in, seems to me like an extremely reasonable strategy to adopt even if you have a limited number of total hours or effort you intend to allocate to EA. If you made a pledge to donate 10% of your time for instance, donate the first 10% you can get a hold of.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Exceptions</h2>\n<p>Many occasions are candidate exceptions for this &quot;bienial all-in&quot; policy I&apos;m suggesting. Before the end of Death was fathomable, it would be a bad idea to spend two years fighting it, as Bostrom suggests in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLecJrXpOEU\">the fable</a>.

There&apos;s no law which says that entrepreneurship has to be risky, so what&apos;s going on? Are VCs just getting together and deciding to pay entrepreneurs based on a dice roll? The answer is: basically, yes.</span></p>\n<p><a></a><span>If a founder leaves a startup, that company is in much more dire straits than if an entry-level employee leaves IBM. This means that startup founders need to signal their commitment to investors much more strongly than entry-level employees do; that signaling usually takes the form of the founder rejecting a salary and instead gambling their finances on the company success.</span><sup><a href=\"#ftnt2\">[2]</a></sup><span>&#xA0;Because salaries are much more stable than business values, this means that entrepreneurs are forced by investors to accept higher levels of risk.</span></p>\n<p><span>This is important so I&#x2019;m going to call it out in very clear terms:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Entrepreneurship </span><span>must</span><span>&#xA0;involve an element o</span><span>f risk</span><span>&#xA0;for the founder (i.e. luck). If it didn&#x2019;t, no one would invest.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1><span>The Importance of Industry Selection</span></h1>\n<p><span>The greatest startups seem to create markets out of thin air: no one cared about search until Google and only petty criminals ran non-medallioned taxis before Uber.

If it turned out that people loved buying books in person so that even when previous technologies like telephones spread no one bought books over the phone, this would decrease our estimate.</span></p>\n<p><span>(</span><span>There&apos;s a clich&#xE9; that startups describe themselves as &quot;it&apos;s like X for Y.&quot; There&apos;s even </span><span><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fitsthisforthat.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFMBQPg8h6yNIm93tgnwFdOX-8z1g\">a site</a></span><span>&#xA0;which generates these clich&#xE9;s. </span><span>Reference class forecasting is basically taking that clich&#xE9; and turning it into an investment strategy</span><span>.)</span></p>\n<h1><a></a><span>Example: Amazon (Redux)</span></h1>\n<p><span>I gave empirical evidence before about the importance of industry selection, but reference class forecasting gives a strong intuition for it.

While I was at my previous job I had been able to show that certain coding techniques were associated with a greater number of defects, and I figured I could monetize this.</span></p>\n<p><span>The outside view didn&#x2019;t look great though. Static code analysis tools have existed for a long time, but few people use them as a core piece of the development process.</span><span>&#xA0;There were no recent advances in </span><span>IDEs</span><span>&#xA0;or version control which I could use to explain why my tools will be more successful</span><span>. Even though this idea met many of the standard startup idea criteria (I had domain expertise, it solved a problem I myself had, I was passionate about it), I abandoned it.</span></p>\n<p><span>My current projects deals with quality measurement in healthcare setting. For those of you unfamiliar with American politics, health care reform is kind of a big deal and quality-based payments are expected to triple in the next three years. The market is clearly growing and while I think I have some advantages that my competitors lack, I think the outside view looks pretty good for all of us.</span></p>\n<h1><a></a><span>Summary</span></h1>\n<p><span>When I explain my unorthodox views on the importance of teams, people often say something like:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>It&#x2019;s better to have an A team with a B idea than a B team with an A idea. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My point isn&#x2019;t that this is wrong; it&#x2019;s that <em>it </em><span><em>doesn&#x2019;t make sense</em></span>.</p>\n<p><span>Industry selection is one of the most, if not the most, important skills of a founding team.

I describe the danger and propose a strategy for alleviating&#xA0;it. (<a href=\"http://claviger.net/incentivizing-charity-cooperation.html\">Cross-posted from my blog.</a>)</em></p>\n<h2>Dangers of Breeding Competition</h2>\n<p>I see two success scenarios for effective altruism, one focused more on causes and one more focused on charities: (1) the top effective interventions get sufficient funding, solve the problems they address, new interventions become most effective, and the cycle continues; and (2) top effective charities get funding from EAs and foundations, less effective charities are incentivized to care less about the donor and more about the beneficiary, and their managements gear their interventions toward higher cost-effectiveness. This post focuses on the second scenario.</p>\n<p>When I started getting involved with the running of a charity, with fundraising, and with organizing collaborative events, I didn&#x2019;t know anything about effective altruism (this was in 2010&#x2013;2011). I already had my intuitions about cost-effectiveness and its drops at the margin in some cases, but by and large I saw most charities as cooperating toward the reduction of suffering. That allowed me to be happy about almost any charity fundraising success no matter whether we had anything to do with it.</p>\n<p>When I learned more about effective altruism, I realized how wasteful many charities are and how fundraising may do harm if it directs donations from more effective charities to less effective ones. Suddenly competition appeared where I thought only cooperation should rule.</p>\n<p>At our EA Berlin meetup, we are worried that we&#x2019;re not doing enough to address this problem. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0VrZPBskpg\">Melanie Joy</a>, who started the discussion, reported that some people involved in animal charities that ACE deems less effective than its top charities have come to view these top charities as competitors even though they work together toward closely related goals. However, some of these people are actually open to learning how to improve the effectiveness of their charities.</p>\n<h2>Specialized Effectiveness Training</h2>\n<p>When I&#x2019;ve been thinking about improving the effectiveness of charities, I always thought along the lines of targeted advocacy, where I would try to find a charity that moves a lot of money and has much room for improvement, find someone in a key position who might be open to improving something, contract them and make a case for a more effective allocation of their resources. This is complicated and cumbersome. In this case, however, there are actually just these people who are in key positions and are open to educating themselves. This is an amazing new perspective!</p>\n<p>The problem is just that building up a highly effective charity in a specific cause area, running one or several specific interventions takes a lot of very specialized knowledge. The EA forum and the blogs of EAs and EA organizations are unlikely to hold the information that these people will need.</p>\n<p>Prioritization organizations could probably give some advice here, but they would become a central hub for this sort of consulting and are probably too resource-constrained to do that. They also need to be generalists, so they might not have the knowledge at quite the level these trainees require. Alternatively, someone could start an EA McKinsey, but I&#x2019;m not sure if that could work out financially. Consultants like Caroline Fiennes seem to focus more on advising donors than charities, but please let me know if there are already some that give quality advice to charities.</p>\n<p>Rather the top charities themselves could help here. It is in the interest of their transparency anyway to keep their strategies and processes open to the public, for example in blog posts, but they could go beyond that and actually accept in staff members of interested less effective charities and work with them for some time, maybe a month or a year.</p>\n<h1>Cost-Effectiveness of EA Training</h1>\n<p>The main question is whether such a program could be cost-effective for the top charity and in general, and I&#x2019;m not satisfied with the answer I can give to that.</p>\n<p>First, the costs to the top charity are not comparable with the expenses they would incur through volunteers, interns, or even average new hires. Typically you invest into hiring, onboarding, training, and salaries in the hope that the employee will stay long enough to far outearn this initial investment. In this case, however, the less effective charity would react to a call for applications from the top charity, and the latter only has to review the applications it receives, which already reduces costs. (The interest in such positions will likely increase as effective altruism becomes more popular.) Then, crucially, these are people who already worked in the same cause area for years. Even though their charities&#x2019; performances might not be on par with the top charity yet, they are likely to be highly qualified in the same field. Training costs will be minimal. Finally, they may&#x2019;ve solved problems at their own charities that the top charity still struggles with, so that the flow of experience is not strictly one-sided. All in all, the cost for the program is likely to be smaller than it would at first seem.</p>\n<p>Second, these charities are cooperating toward a common goal, so the improvements of the less effective charities also count into the effectiveness side. The more money these charities move (and the lacking recommendation will unfortunately not have a crucial impact on that) and the greater their room for improvement, the greater will be the absolute improvement in impact that the program can achieve (and the more likely it is that they can afford to send an employee to such a training). If the program is very successful, the charities might even merge, which could enhance the effectiveness of both.</p>\n<h2>Incentivizing EA Training</h2>\n<p>It would be valuable to test these intuitions about the cost-effectiveness of such a program against real numbers that I currently don&#x2019;t have. It would also be interesting to poll how many organizations of what size would already be interested in taking part in such a program at any current top charity, but I would expect that number to increase over time.</p>\n<p>If the cost-effectiveness is sufficient, the program could be seen as increasing the effectiveness of the top charity via other charities, an additional argument for donating to them and for the prioritization organization to keep recommending them. That, in turn, would incentivize top charities to conduct such programs.</p>\n<p>All the while the program would also thwart division among charities by showing them that EA is not only about finding the best charities and donating to them at the exclusion of all others but also about lifting those other charities to the same level of effectiveness as the top charities where this is possible.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Telofy"}}, {"_id": "GE8DjberQpCF346qT", "title": "Meetup : First Munich Meetup", "postedAt": "2015-05-09T13:18:24.059Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/2p\">First Munich Meetup</a></h2>\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHEN:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>11 May 2015 07:30:00PM (+0200)</span><br>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHERE:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>Englischer Garten, Munich</span>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .meta -->\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t    <div><p>The Munich Effective Altruism group is having its first meetup!

There are several reasons we discount, such as time preference and uncertainty, and these behave differently in different contexts.</p>\n<p>In this chapter I explore discounting for uncertainty in a health context. I argue that it is important to include a discount rate for uncertainty about future medical progress, but that it should be relatively low. I show how such a discount rate differs in practice from discounting for time preference. I explain how the inclusion of such a discount rate allows better counterfactual estimates of the health effects of a research or eradication programme.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DiscountingHealth.pdf\">You can read the full article here.</a></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt"}}, {"_id": "mzD4XCgSXugrgMAw8", "title": "Introducing the .impact fund - paying for small costs and VA work for independent EA projects", "postedAt": "2015-05-07T18:39:57.405Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Thanks to generous initial contributions from Ozzie Gooen and Peter Hurford, we&apos;ve started a .impact fund which can pay for&#xA0;small costs and virtual assistant (VA) work for independent EA projects.

We&apos;ve found some good virtual assistants and opened paid-for accounts with them that you could use. These virtual assistants are generally cheap overseas freelancers who bill us hourly, and are happy to help with any task, including time-consuming administrative ones. We also have an account at US-based&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.fancyhands.com/\">Fancy Hands</a>, which provides us with a certain number of 15 minute tasks per month.</p>\n<p>Though we&apos;re open to offering more in some cases, at least for now the fund will mostly be limited to very small-scale spending - $10 for domain names here, $30 for VA work to complete or drive forwards a delayed project there.

Call them <em>Effectiveness,</em>&#xA0;<em>Altruism </em>and <em>EA-morality</em>,&#xA0;respectively:</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong><em>Effectiveness</em></strong>: When you&apos;re acting altruistically, you should be effective.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Altruism</em></strong>: You should act altruistically a lot.</p>\n<p><em>EA-morality</em>: Global empathy, future lives are very valuable, animal lives are valuable, etc.*</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Effectiveness</em><em>&#xA0;</em>concerns your <em>means</em>, whereas <em>Altruism </em>and <em>EA-morality </em>concern your <em>ends.</em>&#xA0;Now presumably it is, in general, easier to sell&#xA0;<em>Effectiveness</em>&#xA0;than&#xA0;<em>Altruism </em>and&#xA0;<em>EA-morality</em>, respectively<em>.&#xA0;</em>Accepting&#xA0;<em>Altruism</em>&#xA0;means less money and time for yourself, whereas accepting <em>EA-morality </em>might mean a fundamental transformation of your moral values. Accepting&#xA0;<em>Effectiveness</em><em>&#xA0;</em>means none of those things. Really, it seems very hard to argue against&#xA0;<em>Effectiveness</em>&#xA0;(though people do try to some extent, by all means).</p>\n<p>This raises the question of whether it is wise to sell&#xA0;<em>Effectiveness</em>,&#xA0;<em>Altruism</em>&#xA0;and <em>EA-morality</em><em>&#xA0;</em>as a package deal, as it were, or whether it is better to try to sell&#xA0;<em>Effectiveness</em><em>&#xA0;</em>alone to some people.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>An obvious option is to adapt the message to the audience: to sell the package deal to those who are likely to be open to&#xA0;<em>Altruism&#xA0;</em>and&#xA0;<em>EA-morality</em>, but to focus on&#xA0;<em>Effectiveness</em><em>&#xA0;</em>when dealing with people who are unlikely to accept those other two claims.&#xA0;You could also, of course, try to sell the&#xA0;<em>Effectiveness</em><em>&#xA0;+</em>&#xA0;<em>EA-morality</em>-pair (which is what GiveWell is doing, I guess) or the&#xA0;<em>Effectiveness</em><em>&#xA0;+</em>&#xA0;<em>Altruism</em>-pair if you think that your audience could buy them, given whatever circumstances they are in. In this post, I am, however, going to focus on the&#xA0;<em>Effectiveness</em>-alone alternative.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>One reason why this option is attractive is that people are already carrying out a tremendous amount of work which they claim to be altruistic. For instance, most people who do political work, in an extended sense (including voters, people who participate in internet discussions, and so on), would say that this work is being carried out for altruistic reasons. They wouldn&apos;t say that they argue for low taxes, or higher benefits, or whatever, because such policies&#xA0;<em>benefit themselves</em>. Rather, they would argue that they&#xA0;<em>benefit society</em>, <em>are&#xA0;just</em>, or some other reason which is not specifically tied to their own good.</p>\n<p>Now of course you could argue that some of these people are fooling themselves, and that the real motives for their political actions are purely self-interested. That may be, but is irrelevant here. The fact that these people claim to be altruistic (when acting politically) suffices to make them open to criticism from&#xA0;<em>Effectiveness</em>. Because, suppose that:</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>1) They accept&#xA0;<em>Effectiveness</em><em>.</em></p>\n<p><em></em>2) They claim to be acting altruistically when acting politically.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>3) It can be shown that a set of actions suggested by the EA-community, <em>X</em>, are more effective at reaching their altruistic goals than their political actions are.</p>\n<p>From 1)-3) it follows that:</p>\n<p>4) They should change their course of action to <em>X</em>.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This means that if we could make this existing altruistic work more&#xA0;effective, that could do an enormous amount of good. There is one important caveat that must be made here, however. If people get more&#xA0;effective&#xA0;at reaching goals which are altruistic, as opposed to self-interested, but which are opposed to the EA-movement&apos;s goals, then that is obviously not a good thing.</p>\n<p>How much existing altruistic work, in the sense used here, has this character? Far less than usually thought, I should say. Even though there are fundamental value disagreements, most political disagreements rather stem from factual disagreements,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.owl232.net/irrationality.htm\">as Michael Huemer have argued</a>. Most people want less crime, better health, better education, more wealth, and so on (albeit to slightly different degrees). We can discuss this, however.</p>\n<p>Also, even if some people do have such &quot;negative&quot; altruistic goals, we could just avoid helping them with those, and focus on making more&#xA0;effective&#xA0;the altruistic work which is, at least roughly, aligned with our own goals.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I take it that some EA-organizations are already involved with making existing altruistic work more&#xA0;effective. That would go for, e.g. 80,000 hours and GiveWell. However, there are many areas where lots of altruistic work is being carried out where the EA community hasn&apos;t been that much involved.</p>\n<p>One of these areas is politics. The benefits of making politics more evidence-based and rational, and thereby more&#xA0;effective, should be vast.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is in fact already an existing movement for making politics more evidence-based. For instance, there&apos;s the <a href=\"http://coalition4evidence.org/\">Coalition for Evidence-based policy</a> in the US and the British <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/what-works-network\">What Works Network</a>. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence-based_policy\">Evidence-based policy</a> is a catch-word in many countries (it&apos;s essentially a corollary of <em>Effectiveness&#xA0;</em>and as such really hard to argue against).&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This means that if the EA community would do more work on evidence-based policy, it would have many allies. This is an advantage for two reasons.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>1) It obviously increases the chances of success - of making policy more evidence-based.</p>\n<p>2) It also provides us with an opportunity to convince mere <em>Effectivists</em>, if we may call them such, to become full Effective Altruists. Once you have acquired people&apos;s confidence, it&apos;ll be easier to convince them of the more far-reaching ideas of the EA movement. This is a general advantage of the&#xA0;<em>Effectiveness</em>-alone strategy.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, I recently started a network for evidence-based policy in Sweden, for precisely these reasons. We&apos;re only in the start-up phase so far, but people are generally positive to the idea, which makes me think we have reasons for optimism. I&apos;m also running a blog on rational political debate, which is attached to this network (a rational debate obviously makes rational, evidence-based policy more likely). (The <a href=\"https://dndebattbetyg.wordpress.com/\">blog is in Swedish</a> but some posts in English can be found <a href=\"https://stefanschubert.wordpress.com/\">here</a>.) This work has also been well received, and has got some limited attention by the media.</p>\n<p>I thus think there are some reasons to believe that this cause is <em>tractable</em>. It also clearly has <em>scale </em>and is relatively <em>neglected </em>(most people are working on object-level politics - for this or that political party or movement - and very few work on the meta-level, to make politics more evidence-based and rational). Hence I think it scores well on <a href=\"http://www.eaventures.org/\">all of the EA movement&apos;s three cause selection principles</a>.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Politics is just one area, however. Ideally, we would go through all kinds of altruistic works, and point out to people that if you do this for altruistic reasons, then you should be&#xA0;effective, and if so you should do <em>Y </em>instead of <em>Z</em>.</p>\n<p>I&apos;d be interested to hearing your views both on the&#xA0;<em>Effectiveness</em><em>-</em>alone strategy in general, and on the suggestion that EA-members should work on making politics more rational in particular.</p>\n<p><br><br>* Of course there is not perfect agreement among EA-members on what the EA-movement&apos;s values should be, but let&apos;s leave that aside in this post.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Stefan_Schubert"}}, {"_id": "Dd3XF4tw8FE482XrS", "title": "Request for Feedback: Researching global poverty interventions with the intention of founding a charity.", "postedAt": "2015-05-06T10:22:15.298Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>I intend to initiate a project that looks for highly effective global poverty interventions that are not currently being carried out.

Even if it     is relatively easy for GiveWell&apos;s current top charities to expand to other countries and they may find that the effectiveness of their interventions is lower in those countries. (Details on SCI&#x2019;s funding gap can be found    <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2015-03-31/charity-update-ii-schistosomiasis-control-initiative-sci\"> <span>here</span></a>. AMF has previously     lost its top spot due to limited room for more funding. We are assuming that GiveDirectly has a larger room for funding but is slightly less effective than     AMF and SCI and DtW.)</p>\n<p>We recognise the existence of organisations that scale up effective interventions, such as Evidence Action, but believe that there is a benefit to even     more work in this area.</p>\n<p><span>Step one &#x2013; research:</span></p>\n<p>We want some research into which global poverty interventions are potentially highly promising. We want to look for interventions that have some evidence     behind them but where there is no charity working in this area (or no good effectiveness focused charity in that area, or no charity solely in that area).</p>\n<p>We want to compile a public list of promising interventions. This list should be a tool that anyone keen to start a global poverty charity can look at and     choose an intervention to start. It should list promising global poverty interventions some analysis and comparison of the different ideas. It should     include both promising ideas that could be better than GW&#x2019;s top recommended charities, as well as a no-go list of promising sounding ideas that can be     dismissed as not worth starting following some initial research.</p>\n<p>We envisage the process of generating ideas to fill out the list to be primarily through talking to existing research organisations in this area (beginning     with GiveWell and including GW, GWWC, JPAL, IPA, DCP, Evidence Action, Centre for Global Development, Copenhagen Consensus, and so on) and asking if they     have come across any promising high impact interventions.</p>\n<p>Once a list of intervention ideas is compiled the next step would be to do further analysis of each intervention. This could be carried out by talking to     the aforementioned organisations again in more detail, talking to experts in the fields and doing literature reviews.</p>\n<p>We are currently looking to provide funding for GWWC to take on an intern to do this research.</p>\n<p><span>Step two &#x2013; more research:</span></p>\n<p>The list is complete, so we choose an intervention to start.

(<a href=\"http://claviger.net/expected-utility-auctions.html\">Cross-posted from my blog.</a>)</em></p>\n<h2>Open Phil&#x2013;Type Interventions</h2>\n<p>Insightful quantitative analyses give me the warm-fuzzies, but there may well be highly effective interventions, maybe even interventions more cost-effective than GiveWell&#x2019;s top charities, that are not easily quantifiable. The Open Philanthropy Project has set out to find them, but so far it has not published any hard and fast recommendations.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile outsiders seem to have mistaken our enthusiasm for certain more easily quantifiable interventions for &#x201C;effective altruism is about donating to easily quantifiable interventions&#x201D; rather than &#x201C;effective altruism is about doing the most good.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s weird. But in a <a href=\"/ea/gl/common_misconceptions_about_effective_altruism/31r\">comment on my article</a> David Moss noted that there is something going on that does look like the streetlight effect. Still I think that this is the result of good judgment. That, however, doesn&#x2019;t mean that the same good judgment could not also lead to different decisions given more information.</p>\n<h2>Expected Utility and Limited Diversification</h2>\n<p>What the streetlight effect describes is a scenario where you lose your wallet in the park, and then go up to the street to search for it there since there are streetlights there and you&#x2019;d never find it in the dark of the park anyway. The reality is more like that you haven&#x2019;t lost any particular wallet but that there are potentially a whole bunch of wallets lying around on the street and in the park. Since the light cones are so small, you figure chances are that the biggest wallets are probably somewhere out in the dark. (Unrelated question: When you find a wallet with just $3,340 in it and a bunch of business cards of the owner, should you return it or donate the money effectively?)</p>\n<p>Translating the metaphor into reality, the darkness are areas of great uncertainty. You may, for example, have uncertainty surrounding how important the cause is that an intervention is trying to address, how effective the intervention is at addressing said cause, whether the intervention is still cost-effective at the margin, and whether the charity implementing the intervention is any good at it. If these uncertainties were known probabilities, you&#x2019;d have to multiply them all, but you can&#x2019;t do that unfortunately. The result of all these pseudomultiplications is that the expected utility of interventions in the dark becomes pretty small.</p>\n<p>All the while there are a few, pretty few, really cool interventions in the cones of the streetlights, those of the GiveWell and Animal Charity Evaluators top charities. The interventions in the dark haze of uncertainty are many, many more, but you can only expect the tiniest fraction of them to have any considerable cost-effectiveness at the margin and even fewer of them to beat the known top charities.</p>\n<p>Ordered by expected utility, the interventions will form something like a hyperbolic function with very few top interventions and a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Telofy/status/594523359163060224\">long long tail</a> of potentially interesting giving opportunities. This doesn&#x2019;t include interventions that are fairly certain not to be cost-effective.</p>\n<p>When we choose charities to donate to, we can&#x2019;t diversify infinitely, and that wouldn&#x2019;t be a good idea anyway. Some even argue against any diversification, but that seems unnecessarily restrictive. In any case, few effective altruists will donate to more than five charities, and they will mostly focus on the charities with the highest expected utility or some slight variation thereof. Most will agree on the high expected utility of the known top charities, but the opinions on the long tail charities will vary widely. One person may be very familiar with a certain long tail charity and may hence think that they&#x2019;re able to tell with above-average certainty that it&#x2019;s a good buy, but someone else could worry that this very familiarity might bias the first person&#x2019;s judgment and donate to a different one or none at all. The result is that the hyperbolic function becomes even more extreme when the y axis are donations.</p>\n<h2>Expected Utility Auctions</h2>\n<p>This seems all perfectly logical to me, and I see no reason to criticize these people&#x2019;s decisions. What would be very valuable, however, is what Open Phil does, to try to find the few good giving opportunities in the long tail and lift them out of it.</p>\n<p>Open Phil, however, has to prioritize interventions that are very scalable because there are eight billion dollar waiting to be invested. The interventions at least have to maintain a comparable marginal cost-effectiveness for long enough to warrant the time and money invested into finding them.</p>\n<p>Significantly, EA metacharities could profit from prioritization. Such goals as to educate the public about effective giving, to fundraise for effective charities, to collect donation pledges, to conduct prioritization research, and much more might all conceivably be highly cost-effective so long as they haven&#x2019;t overexerted the limits of their scalability or suffer from any other hidden ailments. Worries about these latter problems are probably what&#x2019;s holding back many EAs who would otherwise donate to metacharities.</p>\n<p>Is there maybe a system that is less reliable than the proper Open Phil treatment but that might serve as a rough guide for these donors and as a training ground for prioritization research hobbyists? <a href=\"http://impactpurchase.org/\">Impact certificates</a> may develop into such a tool, but here&#x2019;s another idea.</p>\n<p>I envision an expected utility auction site a bit like Stack Exchange,</p>\n<ol>\n<li> where people can post their own estimates of the cost-effectiveness and scalability of their project and their reasoning and calculations behind it </li>\n<li> where other people can reply to such a bid with their own ones and their own calculations </li>\n<li> where a widget at the side displays the current average of the bids weighted according to their upvotes, the standard deviation, and some other metrics of the thread</li>\n<li>where a list gives a sorted overview of these metrics of all threads.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The unit could be something like 1 util/$ = what GiveDirectly can do for $1.

[Outcome: No contest.] </strong><em>(Disclaimer: This is 30hrs/wk with full time-tracking, subtracting out time spent on     break, at lunch, in the bathroom, etc. -- it is probably still more than a typical 40hr/wk work week.)</em> In the past, I&#x2019;ve made time tracking a large     component of my personal reviews. However, lately, I&#x2019;ve changed my philosophy away from that, and for a variety of reasons I no longer think &#x201C;amount of     hours worked&#x201D; is a sufficiently useful proxy for &#x201C;amount of work accomplished&#x201D;. While the question of whether I work hard enough at my day job still looms     large for me, I no longer think increasing my amount of hours spent working on it means much. I have begun writing on this in more detail and intend to     elaborate eventually on my changing thoughts behind the nature of work.</p>\n<p><strong> Learn some data modeling. [Outcome: Successful.]</strong> While my work is commonly referred to as data science, it is more accurately considered &#x201C;data engineering&#x201D;     (and &#x201C;Data Engineer&#x201D; is my actual title). This means I do a lot more programming and a lot less statistical modeling relative to a typical data scientist     (but still more statistics than a typical programmer / software engineer). I wanted to actually do a data modeling project so I could learn more about the     &#x201C;other side&#x201D; of data science. I was able to do this, completing a data modeling project throughout January.</p>\n<p><strong>Learn Hadoop. [Outcome: No contest.]</strong> Our work ended up deprioritizing Hadoop usage, so this skill was no longer relevant. I&#x2019;ve become more careful with     crafting learning goals, which I elaborate on in the section &#x201C;Learning&#x201D;, below.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong> What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>I just finished my ninth month as a professional programmer and my fifth month as a Data Scientist. And just sixteen months ago I started studying     programming seriously. Each time I do this review I talk about how I&#x2019;ve learned a lot, and this review is no different.</p>\n<p>I feel like it&#x2019;s hard to know how you&#x2019;re a better programmer, but a few things stand out as signs of development:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I can look back on past code, see how it is inadequate, and improve it. A public example of this will be seen below when I discuss the EA Survey.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve learned the virtue of making small, modular functions and engaging in            <a href=\"http://maryrosecook.com/blog/post/a-practical-introduction-to-functional-programming\">functional programming</a> as much as possible. This             makes my code cleaner and more readable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve learned the virtue of using external libraries and not re-inventing existing solutions. But I unfortunately learned this by experience. This             is discussed in &#x201C;What Went Wrong&#x201D; below.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve introduced two new R best practices to our team that no one else on the team had been thinking about before. I think I&#x2019;m finally contributing             as an equal.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>People ask me a lot of questions now, seeking my help.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest problem is that I &#x201C;wasted&#x201D; a lot of time through tackling work suboptimally.</p>\n<p>For example, one project I had was a &#x201C;big data&#x201D; project, where I had to handle data with 10M - 100M records. I conceived of a solution in my head and went     for it, spending two months building the architecture. However, later I learned of an external library which supported a different approach that was     superior and easier to implement.</p>\n<p>I had considered this library earlier but dismissed it, having not spent enough time to get to know it. Once I implemented this library, I was able to     re-create the needed architecture in only four days. What took two months of my time could have been done in two weeks if I spent a bit more time     researching beforehand. (Another reason not to count &#x201C;hours worked&#x201D;.)</p>\n<p>The other biggest problem I had was mismanaging a data retrieval project by misunderstanding how high priority the project was and by not asking for help     when I needed it. I learned that it&#x2019;s important to ask clarifying questions and understand the priority and process behind projects before doing them.     Luckily, for what I&#x2019;ve been led to believe are unrelated reasons, I&#x2019;m no longer in charge of any data retrieval projects.</p>\n<p>I think these mistakes happen, and if I wasn&#x2019;t making these mistakes, recognizing them, and learning from them, I don&#x2019;t think I would be able to say in     good confidence that I was improving as a programmer and as a corporate worker. So I&#x2019;m not disappointed. But I hope not to repeat these mistakes on my     future projects.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> Q2 Goal</strong></p>\n<p>I made a mistake last quarter in not making sufficiently good goals that would survive three months of change, so this time I&#x2019;d like to make my goal a     little bit more general: Reflect on how I can be a better programmer. My ideal deliverable for this goal would be three things: (a) an blog post     overviewing of what I&#x2019;ve learned programming to date, (b) a blog post with thoughts on how programmers can become better, and (c) a reflection in my Q2     review on how I&#x2019;ve improved as a programmer.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Secret Entrepreneurship Projects</h2>\n<p>In September 2014, I spent five hours launching <a href=\"http://64or32.com/\">64or32.com</a>, a dinky advertising-supported application to    <a href=\"http://64or32.com/\">tell people whether they have 32-bit or 64-bit browsers</a>. It&#x2019;s earned about $50 since it&#x2019;s initial launch, but has slowed     down to earning ~$0.10 a month, which I take it means the dream is over.</p>\n<p>Since Sep 2014, I have been working with two friends, fiddling around with several different project ideas, even getting two of them close to a possible     launch. But ultimately we put both of those two on hold to pursue another idea, and then put that idea on hold to pursue yet another idea.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I don&#x2019;t think there&#x2019;s a lot we can safely say. I can say that one of the two projects is open sourced (i.e., free) modeling software. The     other one of the two is not one that I can talk about publicly out on the open internet yet. I do err on the side of transparency, and I do hope to be able     to talk about both projects more freely by the end of Q2.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> Q1 Goals</strong></p>\n<p><strong> Launch something. [Outcome: Did not happen.]</strong> By the end of 2014, we had two projects that both were only a few weeks away from a potential launch. However,     we think that those two projects are not as high-value as the projects we&#x2019;re working on now. However, one of the two projects (the open source one) I hope     to have launched by the end of Q2. The other project will take longer to launch.</p>\n<p><strong> Move monthly revenue from $6/mo to $12/mo. [Outcome: Success] </strong>Surprisingly, this did actually happen, though not in the way I expected. We&#x2019;ve successfully     moved monthly revenue from a one-digit figure to a two-digit figure!</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>Entrepreneurship is really messy and there is a very large gap between practice and theory, especially when the theory is really just anecdotes about other     people&#x2019;s practice.</p>\n<p>The hardest thing has been a lack of planning, with too many ideas that seem good and not enough execution. This led us to move between idea to idea,     getting a few ideas close, but not doing the final push to launch any of them.</p>\n<p>While I guess it&#x2019;s good no one can accuse us of a &#x201C;sunk cost fallacy&#x201D;, this seems generally like a bad habit to be in, and I&#x2019;m nervous that we&#x2019;re making a     mistake by not following through. Frequently in developing our potential products we enjoy the coding and solving hard problems, but then turn away from     the &#x201C;boring&#x201D; development side of things, like writing documentation, talking to potential users, etc.</p>\n<p>This ties in somewhat with our other problem -- while I&#x2019;ve personally read countless articles and books about taking a &#x201C;minimum viable product&#x201D; approach, I     tend to forget to actually do this in any of the actual work. We keep adding cool features because they&#x2019;re fun and we&#x2019;re sure they&#x2019;ll be useful, without     just getting the project out there first and asking potential users.</p>\n<p>Also, there have been times when I&#x2019;ve been a bit too excited about these ideas without potentially thinking them through. This has led me to scare a few     people with notions of quitting my job when, upon further reflection, I don&#x2019;t really have any basis (or desire) to do that yet.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>I put &#x201C;What Went Wrong&#x201D; before &#x201C;What Went Right&#x201D; because I&#x2019;m really tempted for this section to say &#x201C;Nothing&#x201D;. But that&#x2019;s clearly not the case. Overall,     I&#x2019;ve been impressed with our team and our ability to make significant progress quarter-to-quarter while still all having full-time jobs and other     priorities.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> Q2 Goals</strong></p>\n<p><strong> Launch the modeling software project as an invite beta ASAP.</strong> We really have to get this in front of potential users and reflect on their feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>Launch the modeling software project as an open beta before the end of Q2.</strong> This is a bit of a stretch goal, but we think we can make it.</p>\n<p><strong>See whether the other project is actually launchable.</strong> This mostly involves legal due diligence. While we might not get a clear &#x201C;yes&#x201D; or &#x201C;no&#x201D; answer, I&#x2019;d     like to be a lot more confident with it than I am now.</p>\n<p><strong>Move total revenue to &gt;$1K.</strong> Our current total revenue stands at ~$250 and I have some good reasons to expect some growth. I think total revenue is     potentially a better figure for my purposes than monthly revenue, since things are still fluctuating a lot. But let&#x2019;s see what we can bring in over Q2.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Charity Science</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/\">Charity Science</a> is a non-profit that aims to popularize the dense materials of <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org\">GiveWell</a> for general audiences. I&#x2019;ve been helping     advise them with their work.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>The point of this is not to review the impact of Charity Science, but my personal impact with respect to Charity Science. The biggest thing I did in Q1 for     them was host both Joey and Xio here in Chicago. We had a good time as a mini-vacation, but we also arranged two speaking opportunities -- one where all three of us were on a panel at <a href=\"http://chi-fi.org/\">Chi-Fi</a> and Joey spoke at the    <a href=\"http://chicago.sundayassembly.com\">Chicago Sunday Assembly</a>. In both cases the audience was small (~9 people and ~22 people respectively), but     in both cases the talks were well-received.</p>\n<p>(Also, I must admit that really it was Marcus Davis who did all the arranging for the two talks and all I had to do was figure out how to get Joey and Xio     there.)</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>I considered &#x201C;ramping up my involvement&#x201D; in Charity Science for Q1, but attempting to do so failed and ended up creating some burnout. As anyone can see     from scrolling through this list, I&#x2019;m attempting to do too much, and I really need to cut back. I personally feel less irreplacable at Charity Science than     on my other projects, so it&#x2019;s probably for the best that I just remain where I am as a board member, advisor, and donor.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> Q2 Goal</strong></p>\n<p><strong> Avoid taking on too much responsibility in Charity Science. </strong>So far, I&#x2019;ve begun by being candid about what I can and cannot do and avoiding taking on     additional work. I haven&#x2019;t committed to a particular hour target yet (especially now that I dislike hours targets), but that might be a good idea if I     still find myself doing too much. I expect to evaluate this goal by asking &#x201C;is Charity Science work stressing me out?&#x201D;, which the answer is currently yes,     but hopefully will be no by Q2.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>The EA Survey</h2>\n<p><strong> What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>First and foremost, <a href=\"/ea/gb/the_2014_survey_of_effective_altruists_results/\">I finally finished it.</a></p>\n<p>Second, while doing the EA survey did not teach me programming, per se, it definitely served as a good benchmark for my development as an R programmer.     When I first started the survey analysis back in September, I wrote quite clunky script. Eventually, by November I learned a little bit more about what I was doing and created <a href=\"http://www.github.com/peterhurford/surveytools\">surveytools</a>. But later in January I learned about the<a href=\"http://www.github.com/hadley/dplyr\">dplyr library</a> and realized that surveytools was duplicative and inferior, and I wrote    <a href=\"http://www.github.com/peterhurford/surveytools2\">surveytools2</a> based off of dplyr.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve ever fallen prey to the planning fallacy quite this badly. This project had significant time overruns and I feel bad for not being able     to complete it in a timely manner. But I definitely learned a good lesson about how long analysis takes, how to do it more quickly, and what I can and     cannot take on given my workload.</p>\n<p>Luckily, the next time the analysis happens, it should go much more quickly, because the hard problems (in R analysis, though not survey methodology) have     been largely solved.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2><strong> The FB Veg Advocacy Study</strong></h2>\n<p>In Q3, Jason Ketola and I designed a study to determine the effectiveness of advertising pro-vegetarian videos on Facebook. In Q4, Jason and I teamed up     with Mercy for Animals to implement the study, acquiring $75K in funding.</p>\n<p>Since the study is ongoing in the field collecting responses, I did not have to do anything for this in Q1. I also don&#x2019;t expect to have to do anything in     Q2.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Learning</h2>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve been trying to learn R programming (to get better at my job), mathematics (to get better at my job), and Chinese (just because it&#x2019;s fun).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>I actually sat down and learned stuff!</p>\n<p>\n</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Programming: </strong>I&#x2019;ve completed 55% of Hadley Wickham&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://adv-r.had.co.nz/\">Advanced R</a> and 33% of Wickham&#x2019;s    <a href=\"http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/\">R Packages</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Math:</strong> I&#x2019;ve &#x201C;mastered&#x201D; 40% of <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/algebra2\">Algebra II on Khan Academy</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Chinese:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.memrise.com/\">Memrise</a> says I have 181 Chinese words in my long-term memory.<a href=\"http://www.skritter.com/\">Skritter</a> says I&#x2019;ve learned 40 Chinese words.

I did well in January, but things fell off a     cliff in February and March as I got less motivated and more busy. I think I just need to work on setting more realistic goals.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> Q2 Goals</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Finish Advanced R</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finish R Packages</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Master &gt;75% of Khan Academy&#x2019;s Algebra II</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have &gt;300 words in long-term memory on Memrise.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learn &gt;75 words on Skritter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finish the Chinese 101 Coursera class.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Complete &gt;5 more lessons in Rocket Chinese.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Reading</h2>\n<p>Over 2015 Q1, I read 11 books and tried reading two additional books that I ended up not finishing. I wrote up a    <a href=\"http://peterhurford.com/other/reading.html\">new reading list</a> with more details. Only one of these 11 completed books was in print, which just     goes to show how powerful <a href=\"http://www.audible.com\">Audible</a> is for clearing through my reading list.</p>\n<p>I also cleared out all the articles in my <a href=\"http://www.getpocket.com\">Pocket</a>, which I consider a significant accomplishment.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> Q2 Goals </strong></p>\n<p>Over Q2, I&#x2019;d like to transition to a phase where I consolidate what I&#x2019;ve read instead of seeking to read more (though I do still plan on reading more). The     main deliverables for this will be (a) expanding the summaries of <a href=\"http://peterhurford.com/other/reading.html\">books that I&#x2019;ve read and liked</a> (including writing my own where necessary), (b) completing an organized document with    <a href=\"http://peterhurford.tumblr.com/post/108765371191/links-when-i-feel-like-it-29\">all of my link posts</a>, and (c) completing more links posts.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Social Life</h2>\n<p>Previously, I had not reflected on my social life as a part of these reviews, but I think that&#x2019;s a mistake. I don&#x2019;t want to go into too much detail because     I do want to protect the privacy of others and have some privacy myself. I&#x2019;m also struggling in this area, deciding what I do and do not want from my     social life, how I do and do not want to review it, and what I do and do not want to share publicly.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> What Went Right </strong></p>\n<p><strong>My girlfriend:</strong> I think our relationship overall grew much stronger over these past three months. I&#x2019;m grateful I was able to see her in both January and     February (we have a long-distance relationship), which really helps.</p>\n<p><strong> My parents:</strong> I&#x2019;ve gotten into a much better habit of calling my parents regularly, which I&#x2019;m excited about!</p>\n<p><strong>My brother:</strong> I&#x2019;ve been keeping in touch regularly with my brother as well. I also got to visit him in late March.</p>\n<p><strong> Local friends:</strong> I&#x2019;ve been making more of an effort to get to know my co-workers. I also have one friend from college who also lives in Chicago, who I&#x2019;ve     been seeing regularly.</p>\n<p><strong> Distant friends:</strong> I&#x2019;m glad that I got to see a good amount of my college friends in late March.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p><strong> My girlfriend:</strong> Quite a lot of the time this past three months I ended up planning rather terribly, neglecting my girlfriend and not considering her needs.     I&#x2019;m saddened by having hurt her that way.</p>\n<p><strong> My brother:</strong> My brother and I have both agreed that we want to stay in touch more consistently, but we haven&#x2019;t developed a consistent schedule yet. Of     course, perfect consistency is unrealistic, but I&#x2019;d still like to improve by being in contact more.</p>\n<p><strong> Distant friends:</strong> There&#x2019;s no regularity to our contact, and I need to fix that. Outside of visiting them once, I have not been doing well at keeping in     touch.</p>\n<p><strong> Connecting with people I know less deeply: </strong>I&#x2019;d like to be in somewhat regular contact with people I know less deeply from college and my past; people who     are more my acquaintances instead of my friends.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> Q2 Goal</strong></p>\n<p>My big goal here is to figure out a system for improving my consistency in communication with everyone I want to be in touch with, as well as sorting out     who I want to be in touch with and at what quantities.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<h2>Personal Health / Exercise</h2>\n<p>More important than nearly anything to a healthy and productive life is really nailing the core three: exercise, sleep, and food. Unfortunately, I&#x2019;ve     struggled with these three so far my entire life.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m happy with the health of my current, vegetarian diet. I have taken    <a href=\"http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/ART02840/How-to-Eat-in-Seven-Words.html\">the words of wisdom of Michael Pollan</a> to make it not much more     complicated than to &#x201C;Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.&quot; I get a good amount of fruits and vegetables in my diet every day and don&#x2019;t eat too much junk     food. There&#x2019;s probably room for improvement, as I could stand to eat less and to maybe eat less bread. But I&#x2019;m happy with where I am.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> What Went Wrong </strong></p>\n<p>While food is on target, exercise and sleep are not.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve been struggling with going to sleep at a reasonable time (i.e., before midnight), getting up at a reasonable time (i.e., before 9am), and sleeping a     reasonable amount of time (my problem is actually oversleeping, not undersleeping like most Americans). This has created a bad morning routine which has     worsened my work life, and, from there, worsened my personal life.</p>\n<p>Exercise has not been great either. I&#x2019;ve kept things steady at 1.4hrs/wk, which is the same as 2014 Q4, so at least things have not gotten worse. And by     many measures, I should be exercising enough, as I walk 30 minutes every day commuting to work (12-15 minutes both ways), and frequently walk (or even run)     up the six flights of stairs to my apartment. However, I&#x2019;d still like to have a routine of going to the gym at least once every week, not to mention twice     or three times. I&#x2019;d also like to do the same with running. I think both are reasonable goals for getting more healthy.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong> Q2 Goals </strong></p>\n<p>For my goals in this area, I&#x2019;d like to create the reasonable goals of (1) getting to work by 9:30am more often than not (since this would mean I&#x2019;m waking     up well enough and having a decent morning routine) and (2) going to gym at least once a week and running at least once a week.</p>\n<p>If I&#x2019;ve been struggling with both sleep and exercise since the beginning, it&#x2019;s a bit silly to just re-commit to the same goals every time. Instead, I must     follow the rule which asks &#x201C;If you&#x2019;ve failed in the past, what will be different about this time?&#x201D;. To this, I answer:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I&#x2019;m committing to much less difficult goals than usual. For example, going to the gym once a week instead of 2-3 times; getting to work more often             than not by 9:30am, rather than all the time by 8am. This should build me a success spiral toward where I really want to go.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve put things under the watchful eye of <a href=\"http://www.beeminder.com\">Beeminder</a>. While many times I end up paying money on Beeminder, at             least it lets me notice and feel the sting. For exercise, I&#x2019;m beeminding time spent both in the gym and running, and for sleep I&#x2019;m beeminding both             bedtime and the time I get to work. (I&#x2019;m also beeminding my diet, even though I think that&#x2019;s going ok.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I&#x2019;m going to consider some secret weapons. For sleep, buying a            <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Philips-HF3520-Wake-Up-Colored-Simulation/dp/B0093162RM?tag=s4charity-20\">wake-up light</a>. For the gym, trying to             go regularly with a friend. For diet, preparing food in advance.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div></div></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hurford"}}, {"_id": "NJ5XvxeF5e8tAuzFi", "title": "Please support Giving What We Can this Spring", "postedAt": "2015-04-24T18:22:16.230Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h4><img src=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/gwwc-spring-fundraising-header.jpg\" alt=\"\"><br></h4>\n<h4><br></h4>\n<h4><span><a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.causevox.com\">Donate now</a> to get your donations matched!</span></h4>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>Giving What We Can is an international community of people donating at least 10% of their income to the organisations which can most effectively use it to help others.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>We believe that if people are to do this, it is important that they know that there are many others out there doing the same and that there is information readily available about the best places and ways to donate. We therefore encourage people to make a long-term commitment through the Pledge to Give, put members in contact with each other, support people to set up in person meet-up groups and run the Giving What We Can Trust, which provides an easy and cost-effective way for people to donate. Using the data we&#x2019;ve gathered over the five years since we started, <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/impact\">we estimate that</a> we have already moved around $6 to effective charities for every $1 we have spent, and that a realistic estimate of our impact in the long term is closer to $60 going to effective charities for every $1 coming to us.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>This year is going to be an amazing year for effective altruism. The publication of <a href=\"/ea/hg/marketing_effective_altruism_what_can_we_expect/\">four books</a> on the topic mean that more people than ever before will hear about effective giving. It is crucial that that awareness leads to long-term impact. This will be our <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/fundraising-2015\">focus over 2015</a>. We will be capitalising on the increased awareness to set-up and support chapters across the English speaking world and Europe (the main markets of the books). We will increase our one-on-one outreach to encourage people to take the Pledge and continue to keep in close contact with our members to ensure member retention.

In order to have our full budget for 2015, and end the year with 12 months of reserves, we need to raise &#xA3;150,000. If you&#x2019;ve previously donated less than &#xA3;1,000 to Giving What We Can, this is a fantastic time to give because right now donations over &#xA3;1,000 from new donors are being matched (up to &#xA3;5,000 per person and with a total cap of &#xA3;50,000). Our stretch goal is to raise enough so that we don&#x2019;t have to do another fundraising round for a year - in order to do that we would need to raise an extra 6 months or reserves, meaning we want to raise a total of &#xA3;280,000.

Thanks to the growing effective altruism movement, lots of essays have been written around the topic of charity effectiveness over the last five years. And many of the key insights are gathered together in the Effective Altruism Handbook, which has become available today.</p>\n<p>The Effective Altruism Handbook includes an introduction by William MacAskill and Peter Singer followed by five sections. The first section motivates the rest of the book, giving an overview of why people care about effectiveness. The second through fourth sections address tricky decisions involved in helping others: evaluating charities, choosing a career and prioritizing causes. In the final section, the leaders of seven organizations describe why they&apos;re doing what they&apos;re doing, and describe the kinds of activities they consider especially helpful.</p>\n<p>A lot of conversations have gone into picking out the materials for this compilation, so I hope you enjoy reading it!</p>\n<p><strong><span>The <a href=\"http://bit.ly/EA_Handbook\">Effective Altruism Handbook</a> can be freely downloaded <a href=\"http://bit.ly/EA_Handbook\">here</a>.</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>There are also&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/eahepub\">epub</a><span>&#xA0;and&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/eahmobi\">mobi</a><span>&#xA0;versions for readers using ebook devices, although their formatting has not been edited as carefully.</span></p>\n<p>Thanks to all of the authors in this compilation for writing their essays in the first place, as well as for making them available for the Handbook. Thanks to Alex Vermeer from MIRI for helping massively by offering his experience and assistance with working in LaTeX to produce this kind of book.

In general, the prices of the pieces will add up to less than the price of the project, because we don&#x2019;t know how to assign credit amongst the pieces.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you were paid to do something, we probably won&#x2019;t buy it.</li>\n<li>A group can sell anything the group did, if they decide unanimously what to do with the proceeds (for example, they can decide how to split the proceeds, or they can decide to use them to fund another project).</li>\n<li>A group of people can also unanimously decide how to distribute the certificate for a project done by the group, and then any member of the group can sell up to half of their share of that certificate.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Purchasing certificates</h2>\n<p>A handful of people have expressed interest in buying certificates, so we may run a two-sided auction starting in either May or June. Let us know if you are interested in purchasing certificates, by emailing contact@impact-purchase.org. If you are interested, we will send you the publicly available parts of the project descriptions--everything other than the asking price and anything that the seller asked us to keep private. You can submit buy orders if any of the offered projects look exciting (we&apos;ll describe the mechanics to the buyers at that time---the changes will be transparent and strategically irrelevant to the sellers).</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Paul_Christiano"}}, {"_id": "EpQqh6wCDtfZkeneg", "title": "Should You Visit an EA Hub?", "postedAt": "2015-04-20T11:15:34.931Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>This a post co-written by Brenton Mayer and Peter McIntyre.</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Peter Hurford&#x2019;s <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/gt/we_might_be_getting_a_lot_of_new_eas_what_are_we/\">recent post</a> challenges us to find ways to engage new EAs. In this post we explore travelling to an EA hub as a means to achieve this goal, and consider whether we would advise others to undertake the same trip we did.</p>\n<p>As an effective altruist in Australia it can feel isolating being so far away from the action. Over the December 2013 holidays, Brenton Mayer spent a month at Giving What We Can. In the Christmas period just gone, Peter McIntyre visited Oxford and the San Francisco Bay Area for a month each and <a href=\"http://rationality.org/author/peter/\">interned</a> at <a href=\"http://rationality.org/\">CFAR</a> in the latter.</p>\n<h1>What was it like?</h1>\n<p>In San Francisco, every morning Peter would leave his sharehouse for EAs and rationalists, &#x2018;Event Horizon&#x2019;, and head to the CFAR office, where he would sit down to do some writing for their blog.</p>\n<p>In Oxford, some of us worked if our visa allowed it, but otherwise we would rock up to the office and work on our own projects. We&#x2019;d have a shared lunch with the rest of the office, during which we&#x2019;d discuss other people&#x2019;s research, listen to a talk on a topic someone had studied or work on solving the big issues, like figuring out what the next SMBC comic strip should be. Outside of &#x2018;office time&#x2019;, we both stayed in houses with other EAs, going to gorgeously English pubs and having lots of interesting conversations.</p>\n<h1>Positives</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Most importantly, visiting an EA hub can lead to a significant change in your career or life. We asked the 14 Australians who have visited an EA hub about their experiences.<a href=\"#[1]\"><sup>[1]</sup></a><a></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Acquiring contacts within the EA community can lead to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Collaborative projects you hadn&apos;t envisioned before</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The ability to ask people with skills in a particular area for help</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Having a better feel for the scale and characteristics of the community</p>\n</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>If you enjoy the atmosphere, you might be more inclined to <a href=\"/ea/ey/how_i_organise_a_growing_effective_altruism_group/\">start your own group</a> back home to replicate it. </li>\n<li>\n<p>It will increase your understanding current EA best practices, rather than reinventing the wheel.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&#x2019;s great fun to talk about what you&apos;ve been reading with people in real life, rather than just through a computer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The enjoyment of travelling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A speaker saying &#x201C;I volunteered for an organisation researching and running workshops on working out the bugs in our cognition&#x201D; conjures up more faith than &#x201C;So, I read this blog right&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It might reduce value drift because you meet friends with similar goals and because the travel is a significant investment in EA.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&apos;s a good environment for getting your own projects done:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Highly motivating (observing others&apos; productivity + feeling them approve of your EA work)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Access to an office</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Away from normal duties at home</p>\n</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>\n<p>General personal growth:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You might learn productivity techniques.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Nice environment for goal setting/career planning</p>\n</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li>\n<p>When you come back and tell your friends about your experiences, you get to discuss EA in your life in a less preachy manner.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Negatives</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>You&#x2019;re part of a work environment, so while there&#x2019;s never any shortage of EAs to have big chats to, you need to be respectful of people&#x2019;s time and space. (To get around this, you could consider going to an <a href=\"http://www.effectivealtruism.org/eaglobal\">EA Global</a>.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The monetary cost - Pete spent around $5000 more than he would have at home over the same period, Brenton $4000 more. This includes travel, sightseeing etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You&#x2019;ll miss out on things you would have done at home (eg. Christmas, holidays at home).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The EAs who we have data on are those who have been to an EA hub, so they&#x2019;re highly selected for their enthusiasm and their confidence that they&#x2019;ll get a something out of a trip to a hub. The average EA might get less out of it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Is it the most efficient use of your resources?</h1>\n<p>We struggled with this idea for a long time. Wouldn&#x2019;t we have had a greater impact by donating our money rather than travelling? The mindset of modelling everything in quantifiable terms is common but is <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/08/passive-vs-rational-vs-quantified/\">likely often harmful</a>. Nonetheless, we&#x2019;ll indulge your desires and have a very brief look into whether it would be worth the cash from three angles:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Of the 14 surveyed Australian EAs that went on such a trip, 12 thought that it would increase their overall impact.<sup><a href=\"#[2]\">[2]</a>&#xA0;</sup>Only 2 didn&#x2019;t think it was worth their resources as a charitable act. 9 are currently in Oxford, London or San Francisco. It&#x2019;s best to skim through Footnote 1 to get an idea of how the group found the experience.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An Australian giving at 10% while earning an average wage (this is probably a conservative example for EAs) will give around $280 000 over their career. This implies that an EA earning and giving at that level would need to see a greater than 1.8% influence on their total giving in order to draw even in good done through their donations, in expectation.<a href=\"#[3]\"><sup>[3]</sup></a><a></a>&#xA0;We could easily imagine a much larger likely increase in donations, from consideration of different careers as well as reduction in value drift. In addition to this are all the other positives discussed above, like doing collaborative projects or starting an EA group.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/02/should-i-help-now-or-later/\">80000 hours</a> and the <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/02/give-now-or-later/\">Global Priorities Project</a>, in a collaborative report, suggest that in our early careers, investing in personal capital is a better use of resources than donation. This seems like a pretty good way of building career capital more broadly, as well as domain-specific EA-capital.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n<p>We acknowledge that it seems a bit dubious to point to small changes on things like career trajectory as evidence of impact, as we have done above. However, as we&#x2019;ve seen, the chance of travelling to EA hubs significantly affecting the individuals actually seems quite large. We&#x2019;re also skeptical of our ability to have insight into this and reason counterfactually; the question serves instead as a proxy for &#x2018;do you think your trip was valuable?&#x2019;</p>\n<p>Contrary to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge%27s_law_of_headlines\">Betteridge&#x2019;s law of headlines</a> (any question asked in title can be answered with &apos;no&apos;), we think that visiting a hub does increase your likelihood and ability to do a lot of good. We also think this outweighs the costs. There are some thoughts in Footnote 3 regarding how to get the largest benefit from a trip.</p>\n<p>Giving What We Can <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/volunteer-or-work-us\">are currently looking for volunteers</a>, for their 2015 summer internship programme, as is the <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/04/global-priorities-project-is-looking-for-a-summer-intern/\">Global Priorities Project</a>.

Was it a better use of your resources than your relevant counterfactual?&#x201D;&#xA0;<a href=\"#up1\">&#x2934;</a></p>\n<p><strong>Peter McIntyre:</strong> &#x201C;I&#x2019;d estimate a 50% change in my career from visiting Oxford and San Francisco. I&#x2019;m around 70% sure that the trip was a better use of my resources than the relevant counterfactual.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>Brenton Mayer:</strong> &#x201C;There&#x2019;s a 10% chance my visit will change some step in my career. The experience and the friends I now have will significantly reduce my value drift, which is possibly the most significant positive. I&#x2019;m also 90% sure that the trip was a better use of my resources than the relevant counterfactual. &#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>Tara Mac Aulay:</strong> &#x201C;Change is hard, maybe 30%? I imagine I would still be working in the non-profit sector if I never visited an EA hub, so it&apos;s not that different to working at CEA, most of the changes are probably network related though.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>Brayden McLean:</strong> &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a Significant Plan change for me, for sure. 50%, probably.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>Ryan Carey:</strong> &#x201C;If I hadn&apos;t travelled to Oxford or SF ever, there&apos;s like &lt;50% chance I&apos;d have ever done a msc here [in London] and &lt;20% chance I&apos;d volunteer for CSER.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>Buck Shlegeris:</strong> &#x201C;I moved to SF for App Academy in part because of the EA community here, but I didn&#x2019;t actually visit here. However, moving here was an unambiguously good decision. I have gotten an enormous amount of value from the EA community here (and my income is about doubled here compared to what it would have been in Australia). If you&#x2019;re a software engineer, the salary difference is such that you&#x2019;d be crazy not to move here if you possibly can.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>Tonja Wright: </strong>&#x201C;Very sure - 90%. I was able to create personal relationships with highly active EAs and it led to a full-time paid EA job! My trajectory was completely changed. I spent nearly 2 months at Leverage in The Bay Area and then did a 3-4 month internship at CEA. If I didn&apos;t get hired by one of them, I was going to work at a think tank or go into politics I had many conversations with different members of the EA movement - ones I couldn&apos;t have had over the internet from Australia... they gave me lots of advice about what my next career step should be and that helped me make my final decisions on what was fast becoming a very overwhelming process. On a personal note, the chance to meet so many amazing people in the flesh and make friends with them was priceless!&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>Chris Barnett:</strong> &quot;I am highly (90%) confident that I made the right choice moving to the bay area. The opportunities to have a high impact are much higher here because there are more people here with both the capability and the will to impact the world for the better. I have already experienced a faster than ever growth trajectory since I moved here, which I attribute to collaborating with, learning from and being inspired by the myriad of impressive people I&apos;ve met here.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Rob is now living in Oxford and is the Executive Director of the Centre for Effective Altruism.</p>\n<p><strong>Thomas Hendrey:</strong> &quot;Pretty undecided on my trajectory both before and after going, so I won&#x2019;t put figures on trajectory change. I am confident it was a better use of resources than the relevant counterfactual for me (in the sense that it was better that I went than that noone went). My relevant counterfactual wasn&#x2019;t very good, but I do think it is the best way of getting an understanding of the internal workings of CEA and I met lots of great people, and had lots of interesting and potentially fruitful conversations.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>Frazer Kirkman:</strong> Currently my trajectory is unchanged, but I do plan to visit the Bay again. While there I met inspiring, resourceful, and interesting people. There is so much positivity being produced, I loved the lifestyle, and the mindset of so many people.</p>\n<p>The focus of this trip was to get a tech job as that seemed to be a confident way to earn to give. While I worked in tech when I was younger, the majority of my life has been as a personal well being coach, focussing on empowering people to change habits, lifestyle and life direction. While I have created a lot of altruists, it has not been financially lucrative for me. I wanted to work in a more financially stable tech role to fund future projects, and have funds to donate, or whichever method will be most effective. This was change in careers was perhaps too big of a swing from my current trajectory. I didn&apos;t find a job. I also intended to have a greater positive impact on the EA community in the Bay. If I was to go again, I would focus on my strengths, go on a business visa, put on seminars and workshops, as well as offer coaching.</p>\n<p><strong>Emily Cutts Worthington:</strong> [her boyfriend Buck answering on her behalf] &#x201C;Emily enjoyed meeting EAs, but did not find it useful per se. Emily is unmotivated by communities, so didn&#x2019;t get as much out of it as most do.&#x201D;</p>\n<p><strong>Ruby Bloom:</strong> &#x201C;Visiting an EA Hub had an enormous impact on me.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x201C;1) Motivation and inspiration.<br> Being among dozens of others who share your values and are putting forth impressive efforts to pursue unambiguously increased my own drive for personal growth and do-gooding.<br> &#x201C;2) Practical advice and connections.</p>\n<p>Discussions with people I met changed my opinions and plans significantly, and I&apos;d say for the better. Their insight in general helped me achieve more, internally and externally.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;3) Connections and opportunities. You find people to work with (this happened to me) and discover other ways to do good that you just wouldn&apos;t elsewhere.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Ruby says he&#x2019;s 90% sure that visiting an EA hub was a better use of resources than his relevant counterfactual and that without visiting he&#x2019;s 99% sure he wouldn&apos;t have gotten married six months later!</p>\n<p><strong>Helen Toner:</strong> &#x201C;I visited the US twice in 2014 to help me think about next steps after finishing my degree. I think you can get the most out of a trip if you are considering living overseas, have specific questions you&apos;re trying to answer, and have friends-of-friends living there who you can be introduced to personally.&#x201D; Interviewer: &#x201C;How sure are you that it was a better use of resources than your relevant counterfactual?&#x201D; Helen: &#x201C;I&#x2019;d say &gt;50%, because I think counterfactuals are hard but I think personal development is basically is the best use of my resources of the next few years.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><a>[2]</a> (Written by Helen Toner)</p>\n<p>-Having at least a few people to visit who are friends-of-friends, that is, you can be introduced to them by someone who knows you well</p>\n<p>-Living overseas being at least something you&apos;re considering</p>\n<p>-Having a few questions (even if they&apos;re vague) that you want to find out more about on the trip (classic example is questions about careers). This makes it much easier to meet people, since you can link up with those who can most likely help you, and makes it more likely you&apos;ll come out of the trip with something concrete</p>\n<p>The EA retreat might be an exception to the above - it was an amazing way to meet people, discuss all kinds of things, and have a great time, so I&apos;d almost recommend it without even considering effectiveness</p>\n<p><a href=\"#up2\">&#x2934;</a></p>\n<p><a>[3]</a> This calculation comes from an income of $62 000 over 45 years, with Pete&#x2019;s cost of $5000 being the cost of the trip. It&#x2019;s very simplistic. A better estimate would consider factors such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A discount rate. Using a discount rate of 3% gives a present value of $152 000 on that $280 000.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A counterfactual which includes the EA earning if they&#x2019;re not travelling</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The contribution the EA makes to the group the visit</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A donation percentage closer to the individual&#x2019;s intents rather than just 10%</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A lifetime earnings figure closer to the individual&#x2019;s expectations rather than just the average wage</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"#up3\">&#x2934;</a></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Peter McIntyre"}}, {"_id": "xmKX3HNDNrcm4TqHX", "title": "America\u2019s Provincialism Ratio", "postedAt": "2015-04-19T20:12:50.399Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>Disclaimer: I am new to the EA world (although not necessarily its methods), which means I have no idea which of my half-baked ideas are worth sharing (i.e., insightful) and which are not (i.e., well-trodden ground).

If someone gives me the choice between a dollar for me and two dollars for my sister, I have to determine whether my <em>M</em><em>e:Sister</em> ratio is greater or less than 2:1. If someone gives me the choice between a dollar for my sister and 100 dollars for a nameless child in Africa, I have to determine whether my&#xA0;<em>S</em><em>ister</em>:<em>African Child</em> ratio is greater or less than 100:1. Etc.</p>\n<p>We discuss these personal ratios (if not quite in these terms) all the time, but I have seen less attention paid to national ratios.</p>\n<p>It is the official policy of the American government to value American lives over non-American lives. (Were it otherwise, the concept of a nation-state would be mostly meaningless.) But it is not the policy of the American government to place no value on non-American lives, as evidenced by, among other things, its concern (if minimal) for civilian casualties in foreign countries. Accordingly, the American government has what could be termed a <em>provincialism ratio</em> that guides (in a considered or unconsidered manner) its foreign and military policies.</p>\n<p>One example of this ratio in action is American drone strikes.<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/mhpag/Desktop/provincialism%20ratio.docx#_ftn1\"><span><span><span>[1]</span></span></span></a> The trade-off when deciding whether to destroy a military target through the use of drones or ground troops is, in part, American soldiers&#x2019; lives for non-American civilian lives. When a drone strike destroys a school full of children, many Americans look askance at their government&#x2019;s decision not to use ground troops. But of course, the other half of the decision is how many of the ground troops likely would have died in pursuit of the target.</p>\n<p>I expect&#x2014;indeed I hope&#x2014;that before deciding whether to use drones or soldiers, the military provides an estimate of (i) the number of civilians that would likely die through the use of drones; and (ii) the number of American soldiers that would likely die through the use of ground troops. In other words, the military provides the decision-maker with a ratio, and the decision-maker decides whether that ratio is acceptable.</p>\n<p>Although more difficult to determine, one could also calculate a provincialism ratio based on how much foreign aid America provides relative to those foreign programs&apos; domestic counterparts. If the same amount of American tax dollars could save the life of one Washington DC resident or 1,000 individuals in southeast Asia, what would the American government do?&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I believe this ratio goes to the heart of what it means to be American and, therefore, should be determined by the electorate. Although how that ratio is <em>translated </em>into foreign/military policy requires expertise, selecting the ratio does not. Indeed, we could create calculators that would roughly determine for individuals, based on their own behaviors, what their personal ratio is,&#xA0;and then they could learn how that ratio might translate to foreign/military policy. I would like to see the 2016 presidential candidates on a spectrum based on their provincialism ratio: how does Hillary Clinton compare to Jeb Bush? I would like to see the candidates&#x2014;as well as coworkers, friends, and family&#x2014;openly debate this ratio.</p>\n<p>The very concept of a provincialism ratio will strike many as crass, and it is. But it exists, and perhaps by being forced to acknowledge that it exists, we will at least have a considered ratio and, overtime, one slightly less crass. &#xA0;</p>\n<div>\n<hr>\n<!--[endif]-->\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/mhpag/Desktop/provincialism%20ratio.docx#_ftnref1\"><span><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><span><span>[1]</span></span><!--[endif]--></span></a> This example is imperfect because most people would agree that&#x2014;holding national origin constant&#x2014;the death of an innocent civilian is more tragic than the death of a soldier.

As part of it&#x2019;s 2014 annual report, GWWC could report:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2011 cohort: \n<ul>\n<li>Of the 107 who joined in 2011&#x2026;</li>\n<li>75 donated over 10% in 2014</li>\n<li>15 were students and did not donate 10% in 2014</li>\n<li>10 had incomes but did not donate 10% in 2014</li>\n<li>7 could not be contacted in 2014</li>\n<li>Total of $450,000 donated in 2014</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2012 cohort: \n<ul>\n<li>Of the 107 who joined in 2012&#x2026;</li>\n<li>50 donated over 10% in 2014</li>\n<li>53 were students and did not donate 10% in 2014</li>\n<li>2 had incomes but did not donate 10% in 2014</li>\n<li>2 could not be contacted in 2014</li>\n<li>Total of $300,000 donated in 2014</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2013 cohort: \n<ul>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While in the 2013 annual report, GWWC would have reported</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2011 cohort: \n<ul>\n<li>Of the 107 who joined in 2011&#x2026;</li>\n<li>45 donated over 10% in 2013</li>\n<li>56 were students and did not donate 10% in 2013</li>\n<li>3 had incomes but did not donate 10% in 2013</li>\n<li>3 could not be contacted in 2013</li>\n<li>Total of $250,000 donated in 2013</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>2012 cohort: \n<ul>\n<li>Of the 107 who joined in 2012&#x2026;</li>\n<li>16 donated over 10% in 2013</li>\n<li>89 were students and did not donate 10% in 2013</li>\n<li>1 had incomes but did not donate 10% in 2013</li>\n<li>1 could not be contacted in 2013</li>\n<li>Total of $100,000 donated in 2013</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This would allow us to see how each cohort matures of time, helping us answer some very important questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much is a member worth, after taking into account the risk of non-fulfillment?</li>\n<li>How does the donation profile of a member change over time &#x2013; does it rise as they progress in their career or fall as members drop out?</li>\n<li>How much does the value of a member differ with the discount rate we use?</li>\n<li>Are the cohorts improving or deteriorating in quality? Are the members who joined in 2012 more likely to still be a member in good standing in 2014 than they 2010 cohort were in 2012? Do they donate more or less?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are some other numbers that might be nice to know, for example breaking the data down by age, sex, nationality, or even CEA employee vs non-employee, but it&#x2019;s important not to impose too high a reporting burden.</p>\n<h3>Why this is not idle speculation</h3>\n<p>This might seem a bit ambitious. Yes, it would be nice if GWWC released this data. But is it really a pressing issue?</p>\n<p>I think it is.</p>\n<h4>Bank problems: Extend and Pretend</h4>\n<p>Sometimes banks will make a series of bad loans &#x2013; loans which are repaid at a significantly lower than expected rate, perhaps because the bank was trying to grow aggressively. When the first signs of this emerge, like people being late on payments, banks have two alternatives. The honest one is to admit there is a problem and &#x2018;write down&#x2019; the loan &#x2013; take a loss to profits. The perhaps less honest one is to <a href=\"http://mathbabe.org/2012/05/29/when-extend-and-pretend-becomes-delay-and-pray/\"><span>extend and pretend</span></a> &#x2013; give the borrowers more time to repay and pretend to yourself/auditors/investors that they will come good in the end. This doesn&#x2019;t actually create any value; it just delays the day of reckoning. Worse, it propagates bad information in the meantime, causing people to make bad decisions.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately they neglected the Litany of Gendlin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is true is already so.<br> Owning up to it doesn&#x2019;t make it worse.<br> Not being open about it doesn&#x2019;t make it go away.<br> And because it&#x2019;s true, it is what is there to be interacted with.<br> Anything untrue isn&#x2019;t there to be lived.<br> People can stand what is true,<br> for they are already enduring it.<br> <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/id/you_can_face_reality/\"><em>&#x2014;Eugene Gendlin</em></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>GWWC: Dilutive Growth?</h4>\n<p>About a year ago, people were concerned that GWWC&#x2019;s growth was slowing &#x2013; <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2014/01/recent-linear-growth-at-giving-what-we.html\"><span>only growing linearly, rather than exponentially</span></a>. This would be pretty bad, and people were justifiably concerned. However, GWWC made a few changes with the aim of promoting growth. Most pertinently:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allowing people to sign up online, rather than having to mail in a hand-signed paper form. This happened between <span><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130423151736/http://givingwhatwecan.org/getting-involved/joining-us\">April </a></span>and <span><a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130814223723/http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/taking-the-pledge\">June </a></span>2013.</li>\n<li>Adjusting the pledge to become more cause-neutral, rather than just about global poverty. This happened late 2014.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/gwwc-signups-labeled.png\"><img src=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/gwwc-signups-labeled.png?w=681&amp;h=574\" alt=\"GWWC signups labeled\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/dashboard\"><span><em>source</em></span></a></p>\n<p>The concern is that, though these measures have <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/dashboard\"><span>increased the number of members</span></a>, they may have done so by reducing the average quality of members. Making it easier to join means more marginal people, with less attachment to the idea, can join. This is still good if their membership adds value, but they dilute the membership, which means we shouldn&#x2019;t account for the average new member being signed up now as being equally valuable as the members who joined up in 2010. Additionally, the reduction in pomp and circumstance might reduce the gravitas of the pledge, making people take it less seriously and increase drop-out rates. If so, moving to paperless pledges might have reduced the value of sub-marginal members <em>as well as</em> diluting them. This makes it harder to forecast the value of members, and might lead to over-investment in acquiring new ones.</p>\n<p>The comparison with banks should be pretty clear &#x2013; a bank that&#x2019;s struggling to grow starts accepting less creditworthy applicants so it can keep putting up good short term numbers, but at the cost of reducing the long-run profitability. Similarly GWWC, struggling to grow, starts accepting lower quality members so it can keep putting up good short term numbers, but at the cost of reducing the long-run donations.</p>\n<p>This seems potentially a big risk, and it&#x2019;s the sort of issue that this data would allow us to address. Of course, there are many other applications of the data as well.</p>\n<p>And GWWC in fact has even stronger reasons than banks to report this data. The bank might be wary of giving information to its competitors, but GWWC has no such concerns. Indeed, if releasing more data makes it easier for someone else to launch a competing, better version of GWWC, all the better!</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>If you liked this you might also like: <a href=\"https://effectivereaction.wordpress.com/2014/11/15/happy-5th-birthday-giving-what-we-can/\"><span>Happy 5th Birthday, Giving What We Can</span></a> and <a href=\"https://effectivereaction.wordpress.com/2014/10/12/givewell-is-not-an-index-fund/\"><span>GiveWell is not an Index Fund</span></a></em></p>\n</div></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Dale"}}, {"_id": "2DyWySGtWGNTCiAqr", "title": "Spreading EA messages to friends - including giving the hard sell", "postedAt": "2015-04-17T21:15:43.090Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><span>I&#x2019;ve long argued that word of mouth is a powerful way of spreading effective altruism and that there should be systematic efforts to encourage this. And, as detailed below, last year&#x2019;s EA survey </span><span><a href=\"/ea/da/a_taxonomy_of_ea_origin_stories/\">showed</a></span><span>&#xA0;that a good number of people got involved through it. I&#x2019;d be interested in people&#x2019;s thoughts on all this. Below, I raise a few questions, make some scattered observations, and describe a pretty extreme hard and widely targeted sell I&#x2019;ve tried recently.</span></p>\n<h3><a></a><span>Word of mouth as a powerful way of spreading effective altruism</span></h3>\n<p><span>Drawing on data from the EA survey, I discussed how people got into effective altruism in </span><span><a href=\"/ea/da/a_taxonomy_of_ea_origin_stories/\">A taxonomy of EA origin stories</a></span><span>. I distinguished between how people first heard about the term or the community, and what convinced them of EA ideas or got them into EA. 126 survey respondents reported first hearing about EA from friends, 237 said personal contact was important in getting them into it, and 196 said the same of friends or family. Note that since the question about the factors that were important in getting people into EA was multiple choice, there was some overlap between the last two categories. Also, as </span><span><a href=\"/ea/da/a_taxonomy_of_ea_origin_stories/\">discussed in the taxonomy post</a></span><span>, these figures are underestimates within the survey sample.</span></p>\n<p><span>These are sizeable numbers within a small movement. </span><span>To them I&#x2019;d add the following</span><span>:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>My anecdotal observation is that word of mouth&#x2019;s been a common factor among EAs I know.</span></li>\n<li><span><a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/conversation-with-michael-bitton-about-ea-marketing/\">Michael Bitton</a></span><span>&#xA0;suggests that there&#x2019;s a core group of people inclined to quickly buy EA and that it&#x2019;s thus valuable to reach them through &#x201C;spray and pray&#x201D; marketing - spreading shallow exposure to our ideas to as many people as possible.</span></li>\n<li><span>There are also others who require in-person conversations, repeated exposure, or peer pressure (though these people&#x2019;s commitment to effective altruism may thus be fragile, particularly if the peer pressure doesn&#x2019;t persist). Friends are an unusually good way to get this. </span></li>\n<li><span>To the extent that peer pressure (or, to put it more positively, a social norm) is important, friends are an unusually strong and lasting source of this. </span></li>\n<li><span>EA&#x2019;s grown disproportionately in a few cities, and in those cities with which I&#x2019;m familiar this </span><span>seems</span><span>&#xA0;to have been more through friendship circles than through people simply hearing talks.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a></a><span>People&#x2019;s resistance to selling EA</span></h3>\n<p><span>Despite this, many people are reluctant to raise EA with friends, let alone to try selling it,</span><span>&#xA0;let alone to</span><span>&#xA0;apply moral pressure or give a hard sell of the sort I describe trying below. It&#x2019;s socially awkward, can feel implicitly boastful, carries some relationship cost, can make our friends uncomfortable, and conflicts with some common norms. And, given all this, we&#x2019;d expect to have a strong irrational bias against it too.</span></p>\n<p><span>I&#x2019;d argue that we should try to counteract this bias, because there&#x2019;s a possibility that doing so will lead to people taking EA actions (such as donating even small amounts to effective charities) which would outweigh these costs. The size of this possibility is very uncertain though; it would be valuable to pin down.</span></p>\n<p><span>It&#x2019;s interesting that people are willing to donate or pledge 10% of income but not raise EA with friends. Gently describing EA ideas to them seems less costly than donating 10% (although this would not obviously be the case with giving a hard EA sell to every single person you meet).</span></p>\n<h3><a></a><span>Possible actions</span></h3>\n<p><span>Given the above, it could be valuable to find a way to make spreading EA messages to friends less awkward, and to coordinate and motivate people to do so. I&#x2019;ve created an </span><span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://impact.hackpad.com/Getting-people-to-sell-friends-on-some-EA-ideas-3hVuBam0yeK\">idea entry</a></span><span>&#xA0;for this on .impact in case anyone&#x2019;d like to take it on. For instance, people could write sample messages or I-was-asked-to-forward-this-email campaigns. It would also be useful to gather evidence as to how well it works. To this end, I&#x2019;ve </span><span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LS9Jc1RP4vxJ5yrkhw_h3DX_XFyOXxBYANKp-BRUT0c/edit#gid=0\">created a spreadsheet</a></span><span>&#xA0;in which anyone can record their attempts and results, and put in some of my own to start with. And it&#x2019;d be valuable to learn about the conclusions of other groups with more experience of evangelism through friends, such as peer-to-peer salespeople, religions and veg*ns.</span></p>\n<h3><a></a><span>What to say, and how hard a sell to make</span></h3>\n<p><span>There are many different EA messages which you could choose to communicate, and different ways to present them. This raises a number of questions. Should you mention your own example? How much moral pressure should you apply? How hard a sell should you make? What are the risks of making people defensive?</span></p>\n<p><span>Participating in a fundraiser can be one of the best excuses to bring up the subject, as it&#x2019;s normal to approach people for donations or sponsorship. Charity Science runs several of these fundraisers for the EA community, including </span><span><a href=\"http://birthday.causevox.com/\">birthday</a></span><span>&#xA0;and </span><span><a href=\"http://christmas.causevox.com/\">Christmas</a></span><span>&#xA0;fundraisers and </span><span><a href=\"http://experiencepoverty.causevox.com/\">Experience Poverty</a></span><span>. That&#x2019;s one good reason to take part in them (consider joining Experience Poverty today!) There are also even less demanding opportunities to bring up EA ideas, like sharing some interesting content or a cost-free action that your friends can take, like </span><span><a href=\"http://effective-altruism.wikia.com/wiki/Shop_for_Charity\">directing 5% of their Amazon spending to top charities</a></span><span>. (It is</span><span>&#xA0;less natural to make a pitch for donating to particular charity in these contexts though.)</span></p>\n<p><span>I&#x2019;ll conclude with an extreme example of spreading one EA message. I recently took advantage of my own Experience Poverty fundraiser to send the following message to every single non-EA I reasonably could. I used an expansive definition of &#x2018;reasonably&#x2019;, sending the message to everyone I knew except for rare cases where I&#x2019;d talk to them often and the social cost would be too high. This included many people I hadn&#x2019;t spoken to in years, every colleague at every past workplace, most people I&#x2019;ve ever studied with, every past neighbour I knew, people I&#x2019;d only spoken to once since I was five, etc. It was an uncomfortable thing to do! As you&#x2019;ll see, my message was quite the hard sell:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Hi [who I was writing to],</span></p>\n<p><span>[Any personal things I wanted to write to them about anyway, such as checking what they were up to. I always enjoy catching up with people anyway.] For my part, we now have our core budget funded and after quite a search have found a </span><span><a href=\"https://www.google.ca/maps/@49.230341,-123.008752,3a,75y,316.14h,82.54t/data=%213m4%211e1%213m2%211sGFvIuA4DCv5IWOSnJ-1PIg%212e0\">new apartment</a></span><span>&#xA0;to move into. I have one big thing coming up, which partly prompted me to write: I&apos;m taking part in a large international fundraiser that I created and have led on (eating my own dog food - almost literally, as you&apos;ll see!)</span></p>\n<p><span>From Monday the 20th to Friday the 24th, I&apos;ll be living on less than &#xA3;1 (~CAD$2)&apos;s worth of food a day, and getting sponsored to help those living in extreme poverty. We&apos;ve signed up over a hundred people around the world to do something similar simultaneously, going for three days and spending &#xA3;1.50 (what the median person in the world spends on food). I picked &#xA3;1 because it&apos;s the international poverty line, and I really want my fundraiser to have the biggest positive impact possible. Both figures are already adjusted for how much they&apos;d buy in poor vs. rich countries.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>I&apos;m writing in case you want to sponsor me </span><span><a href=\"http://ukexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/tom-ash\">here</a></span></strong><span><strong>&#xA0;- entirely up to you - but much more importantly to pass on what may be the most important fact you ever learn (seriously).</strong>&#xA0;This is</span><span>&#xA0;the reason why I picked the charity I did, and why it&apos;d be a good one for you to donate to through this, or (what&apos;d make it important) for the rest of your life. It&apos;s that some charities are hundreds or even thousands of times better than others, that an excellent charity evaluator called </span><span><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a></span><span>&#xA0;picks these based on solid evidence, and that the one I&apos;ve picked cures children of horrible parasitic worms for around 20p each. This means that if you donate &#xA3;250 today you&apos;d spare a whole village from this suffering, for at least a year - and if you donated nothing else, this would likely do more good that anything else in your entire life, even including all the deeply important things you do for those you know. (I personally find that a startling, profound and challenging thought.)</span></p>\n<p><span>If you donate &#xA3;25,000 to the best charities over your life you&apos;d help a staggering number of people a great deal, doing more good than most ever do. Donate to other top charities and you&apos;d save many lives; if you saved someone in person, you&apos;d see it as something enormous, the greatest difference you ever made, and there&apos;s no less reason to do it when you can&apos;t see who you help. The numbers would scale as you donated ten times as much, and so on. And donating to charities which aren&apos;t quite as effective means that many more people suffer than otherwise would have. That&apos;s why these facts would be the most important ones you ever learn, if you act on them in any of these ways.</span></p>\n<p><span>The charity I picked is </span><span><a href=\"http://www.evidenceaction.org/dewormtheworld\">Deworm the World</a></span><span>. You can dig into it by reading the &#x200B;</span><span><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/deworming-charities.html\">short summary I wrote for Charity Science</a></span><span>, or &#x200B;</span><span><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative\">GiveWell&apos;s detailed review</a></span><span>. If you have any questions or concerns or thoughts about the charity or anything I&apos;ve said, there&apos;s nothing I&apos;d like more than to talk about them by email or Skype. Because it&apos;s so good you might want to consider making any sponsorship be your overall donation for the year, but in truth I don&apos;t care whether you donate through sponsoring me or not, and the important thing would be these facts influencing your future donations.</span></p>\n<p>I know this email is a strong sell, and heavy stuff; I&apos;m essentially doing what evangelists do. I wouldn&apos;t normally do this and have never sent an email like this before for anything, but I hope you can tell that the reason I&apos;m doing so this once is that I care passionately about it, and think that it would spare huge amounts of suffering if you acted on it, either now or throughout your life. I do promise never to bring it up again if you don&apos;t want to talk about it! I would love to hear what you&apos;re up to, and don&apos;t want fear of preaching to put you off ;)</p>\n<p><span>All the best,<br></span>Tom</p>\n</blockquote></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Tom_Ash"}}, {"_id": "BjXouszM4DbyfCDyf", "title": "One week left for CSER researcher applications", "postedAt": "2015-04-17T00:40:39.961Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>This is the last week to apply for one of four postdoctoral research positions at the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://cser.org/\">Centre for the Study of Existential Risk</a>.

Some readers remarked that it helped them understand impact purchases better, so I&apos;m cross-posting it here.</em></p>\n<p>I&apos;m excited to report that 50% of the impact of my <a href=\"/matching\">donation matching literature review</a> has just <a href=\"http://impactpurchase.org/2015/04/10/first-round-results/\">been purchased</a> in the first round of Paul Christiano and Katja Grace&apos;s <a href=\"http://impactpurchase.org/\">impact purchase</a>!</p>\n<p>This means that Paul and Katja now own 50% of the altruistic consequences of the post, so you should consider it only 50% as much of a good deed as you previously did.</p>\n<h3>Huh?</h3>\n<p>Paul and Katja are purchasing &quot;certificates of impact,&quot; which are a philanthropic instrument they invented. It&apos;s like funding someone to do something, except that instead of giving them money before they do the thing, you give them money <em>afterwards</em>.</p>\n<h3>Why is that better?</h3>\n<p>It helps to make an analogy to normal tradeable goods.</p>\n<p>Suppose I&apos;m buying a shirt. What I generally do is look at all the shirts that are available and then buy one. (Contrast this with the funding model that&apos;s normal for philanthropy, where I would pay someone money for a shirt, and <em>then</em> they would make it.)</p>\n<p>The normal market model puts most of the downside risk of shirt production on the seller. If my tailor runs out of cloth and can&apos;t make my shirt after all, then my tailor doesn&apos;t get to sell it so my tailor loses the money. This aligns incentives better: my tailor is likely to try harder to make a saleable shirt if they haven&apos;t gotten paid for the result yet. (For instance, Kickstarter products might experience fewer production delays and failures if sellers were only paid when their product shipped.)</p>\n<p>An even more important aspect of the normal market model is that it makes it much easier to decide what shirt you want. This isn&apos;t such a huge deal for shirts, where it&apos;s not so hard to predict <em>ex ante</em> how good the future shirt will be. It&apos;s much harder to do that in philanthropic funding!</p>\n<p>There&apos;s a much more in-depth explanation of why an impact purchase market would be helpful <a href=\"http://impactpurchase.org/why-certificates/\">on the website</a>.</p>\n<h3>How did the process work?</h3>\n<p>I applied through the form on Paul and Katja&apos;s website, giving a short description of the blog post, why I thought it had good consequences, and the minimum amount of money for which I would undo the post&apos;s impact.</p>\n<p>Then Paul and Katja made their own evaluation of how much each applicant project did, and ran a <a href=\"http://impactpurchase.org/the-auction/\">complicated yet nifty auction process</a> that ensured they would purchase the maximum amount of impact possible while ensuring that I was incentivized to report the true minimum price at which I would be willing to sell the post&apos;s impact.</p>\n<p>(The structure of the auction is such that my stated price for the post has no effect on what price Katja and Paul buy it at, only on whether or not it gets purchased. It&apos;s pretty cool.)</p>\n<h3>Isn&apos;t this basically Paul and Katja throwing money at you for no reason? Why would you name a minimum price greater than zero?</h3>\n<p>It&apos;s not free money for me, because I&apos;ve now been better incentivized to do things that Paul and Katja think are good for the world.</p>\n<p>Well, actually, right now, since Paul and Katja are the only buyers of impact purchases and the market is very thin, I think there&apos;s some free money to be had. For instance, if Paul and Katja discontinue the program at the end of the year and nobody else steps up, then the incentives will go away, and nobody will really care that much that once they bought 50% of one of my posts.</p>\n<p>Also, because there are so few entrants right now, impact is getting sold at a substantial markup--according to Paul and Katja&apos;s impact evaluations, the price at which they purchased impact from sellers this round was almost double what they could have gotten from donating to GiveWell top charities. But I don&apos;t expect that to continue.</p>\n<p>In the long term, though, impact purchases don&apos;t involve any money-throwing at all.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s easy to think they would, because at first it seems like Paul and Katja aren&apos;t really buying anything. The right to claim 50% of my post&apos;s impact doesn&apos;t seem worth that much because people might not play along. For instance, people might still give me close to 100% of the social status benefits from doing something altruistic.</p>\n<p>But actually, the more important thing Paul and Katja are buying is an incentive for me to do more stuff they&apos;d want to buy in the future. On this view, the point of giving them a claim to the post is to make sure that I can&apos;t sell more than 100% of it. (If I could do that, it would distort the market instead and lead to people getting <em>too much</em> incentive to do things.) The public notice that they own half of the consequences is simply a mechanism of enforcing this.</p>\n<p>So in the long term--if the impact purchase market grows--there&apos;s a very good reason for me to name a nonzero minimum price for my post, which is that I might think I could sell it later, or to someone else, for more money.</p>\n<h3>How was the experience? Would you do it again?</h3>\n<p>Yes! I think the impact purchase program is really cool, and could fill an important gap in what EA projects get funded/properly incentivized to get done. The application was very quick. (And on top of that, I got paid.)</p>\n<p>There&apos;s one round of purchases each month, and the next deadline is in a bit over a week on April 25.

These are based around sheets with a list of questions and relevant background; you can see examples of previous ones <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7BGumocZjekfjJXYVBaWWF6S0ZPN1czSVF5QVNnWUhORFpIWkw2Nms4RU9TOXhuU0FYa00&amp;authuser=0\">here</a>. (Thanks to Kelsey Piper for writing these!) At one point we planned to consistently provide a page of background on the other side of the sheet; we&apos;ve partially stopped doing so, as the background didn&apos;t seem to really guide the conversation.<br><br>First we have a few minutes to write down our answers to the questions on the sheet. We then go around the circle doing introductions, as specified at the top of the sheet. Then, for each question, we go around the circle and give our response to it.<br><br>Most of the interesting discussion happens as prompted by things people say when providing their answers. It&#x2019;s pretty loose: people ask you about your answer, and you respond to them, and the discussion kind of goes where it will. When it&#x2019;s gone on a long enough tangent, Kelsey moves the conversation along by asking the next person to give their answer to the question. This is a great way of ensuring that the conversation can stay roughly on track and everyone gets a chance to speak. Often meetups have a problem where new people don&#x2019;t know what to say; this goes some of the way to solving that.<br><br>These questionnaires also make the discussion more accessible to people who know less about effective altruism, because often it&#x2019;s easy to grasp the complex natures of questions like &#x201C;how much do you value IQ increases vs saving more lives&#x201D;. The Stanford EA meetup, like all meetups, occasionally veers pretty hard into jargon and confusing advanced territory, but Kelsey is able to somewhat restrain that by moving the conversation to the next person or next question. The background info on the sheets, when present, also helps.<br><br>It&#x2019;s rare that we actually make it all the way through the questions. Usually we discuss some aspects of a later question when talking about an earlier one, or we do a quick straw poll about a later one and don&#x2019;t discuss it further. Generally, the topics which lead to the most digressions are the more abstract or philosophical ones; when we talked about population ethics, we spent an hour and a half discussing the first question.<br><br>The meetup lasts for an hour and a half, after which most of us get dinner together. Dinner discussions tend to still be about EA topics, but instead about anything people who want to talk about. They also tend to be where we discuss/plan ideas for non-discussion meetings; the larger number of people allows the leaders to get better feedback on which future events should be run.<br><br>(Thanks to Buck Shlegeris for writing the first draft of this post; thanks to Kelsey for running the meetups and writing the discussion sheets; thanks to Alex Richard for revisions.)</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "MichaelDickens"}}, {"_id": "HeuEyKepQxe263K4M", "title": "Meetup : Geneva, Ethnobar", "postedAt": "2015-04-14T14:12:23.365Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/2l\">Geneva, Ethnobar</a></h2>\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHEN:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>15 April 2015 07:00:00PM (+0200)</span><br>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHERE:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>Rue des Deux-Ponts 2, 1205 Gen&#xE8;ve, Suisse</span>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .meta -->\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t    <div><p>Just a meetup for everyone interested, find more in our facebook group. :) facebook.com/groups/EAGeneva</p></div>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .content -->\n\t\t<h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/2l\">Geneva, Ethnobar</a></h2></body></html>", "user": {"username": "konrad"}}, {"_id": "zeoh5naxtW2fJMfKL", "title": "The role of time in comparing diverse benefits", "postedAt": "2015-04-13T20:18:52.049Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><span> &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><span><span> </span></span><span>Every week or so, the CEA office holds a lunch on a particular topic &#x2013; whether a presentation or just a discussion led by someone on a particular topic. Last week, the Global Priorities Project hosted one on how to compare very different goods, and I thought people on the forum might be interested in some of the considerations that came up. This is just a couple of the points which I remember being made &#x2013; it&#x2019;s not a defence of a particular view, or a particular person&#x2019;s stance. I did try to pick out a somewhat coherent thread to make it a more interesting post.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<h1><span>Time and units of benefit</span></h1>\n<p><span> &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><span><span> </span></span><span>One thing that makes it more difficult to compare between benefits is that they seem to have different natural units. That&#x2019;s just true because some ways of helping people improve their lives in different ways. It&#x2019;s also because different benefits seem to naturally manifest at different times.</span></p>\n<p><span>For example, say that I&#x2019;m trying to decide between treating TB or trying to reduce the impact that climate change will have in hundreds of years time. A natural way to compare these might seem to be to ask how many lives I could save over the next year by treating TB, and how many lives I could save in, say, 300 years time (in expectation) by reducing carbon emission. However, doing that wouldn&#x2019;t be comparing like to like. One reason is that treating TB this year would also have an impact on the state of the world in 300 years time. What that impact would be is very hard to determine. But so is the impact of a particular intervention aimed at reducing climate change&#x2019;s harm in hundreds of years time. Treating TB this year seems likely to have positive flow through effects on the future &#x2013; whether that&#x2019;s through economic benefit which lasts into the future, or the burden from TB being slightly reduced over the long-term. (Additionally, both of these would also make society more able to adapt to climate change.)</span></p>\n<p><span>So how should our reasoning change if we want to make sure that we compare like with like when it comes to interventions aimed at different time periods? One upshot is that it means that questions surrounding how many people will exist in the future are less important than we might have thought. If we compared how many lives we can save from TB next year to how many we could save from climate change in 300 years time, it would be very important how many people there are around in 300 years time to save. But if we take into account the fact that saving people from TB this year will have an impact in 300 years time too, comparing difference in effectiveness of the two interventions no longer depends straightforwardly on the number of people in the future, since the impact of both is likely to be higher, the more people there are in future.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<h1><span>Future consequences of benefits</span></h1>\n<p><span> &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><span><span> </span></span><span>The preceding section highlighted the importance of knowing whether interventions that are beneficial in the short term are likely to be beneficial in the long term. For the kinds of interventions we tend to consider &#x2013; ones that improve global health or increase education or income &#x2013; it seems plausible that this is the case. After all, if people are healthier or more educated they typically become richer, and which allows them to invest in more education and research in the future, and so on.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, we might want to question that assumption. We might think that it is not generally the case that current benefits increase the chance/quantity of future benefits, but that that is only the case in times of peace. If you&#x2019;re a nation at war with another nation, you are likely to want to the other nation to be less developed and poorer. However, overall wars seem less likely to happen if nations are more prosperous and resources are not scarce.</span></p>\n<p><span>A second reason for questioning the idea that current benefits will lead to future benefits is the fact that in nature populations tend to experience cycles. A population of rabbits might increase until the point where it was overstretching the food supply, at which point many would starve and the population would decrease. Or the increase in rabbits would be followed by foxes proliferating, which would shrink the rabbit population. If humans are relevantly similar to other species, perhaps we should expect that short term benefits to humanity will simply hasten a time when there is a lack of resources. One reason to think that humans are not relevantly similar to other species, however, is our capacity for adaptation. Far more than other animals, we are able to change which resources we use. Therefore it doesn&#x2019;t seem necessary that current benefits speed-up harm coming to us &#x2013; it seems more likely that (very broadly speaking) benefiting people today improves their future. An exception might be harm coming from advancing technology, which could be sped up if current benefits increase the rate of technological progress.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<h1><span>How uncertainty about interventions might affect our choices</span></h1>\n<p><span> &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><span><span> </span></span><span>Say that we thought that we could save more lives in 300 years than we can now, because we think there will be more people in 300 years. In that case, even if we think that treating TB now will have a positive effect in 300 years time, it seems likely that we would still want to opt for directly tackling climate change. After all, an intervention that is directly aiming at improving the state of the world in 300 years time seems more likely to do that than one which is aiming at helping people this year.</span></p>\n<p><span> &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;</span><span><span> </span></span><span>On the other hand, it seems very difficult to know how good interventions which aim to minimise the harm of climate change in 300 years time are. For one thing, we can&#x2019;t test their relative efficacies. On the other hand, we know quite a lot about health interventions and we certainly can test and compare them. Since that&#x2019;s the case, even if the average current health intervention was worse than the average future-oriented intervention, it might be that we would be better off supporting current health interventions. The reason is that we can tell which the best health interventions are, and we might expect those to be better than the average future-oriented interventions.</span></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Michelle_Hutchinson"}}, {"_id": "9YY6L8mySfc5HKwzH", "title": "Meetup : Brooklyn EA Gathering", "postedAt": "2015-04-13T00:07:47.159Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/2k\">Brooklyn EA Gathering</a></h2>\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHEN:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>18 April 2015 08:00:00PM (-0700)</span><br>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHERE:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>851 Park Place, Brooklyn NY 11216</span>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .meta -->\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t    <div><p>This week Peter Singer will in NYC, touring with his new Effective Altruism book &quot;The Most Good You Can Do.&quot; His book signing event is on Tuesday (with tickets at $25, which include a copy of the book).

(Unfortunately it is very expensive to get access to large datasets on book sales.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667996110/mirroredImages/vXkhEFLaqvcheLMZD/npbcb8zenyfr6cwylgwy.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 2: A sample power law distribution</p>\n<p>Power law distributions are characterised by an initial sharp decline, which then levels out into a long tail. As a result, <strong>the the best-selling books don\u2019t sell twice or three times as many copies as the median books, they sell thousands of times more copies.</strong></p>\n<p>Because of the shape of the distribution, the mean number of sales will also be far higher than the median. This means that the typical or median book sells relatively poorly. <strong>There are different estimates for how many copies the median book sells, but for professionally published books it is probably less than 1000 copies.</strong></p>\n<p>Bearing this in mind, it is predominantly the small chances of extraordinary success that bring up the mean or \u201cexpected\u201d number of book sales to more substantial numbers. <strong>Our goal must be to chase these much higher numbers.</strong></p>\n<h3>Publishers\u2019 Behaviour</h3>\n<p>Publishers have their own metrics for estimating a book\u2019s sales, using their own data and industry experience. Unfortunately we don\u2019t have access to these estimates from the publishers of the books in question. However, I have attempted to reconstruct these estimates using the following process:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Estimate the size of the advance given to each author, based on media reports, discussions with the authors and my own calculations. (I only know the exact size of William MacAskill\u2019s advance.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Apply the reverse of the \u201cpublisher\u2019s rule of thumb\u201d (which I have learned through my discussions). This is how publishers use their estimated sales to determine the size of the advance given.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong> These figures should be taken as mean best guesses only. </strong>Any errors in my estimate of the advances will scale with the publisher\u2019s formula applied, and in any case the size of the advance may be affected by other factors: for example, the size of William MacAskill\u2019s advance was partly the result of a bidding war between different publishing houses.</p>\n<p>So with that said, <strong>my best guess is that the publishers have estimated the following mean lifetime sales figures for each of the upcoming books:</strong></p>\n<div>\n<table>\n<colgroup> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> \n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Author</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Book</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Estimated Sales</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Peter Singer</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>The Most Good You Can Do</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>~20,000 copies</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Nick Cooney</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>How To Be Great At Doing Good</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>~10,000 copies</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>William MacAskill</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Doing Good Better</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>~60,000 copies</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Larissa MacFarquhar</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Strangers Drowning</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>~300,000 copies</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>Figure 3: Estimated mean sales based on publishers\u2019 rule of thumb.</p>\n<p><strong>Note that these are \u2018mean\u2019 lifetime estimates, not median lifetime estimates. We should expect all of the books to do significantly worse than this in the median case.</strong></p>\n<p>Based on this <strong>we should expect Larissa MacFarquhar\u2019s book to do significantly better than any of the other books</strong>, and potentially better than all of the other books combined. The only downside to this is that her book is the least directly about effective altruism. As a result, we will need to put extra effort into harnessing the interest and momentum built by this book in order to get people more interested in effective altruism.</p>\n<h2>2. How much can we boost the sales of these books through marketing?</h2>\n<p>The success of these books will depend on some combination of marketing (whether by the publisher, specialist marketing firms or vendors), word-of-mouth publicity (which is itself largely determined by the quality of the book) and luck. But how does the interaction between these lead to sales figures?</p>\n<p>I will now introduce a model that is often used to explain power-law distributions, which was suggested to me by Owen Cotton-Barratt.</p>\n<p>Say that five new books are published at pretty much the same time, including one of ours. Let\u2019s suppose that the total number of these books which our target demographic will buy is fixed: the question is how many of these purchases will be of our book rather than one of its rivals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667996110/mirroredImages/vXkhEFLaqvcheLMZD/mimvtwatnc82pc91fzm8.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Figure 4: A more complicated toy model of word of mouth influence on book sales.</p>\n<p>In this diagram, book sales are modelled as dots, with each colour corresponding to one of the five books. The initial distribution, shaded at the top, is based primarily on marketing - here it is assumed that the public buy one of each book.</p>\n<p>However, after this point the choice of book for each additional purchase is based on word of mouth, and it is a function of all previously purchased books. In the diagram, it\u2019s based at each stage on a random draw from the previous dots.</p>\n<p>When this process is repeated a large number of times for a large number of initially published books, the frequency of book purchases (or the colours of dots) is described by a power law distribution.</p>\n<p>Now in the real world, the chances of being recommended a book depend not just on the number of people who have read the book before, but also on the quality of the book. So we can add an extra variable to the model, which is the quality of each book.</p>\n<p>Book sales will be a function of n, the number of initial purchasers who bought the book (which depends on marketing), and j, the likelihood of this book being recommended above the others (which depends on quality).</p>\n<p>Working through this model, an increase in n leads to a linear increase in sales; however an increase in j leads to a superlinear increase in sales. <strong>This points towards quality having a greater impact than marketing. </strong></p>\n<p><strong>This model also shows the importance of luck to the process. </strong>In the diagram, the colour green had an equal chance of being picked after the initial distribution. However time after time it was not picked, purely by chance, and each time the chances of it being picked decreased. Marketing could plausibly improve the initial distribution and quality could increase the chances of being picked, but bad luck could bring it all to naught.</p>\n<h2>3. Once the sales figures come in, how confident can we be that our efforts made a difference?</h2>\n<p>Unfortunately, the answer to this is \u201cnot very\u201d. The exception is that if a book sells extremely poorly, we can be pretty sure it would have performed similarly poorly even if we had not marketed it, and that we had very little impact.</p>\n<p><strong> Presuming a reasonable degree of success, it is very difficult to establish how much of this is down to marketing, how much to quality and how much to luck.</strong></p>\n<p>There may well be anecdotal data which supports the idea that marketing has made a difference, but even this has limits. For example, one of the key drivers of sales of Nick Bostrom\u2019s Superintelligence was Elon Musk\u2019s tweet about the book. Now, during the marketing phase Nick and his team sent out dozens of copies to thought leaders, including to Elon Musk. But can we be sure that he read the book because of this? Perhaps word of mouth reached him instead? Perhaps it was some combination of the two? Even in a case like this, it is unclear whether the Future of Humanity Institute\u2019s marketing efforts really did make that difference.</p>\n<h2>4. What does the success or failure of these books mean for future publication attempts?</h2>\n<p>As this is our first foray into publishing, we have had to devote significant resources to learning about the publishing and book marketing worlds. As a result, regardless of whether the book sells well or not, <strong>I would expect that next time around we would need to devote fewer resources to the project.</strong></p>\n<p>Let\u2019s start by imagining that William MacAskill\u2019s book is successful. In this scenario, if he were to write another book he would be more likely to get a good book deal. Also publishers, vendors and the media would be likely to take him more seriously next time around.</p>\n<p>This would probably slightly improve the chances of this book also being a success. However, remember regression to the mean: if this book is particularly successful, we should expect his next book to do less well.</p>\n<p>What about if his books is unsuccessful? Unfortunately, as discussed above it would be difficult for us to determine to what extent this was caused by marketing, quality or luck. The publishers would most likely say that we had simply been unlucky: <strong>most authors do not publish successful books on their first attempt</strong>, and in fact it would be somewhat surprising if Will\u2019s first book was a major success.</p>\n<p>Book publishing is a very high variance industry, and success is to a large degree down to chance or at least factors outside our control. With this in mind, I do not think that a failed first book would be more than a small update against attempting to publish more books in future. I would certainly not be surprised if Will or Peter decided to publish another book, even if this one is not a success.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>As I\u2019ve explained above, the vast majority of books sell relatively poorly. The reason that we\u2019ve put our resources into supporting these authors is that there is a chance of them being among the few that sell extremely well. How well they do sell will depend on a combination of marketing, word of mouth and luck, although it\u2019s difficult to attribute success or failure between these factors.</p>\n<p><em> Many thanks to Owen Cotton-Barratt for suggesting the final model I use here, to William MacAskill, Rob Wiblin, Owen Cotton-Barratt and Kerry Vaughan for their thoughts on this piece, and to Peter Orr for extensive copy editing.</em></p>", "user": {"username": "Niel_Bowerman"}}, {"_id": "9wAj5SQMXBx772gTw", "title": "Meetup : Potluck & Discussion", "postedAt": "2015-04-10T14:55:37.789Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/2j\">Potluck &amp; Discussion</a></h2>\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHEN:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>18 April 2015 12:00:00PM (-0500)</span><br>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHERE:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>3136 Patty Lane, Middleton, WI 53562</span>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .meta -->\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t    <div><p>We will be having a potluck and discussion.

Paul&apos;s involvement in SPARC made&#xA0;buying&#xA0;teaching there complicated, and it&#xA0;would already have been&#xA0;difficult&#xA0;to separate the teaching from&#xA0;others&apos;&#xA0;work on SPARC.&#xA0;Inducing the translation of papers also seemed too hard to separate from actually translating the papers, without much more access to exactly what happened between the participants.&#xA0;The value of mentoring EAs seemed too hard to assess.</p>\n<h4>Purchased projects</h4>\n<p>We evaluated the other five projects, and it looked as if we would buy the two that we did. We then&#xA0;evaluated those two somewhat more thoroughly.&#xA0;Here are summaries of our&#xA0;evaluations for them.</p>\n<h5>Ben Kuhn&apos;s blog post on donation matching</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>We estimate that EAs and&#xA0;other related groups move around $500k annually through donation matching. We are thinking of drives run by MIRI, CFAR, GiveDirectly, Charity Science, Good Ventures,&#xA0;among&#xA0;others.</li>\n<li>We think a full and clear&#xA0;understanding of donation matching would improve this by around&#xA0;$6k, through such drives being better optimized. We lowered this figure&#xA0;to account for the data being less relevant to some matching drives, and costs and inefficiencies in the information being spread.</li>\n<li>We think this work constitutes around 1/30th of&#xA0;a&#xA0;full and clear understanding of donation matching.</li>\n<li>We&#xA0;used a time horizon of three years, though in retrospect it probably should have been longer. This implicitly included some general concerns about the fraction of people who have seen it being smaller in the future, and&#xA0;information accruing from other sources and conditions changing, and so on.</li>\n<li>We get $6,000 * 3 years / 30 = $600 of stimulated EA donations</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Oliver Habryka&apos;s organization of HPMOR wrap parties</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>We estimate that around 1300 people went to wrap parties (adjusted somewhat for how long they were there for). This was based on&#xA0;examining the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ltd/hpmor_wrap_parties_resources_information_and/\">list of events</a> and their purported attendances, and a few quick checks for verification.</li>\n<li>We estimated&#xA0;Oliver&apos;s impact was 1/4 of the impact of the wrap parties. We estimated that the existence of cental organization doubled the scale of the event, and we attributed half of that credit to the central organization and half of the credit to&#xA0;other&#xA0;local organizers&#xA0;and non-organizational inputs (which also had to scale up).</li>\n<li>We estimated that the attendance of an additional person was worth&#xA0;around&#xA0;$15 of stimulated EA donations. This was a guess based on a few different lines of reasoning.&#xA0;We estimated the&#xA0;value of the&#xA0;EA/LW community in stimulated donations, the value of annual growth,&#xA0;and the fraction of that growth that comes from outreach (as opposed to improving the EA product, or&#xA0;natural social contact), and the fraction of outreach that came from the wrap parties. We also guessed what fraction of people&#xA0;were new, and would become more involved in the EA/LW community as a result, and would end up doing more useful things on our values as a result of that. We sanity checked these numbers&#xA0;against the kind of value participants probably got from the celebration individually.</li>\n<li>Thus we have 1300 * 15 /4 = $4,875 of stimulated EA donations, which we rounded up to $5,000.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note that while we evaluated&#xA0;both items in terms of dollars of stimulated EA donations, these numbers don&apos;t have much to do with real dollars in the auction&#x2014;their only relevance is in deciding the ratio of value between different projects. So systematic errors one way or the other won&apos;t much matter.</p>\n<h3>Notes on our&#xA0;experience</h3>\n<h4>Quick estimates</h4>\n<p>It was tough&#xA0;to evaluate things fast enough to be worth it given how little we were&#xA0;spending, while also being meaningfully&#xA0;accurate. To some extent this is just a problem with funding small, inhomogeneous projects.&#xA0;But we think it&#xA0;will get better in the future for a few&#xA0;reasons, if we or others do more of this kind of thing:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Having a reference class of similar things that are already evaluated makes it much easier to evaluate a new project. You can tell how much to spend on a bottle of ketchup because&#xA0;you have many similar ketchup options which you have already judged to be basically worth buying, and so you mostly just have to judge whether it is worth an extra $0.10 for less sugar or more food dye or whatever. If you had never bought food&#xA0;before and had to figure out from first principles how much&#xA0;a bottle of ketchup would improve your long term goals,&#xA0;you would have more trouble. Similarly,&#xA0;if we had established going prices for different kinds of research blogging, it would be easier to evaluate Ben&apos;s post relative to nearby alternatives.</li>\n<li>We will cache many parts of the analysis that come up often. e.g. how much is&#xA0;it worth to attract a new person to the EA movement? And only make comparisons between similar activities.</li>\n<li>We will get better with practice.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Shared responsibility</h4>\n<p>We <a href=\"http://impactpurchase.org/restrictions-2/\">said</a> we would not buy certificates for collaborative projects unless the subset of people applying had been explicitly allocated a share of responsibility for the project. Collaborative versus not&#xA0;turned out to be&#xA0;a fairly&#xA0;unclear&#xA0;distinction.&#xA0;No&#xA0;project was&#xA0;creating objects of ultimate&#xA0;value directly; so all of these projects are instrumental steps, to be combined with other people&apos;s instrumental steps, to make further, bigger instrumental steps.&#xA0;Is a donation to GiveDirectly its own project, or is it part of a collaboration with GiveDirectly and their other donors? Happily, we don&apos;t care. We&#xA0;just want to be able to evaluate the thing we are buying. So we were willing to purchase a donation to GiveDirectly from the donor, but not to purchase the output of a cash transfer from a GiveDirectly donor. In some cases it is hard to assess the value of one intermediate step in isolation, and then will be less likely to purchase it (or will purchase it only at a discount).</p>\n<h3>Call for more proposals</h3>\n<p>The next deadline will be April 25.

Most recently, Eric Posner of Slate&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/view_from_chicago/2015/03/effective_altruism_critique_few_charities_stand_up_to_rational_evaluation.html\">has opined against this idea</a>&#xA0;on the grounds that children living in other countries are almost always more needy than First-World Little-Leaguers, and &#x201C;[d]onating to Little League [should] not make you a moral monster.&#x201D; And while I agree with his quip, I think he has&#xA0;fundamentally misunderstood effective altruism, at least as it is practiced by the people I know.</p>\n<p>Posner&#x2019;s critique comes in two parts. First, he&#xA0;is pessimistic that&#xA0;any&#xA0;altruism can be effective, concluding, &#x201C;The most good you can do may turn out to be&#x2014;not much.&#x201D; He cites several&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w11513\">studies</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/2/255.short\">critical</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0143038826/\">of</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-008-9032-8\">aid</a>&#xA0;and references&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/25/world/africa/mosquito-nets-for-malaria-spawn-new-epidemic-overfishing.html\">a recent&#xA0;New York Times&#xA0;story</a>&#xA0;about insecticide-treated bednets (intended to be hung over beds to deter malaria-carrying mosquitoes and often touted as one of the most cost-effective public-health interventions) being misused as fishing nets, poisoning lakes and rivers.</p>\n<p>But these failures of aid&#xA0;highlight&#xA0;the importance of institutions like&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>, whose rigorous research avoids Posner&#x2019;s pitfalls. Long before the&#xA0;Times&#xA0;broke their story about bednet misuse,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#followup\">GiveWell researchers investigated</a>&#xA0;whether bednets were&#xA0;actually&#xA0;hung up properly 6, 15, and 24 months after distribution; in fact, one of the reasons GiveWell&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF\">recommended the Against Malaria Foundation</a>&#xA0;(AMF) over other net distributors is that the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/02/05/putting-the-problem-of-bed-nets-used-for-fishing-in-perspective/\">AMF relies on in-person, unannounced checks, instead of self-reported surveys</a>&#xA0;to gauge net use.&#xA0;(The AMF, through malaria-education programs and these unannounced checks, achieves proper-usage rates of&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2015/02/05/putting-the-problem-of-bed-nets-used-for-fishing-in-perspective/\">80 to 90 percent</a>, with misuse rates half those of other net distributors.)</p>\n<p>Posner makes further arguments about the efficacy of aid that certainly merit empirical discussion, but in many ways, the more interesting critique in his piece is the moral one. To quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Suppose you donate $5,000 to the local Little League so that it can buy baseball equipment for poor children. You might feel good about yourself, but an effective altruist will realize that this amount of money could be used to buy malaria nets or medicine that would save as many as five lives&#xA0;in a poor country. Then you should ask yourself: Which is better, some kids playing baseball or some kids getting a chance at life? Or put differently, should you really let children in Niger die so that some First World kids get to play baseball?</p>\n<p>This, of course, was the point of the story I began with, in which a person chooses to remove garbage from the pond rather than save the child. If we think that person is a monster, then we should regard nearly everyone as monsters. All of us who donate money to Little League baseball, environmental causes, schools, universities, and art museums are moral monsters because we don&#x2019;t use that money to provide live-saving health care to the poorest people in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Posner disagrees and is convinced that this tendency toward scrupulosity is enough of an issue that we should abandon the concept of effectiveness in altruism entirely. His critique, though, is not a new one&#x2014;several effective altruists are&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unequallyyoked/2014/08/purity-anxiety-and-effective-altruism.html\">also</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2015/03/23/in-praise-of-ineffective-altruism/\">concerned</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2014/10/aim-high-even-if-you-fall-short.html\">about</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/10/infinite-debt/\">scrupulosity</a>, and many of them have shared stories from their own lives about balancing giving effectively against more personal cares. For me, these stories are important because they demonstrate that caring about effective opportunities to do good is not mutually exclusive with making the world better in other ways you choose.</p>\n<p>First, Holden Karnofsky, co-founder of GiveWell,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/20/excited-altruism/\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[S]uch people fundamentally misunderstand effective altruism &#x2026; [T]hey imagine that we have passions for particular causes, and are trying to submerge our passions in the service of rationality. That isn&#x2019;t the case. Rather,&#xA0;effective altruism is what we are passionate about. We&#x2019;re excited by the idea of making the most of our resources and helping others as much as possible&#x2026;</p>\n<p>[T]his doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m willing to give up everything else I value and enjoy for effective altruism&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not. But when I&#x2019;m engaged in altruism-oriented activities, I want to be fully engaged.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#x201C;There&#x2019;s absolutely nothing unusual,&#x201D;&#xA0;he writes in the same essay, &#x201C;about caring a great deal about such an interest; giving up some tangible things &#x2026; and using intellectual reasoning in pursuing [it].&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Kaj Sotala,&#xA0;<a href=\"/ea/8h/effective_altruism_as_the_most_exciting_cause_in/\">writing on the Effective Altruism Forum</a>, a community blog, also sees the central message of effective altruism as one of&#xA0;opportunity, not of obligation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Growing up &#x2026; the message I got from society was: one person just can&#x2019;t do much. The problems in the world are huge and structural, and naive reformers will eventually just become disillusioned and burn out. We can try to make small efforts in our personal lives, but they&#x2019;re tiny and won&#x2019;t scale.</p>\n<p>Effective altruism says that this doesn&#x2019;t need to be true! Yes, some of the problems are huge and structural, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean that individuals can&#x2019;t have a big impact. The average person working in an ordinary job can potentially save&#xA0;several lives a year, just by donating a&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/what-you-can-achieve\">measly 10% of her income</a>! That would already be amazing by itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A year ago,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.rossry.net/tag/ogps/\">I volunteered to co-coach an afterschool robotics club</a>&#xA0;in an inner-city Boston middle school. It was an enormously rewarding experience&#x2014;but at times, I did find myself asking whether I was really going to have any lasting impact on those eight students&#x2019; lives. By contrast, when&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.rossry.net/nontrivially-improved-future/\">I decided to donate ten percent</a>&#xA0;of my summer internship&#x2019;s salary to&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell&#x2019;s top recommended charities</a>, I felt less of a warm glow, but was much more sure my choice had actually changed the lives of the people it touched.&#xA0;And that, it seemed, was closer to the real point of altruism&#x2014;after all, was I in this to help other people, or to make myself feel good?</p>\n<p>Is there something wrong with donating uniforms instead of balls to the Little League, since you are more likely to feel a swell of pride when you see them take the field wearing the gift you gave them?</p>\n<p>Or, assuming you do have&#xA0;passions and&#xA0;connections&#xA0;in your local community,&#xA0;does effective altruism leave a way to balance the personal with the effective?&#xA0;Is there any time to, say, bake cookies for a friend, if that time could instead be spent in the office, earning money to donate to those in need? Are you morally monstrous for not abandonning your friends entirely for the more needy?</p>\n<p>Leah Libresco, an effective altruist, blogger, and news writer for FiveThirtyEight,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unequallyyoked/2015/03/effective-altruism-ethically-questionable-cookies.html\">asks this very question</a>,&#xA0;and explains where she finds her balance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I also care about&#xA0;offering an icon of the world I want to build.&#xA0;On the day that malaria joins smallpox and rinderpest in the graveyard of eradicated diseases, I&#x2019;ll be happy, but not satisfied. I want people to have freedom from disease and crippling poverty so they have more freedom to live with and for others. I want to put some, but not all of my resources to building up the lower levels of&#xA0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\">Maslow&#x2019;s hierarchy</a>, but I want to reserve something to build up and live the kind of life I want people to have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/unequallyyoked/2015/03/7qt-matched-donations-fiancees-and-symmetries.html#qt1\">Elsewhere</a>, Libresco says of her decision to donate to a friend&#x2019;s medical fundraiser:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I gave to their fundraiser and then matched the donation with one to Against Malaria&#x2014;GiveWell&#x2019;s top ranked charity&#x2014;so that the need of people I already know and care for can be a spur to give to people I don&#x2019;t (and won&#x2019;t) know personally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And most effective altruists, whom Posner would stereotype as sacrificing everything in life to blindly maximize their ability to donate, turn the same philosophy of balance to life&#x2019;s largest decisions as well. Julia Wise, an effective altruist blogger and social worker,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/cheerfully.html\">describes her choice with her husband to have a child</a>, even knowing that the expense would leave them less able to donate to the causes they support:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Immediately after we gave ourselves permission to be parents, I was excited about the future again&#x2026; And I suspect that feeling of satisfaction with my own life lets me be more help to the world than I would have as a broken-down altruist.</p>\n<p>So test your boundaries, and see what changes you can make that will help others without costing you too dearly. But when you find something is making you bitter, stop. Effective altruism is not about driving yourself to a breakdown. We don&#x2019;t need people making sacrifices that leave them drained and miserable. We need people who can [, as in the traditional Quaker saying,] &#x201C;walk cheerfully over the world,&#x201D;&#xA0;or at least do their damnedest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2014/03/the-other-mother.html\">Elsewhere</a>, Wise explains how motherhood has given her new ways to think about caring for those whom she can help and strengthened her commitment to effective altruism.</p>\n<p>***</p>\n<p>Effective altruism, for Karnofsky, Solata, Libresco, Wise, and for me, is an opportunity and a question (I can help! How and where am I needed?), not an obligation and an ideology (You are a monster unless you help&#xA0;this way!), and it certainly does not demand that you sacrifice your own happiness to utilitarian ends. It doesn&#x2019;t ask anyone to &#x201C;give until it hurts&#x201D;; an important piece of living to help others is setting aside enough money to live comfortably (and&#xA0;happily) first,&#xA0;and not feeling bad about living on that. Obviously, if you are aspiring to do good, you shouldn&#x2019;t throw your money away thoughtlessly (since $10 saved&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/Donation.aspx\">can buy bednets</a>&#xA0;to protect a family of four), but every effective altruist I know does set aside some piece of their personal budget for no other purpose than keeping themselves&#x2014;and those around them&#x2014;happy. And since giving money away is one of&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_norton_how_to_buy_happiness\">the</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/thisemotionallife/blogs/can-money-really-buy-happiness\">best</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/6078101/giving-money-away-makes-us-happy\">ways</a>&#xA0;to buy happiness, then yes&#x2014;that includes donating to the Little League!</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "uX8p2MrTY6zxh8vHP", "title": "Meetup : 35th .impact projects meeting", "postedAt": "2015-04-09T04:31:03.760Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/2i\">35th .impact projects meeting</a></h2>\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHEN:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>10 May 2015 04:00:00PM (-0500)</span><br>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHERE:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>Tower of London</span>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .meta -->\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t    <div><p>On Sunday, May 10th at 9pm UTC (2pm Pacific, 5pm Eastern, 9pm London), we&apos;ll be having our monthly meeting (usually ~90min) about project updates and any new ideas people might be thinking about!</p>\n\n<p>Find the event here: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/894854557223374/\">https://www.facebook.com/events/894854557223374/</a></p>\n\n<p>(.impact is a community of EA volunteers from all over the world who work together on altruistic projects.

We believe the following principles, which are subject to revision as deemed necessary, will help us do this.</p>\n<p><strong>We value action</strong></p>\n<p>We find &#x201C;help people&#x201D; is often a more useful actionable principle than &#x201C;optimally help people.&#x201D; There appear to be many worthwhile tasks which can be fairly easily accomplished simply by motivating and guiding people to accomplish them.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>We value effectiveness</strong></p>\n<p>We encourage and promote projects according to our expectations of their impact and probability of success. We vet and brainstorm ideas before putting them into action. We use <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/2013/04/04/the-lean-nonprofit/\">lean methodology</a> to get things out quickly and then decide whether to expand, pivot, or end a project.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>We value transparency </strong></p>\n<p>Our meetings are <a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/Meeting-Notes-ehPmJqlokpH\">documented</a> and our published work is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source\">open source</a> or <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/about/cc0\">creative commons</a>.

This article is intended to be a single point of reference for all those conversations, as well as sparking input from other people who know about the subject.</p>\n<p>My answer is usually:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Salary differences between languages are small enough that you should care more about other aspects of the process (e.g. if the boot camp makes guarantees about you getting a job) more than the specific language, but</li>\n<li>Front-end (developing things that the user sees) pays less than backend</li>\n<li>Keep standard 80,000 Hours advice in mind, like that it&apos;s better to explore many options in the beginning of your career than optimize for just one</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>More Detail</h1>\n<p>Below is a table of programming language popularity (taken from <a href=\"http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html\">TIOBE</a>) along with data from two salary surveys. You can see that the variance within one language across the different surveys is about the same as the difference across languages within one survey (119 vs. 131/76), which indicates that geographic factors, company size/type, years of experience etc. are probably more of a concern than the specific language. This fits with my anecdotal experience.</p>\n<p>The argument for backend development is mostly due to oversupply of front-end developers: there are a lot of graphic designers, artists etc. who learn a little bit of HTML and JavaScript so that they can get a job doing front-end. There&#x2019;s also <a href=\"http://blog.startupcompass.co/how-much-should-you-pay-your-engineers\">some evidence</a> that backend developers get paid more.</p>\n<p>The second programming language you learn will be vastly easier than the first, and most developers will switch between languages throughout their career, so you should not feel that this first choice is locking you in.</p>\n<p>I&apos;ve bolded the ones which are most commonly taught as a &quot;first language&quot;.</p>\n<table>\n<colgroup><col> <col> <col> <col> </colgroup> \n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Popularity Rank</td>\n<td>Programming Language</td>\n<td>Relative popularity</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://tech.co/highest-paying-programming-languages-2015-03\">Average salary (Compass survey) (in $thousands)</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/best-tech-skills-resume-ranked-salary-2014-11\">Average salary (Quartz survey) (in $thousands)</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>C</td>\n<td>16.64%</td>\n<td>100</td>\n<td>90</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td><strong>Java</strong></td>\n<td>15.58%</td>\n<td>90</td>\n<td>95</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Objective-C</td>\n<td>6.69%</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n<td>108</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>C++</td>\n<td>6.64%</td>\n<td>110</td>\n<td>94</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td><strong>C#</strong></td>\n<td>4.92%</td>\n<td>92</td>\n<td>89</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>PHP</td>\n<td>4.00%</td>\n<td>76</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7</td>\n<td><strong>JavaScript</strong></td>\n<td>3.63%</td>\n<td>78</td>\n<td>91</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8</td>\n<td><strong>Python</strong></td>\n<td>2.61%</td>\n<td>102</td>\n<td>101</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9</td>\n<td>Visual Basic .NET</td>\n<td>2.33%</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td>Visual Basic</td>\n<td>1.95%</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n<td>86</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td>F#</td>\n<td>1.51%</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td>Perl</td>\n<td>1.33%</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n<td>82</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td>Delphi/Object Pascal</td>\n<td>1.15%</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td>Transact-SQL</td>\n<td>1.15%</td>\n<td>80</td>\n<td>86</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td>Pascal</td>\n<td>1.09%</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td>ABAP</td>\n<td>1.08%</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td>PL/SQL</td>\n<td>1.03%</td>\n<td>80</td>\n<td>86</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td><strong>Ruby</strong></td>\n<td>1.03%</td>\n<td>90</td>\n<td>109</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td>MATLAB</td>\n<td>1.00%</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td>R</td>\n<td>0.95%</td>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n<td>90</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Ben_West"}}, {"_id": "f7dAQKDpMvobeRiZ7", "title": "Best way to invest with leverage?", "postedAt": "2015-04-02T11:04:49.951Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Altruists who don&apos;t care too much about risk (and <a title=\"&quot;Why Young People Should Buy Stocks on Margin&quot;\" href=\"http://content.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1982327,00.html\">young people</a>&#xA0;<a title=\"&quot;Early Retirement Using Leveraged Investments&quot;\" href=\"http://gosset.wharton.upenn.edu/research/retirement.pdf\">in general</a>) should plausibly use leveraged investing.

This reflects income levels at which people often can\u2019t afford basic health care. All money raised goes to buy medicines that cost only 50 cents.

If those dates don\u2019t work for you you can set your own. For example, if you're at a US university you can choose to do it on April 6-8, when some American college groups are doing it.<br> <strong>What you can vary:</strong> Any of this: the amount you spend, the number of days and the date.

These parasites live inside your body and suck your blood. The effects include fatigue, bloody diarrhoea, fever, chills, and other such lovely symptoms. Rather understandably, being so ill leads to many sick days from school and work. In fact, this is why deworming is arguably one of the most cost-effective ways to give children an education, among other things (<a href=\"http://www.poverty-action.org/sites/default/files/miguel_worms.pdf\">Miguel and Kremer 2004</a>&nbsp;found that it led to a 25% reduction in school absenteeism, although this is a difficult effect to pin down; for more details, see <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming#Whatarethebenefitsofmassdeworming\">this from GiveWell</a>).</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Effective altruists will be familiar with the case for fundraising for Deworm the World, as one of the charities that GiveWell recommends as the most effective in the world. Deworming drugs themselves cost around 50 cents, a figure we find works well for marketing, and they can cure someone for a year. For more information see&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative\">GiveWell's detailed review</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/deworming-charities.html\">Charity Science's simpler summary</a>.&nbsp;</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667994761/mirroredImages/6s27dyv4jLYxSxFp3/bxfzcmryjwrmlpgcdmpg.png\" alt=\"cost effectiveness of deworming\"><br></div>\n<h1>What could you possibly eat for only $2.50 a day?</h1>\n<br> Not much. But that\u2019s kind of the point. It\u2019s to get a sense of how limiting $2.50 is. It\u2019s like running a marathon for charity, but a lot more related. <br> <br> However, it\u2019s not all abstinence. (That\u2019s reserved for the people taking the challenge mode who will spend only $1.50 a day.) Here\u2019s a few cheap meals people have tried in the past:<br> \n<ul>\n<li>Rice, beans, and spices or soy sauce</li>\n<li>Butternut squash pasta</li>\n<li>Ramen noodles (always a guilty pleasure anyway)</li>\n<li>Oatmeal with chopped banana</li>\n</ul>\nThings you\u2019ll have to give up:<br> \n<ul>\n<li>Starbucks or buying coffee out</li>\n<li>Restaurants</li>\n<li>Alcoholic drinks</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>What are the rules?</h1>\n<span>The spirit of the event involves getting a (very rough) experience of poverty, and to ultimately make it so that fewer people have to have similar experiences. As long as it is done in this spirit, do what works for you. If you need to spend a bit more money, you can set your own amount. If you can\u2019t do it on April 22-24, do a different time. If you lapse during your three days, it\u2019s OK. You might even want to mention it on Facebook, talking about how difficult it was. It will help people understand how hard poverty is.<br>\n<h1><span>Why $2.50?</span></h1>\n<br> Half of the world lives on less than $1,368 a year. Around 65% of that is spent on food, which means $2.43 a day. We rounded to $2.50 a day because round numbers are nicer, but you can spend only $2.43 if you\u2019d like. <br> <br> You might have traveled to a poor country and know that you can buy more for $2.50 overseas. This is a good point, which is why the $2.43 figure is adjusted to how much $2.43 could buy in the USA in 2005. That\u2019s not much. Now imagine that you have to use the remaining $1.75 per day on shelter, transport, healthcare, and entertainment. That\u2019s why we\u2019re running this campaign. Because that\u2019s just too little and we want to change it. <br> <br>\n<h1>Challenge Mode: live on $1.50</h1>\nYawn. $2.50? You already did that in college. Well worry not my frugal friend, there is a challenge mode! $1.50 a day is roughly the international poverty line, so why not try to live on only that for 3 days? <br> <br> Why do the challenge mode?<br> <br> \n<ul>\n<li>People raise more when they suffer more. Yes, they did a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3613749/\">study</a> on this, and yes, people are strange creatures.</li>\n<li>You\u2019ll get a better sense of what extreme poverty is like.</li>\n<li>You\u2019ll get an e-high five from the Experience Poverty team.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>What if I live outside the US?</h1>\nWe have separate pages with different currencies for the following countries:<br> \n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://canadaexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">The US</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://canadaexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Canada</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ukexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">The UK</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ozexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Australia</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://swissexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Switzerland</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://sweexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">Sweden</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://euroexperiencepoverty.causevox.com/signup\">The Eurozone</a></li>\n</ul>\nIf you don\u2019t live in any of those countries then you can either join the US page which will let your friends donate in dollars or you can <a href=\"mailto:mailto:tom@charityscience.com\">email us</a> to see if we can add your country.

I&#x2019;ll describe these incentives first, and then below I&#x2019;ll give an example of how groups can arrange events to support sales.</p>\n<p>Groups or individuals that purchase 3, 5, 15, or 50 books will qualify for different prizes:</p>\n<h3>3 or more copies: Invitation to exclusive live-streamed Q&amp;A forum</h3>\n<p>Peter Singer will hold an exclusive online Q&amp;A forum in late April for participants in this program. Each set of three books will earn one individual sign-in invitation to the Q&amp;A forum. (Details of the forum will be finalized and shared with participants in the next few weeks.)</p>\n<h3>5 or more copies: Get a book copy customized and signed by Peter</h3>\n<p>One specially-marked &#x201C;supporter&#x201D; edition of the book&#x2019;s dust jacket will be signed by Peter and sent for each five copies purchased. This will fit the hardcover edition of the book, not the paperback edition being distributed in Australia and New Zealand. (Peter will sign this during his tour in mid-April, so please send an estimate of the count to <a href=\"mailto:chris@centreforeffectivealtruism.org\">chris@centreforeffectivealtruism.org</a> by 4/10 if you&#x2019;re planning to claim this.)</p>\n<h3>15 or more copies: Personalised career decision analysis by 80,000 Hours (1 per 15 copies; limited to 20 total across the whole promotion)</h3>\n<p>80,000 Hours will sometimes provide career decision analysis services, but limits the service by prioritizing clients by impact and charging a substantial fee. At the 15-book level, they will waive the fee and consult with you or anyone you designate to put together an individualized career decision analysis report. (It could be useful to consider who in your EA circles would benefit most from this.) This can be held onto to use at a later date, so we would recommend using this when you or the designee has a major career decision to make in the future.</p>\n<p><em>This level also includes the levels above: five invitations to the Q&amp;A forum and three signed &#x201C;supporter&#x201D; dust jackets.</em></p>\n<h3>50 or more copies: Peter talks with you or your group via Skype</h3>\n<p>For groups or individuals responsible for selling 50 books, Peter Singer will arrange to hold a conversation or Q&amp;A with your group via Skype after his book tour is completed. This could be a great way to create a major event to grow a smaller meetup group or keep your membership engaged. (Offered no more than once per group.)&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>This level also includes the levels above: invitations to the Q&amp;A forum for sixteen members, ten signed &#x201C;supporter&#x201D; dust jackets, and three separate offers of personalized career decision analysis (if the limit of 20 has not been reached).</em></p>\n<h3>How to participate</h3>\n<p>We would like to stay in touch with all of the local groups and individuals who are working on this promotion, so please let me know if you&#x2019;re thinking about setting up a book-selling event. If you&#x2019;re looking for ideas about how to make the promotion work, we can provide feedback and compare strategies across groups. Please write to the promotion&#x2019;s organizer, Chris Jenkins, at <a href=\"mailto:chris@centreforeffectivealtruism.org\">chris@centreforeffectivealtruism.org</a> if you&#x2019;re participating or considering an event plan!</p>\n<p>For prize claims, please hold onto your receipts (for online orders, this can be printed as PDFs) and write to us at <a href=\"mailto:prizes@centreforeffectivealtruism.org\">prizes@centreforeffectivealtruism.org</a>. If you would like more information about any of these plans or would like to discuss your own plans with us at the Centre for Effective Altruism, please let us know!</p>\n<h3>EA groups: starting a book-selling event</h3>\n<p>The easiest way to do this if you have an active EA chapter or meet-up is to hold an event with an admission fee and give out copies of the book there. We can talk with you about planning and promoting these events as we communicate with other local groups about their approaches: please email Chris at <a href=\"mailto:chris@centreforeffectivealtruism.org\">chris@centreforeffectivealtruism.org</a>!</p>\n<h3>Duration of the promotion</h3>\n<p>For claiming signed book jackets, please estimate the number you expect to claim and provide your estimate by Friday, 4/10/2015. For all other prizes, please stay in touch about your plans during the promotion, and be ready to send your receipts to <a href=\"mailto:prizes@centreforeffectivealtruism.org\">prizes@centreforeffectivealtruism.org</a> by Tuesday, 4/21/2015.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!

If you think that my last one is not ideal for your audience, then you can link them this one. I also published it <a href=\"http://claviger.net/effective-altruism-101.html\">on my own blog</a> including a video that I can&#x2019;t embed here.</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>If you want to do as much good as possible with your donations and other resources, then you may already be part of the effective altruism movement. The following ideas are central to the&#xA0;movement:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Top charities make it cheap and easy for us to have a huge positive impact because they are ten, a hundred, or a thousand times more cost-effective than other charities.<sup><a href=\"#fn:dcp2\">1</a></sup><sup><a href=\"#fn:to-imp\">2</a></sup></li>\n<li>Hence, it is typically more important <em>where</em> we give than <em>what</em> we give, and empirical, scientific research lends great confidence to these giving&#xA0;decisions.</li>\n<li>Consequently, most of us have the ability to save lives without even having to change our line of&#xA0;work.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The following sections will explain these points in more detail, and the final one will give an overview of the&#xA0;movement.</p>\n<h2>Cost-Effectiveness</h2>\n<p>As children and probably as adults, most of us have wished to be life-savers and heroes like Batman, Blossom, or Buffy Summers&#x2014;to leave a mark on the world and an eminently good one at that. If they weren&#x2019;t fictional, these heroes could look back on their lives, see the permanent change for the better that they have effected, and feel proud of a life well&#xA0;lived.</p>\n<p>Now some people discover a knack for professions such as doctor or lifeguard, others make inventions that improve the lives of millions, but none of these vocations have a monopoly on great positive&#xA0;impact.</p>\n<p>The secret is one that every martial artist knows. If you&#x2019;re in a fight with mighty opponents such as extreme poverty, disease, and malnutrition in far-away countries, you might be tempted to beat them with pure force&#x2014;because, in fact, you have a lot of that. Most people who are likely to read this will have a one-in-ten, one-in-a-hundred, or even rarer <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i\">innate gift for giving</a> simply thanks to being born in a developed country with high earning potential, infrastructure, social security, a working health system, and much&#xA0;more.</p>\n<p>Yet, if you want to win the fight with force alone it is still possible that your opponents will be stronger. Instead you can use your training: You elegantly side-step their attacks, anticipate the vectors of their momenta, and then throw them with just a gentle touch. That is what top charities allow us to&#xA0;achieve.</p>\n<p>Top cost-effective charities, such as the ones listed below, provide the techniques that allow any donor to amplify their impact to the point where a few thousand dollar suffice to save a life. Thanks to them, effective altruism has been a breakthrough for many of us. In some cases we didn&#x2019;t know what impact our donations had, if any. In other cases we were used to being able to do some good with our donations. But by optimizing the cost-effectiveness of our altruism, we found that we could do as much good with a fraction of the money and have enough left to add orders of magnitude more good on top.</p>\n<p>Moreover, since they are among the best investments we can make with our money, these exciting opportunities have in many cases enticed us into donating more in addition to donating better and even choosing higher-earning careers to maximize what we can give&#x2014;all the while saving more lives and feeling exuberant about&#xA0;it!</p>\n<h2>Intervention&#xA0;Prioritization</h2>\n<p>How can you achieve such an enormous boost to your altruism?&#xA0;Science!</p>\n<p>Cause areas such as extreme poverty, diseases, and forms of malnutrition can be addressed through a variety of interventions. Often it is possible to allocate a certain budget to an intervention, randomly select treatment and control groups, and afterwards compare what relative improvement the intervention has achieved at what cost. Such randomized controlled trials or RCTs and systematic reviews across them are as central to evidence-based altruism as they are for evidence-based&#xA0;medicine.</p>\n<p>But the situation is more complex than that because charity can be a bit like the stock market. Once an amazing new intervention has proved itself, governments and major foundations often jump on it, pouring in enough money that the marginal benefit of further donations is low. A great giving opportunity is hence one that addresses an important cause, relies on a well-proven cost-effective intervention, and yet remains&#xA0;underfunded.</p>\n<h2>Cause&#xA0;Neutrality</h2>\n<p>It is crucial to us to be unbiased about whom we help and never judge beings by the nature of their plight: all we want is to do as much good as possible. Hence we compare all interventions&#x2014;whether medical, educational, agricultural, vel sim.&#x2014;as well as we can, not just the ones within one&#xA0;category.</p>\n<p>This means that organizations within the movement also investigate whether there are highly effective giving opportunities in areas that are usually deemed political. For example, opportunities within the <span>US</span> policy areas of labor mobility and criminal justice are being investigated by the <a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/\">Open Philanthropy Project</a>. It also investigates types of global catastrophic risk (also known as <em>existential risk</em>)&#x2014;such as biosecurity and geoengineering&#x2014;and what can be done to avert them. Investigations into giving opportunities in the area of scientific research funding are also on the&#xA0;agenda.</p>\n<p>Cause neutrality also embraces nonhuman animals. There is no agreed-upon method for comparing the suffering of different species, but Animal Charity Evaluators estimates that the cost for saving the lives of farmed animals<sup><a href=\"#fn:ace-topcharities\">4</a></sup> might be four orders of magnitude less than that for saving human lives,<sup><a href=\"#fn:gw-ce\">3</a></sup> a consideration that might outweigh whatever lower value one might assign to the life of an animal. On the other hand, animals are much less likely to benefit from long-term flow-through effects.<sup><a href=\"#fn:ocb-animals\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>Weighing all these considerations is a mighty&#xA0;undertaking.</p>\n<h2>Charity&#xA0;Evaluation</h2>\n<p>Two organizations have put years of work into doing just that and more. <a href=\"http://givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> and <a href=\"http://animalcharityevaluators.org/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a> assess empirically which interventions excel in all these categories. Furthermore, they look for charities that implement these interventions in a fashion that is highly transparent, scalable, and subject to rigorous self-evaluation. The charities that stand all these tests are thus the world&#x2019;s best giving opportunities for&#xA0;donors.</p>\n<p>The reliability of their evidence is paramount to GiveWell and Animal Charity Evaluators, and they go to great lengths to subject their reasoning to public scrutiny, so that they can continually&#xA0;improve.</p>\n<h3>As of December 2014, <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell</a>&#xA0;recommends:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://againstmalaria.com/\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, which funds mosquito nets for malaria&#xA0;prevention</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a>, which distributes cash to people in extreme&#xA0;poverty</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto\">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a>, which treats people for parasite&#xA0;infections</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.evidenceaction.org/dewormtheworld\">Deworm the World Initiative</a> of Evidence Action, which provides advocacy and technical assistance to governments to conduct&#xA0;deworming.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>As of December 2014, <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/recommendations/top-charities/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>&#xA0;recommends:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.animalequality.net/\">Animal Equality</a>, which advocates for farmed animals through media outlets, grassroots outreach, undercover investigations, and legal and corporate&#xA0;outreach</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mercyforanimals.org/\">Mercy For Animals</a>, which advocates for farmed animals through undercover investigations, corporate and legal outreach, online vegetarian ads, and grassroots&#xA0;outreach</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://thehumaneleague.com/\">The Humane League</a>, which advocates for farmed animals through online advertising, grassroots outreach, public campaigns, presentations, and corporate&#xA0;outreach.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a> find the best charities in existence and publish each step of their&#xA0;processes.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/\">Open Philanthropy Project</a> investigates promising giving opportunities including those that lie outside the focus of&#xA0;GiveWell.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> accepts pledges from effective altruists who plan to donate at least 10% of their&#xA0;income.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a> provides career coaching for everyone who wants their life to have the greatest possible positive&#xA0;impact.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://charityscience.com/\">Charity Science</a> experiments with different ways to conduct outreach and&#xA0;fund-raising.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/\">Effective Altruism Forum</a> can help you find answers to your&#xA0;questions.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/\">Effective Altruists Facebook group</a> provides you with another forum for effective altruism&#xA0;discussions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/\">Effective Altruism Hub</a> encourages you to be public about your donations to inspire&#xA0;others.</li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li> <span>D.T.</span> Jamison et al., <a href=\"http://www.dcp-3.org/dcp2\"><em>Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries</em></a>, 2nd ed., <span>NCBI</span> bookshelf (World Bank Publications, 2006), 52, <span>ISBN</span>: 9780821361801.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text\" href=\"#fnref:dcp2\">&#x21A9;</a> </li>\n<li> Toby Ord, &#x201C;<a href=\"/ea/70/the_moral_imperative_towards_costeffectiveness/\">The Moral Imperative Towards Cost-Effectiveness</a>,&#x201D;

I <a href=\"http://vipulnaik.com/donation-history/\">myself donated</a> $125 to the Wikimedia Foundation around 2007/2008.</p>\n<p>Donating to Wikipedia makes <em>prima facie</em> sense: Wikipedia is an extremely valuable resource to humanity. How valuable? Take a look at the <a href=\"http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN/TablesPageViewsMonthlyCombined.htm\">numbers</a>: English Wikipedia alone gets 10 billion views a month, and all the other language Wikipedias get another 10 billion. That&apos;s a total of about a quarter of a <em>trillion</em> views a year. To put it another way, the mean world resident human views a little over 30 Wikipedia pages a year (and if you restrict to the population with Internet access, the number grows to over 100). If you very crudely estimate the average value of a pageview at somewhere between 0.1 and 4 cents, then the annual value delivered by Wikipedia is somewhere between $250 million and $10 billion. In comparison, the Wikimedia Foundation&apos;s <a href=\"http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/2014-2015_Annual_Plan_Questions_and_Answers\">annual plan for 2014-2015 calls</a> for $58.5 million in spending. So, looking at averages alone, we seem to be getting somewhere between a 4-fold and a 160-fold return on investment.</p>\n<p>But does donating to the Wikimedia Foundation <em>actually</em> make sense, once you think more closely about it? I think it could, for some particular sets of values that the donor may hold, and some particular set of beliefs about the world. However, I think that many of the arguments that people make for donating to the Wikimedia Foundation are flawed, based on a combination of factually mistaken beliefs and incorrect reasoning. In this post, I consider some of these arguments.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>We need to donate to the Wikimedia Foundation in order to make sure that Wikipedia continues running</strong>: I believe this is wrong, <em>even if you ignore the issue of marginal versus average donation</em>. Reasons: the foundation is sitting on large reserves, operations costs (including server costs and associated engineering costs) are less than 20% of the budget, and even if donations from individual donors (the main source the WMF relies on in its fundraising) reduced, there are a number of large foundations that would be willing to fill in the gap. Finally, in the highly unlikely event that the WMF did go under, backups of the content as well as publicly available copies of the underlying software could be used by others to set up a clone quickly (this is also compatible with the licensing agreement for the site&apos;s content and software, so legal issues are minimal). But in any case, if the WMF does go under, that&apos;s more likely to be due to lawsuits or malice on somebody&apos;s part rather than directly because of a lack of funds.</li>\n<li><strong>The Wikimedia Foundation is unusually well-run and efficient, so there is value in rewarding it for this by donating to it</strong>: The Wikimedia Foundation is reasonably well-run and efficient, but not extraordinarily so. Some people have made a big deal of alleged inefficiences in the WMF, but I think such apparent inefficiency is par for the course for a software organization of that size and scope. At the same time, there isn&apos;t good evidence of very high efficiency. Appropriate organizations in the broad reference class include the Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Corporation, the WordPress Foundation and Automattic (the company that runs WordPress), and GitHub. Comparing the Wikimedia Foundation to Google or Facebook and then noting that it is much leaner and therefore more efficient is misguided.</li>\n<li><strong>The marginal and/or average donation contributes to improving content quality on Wikipedia</strong>: Donations don&apos;t go directly to content creators. Rather, they go into running the Foundation, whose main costs are staff salaries (staff includes software engineers as well as others) and grants to local chapters. One could argue that some of the activities sponsored spur greater editor participation, but the evidence for this isn&apos;t clear-cut. The software improvements that would allegedly improve editor participation have generally met with heavy backlash from the community and often been retracted. You might examine the data and come to the conclusion that donating does spur more contribution, but this isn&apos;t something that can be assumed offhand.</li>\n<li><strong>Wikipedia has helped me so much, it&apos;s important to pay back</strong>: The WMF has done a reasonable job of stewardship, but I believe that insofar as there inheres a strong moral obligation to pay back, this obligation is to content creators. Donating to the WMF does not reward past content creators.</li>\n<li><strong>If everybody donated $1, then ...</strong>: The &quot;if everybody donated $1&quot; argument is a dangerous slippery slope to get on. The argument is generally made from a Kantian moral imperative standpoint. But it proves too much, because if everybody gave $1 for any service that appeared to vaguely benefit them, that would lead to a lot of careless spending and a lot of overfunding for sectors of the economy whose value hadn&apos;t been proven out. This is also related to the <a href=\"http://www.commentarius.com/2011/03/09/concentrated-benefits-and-diffuse-costs/\">concentrated benefits, diffuse cost problem</a> that plagues politics.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>1.2. Where I&apos;m coming from (background and potential conflict of interest)</h3>\n<p>As I noted above, I <a href=\"http://vipulnaik.com/donation-history/\">donated</a> about $125 to the WMF in 2007/2008. I haven&apos;t donated to the WMF since then. My reasons for donating back then were partly that the WMF had much smaller budgets and so the marginal impact of additional money (or what GiveWell and others have called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_for_more_funding\">room for more funding</a>) seemed more clearly positive. That said, with my current set of beliefs and goals, I probably wouldn&apos;t donate to the WMF even in a situation similar to what it was back then. Nonetheless, I don&apos;t have any deep regrets about the donations. They were a relatively small amount and I&apos;ve made far bigger and more costly financial decisions of dubious and in some cases even negative value.</p>\n<p>I&apos;ve written up my history of editing Wikipedia <a href=\"http://vipulnaik.com/wikipedia\">here</a>. TL;DR: I edited it a bit when I was an undergraduate (around 2005 and 2006) then reduced my editing involvement for a few years, then resumed around 2012. I&apos;ve created <a href=\"http://wikipediaviews.org/displayviewsformultiplemonths.php?tag=Pages%20created%20by%20Vipul%20Naik&amp;allmonths=allmonths\">over 200 Wikipedia articles that get a total of over 100,000 monthly pageviews</a>.</p>\n<p>Around 2008 or 2009, I had become quite interested in issues related to Wikipedia&apos;s management problems and the challenges facing the WMF. I had grown somewhat skeptical of the WMF and of Wikipedia, which was somewhat related to my reducing my editing involvement there. Some of that skepticism lives on in modified form, but my way of thinking about the issue has changed, and I don&apos;t endorse the connotations of some of my earlier writing about Wikipedia and the WMF, even if I don&apos;t have any object-level disagreements.</p>\n<h3>1.3. What I&apos;m (not) trying to do</h3>\n<p>This post holds plenty of potential to be construed as a smackdown of the WMF in the vein of those regularly published in venues such as Wikipediocracy, the Daily Dot, and the Register (all of which are linked here; seems like most of the external publications that cover WMF minutiae generally do so from a somewhat negative angle, and these are the three top ones). So before embarking on a more detailed justification of my claims, let me clarify a little bit more what I hope to accomplish:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I don&apos;t intend to connote that there is anything particularly morally wrong or imprudent about making small donations to the WMF. I think that the arguments that people make in favor of it being virtuous, desirable, or necessary are misguided, but it&apos;s not a particularly evil use of money. People <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2007/01/06/limits-of-generosity/\">spend money in a variety of ways</a>, not many of which yield the sort of great returns we aspire to in our &quot;effective altruist&quot;-style resource allocation. If you think of donating to the WMF as a tip (which goes to the waiters and waitresses rather than the cooks!) it doesn&apos;t seem unreasonable. (I&apos;ve made the analogy with a tip in an <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/Wikimedia-Fundraising-Donations/Does-Wikipedia-collect-more-money-than-it-requires-to-run/answer/Vipul-Naik?share=1\">earlier Quora answer</a>).</li>\n<li>I don&apos;t intend to categorically rule out the possibility that donating to the WMF could be an effective use of resources. I don&apos;t think many of the arguments people commonly make for it are epistemically sound or factually well-informed, but there could be more sophisticated arguments and reasonable sets of goals and beliefs of the world where donating to the WMF is a great choice.</li>\n<li>Although it&apos;s a possibility I don&apos;t rule out, I don&apos;t claim categorically that the WMF is particularly inefficient as an organization, relative to other organizations in its reference class. Nor do I claim that it is failing to pluck any obvious low-hanging fruit. Rather, my claim is that the WMF so far hasn&apos;t produced a huge bang for the buck or shown signs of strong ability to deliver value on donations (beyond keeping the site running, which is no mean feat). I believe this is largely because the problems are inherently very hard, but I don&apos;t take a position on the extent to which intractability is a barrier.</li>\n<li>From a consequentialist perspective, I don&apos;t expect this post to significantly affect donations to the WMF. In the highly unlikely event that it reduces annual donations by something like $150,000 (more than a full-time software engineer&apos;s salary!) that still wouldn&apos;t dent the WMF&apos;s annual budget by more than 0.3%. But actually, even if my post influences donation decisions of $150,000, the WMF is likely to still meet its fundraising target by extending the fundraising period a little longer to make up for the forgone donations. So what could be the effect of this post? First, the set of people who might be persuaded by it is likely the set of people with the most sympathies to effective altruist ideas, so in a sense, substituting their donations away from the WMF would be more high-impact than substituting the donations of somebody who isn&apos;t interested in effective use of money in general. Second, I hope that my article helps spark a discussion, both about the WMF&apos;s activities and about some of the broader topics (philanthropy, nonprofit software organizations, obligations to give).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>1.4. A bit more on what this post is not about</h3>\n<p>The Wikimedia Foundation was in the news in December 2014 for allegedly misleading and alarmist language in its fundraising drive. You can see a mailing list discussion about these concerns <a href=\"http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/wiki/foundation/534599#534599\">here</a> and read some criticism from <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/12/01/penniless_and_desperate_wikipedia_sits_on_60m_cash/\">The Register</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/business/wikipedia-fundraiser-banner/\">The Daily Dot</a>, <a href=\"http://wikipediocracy.com/2014/12/11/the-wikipedia-fundraising-banner-sad-but-untrue/\">Wikipediocracy</a>, <a href=\"http://newslines.org/blog/stop-giving-wikipedia-money/\">NewsLines</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/wikipedia-millions-bank-beg/\">Make Use Of</a>.</p>\n<p>This post is not about that controversy, though I used some of the discussion engendered by the controversy to inform my views. In other words, I&apos;m not focused on the question of whether the WMF&apos;s messaging is deceptive or whether it is morally culpable for the (in my view misguided) reasons people feel it is virtuous, desirable, or necessary to donate to the WMF. Interesting as that issue is, I&apos;m more interested in articulating my reasons for believing that the arguments (as I believe many people formulate them) are flawed.</p>\n<p>Also, I am <em>not</em> claiming that the views here represent a consensus view of the effective altruist community, or even a dominant view within that community (for a broader spectrum of views from within the EA community, see <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/789939494395743/\">here</a>, and also wait for comments on the post you are currently reading). My views and perspective are informed by beliefs that are consonant with effective altruist values, but others who identify with these values may come to fairly different conclusions. Nor do I think you need to embrace general EA principles to derive value from, or even be convinced by, my arguments in this post.</p>\n<p>Further (unlike the case of <a href=\"http://qz.com/249649/the-cold-hard-truth-about-the-ice-bucket-challenge/\">William MacAskill&apos;s critique of the Ice Bucket Challenge</a>), the purpose of this post is not to say something like, &quot;instead of donating $100 to the WMF, donate it instead to a GiveWell-recommended charity.&quot; Of course, if somebody reads this post and decides to not make a donation to the WMF that they otherwise would, that leaves that extra money unallocated, and insofar as they have a specific total charity budget out of which that WMF donation was coming, they have the option of allocating the money to other charities. Otherwise, that money saved goes into their general pool of fungible money, which they can allocate to charity, saving, or consumption. But the <em>negative</em> decision to refrain from donating to the WMF does not imply any immediate <em>positive</em> decision to allocate the money thereby saved in a particular way. I do have thoughts on the latter, but this post is not the place to voice them.</p>\n<h2>2. Evaluation of the arguments</h2>\n<h3>2.1. Is Wikipedia in danger of death?</h3>\n<p>Recently, I came across this Reddit piece (not actual news). It&apos;s not clear where the author&apos;s actual sympathies lay, but some of the connotatively expressed viewpoints describe what many people seem to think and assume about Wikipedia.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p><span title=\"Writing Prompt - Not Actual News\">Writing Prompt - Not Actual News</span><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2ov45h/wp_wikipedia_is_shut_down_and_all_copies_deleted/\">[WP] Wikipedia is shut down and all copies deleted for lack of funds and loss of net neutrality.

The ~$8 million operations costs include the server costs and relevant engineering costs. Note that the Internet hosting costs themselves are even lower: <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/foundation/e/e3/FINAL_13_14From_KPMG.pdf#page=5\">about $2.5 million projected for 2014</a> (the new plan doesn&apos;t seem to include a corresponding number).</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-arguments-against-donating-to-the-Wikimedia-Foundation/answer/Andreas-Kolbe\">Quora answer</a>, Andreas Kolbe quoted Jimmy Wales from back in 2005:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span><span><span><span><em>&#x201C;So, we&#x2019;re doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly. So, it&#x2019;s really gotten to be a huge thing. And everything is managed by the volunteers and the total monthly cost for our bandwidth is about 5,000 dollars, and that&#x2019;s essentially our main cost. We could actually do without the employee &#x2026; We actually hired Brion [Vibber] because he was working part-time for two years and full-time at Wikipedia so we actually hired him so he could get a life and go to the movies sometimes.&#x201D;</em></span></span></span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>Wikipedia pageview counts have gone up by a factor of about 15X (about 20 billion monthly page requests) and pure Internet hosting costs have gone up by a factor of about 40X (from $60,000 annually to $2.5 million annually). This is roughly expected, because Wikipedia now aims for substantially greater reliability and has become a more critical resource.<br></span></p>\n<p>I think the total engineering operations costs are a more reliable proxy for the &quot;cost of maintaining the website&quot; than pure Internet hosting costs. They could overcount costs because some engineering operations aren&apos;t directly necessary to keep the site running. They could also undercount costs because, even if the goal were just to keep the site running, there would likely be other administrative overhead. I think that, extrapolating somewhat, an annual cost of about $12 million would be enough to keep the site running at its current performance, if that were the sole goal. And in the event that the WMF is able to raise no additional money, it could draw down its reserves and keep running the site <strong>for about four years</strong> (the Foundation has cash reserves of $28 million and other assets of $23 million).</p>\n<p>However, if individual donors cut back on donations and the WMF weren&apos;t able to meet its fundraising goals, it likely would simply fill in the funding gap from larger foundation and corporate donors. The reason the WMF relies on individual donors to the extent it does (about 85%) is to maintain independence from the agendas of these large donors. But this does mean that there are other lines of defense before the WMF would need to pare itself down considerably.</p>\n<p>Finally, <em>if </em>the Wikimedia Foundation had to close its doors, it wouldn&apos;t take long for another resource to create a replica of Wikipedia. The entire content of the encyclopedia is available as a public dump, updated every few weeks. There would be a painful transition but it wouldn&apos;t be a permanent loss. The content is also cached by Google and the Internet Archive. Needless to say, this is unlikely to happen, and the biggest risk factors associated with it happening are natural disasters and lawsuits rather than running out of money. But lawsuits themselves won&apos;t result in an immediate shutdown. If there were some sort of lawsuit or legal trouble, people would have ample time to prepare and respond to the site going down.</p>\n<p><strong>ETA</strong>: Andreas Kolbe has done a similar calculation as mine <a href=\"http://wikipediocracy.com/2014/09/21/wikipedia-keeping-it-free-just-pay-us-our-salaries/\">here</a>. I hadn&apos;t seen this calculation (though I had read his Quora answer linked above) before I did my own.</p>\n<h3>2.2. Is the Wikimedia Foundation unusually well-run and efficient?</h3>\n<p>Co-founder Jimmy Wales hints at this efficiency in his letter:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are the small non-profit that runs one of the top websites in the world. We only have about 200 staff but serve 500 million users, and have costs like any other top site: servers, power, programs, and people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some people might interpret this as a claim that, compared with Google or Facebook or YouTube, Wikipedia is an extraordinarily efficient-to-run website. Where Google has over 50,000 employees and Facebook over 8,000, the WMF employs a mere 200. And while Google and Facebook measure their expenses in the billions, the WMF&apos;s $50 million is a bargain.</p>\n<p>However this is a misguided conclusion for a few reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The complexity of the task undertaken by Google and Facebook is substantially greater than that of the task undertaken by Wikipedia in terms of page serving. The majority of Wikipedia pages are loaded statically from a periodically updated cache, and require little computation or user-specific customization. Facebook, on the other hand, has to generate every pageview dynamically based on user-specific information. It&apos;s a much harder problem. Similarly, Google&apos;s search algorithm relies on indexing huge amounts of data, and its personalized search results rank them in real time using a fairly complicated strategy. YouTube probably comes closest to Wikipedia in terms of serving a predetermined page to users, but that&apos;s video streaming, which is fairly expensive in terms of bandwidth (that said, I believe the operating costs of YouTube are probably comparable to the WMF&apos;s annual budget, though much more than WMF&apos;s operations costs).</li>\n<li>On priors, we shouldn&apos;t <em>expect</em> that the Wikimedia Foundation should have figured out a technology or strategy to be so much more efficient than others. The median WMF employee may be somewhat better than the median Google or Facebook employee, but the top 200 employees at companies like Google or Facebook are likely to be a lot better than the 200 Wikipedia employees, if only because of the ability of substantially higher salaries to attract substantially better people.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here are some organizations that I believe fall in the broad reference class that the WMF does with respect to scope and influence on the Internet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automattic\">Automattic</a> is the company that runs <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress.com\">WordPress.com</a>, the platform where people can create their own WordPress blogs. It has also supported the creation and development of the open source and free WordPress software, though the software itself is managed by the WordPress Foundation. <a href=\"http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/automattic\">According to CrunchBase</a>, Automattic has raised a total of $310 million since its launch in 2005, of which $120 million was through secondary markets in 2013, and $160 million was a venture capital round in 2014. Automattic is a for-profit company that makes its money by offering WordPress hosting for big websites (such as <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com\">TechCrunch</a>) and its freemium WordPress.com offering. WordPress powers over 60% of websites, and WordPress.com has an Alexa rank of 33 when I last checked. It has 303 employees.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Foundation\">Mozilla Foundation</a> is the steward for the open-source web browser Mozilla Firefox (and other related products) which powers <a href=\"http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-ww-monthly-200807-201502\">between 10% and 33% of web pageviews</a>. It had an annual revenue of $300 million when last reported, most of it coming from a deal to have Google as the default web search engine (the deal partner is now Yahoo!, but revenue for the deal has not yet been reported).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub\">GitHub</a> is widely used by open source projects to coordinate diverse contributions, as well as by companies, particularly small and middle-sized ones, to manage their codebases. The website had an Alexa rank of 95 when last checked. The company was largely self-financed to begin with but raised $100 million in 2012. It has 241 employees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We see that the WMF&apos;s revenue and expense numbers are within the same ballpark as those of these other organizations that are doing comparably complex stuff with reach that is roughly comparable, albeit in different ways.</p>\n<p>I don&apos;t have a clear assessment of the quality of WMF&apos;s software engineering. Considering that they&apos;ve successfully kept the site functional and running, one can be reasonably confident that they&apos;re at least reasonably competent. But the value of many of the software innovation efforts is ambiguous at best. The basic MediaWiki software was written as far back as 2001 and its rate of change has been declining (it has been fairly stable since about 2013). This isn&apos;t necessarily a bad thing, since MediaWiki is a fairly good piece of software for something like Wikipedia. But insofar as it&apos;s great software, the credit goes to a team of people who built it long before the WMF started employing full-time software engineers.</p>\n<p>Two of the main products of recent years of software engineering effort, the <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/news/wikipedia-visualeditor-kww-patch/\">Visual Editor</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/08/18/class_war_wikipedias_workers_revolt_after_bourgeois_papershufflers_suspend_democracy/\">Media Viewer</a>, met with significant revolts from many vocal sections of the user community. Whether this was because the software was poor or because the community (or relevant sections thereof) were resistant to change is unclear, but either way, given that the goals of these products were to improve engagement and participation by the community, the failure of the products speaks to the Foundation&apos;s software engineering work often not furthering its stated goals. That said, there are some clear successes: the mobile version of Wikipedia and Wikipedia Zero are well-executed and generally liked.</p>\n<p>To take another example of more personal relevance: last year, I was interested in getting information on the total number of pageviews of Wikipedia pages I&apos;ve created or edited. To its credit, the WMF publishes anonymized hourly logs that provide information on how many people viewed each page. In late 2007, Domas Mituzas created a tool, <a href=\"http://stats.grok.se\">stats.grok.se</a>, that processes these logs and allows people to get easy information on the number of pageviews of a particular page in a particular month. It&apos;s currently maintained by Wikipedia user Henrik. Note: This tool, which has been the main means for accessing analytics information for Wikipedia, wasn&apos;t created or maintained by the WMF, but by volunteers (the WMF has recently come up with its own tool, but I think it&apos;s still in beta, and Wikipedia&apos;s official statistics page still recommends stats.grok.se).</p>\n<p>In the beginning of 2014, I would manually query stats.grok.se for the monthly pageviews of all pages I created and enter the results into a spreadsheet to get an estimate of my impact. Finally, I decided to automate the process of retrieving the data, and I created the <a href=\"http://wikipediaviews.org\">Wikipedia Views website</a>, where you can now get the <a href=\"/&lt;a href=\">breakdown by page and month for pages I created</a>. When I made Wikipedia Views, I didn&apos;t have any experience managing a software project (though I had edited/tweaked pre-existing projects in the past), and I still managed to pull it off, over a few weeks of a few hours a week. Given the WMF&apos;s interest in attracting and maintaining contributors, and its having a full-fledged analytics team, I would have expected this sort of tool to have come from the WMF itself a while back. (Incidentally, MediaWiki itself, which is a far more complex project, was created by Magnus Manske over two weeks because he was interested in learning PHP and applying it to the wiki content creation problem).</p>\n<p>But what surprised me recently, when I was drafting my <a href=\"http://vipulnaik.com/blog/the-great-decline-in-wikipedia-pageviews-full-version/\">post on the great decline in Wikipedia pageviews</a> (something I noticed based on stats.grok.se data as viewed through my tool, and again something that I wasn&apos;t able to find any discussion of), was that the statistics on stats.grok.se (that are still listed as the best source for pageview statistics) <em>do not include mobile pageviews</em>. In fact, the WMF started publishing logs including mobile and Wikipedia Zero pageviews as recently as September 2014, but stats.grok.se is still using the old logs. This, despite stats.grok.se being cited and linked to as the canonical source of information on Wikipedia pageviews. And <em>bot pageviews still aren&apos;t excluded</em>, even though both the filtering out of bots and the inclusion of mobile pageviews have been on the agenda since <a href=\"http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/wiki/wikitech/334598\">as far back as February 2013</a>.</p>\n<p>There are many ways of interpreting these facts. Perhaps these analytics just aren&apos;t that important to the WMF or to their users, so they are not giving the analytics a lot of attention (my own interest in analytics is arguably quite atypical). Perhaps this takes a lot more resources than I think it does. Maybe a mere $50 million isn&apos;t enough, perhaps a $500 million annual budget is needed to get a quality analytics product. Whatever the case, I want to take this example to highlight that even with this large budget, many things that some might consider basic and relatively straightforward may end up not happening. So I think this is some evidence against the WMF being unusually efficient or good at getting things done (but it may not be evidence of incompetence <em>per se</em>). It also means that if your goal is to get some very specific project done, such as a new analytics tool, it&apos;s better to build it yourself or fund it directly, going through the WMF only if necessary.</p>\n<h3>2.3. Does the marginal and/or average donation contribute unambiguously to improving Wikipedia quality?</h3>\n<p>Once we know that the servers that host Wikipedia can keep running for a small fraction of the annual budget of the WMF, the best argument in defense of the WMF lies in the value add of the Foundation to the underlying software and to the content created.</p>\n<p>I already noted above that the Visual Editor, the WMF&apos;s most high-profile software engineering effort to improve user participation, was rejected by the community after several months of effort. Apart from these software efforts, the Foundation has also tried a number of other techniques to increase user participation. These seem like valiant efforts, but they don&apos;t seem to have had a clear track record of success. For instance, efforts to improve article quality <a href=\"https://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikimedia-l/2014-March/070728.html\">appear to have stalled</a> because there is very little consensus on what article quality even means. There is much sporadic discussion about how to improve gender ratios in Wikipedia editing, but the end results are unclear.</p>\n<p>I don&apos;t think the difficulty with improving content quality, or expanding the range of editors and the quality of contributions, are evidence of any unique incompetence on the WMF&apos;s part. These are very hard problems, and it&apos;s possible that they can&apos;t be solved even if a lot more resources (including high-quality thought) were poured into them. Any steps taken to attract new people run the risk of alienating the current contributor core (as happened with the Visual Editor).</p>\n<p>So the pushback against the idea that donations to the WMF improve content quality isn&apos;t intended as a criticism of the WMF&apos;s competence, but rather of the idea that improving quality is a relatively easy task that the WMF is executing well.</p>\n<p>Outgoing WMF chief Sue Gardner has said <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/business/sue-gardner-log-rolling-corruption-wikimedia-chapters/\">something</a> <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/10/08/wikipedia_foundation_money_in_wrong_place/\">similar</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Too large a proportion of the movement&apos;s money is being spent by the chapters [whereas] the value in the Wikimedia projects is primarily created by individual editors: individuals create the value for readers, which results in those readers donating money to the movement. ... I am not sure that the additional value created by movement entities such as chapters justifies the financial cost,&quot; Gardner wrote.</p>\n<p>Worse is the risk for trading favours, taking advantage of positions and <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=trougher\">troughing</a> in general, she said. Gardner warns that the FDC [Funds Dissemination Committee] process is &quot;dominated by fund-seekers, does not as currently constructed offer sufficient protection against log-rolling, self-dealing, and other corrupt practices. I had hoped that this risk would be offset by the presence on the FDC of independent non-affiliated members&quot;.</p>\n<p>Gardner questioned whether bankrolling local chapters was the way to go - and urged the community to look for alternatives.</p>\n<p>&quot;With such a high proportion of movement resources now funding [chapters&apos; staff and offices], we need to ask if the benefits are turning out to be worth the cost. It&apos;s possible that a well-managed shift to some staff support can help a volunteer community stay energized and enthused, but the risks and costs of setting up bricks-and-mortar institutions also dramatically increase, alongside sometimes difficult dynamics between staff and community.&quot;</p>\n<p>She added: &quot;I believe we&apos;re spending a lot of money, more than is warranted by the results we&apos;ve been seeing. I am concerned by the growth rates requested by the entities submitting funding requests to the FDC.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>2.4. Does Wikipedia helping you personally make it morally obligatory or desirable to donate to the WMF?</h3>\n<p>First off, as noted earlier, the WMF <em>doesn&apos;t reward either past or future content creators</em>. <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/wikipedia/9581813/Wikipedia-charity-faces-investigation-over-trustee-conflict-of-interest.html\">Past</a> <a href=\"http://wikipediocracy.com/2014/04/01/business-as-usual/\">experiments</a> with paid editing to improve quality <a href=\"http://outreach.wikimedia.org/wiki/Assessment_of_Belfer_Center_Wikipedian_in_Residence_program\">didn&apos;t go well</a>. It&apos;s not clear whether such efforts were inherently doomed or the execution was flawed. But whatever the case, it seems that payment of content creators is not part of the current agenda of the WMF.</p>\n<p>I think there could be a good case for donating to the WMF based on a sense of moral obligation if the money were going to those whose services most directly helped you (the reciprocity/returning favors perspective), and/or if it were clear that the WMF&apos;s use of funds, either at the margin or on average, were the most effective ways of furthering the goals of building the better encyclopedia that you benefited from (the effective altruist perspective). Neither of these seem true to me.</p>\n<p>As Bryan Caplan <a href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/04/jason_brennans.html\">noted in his blog post</a> reviewing Jason Brennan&apos;s book <em>The Ethics of Voting</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2. There are many extrapolitical ways to exercise civic virtue and contribute to the common good:<br>[M]any activities stereotypically considered private, such as being a conscientious employee, making art, running a for-profit business, or pursuing scientific discoveries, can also be exercises of civic virtue.&#xA0; For many people, in fact, these are better ways to exercise civic virtue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the same way, even if there is a generic obligation to &quot;pay back&quot; the world for the great resource called Wikipedia, that obligation can be fulfilled through many means other than donating to the WMF.</p>\n<p>This isn&apos;t to say that there is anything categorically <em>wrong</em> about donating to the WMF as a way of discharging the (perceived) obligation. I don&apos;t think it&apos;s the most effective or sensible apprach, but it&apos;s not obviously wrong.</p>\n<p><em>Aside: </em>Andreas Kolbe has <a href=\"http://wikipediocracy.com/2014/12/01/make-your-wikipedia-donations-count/\">proposed</a> that, rather than donating to the WMF, you seek out people to do paid editing and pay them if the quality of the work satisfies you, using the Wikipedia Review Board to find and communicate with the relevant editors. I don&apos;t have clear thoughts on this, but I do think that if your goal is to improve content quality or quantity on Wikipedia, editing it yourself -- or paying others to directly edit it through appropriate mechanisms (and not in violation of Wikipedia&apos;s guidelines) is probably a more cost-effective approach.</p>\n<p>The English Wikipedia has a little under 5 million articles, and all the language Wikipedias together have between 10 and 20 million articles, with a growth rate of about 10% per annum for the English Wikipedia and perhaps a little higher for other Wikipedias. So if we think of half the money going to the WMF as effectively being for the English Wikipedia, that&apos;s an annual spend of $25 million for about 500,000 new articles, so the cost per new article comes to about $50 (of course, this cost calculation is problematic because much of the new article creation is unrelated to much of the WMF&apos;s spending). At this kind of cost, creating new content yourself might well beat out making a donation.</p>\n<p>However, the &quot;engage in or fund content creation on Wikipedia directly&quot; argument is not essential to my main point here.</p>\n<h3>2.5. Is there a Kantian imperative to donate?</h3>\n<p>The Kantian moral imperative to donate is about seeking a good general rule that, if everybody (or sufficiently many people) followed, the world would be a better place. From this perspective, the rule &quot;don&apos;t donate to the WMF&quot; isn&apos;t a good rule, because if everybody followed that, the WMF would not have any money, and Wikipedia would not be able to survive. The Kantian imperative argument is not an argument about the practical consequences of your marginal decision to not donate, but about what general principles are best for the overall working of society.</p>\n<p>A slight variant of this is the argument: &quot;if every Internet user who has accessed Wikipedia gave $1 a year, then clearly everybody is donating far less than the value they get from the encyclopedia, but Wikipedia would have something like $500 million a year in revenue. So a $58 million annual budget is a bargain deal in comparison.&quot;</p>\n<p>It is true that $1 seems like a trivial sum of money for most donors relative to the value they appear to get from Wikipedia. But this type of argument proves too much. We can come up with lots of things that one could use the &quot;if everybody paid $1&quot; argument. But if everybody followed this argument literally, then people would rapidly spend out all their money in these $1 tips, and the providers of the relevant services would be flush with cash that they don&apos;t have good ways to allocate. I believe that this has already happened to some extent with the WMF, but even if you don&apos;t think so, it seems reasonably clear that it <em>would</em> happen at 10X the scale.</p>\n<p>Rather than adhering to the Kantian imperative, I think it&apos;s better to look at the issue from the perspective of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_for_more_funding\">room for more funding</a>: is the WMF in danger of failing to meet its core functions that have been known to deliver value, or of exploring directions that I think are particularly promising? The answer for me is a clear <em>no</em> at the current margin. But if the answer changed, either because funding went down a lot or because they started taking up much more promising projects, then I&apos;d reconsider my decision in light of the new evidence (and blog my modified views, to set straight the public record).</p>\n<p>I think that there is some appeal of the Kantian imperative in that it avoids complicated game-theoretic coordination issues of the sort that GiveWell outlined in its December 2014 <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/12/02/donor-coordination-and-the-givers-dilemma/\">blog</a> <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/12/19/donor-coordination-and-the-givers-dilemma-part-ii/\">posts</a> on coordinating the contributions of several large donors. And if the WMF fell in the category of contenders for a top place to donate to (i.e., it were something I think there are strong reasons to give to, but we are just constrained on cash and there are somewhat better opportunities) then I think the sort of coordinated solution GiveWell tried to orchestrate would be worthwhile. I don&apos;t think that&apos;s the case with the WMF.</p>\n<h2>3. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I will reiterate that this post is a reasoned criticism of donating to the WMF but not intended as a smackdown (I believe many of the problems being tackled by the WMF are intrinsically hard). Rather, I am using this post to explore what I perceive as factual and epistemic flaws in particular reasons to donate to the WMF. Given the publication venue (the Effective Altruism Forum) I believe some potential donors who read this might find the information contained here sufficient to tip them away from considering donating to the WMF, but it is likely that the majority of readers will not change their decision (some will continue to donate, some will continue to not donate).</p>\n<p>I hope this post is informative both regarding some of the facts surrounding the WMF&apos;s situation and regarding how somebody might use effective altruist principles in evaluating a particular giving opportunity. I&apos;m interested in hearing other people&apos;s thoughts on both these counts.</p>\n<p>PS: I had posted about my plans to write this blog post on the Effective Altruists Forum in December 2014. You can see the post and the comments on it <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/789939494395743/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>PS2: Related to point 4 above, I have been experimenting with <a href=\"http://vipulnaik.com/sponsored-wikipedia-editing/\">sponsoring other people&apos;s Wikipedia contributions</a>.</p>\n<h2>4. Addenda</h2>\n<h3>4.1. ADDED December 2015: Remarks in light of renewed interest due to the 2015 fundraiser</h3>\n<p>In its December 2015 fundraising drive, the Wikimedia Foundation hopes to raise $25 million. Skepticism of the Wikimedia Foundation&apos;s fundraising drive seems to be getting more mainstream now, with the <em>Washington Post</em> using a title that might have been seen on <em>The Register</em> a few years ago: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/12/02/wikipedia-has-a-ton-of-money-so-why-is-it-begging-you-to-donate-yours/\">Wikipedia has a ton of money. So why is it begging you to donate yours?</a> Despite the moderate increase in skepticism, I expect that the WMF will be able to successfully close its fundraising drive.</p>\n<p>However, the inherent challenge in raising more money given declining pageviews has been noted both in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_Signpost/2015-10-14/News_and_notes\">fundraising meta discussions</a> and in the <em>Washington Post</em> and other mainstream media coverage of the fundraising round. It is possible that this will place an effective ceiling on the amount of money that can be raised through fundraising drives in the coming years.</p>\n<p>As for the criticisms I made in my post of arguments for donating to the WMF, I believe that they mostly remain intact. The WMF has made some progress in various areas, but it&apos;s still quite unclear to me if this progress is impressive relative to the financial and manpower resources at their disposal. To take an example I&apos;ve sort-of-been keeping up with, they&apos;ve made a number of improvements in their analytics (they now have an API endpoint to get desktop/mobile and user/bot/spider views of a page by date) which is quite useful to me personally. But it&apos;s not clear that this is an impressive accomplishment relative to the amount of time it took and the amount of financial resources available to the Wikimedia Foundation. Also, the extent to which the various initiatives around analytics pay off in terms of better content and more pageviews remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>It&apos;s possible that I will revise my estimate of the WMF more favorably over the coming years, but as of now I still stand by what I wrote in my post.</p>\n<h3>4.2. ADDED March 2016: Remarks in light of the executive shake-up at the WMF</h3>\n<p>In February 2016, the Wikimedia Foundation revealed that it had applied for a grant from the Knight Foundation to build improved search functionality for the Wikimedia projects. This was consistent with WMF Executive Director Lila Tretikov&apos;s goal of making the organization <a href=\"http://time.com/wikipedia/\">focus on technology so as to facilitate greater engagement by editors and readers</a>. The ambitiousness of the project and the opportunity cost of going down that route attracted negative attention and comment from both WMF employees and influential community members. In addition, the lack of prior disclosure about the grant was not taken kindly by people who expected a higher degree of transparency form the WMF. WMF Executive Director Lila Tretikov resigned with her effective departure date the end of March 2016. Vice has two good articles on the subject (<a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/wikipedias-secret-google-competitor-search-engine-is-tearing-it-apart\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://motherboard.vice.com/read/wikimedia-foundation-executive-director-lila-tretikov-resigns\">here</a>) and Molly White provides a comprehensive <a href=\"http://mollywhite.net/wikimedia-timeline/\">timeline of events</a>.</p>\n<p>As an outsider, I don&apos;t have a strong enough view regarding how realistic the search functionality plans are. To some extent, I can see merit in both sides. I agree with Tretikov, and others, that the decline in traffic to Wikipedia is a significant issue for the future of Wikipedia and, by extension, the Wikimedia Foundation. In fact, I wrote a <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/lxc/the_great_decline_in_wikipedia_pageviews/\">blog post</a> about this decline a year ago. Given that at least part of this decline appears to be because people searching on Google are presented with knowledge cards on Google itself and therefore don&apos;t even click through to Wikipedia, providing a better in-site search experience could, <em>potentially</em>, address the traffic decline. It&apos;s not clear to me that this is necessarily a worse idea than others. I can also understand somewhat the need for secrecy in the initial stages of such a plan, given the potential both to alert competition about it and to alienate people within the community even before any details had been fleshed out.</p>\n<p>But that said, given that the Wikimedia Foundation&apos;s software engineering team had not, in recent years, done anything of comparable complexity to designing a full open search engine, and the fact that similar projects by other companies took huge amounts of resources, skepticism is in order.</p>\n<p>But regardless of which side you take in this debate, the attempt to build a search engine, and the subsequent executive fallout, suggest that it would in general be hard to do ambitious things with Wikipedia. You could argue that this is because a visionary executive director is hampered by a bureaucratic organization and community, or you could argue it is because the Executive Director lacked vision or the ability to cooperate with the community to move things forward. I think this on the whole supports my rebuttal on (2). Wikipediocracy, a website whose content I mostly don&apos;t endorse but that still provides an interesting genre of Wikipedia criticism, sums up the situation by saying that <a href=\"http://wikipediocracy.com/2016/02/26/unicorns-are-a-myth-lila-tretikov-resigns-as-wikimedia-foundation-executive-director/\">unicorns are a myth</a>.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "vipulnaik"}}]
