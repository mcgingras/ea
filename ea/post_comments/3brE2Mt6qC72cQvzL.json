If this company came out and said they were making another code assistant, no one would have invested in them because there are already great code assistants on the market. Claiming that their product was an \u201cAI software engineer\u201d was the ONLY way for them to get funding and attention.</p>\n<p>Also, some of the claims they\u2019ve made involve smoke and mirrors. They claim \u201cit passes the top tech company coding interviews\u201d. It can do that because it\u2019s trained directly on the solutions to the Leetcode questions that top tech companies give. Google search could pass the top tech company interviews by that standard.</p>\n<p>People seem to vastly over estimate how much of software development is doing simple code tasks. Only 20% of software development is writing code and maybe 5% is doing simple code work that Devin was doing in the demos. Generative AI seems to have fundamental problems with reasoning, counting, and precision that I suspect will hold it back from being good at software engineering for a while longer.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "James-Sullivan"}}, {"_id": "iNh3Xu7zzvwePrbbW", "postedAt": "2024-03-20T16:46:05.912Z", "postId": "3brE2Mt6qC72cQvzL", "htmlBody": "<p>I hope you are correct.
