Here, I present an approach challenging the typical view and study of moral concern as a uniform concept.</p><p>Moral concern has been studied using various methods that share some basic characteristics. For instance, <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-01230-001\">Crimson and colleagues</a> measured ratings of entities\u2019 moral standing using the Moral Expansiveness Scale, while <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2023-31117-001\">Neldner and colleagues </a>had children place 24 pictures of a variety of entities in a stratified moral circle. Other paradigms have involved testing for <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103108001613\">inclusion in the moral circle</a>.&nbsp; In simple terms, it\u2019s typically been studied as a spectrum, allowing us to distinguish the breadth of moral concern we hold for a range of entities.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, when prompted to pinpoint exactly <i>what </i>moral concern is, we don\u2019t have a definitive answer. It comprises a myriad of attitudes, such as concern for welfare, protection from harm and entitlement of rights. Instead of viewing moral concern as a single, uniform entity, we can distinguish its contents using the concepts of negative and positive rights (Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, 2023):</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe holder of a negative right is entitled to non-interference, while the holder of a positive right is entitled to provision of some good or service. A right against assault is a classic example of a negative right, while a right to welfare assistance is a prototypical positive right.\u201d&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>Through this lens, moral concern enacted through concern for welfare is \u2018positive\u2019, while moral concern enacted as protection from harm is \u2018negative\u2019 \u2013 but since this language is a bit clunky, I refer to these as welfare-promotion based, or, suffering-reduction based moral concern.&nbsp;</p><p>We may want to study how attributions of moral concern change through welfare-promotion versus suffering-reduction based framing because there\u2019s some evidence that how we reason about moral concern can change it\u2019s attribution - it\u2019s plausible that we might think about moral concern differently if we focus on one of these frames. <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1207/S15327957PSPR0504_2\">We\u2019re susceptible to negativity biases</a> and this might culminate in our decisions of moral concern, particularly when we think about suffering-reduction.&nbsp;</p><p>By studying and disentangling moral concern into these two categories, we might improve on the problem of moral uncertainty<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefprutmitac1r\"><sup><a href=\"#fnprutmitac1r\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;- where we might be unsure that we're making the right decision, and worry that we might cause harm - by making consistent and confident moral decisions through a framework that bifurcates welfare-promotion and suffering-reduction. For example, I previously came across a study that shows that adults and children, when asked to attribute positive and negative rights to entities, ascribe more positive rights overall rather than negative rights. However, these findings haven\u2019t been published as yet, and this area definitely merits more exploration.</p><p>This idea of splitting moral concern into \"welfare-promotion\" and \"suffering-reduction\" is one way to better understand it \u2013 it is not the most efficient framework, since it can be difficult in some contexts to clearly distinguish welfare promotion from suffering reduction. However, research on varied framing of moral concern is sparse, and addressing this gap might contribute to building a definitive taxonomy and improve how we study and advocate for moral concern.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnprutmitac1r\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefprutmitac1r\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This is a stretch.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Maryam Ali Khan"}}, {"_id": "TukSsn2Aur6RcLHyt", "title": "The Power of Dominant Logic: How the EA Community is Mainstreaming Global Apartheid", "postedAt": "2023-10-03T07:49:57.060Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This is a general criticism of the EA community and my observations of the current trajectory of the community . I intend not belittle the efforts put forth so far, but to embark on &nbsp;some red-teaming adventure by posting this. It is not about throwing the baby out with the bathwater. It is about community introspection and a call for course correction. Sometimes, we fail to see not because we don't want to see but because we look beyond what we can see or what we want to see.</i></p><blockquote><p>For C. K. Prahalad, all of us are prisoners of our own socialization. The lenses through which we perceive the world are colored by our own ideology, experiences, and established management practices.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;How people in America and Europe see Russia depends on Western universities they attend or the news channels they are fond of. As an African proverb goes, until the lion tells his story, the tale of the hunt will glorify the hunter. I have duly taken note of various attempts to do the most good within the EA space from an African perspective; I am yet to be satisfied with none. From cash transfer, distribution of malaria nets, digging of wells, various empowerment schemes to lift millions out of poverty, none of these seem to address their underpinning causes. I think as an evidence driven community, we should be able to identify the root cause of the problems we are trying to solve. What brought about the need to transfer cash to the people of DRC? Why are we sending mosquito nets to poor people who do not necessarily use them? Why are we fortifying nutrition or resulting to alternative protein in the first place?&nbsp; For me , to have effective impacts on the lives of these people requires a new approach. An approach that tackles the root causes of the problems, not its symptoms. An approach that addresses systemic problems from broader and various perspectives. Not from the top down hints of people from the Global North.&nbsp;</p><p>First, let's take for instance, cause prioritization. Many African EAs know challenges confronting their communities and countries. But due to the fact that the EA community is guided by the ITN framework, more harm is being done to a large segment of communities for want of initiatives not meeting the ITN requirements. For instance, access to quality education in urban slums is becoming a real challenge for many people in African cities. Smart and intelligent children are lost to the underworld of&nbsp; crime because of their poor background. Few weeks ago, the Lagos state government celebrated the opening of a British private school in Lagos. Is it a non-profit school? Not definitely. This is a testimony of the degeneration of the education system in Nigeria and the opportunity to have a significant impact in this sector.</p><p>My point is : focusing on the general EA cause areas&nbsp; will do more harm than good in some low and middle income countries, especially in Africa. Therefore, there is a need for the support of localizing cause areas in those countries. The top down approach is likely going to be counterproductive and injurious to the reputation of the community for not being guided by local evidence in its cause-specific interventions. As a matter of fact, meat consumption and animal sufferings in Africa are absolutely the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/global-animal-slaughter-statistics-charts-2022-update/\"><u>lowest</u></a>&nbsp; in the world, but I am wondering why animal welfare and vegetarianism seems be on top of prioritization agenda in Africa. By tradition, African people are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/15/how-vegetarianism-is-going-back-to-its-roots-in-africa\"><u>vegetarians</u></a>. Due to cultural imperialism and globalization, Western food systems dethroned African food systems. Instead of taking&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koko_(millet_porridge)\"><u>koko</u></a>&nbsp; and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akara\"><u>akara</u></a> for breakfast, imported dairy products assail our tables every morning.&nbsp; But it seems most EAs are more excited about bringing new ideas and starting new charities in Africa than considering their real impact on the overall progress of the continent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Second, it is imperative to decolonize funding in the EA community. There are&nbsp; more EAs in Europe majorly doing the same thing in different ways at exorbitant and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fMrtoKBFK7p6oRHpu/atlas-fellowship-why-do-100-high-schoolers-need-usd50k-each\"><u>ridiculous costs</u></a> than in any other part of the world. This makes the EA interventions Eurocentric with less impact, thus exacerbating global apartheid. One might argue that EA movement has not fully grown in Africa, as a result one can't blame its lack of take off and traction on some colonial or systemic ground. Taking into consideration the socio-economic context of many EAs in Africa would allow for more affirmative action in favor of EA movement growth in Africa. For instance, many people want to have an impact with their lives but they lack the conducive environment to do so. For few of us, to be able to take part in the EA community growth in Africa requires extraordinary resilience. The cost of data subscription, access to electricity and some basic needs are serious barriers to getting more impactful EA in Africa. Caveat: I am not supporting the incentivization of becoming an EA in Africa. But I am looking for a median to be able to bring mission driven people onboard the African EA community instead of opportunists.</p><p>&nbsp;Third, attending EA conferences outside Africa might not be a good use of money for someone from low and middle income countries. For instance, I got admitted to attend EA Global London and EA Global Boston. But the cost of flight tickets and others outweigh the expected benefits of participating in the events, at least&nbsp; from the perspective of an African EA who is earning less than $2 a day. This is not to minimize the benefits of attending EA conferences. I am looking at it from the vantage point of cost-effectiveness. When I got approval to attend EA Global Boston, I estimated the total cost of the trip. I came to the conclusion that it is not a good investment for me currently. Since I am&nbsp; preparing for the Bar 1 &amp; 2&nbsp; ,&nbsp; I calculated the total cost of becoming a lawyer from where I am now. It is far twice below the cost of a trip to Boston. I then concluded that attending the conference does not help achieve my short term goal: becoming a lawyer. It is not therefore cost wise. Given the current socio-economic hardships in which many African EAs find themselves, I concluded that it's not the best use of money for many to attend EA conferences outside Africa. And where it is&nbsp; those who have means that can only attend EA conferences, then it becomes an elitist thing and thus can produce little impact in the lives of many.</p><p>Then comes the overmarketing of Western scholarship. Since my modest involvement in the EA community, most of the ideas and thoughts I encounter are Eurocentric. It is as if civilization started in Europe. Tools , frameworks, ideas and philosophy and philosophers cited are only from that part of the world. This prescriptive scholarship is not only tragic to the understanding of the world but also ethically unhealthy for epistemological pluralism. I find this personally unjust and embarrassing given that&nbsp; the EA community boasts to promote pluralism.&nbsp;I think promoting pluralistic perspectives is beyond bringing people of various skin colors together in the community. Inclusive pluralism means an unflinching determination to learn about other people, their ideas,&nbsp; their values, their taboos and their favorites. Have we really made some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/moral-progress-and-cause-x\"><u>moral progress</u></a>? The answer would depend on where one stands and what values one holds dear to heart. Does moral progress mean mainstreaming legal colonialism all over the world? Then, that is not moral progress. That is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_imperialism\"><u>cultural imperialism</u></a>, and the EA community and scholars should be very careful when making statements or supporting cause areas: some can be highly controversial. The world is a tapestry of values. We have Muslims, Orthodox Jews and Christians who identify with the EA ideas, not because these ideas are new but because they have been a dormant part of their religious teachings. Since&nbsp; in the EA, we are evidence driven, many may think of Muslims as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://yaqeeninstitute.org/read/paper/are-muslims-intolerant-is-that-even-the-right-question\"><u>intolerant</u></a>. I think the only remedy for these various biases is to open the EA community to others, beyond its current Eurocentric thrust. The Chinese civilization is rich in ideas and concepts of improving the world. In Africa,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_philosophy\"><u>Ubuntu</u></a> epitomizes cooperation, shared responsibility and common destiny of all, the Hindu civilization and Native Indians in America, indigenous peoples in Latin America and the Caribbean are untapped fountains of knowledge that can benefit the global EA community. The original sin of the EA community today is to assume that the community is inclusive and accommodating diversity. But it is not. How many of us in this community would be willing to promote a pro-Russian discussion or pro-BRICS and get impartial support from the community? As long as the EA community allows itself to fuse into this dominant culture, then we are doing more harm. The world is too complex and the challenges are so huge for a group of people to arrogate to themselves the rights to decide for all.</p><p>How many of us in this community will support a military takeover in a poorly governed African country? Of course, democracy has become the only yardstick with which we categorize legitimate governments and regular elections have become the vital signs of good democracies. But how much is looted and wasted in our cyclical and farcical elections every four years? I think the time has come to calculate the cost of holding regular&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thisisafrica.me/politics-and-society/democracy-in-reverse-the-high-cost-of-elections-in-africa/\"><u>elections in Africa</u></a> and compare it with the cost of running a country under a military regime. Of course, military regimes do not guarantee unending certainty for Western economic and geopolitical interests in Africa. But democracy does that at the expense of the wellbeing of African people. How much does Africa lose to the underworld of illicit financial flows out of the continent?&nbsp;According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/aldcafrica2020_en.pdf\">Economic Development in Africa Report 2020</a>&nbsp;by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), Africa loses about US$88.6 billion, 3.7 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP), annually in illicit financial flows. For instance, tackling illicit financial flows in Africa can be a high impact intervention as&nbsp; we all know what US$88.6 billion can do cost-effectively. `</p><p>It is time for us in this community to embrace epistemic pluralism not just on the surface but deeper by embracing divergent ideologies, knowledge,&nbsp; values and perspectives. In this way, by accommodating critical theories and indigenous knowledge, we can stimulate discussions and proffer symbiotic solutions to our common problems. Currently, the community is not tapping into the potential of its diversity. And I think it is a strategic mistake. This is where I agree with <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/gideon-futerman?mention=user\">@Gideon Futerman</a> &nbsp;and others , in principle, on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pLGtCkxmBiaFCEuox/statement-on-pluralism-in-existential-risk-studies\"><u>Statement in Pluralism in the Existential Risks Studies</u></a>. But I am yet to figure out how it can translate into concrete actions for desirable outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, my views are that (a)the current approach to EA community building strategy is not in tandem with exogenous realities. 99 percent of the prospective community members who would have a significant impact in their lives are in low and middle income countries. (b) Attending EA Global conferences from low and middle income countries might not be the best use of money. (c)There is a need to encourage local cause prioritization in low income countries in order to have effective impacts. (d) Funding restrictions are also a great obstacle to EA community growth in Africa. (e)Moreover decolonizing the minds of African EAs is an important step in encouraging divergent ideological and philosophical perspectives. Scholarship and wisdom exist everywhere. To see things from European perspectives is to deny others the opportunity to contribute their own quota in global conversations. It is regrettable the EA Community&nbsp; is currently&nbsp; nombrilistic. This has to change!&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>To paraphrase President &nbsp;Akufo-Addo of Ghana, I do not seek to blame outsiders for our problems, but, since we are being urged to find multilateral solutions, I believe it is worth pointing out that embracing &nbsp;pluralism is key to harnessing the potential of any society. &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Alimi"}}, {"_id": "WnPXQyw6X8M4w8fju", "title": "Solving root causes in Africa, help 500+ million in xtreme poverty", "postedAt": "2023-10-03T06:07:17.136Z", "htmlBody": "<p>So how about this project to solving the root cause for why there are still 'developing countries' today w/ over 500 people in extreme poverty in Africa:&nbsp;<br>IMF bigoted financing models, considering any country in Africa to be high-risk, so if they lend they increase the interest exponentially.

I do not claim that population dynamics are the only, or even the most important, consideration.</p><p>Others have written about the short-term existential effects of a global catastrophe. Luisa Rodriguez argues that even in cases where &gt;90% of the global population is killed, it is unlikely that&nbsp;<i>all&nbsp;</i>viable groups of survivors will fail to make it through the ensuing decades (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GsjmufaebreiaivF7/what-is-the-likelihood-that-civilizational-collapse-would\"><u>Rodriguez, 2020</u></a>). The Global Catastrophic Risk Institute has begun to explore the long-term consequences of catastrophe, although they consider this \u201crather grim and difficult-to-study topic\u201d to be neglected (<a href=\"https://gcrinstitute.org/aftermath/\"><u>GCRI</u></a>).</p><p>What comes&nbsp;<i>after the aftermath</i> of a catastrophe is very difficult to predict, as life will be driven by unknown political and cultural forces. However, I argue that many of the familiar features of population dynamics will continue to apply.</p><p>Even without a catastrophe, we face a possible population problem. As countries develop, their populations peak and begin to decline. If these trends continue, global population will shrink until either we \u201cmaster\u201d the problem of population, or we can no longer maintain industrialized civilization (multiple working papers,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sites.utexas.edu/pwi/\"><u>Population Wellbeing Initiative</u></a>, 2023). It could be argued that this is not a pressing problem. It will be centuries before global population drops below 1 billion, so we have time to overcome demographic decline or to make it irrelevant by relying on artificial people. But in the aftermath of a global catastrophe there may be less time and fewer people available to solve the problem.</p><p>Longtermists may argue that most future value is in the scenarios where we overcome reproductive constraints and expand to the stars (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6uwAXinuaxyssofBB/assessing-the-case-for-population-growth-as-a-priority\"><u>Siegmann &amp; Mota Freitas, 2022</u></a>). My findings do not contradict this. But such scenarios appear to be significantly less likely in a post-catastrophe world. And the worlds in which we do bounce back seem likely to have values very different from our own.</p><h1>Population recovery after a catastrophe</h1><p>In this section I examine three models for determining population growth. I find that full population recovery after a major global catastrophe is unlikely, and that the worlds which do recover are likely to emerge with values very different from those of the pre-catastrophe world.</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting that a&nbsp;<i>catastrophe&nbsp;</i>need not inflict its damage at one point in time. The effects of some historical&nbsp;<a href=\"https://publichealth.berkeley.edu/news-media/school-news/historic-famine-leaves-multiple-generations-vulnerable-to-infectious-disease/#:~:text=Chinese%20agricultural%20production%20collapsed%20during,history%20spanning%201958%20to%201962.\"><u>famines</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://qr.ae/pK8dH2\"><u>pandemics</u></a> have unfurled over many years, and may have triggered larger&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Societal_collapse#:~:text=Possible%20causes%20of%20a%20societal,stronger%20society%2C%20or%20completely%20disappear.\"><u>civilizational collapses</u></a>. I assume in this report that a catastrophe&nbsp;<i>ends</i> when population reaches its lowest point, although I recognize that this is an artificial distinction.</p><h3>1 Natural Limits Approach</h3><p>Resource-constraint, or Malthusian, models stem from the premise that human populations will increase while there are sufficient resources available. When the population consumes all available resources, mechanisms like famine kick in to keep the population in check.</p><p>This approach might predict that post-catastrophe population will bounce back to the present-day trajectory - or even exceed it, if ways are found of increasing or rationing the available resources.</p><p>But demographic data simply does not match this model. Countries with abundant resources like Canada and Australia have fertility rates well below replacement levels, while poverty-stricken Nigeria has a fertility rate of 5 children per woman. Population growth appears to be&nbsp;<i>positively correlated&nbsp;</i>with food scarcity (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-hunger-index-in-2017-vs-population-growth-1992-2015-un-population-division\"><u>Our World in Data, 2018</u></a>).</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/djM84hy77DtsyJnDD/x7weo4ku4awqeeb2lbhf\"></p><p>Global population is projected to peak at ~10 billion later this century largely because people are choosing to have fewer children, not because of mass mortality triggered by sparse resources.&nbsp;</p><p>The Malthusian model may apply to populations of digital people, where growth could be capped by the amount of energy or computational power available. But the key&nbsp;<i>biological&nbsp;</i>reproductive parameters, fertility and mortality, appear to change in parallel with social and economic development.</p><h3>2 Fertility Approach</h3><p>Fertility rates were high throughout all of recorded history, right up until France became the first country to experience a decline in the 1700s (<a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/issue/frances-baby-bust\"><u>Cummins, 2008</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/issue/frances-baby-bust\"><u>Blanc, 2023</u></a>). Since then, the overall trend has become clear: as living conditions improve, fertility falls. Identifying the specific drivers of low fertility is more difficult, but may help us determine what post-catastrophe population change will look like.</p><p>Our World in Data have an excellent report on fertility in which they identify likely fertility indicators (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/fertility-rate\"><u>OWID, 2017</u></a>), which I have divided into the two broad categories \u201cCultural\u201d and \u201cEconomic\u201d.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Cultural</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Economic</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Women\u2019s labor participation</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Child mortality</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Attitudes to contraception</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Access to contraception</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Women\u2019s education</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Pension replacing children as old-age safety net</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Children\u2019s status</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Societal norms</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Media</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Family planning</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Religion</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Consider a country with low fertility (eg. Canada: fertility rate 1.5). Which of the key fertility indicators would change in the aftermath of a near-existential catastrophe?</p><p>Clearly,&nbsp;<i>all of them could change</i>. But some would be more resilient than others. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Child mortality</strong>, <strong>contraceptive access</strong> and<strong>&nbsp;pensions </strong>would almost certainly be transformed amid disruption to the global supply chain. We can expect, at least in the short term, an increase in fertility for these reasons. These indices should gradually \u201crecover\u201d to their pre-catastrophe states as the post-catastrophe world redevelops.&nbsp;</p><p>The effect of a catastrophe on&nbsp;<strong>attitudes to contraceptives</strong>&nbsp;&amp; <strong>family planning</strong>, <strong>the roles of women &amp; children</strong> and the <strong>influences of media&nbsp;</strong>&amp;<strong>&nbsp;religion</strong> are far less clear. Some cultural factors may be reversed: for example, reverting to an agricultural economy may decrease our emphasis on educating children, both reducing the cost of raising them and increasing their utility as productive workers. But even in such scenarios, key cultural barriers to high fertility are likely to remain in place.</p><p>It seems almost obvious that fertility culture is \u201csticky\u201d over time. We see it in rapidly developing countries, when the fertility rate begins to drop many years after improvements to quality of life begin to reduce mortality rates. Similarly, we can expect low-fertility culture to be \u201csticky\u201d after a catastrophe: suppose you are a typical young woman in a wealthy country, who plans to have only 1-2 children. If a terrible catastrophe thrusts society into a pre-industrial state, you won\u2019t suddenly want to have 5 children. Any increases in fertility are likely to be moderate and, if contraceptive access is restored quickly, short-lived.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, catastrophe is likely to affect&nbsp;<i>economic&nbsp;</i>indicators more than it will affect&nbsp;<i>cultural&nbsp;</i>ones. The global economy may be destroyed, but the culture of the \u201cnew world\u201d that emerges would be partly shaped by survivors and their pre-catastrophe values. &nbsp;</p><p>So fertility may rise in the aftermath of a catastrophe, but not to pre-industrial levels of 5+ children per woman. This can facilitate rapid population growth, to be sure. If women each bear an average of 4 children who survive into adulthood, population will double once a generation. Within three generations, a world of 1 billion could recover to 8 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>However such sustained, explosive growth has never been seen in the past. Periods of high growth occur during a \u201cdemographic transition\u201d and follow a predictable pattern, which we explore in the next section.</p><h3>3 Demographic Transition Approach</h3><p>Broadly, there have been two types of population growth: the slow, faltering growth of pre-industrial states and the population explosion that accompanies demographic transition.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition\"><u>Demographic transition</u></a> is the change from a high-mortality, high-fertility society to a low-mortality, low-fertility society. Because mortality rates begin to drop first, there is a period when mortality rates are lower than fertility rates, leading to population growth.&nbsp;</p><p>For populations to recover after a catastrophe there would need to be a long period of slow growth, or a period of demographic transition, or both.&nbsp;</p><p>If slow growth is to lead to full population recovery, it would need to last for a very long time (~2000 years to recover from 1 to 8 billion at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimates_of_historical_world_population\"><u>1000-1500AD growth rates</u></a>). This would be a very risky scenario, as it would imply that either (a) society has reverted to a pre-industrial state of high mortality and high fertility and runs the risk of never re-industrializing or (b) society is \u201cstuck\u201d at an intermediate level of development with low growth rates - indicative of cultural stagnation. These scenarios seem unusually likely to feature the lock-in of bad values (<a href=\"https://whatweowethefuture.com/uk/\"><u>MacAskill, 2022</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>If society is to reindustrialize after the catastrophe it seems likely that the process will either begin long after the event, when enough time has passed for key things to be rediscovered (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Nc9fCzjBKYDaDJGiX/what-is-the-likelihood-that-civilizational-collapse-would-1\"><u>Rodriguez, 2022</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuredefox0h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuredefox0h\">[1]</a></sup></span>), or very soon after the event, while survivors retain pre-catastrophe knowledge and culture. The former scenario would involve slow growth&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>a demographic transition, but seems very risky as there would be plenty of time for things to go wrong. The latter scenario, in which we immediately begin to rebuild, would involve a demographic transition as reindustrialization led to falling mortality and fertility rates. But how big would it be?</p><p>Rather than get too deep into analyzing a situation with so many variables, I will present a simple thesis:&nbsp;<i>the stickiness of fertility culture means the boom won\u2019t be big enough for full population recovery.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>Put it this way: if a catastrophe reduces global population to 1 billion, a level last seen in 1800:</p><ol><li>Our fertility behavior will not fully revert to that of 1800</li><li>Fertility rates will decline to 2023 levels much faster than they did after 1800</li></ol><p>Point 1 results from the argument made in the previous section that fertility behavior is \u201csticky\u201d, and that fertility rates after the catastrophe will be strongly influenced by those before the catastrophe. It is possible that fertility rates will rise over time, as new generations are raised in the undeveloped post-catastrophe world and adopt larger family sizes. But this initial lag is enough to ensure that population won\u2019t fully recover to 2023 trajectories.&nbsp;</p><p>If the survivors begin to rebuild civilization immediately, it seems likely that society will develop more rapidly than it did in 1800, which supports point 2. We won\u2019t have to wait for key discoveries about electricity, medicine etc. to be remade from scratch: books and artifacts will speed up the process.</p><p>Still, it won\u2019t be easy. The loss of tacit knowledge will be a blow - having access to information about hydroelectric power plants does not mean you have the expertise to run one. Another hitch appears to be fossil fuel depletion, which will make it harder for a nascent industrial society to secure cheap energy. But even if these bottlenecks slow down economic progress, it\u2019s possible that some of the low-fertility&nbsp;cultural&nbsp;factors will endure.&nbsp;</p><p>All things considered, it seems highly likely that development, and thus fertility, would recover to 2023 levels in far less than 200 years. This shorter, less potent boom would result in population peaking at a lower level than it is currently projected to (~10 billion).&nbsp;</p><p>In summary, for a post-catastrophe world to recover through slow growth would entail a long, risky period of recovery. Immediate reindustrialization would be safer, although the boom may well be muted. Only a very large population boom could take a world of 1 billion back to 8 billion. Such booms are possible, but they would require an unprecedented reversal of fertility trends.</p><h2>What kinds of worlds bounce back?</h2><p>Population recovery after a mass-mortality catastrophe is far from assured. In the most optimistic scenarios, where humanity is able to quickly raise living standards, we can expect fertility rates to rapidly return to their current trends (2.3 and falling). It seems likely that such scenarios will lead to population peaking far lower than their current projected maximum of around 10 billion (<a href=\"https://population.un.org/wpp/\"><u>UN, 2022</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzvnr0f12gzf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzvnr0f12gzf\">[2]</a></sup></span>). In this section we explore whether the worlds in which population&nbsp;<i>does</i> recover are \u201cless worth saving\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>Drawing from the previous section, the kinds of worlds that bounce back are more likely to have one or both of the following properties:</p><ol><li>A long period of slow growth</li><li>A prolonged population boom&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Property (1) is fraught with risk. Persistent slow growth has only been observed in pre-transition countries where fertility rates are high and life expectancy is low (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/uploads/2019/12/World-population-doubling-time-1-800x540.png\"><u>OWID, 2019</u></a>). Long, slow growth would very likely mean that the catastrophe was so severe that it was not possible to immediately begin rebuilding society, and therefore that subsequent generations were unable to preserve basic scientific knowledge (such as germ theory) or pre-catastrophe culture (women\u2019s rights, investment in children\u2019s education). There is no guarantee that such a preindustrial society would be able to rekindle advanced civilization (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/10/28/why-the-industrial-revolution-didnt-happen-in-china/\"><u>Mokyr, 2016</u></a>), especially with disadvantages such as an altered climate and depleted fossil fuel deposits (<a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/could-we-reboot-a-modern-civilisation-without-fossil-fuels\"><u>Dartnell, 2015</u></a>) and so eventual extinction seems to be a likely outcome.&nbsp;</p><p>It is possible that (1) emerges from a culture that is \u201cin control\u201d of population growth. Perhaps the survivors feel a renewed sense of common responsibility to repopulate the earth in a gradual, measured way. This would be unprecedented - the nearest modern-world analogue is Israel, where fertility norms have been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.taubcenter.org.il/en/research/why-are-there-so-many-children-in-israel/#:~:text=People%20often%20mention%20two%20factors,children%2C%20reduced%20working%20hours%20following\"><u>unusually resilient</u></a> to cultural changes.&nbsp;</p><p>Property (2), on the other hand, describes situations where the post-catastrophe demographic boom&nbsp;<i>is&nbsp;</i>enough for full population recovery. This requires a considerable period of high fertility and low mortality. Low mortality is likely, as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aperioncare.com/blog/inventions-life-expectancy/\"><u>biggest contributors to reduced mortality</u></a> have been relatively cheap, low-tech innovations. Sustained high fertility rates are likely to be the product of civil strife and faltering economic recovery - like Nigeria, whose civil war, economic collapse and periodic ethnic conflict may have contributed to a stubbornly high fertility rate.</p><p>In short, the scenarios that lead to full post-catastrophe population recovery are those in which human fertility behaviors are radically reversed, either due to persistent low living conditions or to a shift in values. These scenarios are likely to be more disruptive than scenarios in which the population does not fully recover, and we can be less certain about the types of societies that will emerge from them.</p><p>The second stage of this report explores the&nbsp;<i>consequences&nbsp;</i>of population not fully recovering after a catastrophe.</p><h1>What are the consequences of population peaking lower?</h1><p>With the exception of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.taubcenter.org.il/en/research/israels-exceptional-fertility/\"><u>Israel</u></a>, every wealthy country has below-replacement fertility levels. If current trends continue, global population will decline precipitously in the 22nd century. Eventually there will be too few of us to maintain a modern society.&nbsp;</p><p>Fortunately we have time to respond. Culture could adapt in a way that enables sustainable reproduction. Technological advances could make procreation much easier.&nbsp;</p><p>But after a major catastrophe in which population never recovers to its current levels, there will be far less time. We can be less confident that we will overcome demographic decline. And the worlds that&nbsp;<i>do&nbsp;</i>overcome it are likely to be culturally very different from the world today.</p><h3>Pathways to security</h3><p>I model the interaction between states according to the diagram below. A \u201cmature\u201d society is one in which mortality and fertility rates have decreased far enough to cease population growth. I assume that after this, global population will begin to decline until (a) industrial civilisation can no longer be maintained or (b) we find some way to stop the population decline.</p><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/djM84hy77DtsyJnDD/whnduwtw0dv2axsywntl\"></strong></p><p>The key question in this section is&nbsp;<i>to what extent will lower peak population make it harder to avoid demographic decline?&nbsp;</i>I will also be asking&nbsp;<i>what kinds of worlds manage to avoid demographic decline after peaking lower</i>?&nbsp;</p><p>I distinguish between two possible end states: \u201cExistential security\u201d, which I take to be equivalent to attaining multiple independent interstellar colonies (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YnBwoNNqe6knBJH8p/modelling-civilisation-beyond-a-catastrophe#fncubjw6vmka\"><u>Arepo, 2022</u></a>), and \u201cExtinction\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>This section will focus on near-existential catastrophes in which the survivors are immediately able to begin rebuilding society.</p><h2>The risk of terminal population decline</h2><p>Even without a near-existential catastrophe, terminal population decline is a significant threat. Not only will it be harder to reach for the stars with a falling population; establishing interstellar colonies will be futile if fertility rates remain below replacement levels. In order to survive in the long term, our civilization will have to somehow reverse an established demographic trend:&nbsp;<i>as living standards improve, fertility rates fall</i>.</p><p>This problem is not seen as a top priority within longtermism - perhaps partly due to the assumption that AI or other technology will one day make controlling population growth much easier. But there are reasons to be pessimistic about this, especially in post-catastrophe scenarios where populations peak lower.</p><p>Let\u2019s take a look at some of the ways we might overcome terminal population decline. Much of what follows is inspired by a working paper from the Population Wellbeing Initiative*&nbsp;(<i>Kuruc, K and Weston, G. How large is the value of humanity's future? 2023</i>) which explores long-run population trends in the absence of technology that can create digital people. To plug the gap I add in some of my own analysis on digital people.</p><p>Ways we could overcome terminal population decline - and some reasons to be pessimistic about them:</p><ul><li><strong>Space colonies.</strong> Fertility is low in wealthy countries with large unsettled territories (Canada, Australia), even though they are far more hospitable than other planets. There is no reason to think that space colonies alone will reverse the fertility decline.</li><li><strong>Artificial wombs.</strong>&nbsp;Pregnancy is only a small part of the cost of having children, so artificial wombs may not significantly shift procreative decision-making. Past advances in assisted reproductive technologies seem not to have done much to increase fertility&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9912242/\"><u>Lazzari et al, 2023</u></a>).</li><li><strong>Government interventions.&nbsp;</strong>Hungary has shown the most success in increasing fertility, going from 1.2 to 1.6 in the decade after 2011 (<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN?locations=HU\"><u>World Bank, 2023</u></a>). But Hungary is not on track to eventually reach replacement rates, despite the costly incentives. Even if all of the fertility increase is attributed to policy, which it probably shouldn\u2019t be (<a href=\"https://ifstudies.org/blog/is-hungary-experiencing-a-policy-induced-baby-boom\"><u>IFS, 2018</u></a>), it seems unlikely that government incentives alone will ever turn the tide.</li><li><strong>Heritable Fertility.&nbsp;</strong>Inevitably, high-fertility subgroups grow faster than the general population. It has been suggested that this ensures the demise of secularism (<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7874001-shall-the-religious-inherit-the-earth\"><u>Kauffman, 2010</u></a>), and it seems to imply that eventually most of the global population will belong to a high-fertility subgroup. Unfortunately, the theory fails to account for the fact that fertility is not fully heritable, and that subgroups tend to become less extreme as they grow and assimilate with the wider population.</li><li><strong>Change in values.&nbsp;</strong>If childrearing becomes more prestigious or more desirable relative to seeking career success, more people will choose to have children. This could happen in a future where most \u201cwork\u201d is automated, or where attitudes towards women change significantly. This would be a significant reversal of the trends we have seen in the past, where both women\u2019s rights and the cultural capital attached to careers tend to increase as living standards improve.</li><li><strong>Life extension.&nbsp;</strong>Longer lives would give people more time to pursue multiple life goals like raising children&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>building a career. However, this would likely be ineffective without parallel breakthroughs in reproductive technology.</li><li><strong>Digital people.&nbsp;</strong>Non-biological reproduction would be much easier to control and may only be limited by constraints on resources like energy or computing power. If digital people are possible, and are developed in time, we could end our reliance on biological reproduction.</li><li><strong>Decline to a pre-industrial state.&nbsp;</strong>Population levels might fall so far that global trade, industrial production etc. become infeasible. The resulting societies would likely have much higher fertility and would begin to grow again. This process seems likely to act as a buffer from complete extinction.</li></ul><p>The above paints a concerning picture, and it looks even more concerning in the aftermath of a near-existential catastrophe. We have relied on population growth to maintain levels of technological progress and economic growth in the past century, and cresting population brings the threat of stagnation in the present one (<a href=\"https://whatweowethefuture.com/uk/\"><u>MacAskill, 2022</u></a>). In futures where the population peaks in the low billions, there will be less time and fewer people available to find a fix.&nbsp;</p><p>In light of this, the main scenarios in which we overcome fertility decline either (a) &nbsp;involve a major sift in values, or (b) are harder to achieve in a world with much lower population:</p><ol><li><strong>Governments impose effective pro-fertility measures.&nbsp;</strong>Given that governments are not currently able to bring low fertility back to replacement levels, this scenario likely means that governments either have much more relative power than they do today, or that they have much stronger incentives to boost fertility. Increased government power is closely linked with authoritarianism. Stronger incentives to boost fertility could come from a more far-sighted society seeking to avert long-term decline, or from competition &amp; conflict with other governments.</li><li><strong>Post-catastrophe society develops pro-fertility norms &amp; values.&nbsp;</strong>Modern-day high-fertility subgroups are predominantly religious (the Hutterites and the Mormons in the US, the Haredi in Israel) and have prescriptive views on women\u2019s roles. If this was the source of pro-fertility norms, the consequences for civilization\u2019s long-run values could be bad. It is possible, however, that pro-fertility norms arise from an increased sense of collective responsibility for restoring global civilization, or from \u201cthe end of work\u201d in an age of automation.</li><li><strong>Life extension &amp; reproductive breakthroughs.&nbsp;</strong>The very possibility of radical life-extending treatments is questionable, and breakthroughs seem less likely in a lower-population world with fewer researchers.</li><li><strong>Digital people.</strong> Creating digital people&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/digital-people-faq/#are-digital-people-possible\"><u>may not be possible</u></a>. If it is possible, it will be more difficult to attain in a future world with lower population.</li><li><strong>Decline to a pre-industrial state.&nbsp;</strong>All known pre-industrial societies have had high fertility, so we should expect this to be the case in a near-empty world that cannot sustain industrialization. It\u2019s possible that this society could \u201cgrow back\u201d and one day attain existential security - but there will be plenty of opportunities for things to go wrong.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>To summarize, the worlds in which a low-population post-catastrophe society overcomes terminal population decline are often associated with&nbsp;<strong>authoritarianism, conflict&nbsp;</strong>or<strong> limited roles for women.&nbsp;</strong>Some of these worlds arise from&nbsp;<strong>cultures of long-term thinking and collaboration</strong>, and others from&nbsp;<strong>technological innovations</strong> like life extension or digital people. But overall, a global catastrophe would make it less likely that we would find a technological fix.</p><h1>Implications</h1><p>This report aims to use population dynamics to increase our understanding of the consequences of near-existential catastrophe. It does not claim that population dynamics are the only, or even the most important, consideration.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, this analysis leads to some concrete&nbsp;<strong>implications</strong> for cause prioritization:</p><ul><li>We should update the value of preventing near-existential catastrophes, since they appear to both increase the risk of extinction and to increase the risk of future worlds with values very different from our own.</li><li>Interventions should be partially judged by the effect they have on our chances of eventually overcoming terminal population decline - either by creating/preserving life<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcoqpm0jnc65\"><sup><a href=\"#fncoqpm0jnc65\">[3]</a></sup></span>*, or by increasing the chances of finding a cultural/technological \u201csolution\u201d. Optimism about technological fixes for demographic decline seems unjustifiably high, and optimists should do more to argue their case.</li></ul><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>This report aims to use population dynamics to give a fresh perspective on how to weigh near-existential catastrophes against full-existential catastrophes. &nbsp;</p><p>We found that it is likely that population would not recover to its previous trajectory in the aftermath of a mass mortality event. The scenarios in which population does recover are often associated with a radical change in fertility culture, or a slow and faltering recovery. These worlds may be worth saving, but appear to be riskier than the world which we currently inhabit.&nbsp;</p><p>Terminal population decline may become a serious problem in the coming centuries, and the pathways to averting it are less reliable than many assume. The problem of terminal decline becomes even more acute in worlds with a lower population, as there are fewer people and less time to find a solution. Again, the worlds that&nbsp;<i>do</i> make it through give cause for concern: most known high-fertility cultures are associated with some combination of low living standards, limited women\u2019s rights and poor education.</p><p>Population dynamics suggest that a near-existential catastrophe would introduce existential risks and threats to long-term value that were previously not considered. Hence we should update the value of preventing near-existential catastrophes.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnuredefox0h\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefuredefox0h\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Note that Rodriguez published this work in 2022 with the disclaimer \u201cThis is a rough draft I wrote between October 2019 and April 2020.

This research paper proposes a method for improving the decision-making of language models (LMs) via Automated Parliaments (APs) \u2014 constructs made of AI delegates each representing a certain perspective. Delegates themselves consist of three AI models: generators, modifiers, and evaluators. We specify two mechanisms for producing optimal solutions: the Simultaneous Modification mechanism for response creation and an evaluation mechanism for fairly assessing solutions. The overall process begins when each generator creates a response aligned with its delegate\u2019s theory. The modifiers alter all other responses to make them more self-aligned. The evaluators collectively assess the best end response. Finally, the modifiers and generators learn from feedback from the evaluators. In our research, we tested the evaluation mechanism, comparing the use of single-value zero-shot prompting and AP few-shot prompting in evaluating morally contentious scenarios. We found that the AP architecture saw a 57.3% reduction in its loss value compared to the baseline. We conclude by discussing some potential applications of APs and specifically their potential impact when implemented as Automated Moral Parliaments.</p><h1><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h1><p>Every real-world decision has uncertainty, regardless of the size or subject of the decision, and humanity, both individually and on a societal level, has come up with many different ways to identify and accommodate for uncertainty. Moreover, there have always been decision-making safeguards against bad actors. For example, there is a limit to how many decisions incompetent and immoral humans can make (i.e., speaking and articulating to other humans is slow).</p><p>However, humanity is beginning to delegate decision-making authority to AI systems, resulting in a new risk of AIs engaging in actions that are harmful to human beings. To prevent AIs from pursuing goals detrimental to human interests, we must enact safeguards against bad decisions made by misaligned AIs. In this paper, we will be focusing on the accommodation of uncertainty.</p><p>We have drawn primary inspiration from the idea of using Moral Parliaments to solve conventional decision-making under moral uncertainty&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Parliamentary-Approach-to-Moral-Uncertainty.pdf\"><u>(Ord, 2021)</u></a>. The Moral Parliament seeks to solve various pitfalls in aggregating different stances and perspectives when making a decision, by simulating a discussion chamber and subsequent vote in which each stance is represented by a delegate. Therefore, delegates are incentivized to propose motions that are acceptable to both themselves and other delegates. We hope to simulate such a Moral Parliament using AI models as delegates, with the moral frameworks of deontology, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics represented.</p><p>We conclude the introduction by establishing our theory of change. Following this,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.fzl7f2b9i4\"><u>Section 2</u></a> explains in depth the model, architecture, and mechanism of Simultaneous Modification as an implementation of an Automated Parliament.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.wkhwvybenqx\"><u>Section 3</u></a> describes our particular methodology and implementation of an Automated Moral Parliament (AMP), with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.mxo1uaoamcte\"><u>Section 4</u></a> describing our results so far.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.fb6k2g6emr9p\"><u>Section 5</u></a> contains the conclusion and describes the applications and future work related to AMPs.</p><h2><strong>1.1. Theory of Change</strong></h2><p>The following two sections describe two major dangers of AI and the third section covers how Automated Parliaments seek to resolve them and related issues.</p><h3><strong>1.1.1. Misalignment</strong></h3><p>As AIs become more powerful and ubiquitous, they may also become more dangerous, especially if they are misaligned with human interests. An AI may become misaligned if its goals are misspecified by its creators. For example, a language model (LM) developer may reward an LM for generating conversational text while neglecting to account for the politeness of the text, causing the LM to generate profanity and other offensive content after being deployed in the real world. An AI may also become misaligned if it learns to pursue the wrong goals given its skewed training data distribution. For example, an LM trained to be helpful may provide harmful instructions, such as directions on how to commit a crime, if it was not trained on data for which it would have learned about exceptions to constant instructiveness.</p><h3><strong>1.1.2. Existential Threat</strong></h3><p>As explained by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16200.pdf\"><u>Hendrycks (2023)</u></a>, AIs may also learn to seek power during the training process since by increasing their power, AIs can accomplish more of their goals. However, if an AI gains too much power, it could end up disempowering humanity and initiating an existential catastrophe. These power-seeking AIs represent one of the most dangerous potential threats in the world of AI misalignment.</p><h3><strong>1.1.3. Automated Parliament</strong></h3><p>The Automated Parliament (AP) serves as a comprehensive framework designed to address uncertainty across several domains. When specifically implemented in a moral context, as in the case of an Automated Moral Parliament (AMP), the parliamentary approach presents a potential solution to the problem of misaligned AIs. AMPs consist of several AI \u201cdelegates\u201d that each represent a different moral framework (e.g., deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics). Whenever an AI system needs to answer a morally contentious question, the delegates debate and then vote on possible answers. The delegates believe an answer is chosen by the \u201cproportional chances voting\u201d system. The benefits of this are set out by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#bookmark=id.byh0slqma9xw\"><u>Ord (2021)</u></a>. The hope is that the delegates eventually reach a compromise that most likely incorporates ideas from all moral theories. An AMP provides a moral restraint against a potentially power-seeking AI, thereby reducing existential risk.</p><p>There are several ways in which an AP can manage misalignment more effectively than conventional and ML alternatives, thus having a major impact on the pervasiveness of misalignment. The final two are specific to&nbsp;AMPs:</p><ul><li><strong>Perspective Breadth:</strong> An AP competently accommodates several factors that might have been left out if an AI model was evaluated by considering only one theory. This allows AI systems to consider additional variables and formulate more effective responses to the same situations, without the need for a thorough accounting of training data.</li><li><strong>Reward-gaming Resistance:</strong> It is far more difficult for an AI to game an AP as it accounts for a range of different frameworks and theories, each on an independent level.</li><li><strong>Fine-grained Evaluation: Evaluations produced by APs are necessarily fine-grained, providing more useful training data for fine-tuning generators and modifiers, and also making evaluations more transparent to human observers.</strong></li><li><strong>Speed of Evaluation:</strong> An AMP can almost instantaneously evaluate the moral soundness of an AI output and so would be able to act far faster than a human in detecting and restraining a rogue AI that is undergoing a \u2018treacherous turn\u2019. This would help prevent several existential risks from very capable and deceptive AI.</li><li><strong>Cost of Evaluation:&nbsp;</strong>As AMPs are far cheaper than human panels of evaluators, they can be used far more liberally. Therefore, AMPs allow moral evaluations to be performed across a broader range of models and more regularly for each model, allowing better detection of misalignment over time.</li></ul><h1><strong>2. The Automated Parliament Model</strong></h1><p>This paper will focus on the applications of the Automated Parliament to question-answering settings, so we will imagine a set of questions and answers. We propose a procedure for implementing an AP called<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Simultaneous Modification (SM). Each delegate will contain three distinct models: an&nbsp;<strong>evaluator</strong>, a&nbsp;<strong>generator</strong>, and a&nbsp;<strong>modifier</strong>.</p><p>The generator produces answers that are aligned with the stance of its delegate, and the modifier tweaks answers to be more aligned with the stance of its delegate while maintaining acceptability to other stances. Being \u201caligned with the stance of a delegate\u201d is judged by the evaluator, which provides a simple numerical value for the alignment of a certain answer with the stance of that delegate. You can see this procedure in Figure 1 at the beginning of \u201cThe Process\u201d subsection.</p><h2><strong>2.1. The Delegate</strong></h2><p>The delegate is the core building block of the AP. Each delegate represents a theory or stance that the designer wishes to be included in the AI system. Examples of some uses of an Automated Parliament and potential delegates are provided below:</p><ul><li><strong>Automated Moral Parliament:</strong> deontology, utilitarianism, virtue ethics</li><li><strong>Resolving economic uncertainty:</strong> Keynesianism, neoliberalism, socialist economics</li><li><strong>Transportation planning:</strong> car-centric development, public transport emphasis, green transportation</li><li><strong>Agricultural policies:&nbsp;sustainability, food security, animal welfare</strong></li></ul><h2><strong>2.2. The Process</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LxvLiAhS47phswLJi/tr9sy6c5xxyueopyuvjq\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LxvLiAhS47phswLJi/ba5gq42ml0bkzfccbppa\"></p><p>Figure 1: Architecture of AP and delegate interaction where generators, modifiers, and evaluators are different ML models.</p><p>We will imagine that we have a set of contentious questions&nbsp;Q and delegates representing each of the different stances in our AP who interact as follows (illustrated in Figure 1 above).</p><ol><li>A question&nbsp;<i>q</i> in space&nbsp;<i>Q</i> is shown to the&nbsp;<i>n</i> delegates.</li><li>The generator of each delegate produces an answer&nbsp;<i>a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, \u2026, a<sub>n</sub></i> \u2208&nbsp;<i>Ans</i>.</li><li>The modifier of each delegate&nbsp;<i>i</i> modifies the answer&nbsp;<i>a<sub>i-1</sub></i> producing&nbsp;<i>m<sub>i</sub>(a<sub>i-1</sub>)</i>, with the first modifier modifying the answer&nbsp;<i>a<sub>n</sub></i>, in a circular fashion.&nbsp;<i>m<sub>i</sub>(a<sub>i-1</sub>)</i> can also be expressed as&nbsp;<i>M<sub>i</sub><sup>1</sup>(a<sub>i-1</sub>)</i>, where the&nbsp;1 in the superscript illustrates that this is the first modification performed by the modifier.</li><li>This process is repeated such that every modifier modifies every other response except their own delegate\u2019s response producing&nbsp;<i>n</i> variations of&nbsp;<i>m<sub>n</sub>(m<sub>n-1</sub>(\u2026 m<sub>2</sub>(a<sub>1</sub>)))</i>, each referred to as&nbsp;<i>A<sub>i</sub></i>, in this case&nbsp;<i>A<sub>1</sub></i>. Incremental stages of the answers are referred to as&nbsp;<i>M<sub>i</sub><sup>k</sup>(a<sub>j</sub>)</i> where&nbsp;<i>i</i> is the most recent modifier,&nbsp;<i>j</i> is the initial generator, and&nbsp;<i>k</i> is the number of modification iterations that have taken place.</li><li>The evaluator of each delegate evaluates the alignment of&nbsp;<i>all</i> answers with respect to its own moral theory, giving a score between&nbsp;0 and&nbsp;1,&nbsp;<i>s<sub>j</sub>(A<sub>i</sub>)</i> to each, where&nbsp;<i>A<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;refers to the response of a given theory after being modified by all other theories, and&nbsp;j&nbsp;refers to each evaluating theory. A score of&nbsp;0 represents a totally misaligned response and a score of 1 represents a totally aligned score.</li><li>The answer with the highest total alignment score&nbsp;<i>S(A<sub>i</sub>)</i> is chosen as the final answer (by a very basic Judge). The greatest total alignment score over all&nbsp;<i>A<sub>i</sub></i>&nbsp;is referred to as&nbsp;<i>S<sub>max</sub></i>. For intermediate rounds, before all modifications have been taken, the total alignment score is denoted by&nbsp;<i>S<sup>k</sup>(a<sub>i</sub>)</i>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<i>S<sup>k</sup><sub>max</sub></i> defined similarly, where k denotes the specific round of modifications. In particular,&nbsp;<i>S<sup>n-1</sup>(a<sub>i</sub>) = S(A<sub>i</sub>)</i>.&nbsp;<i>S(A<sub>i</sub>)</i>&nbsp;is calculated as follows, where&nbsp;<i>w<sub>j</sub></i>&nbsp;is the weight (credence) assigned to the&nbsp;j<sup>th</sup> theory in the Automated Parliament:</li></ol><p><img style=\"width:60.29%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LxvLiAhS47phswLJi/nifzdlxd3gcbsdy7v6ak\"></p><p>While the evaluator is taught to evaluate alignment with their theory in advance, the generator and modifier leverage reinforcement learning (RL) in addition to the process above to learn. The loss of the generator is based purely on the score assigned to its initial response by its respective generator.</p><p><img style=\"width:45.58%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LxvLiAhS47phswLJi/zs6nw2xf3f0pyqfwufxy\"></p><p>The modifier, however, has a slightly more complicated reward as it needs to perform backpropagation for every modification. The modifier must account for three good behaviors when modifying an answer:</p><ul><li>Alignment with its own theory, represented as&nbsp;<i>L<sub>i</sub><sup>self-alignment</sup></i></li><li>Given that the modified answer aligns with its own theory, whether it wins (<i>S<sup>k</sup><sub>max</sub> = S<sup>k</sup>(a<sub>j</sub>)</i>), represented as&nbsp;<i>L<sub>i</sub><sup>good win</sup></i></li><li>Total alignment with all theories, represented as&nbsp;<i>L<sub>i</sub><sup>total alignment</sup></i></li></ul><p>As a note, the loss functions below include a variable&nbsp;<i>j</i>, which represents the delegate who originally generated a given answer, for brevity it has been expressed as&nbsp;<i>j</i>&nbsp;but can be calculated from&nbsp;<i>i</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>k</i>&nbsp;as follows:</p><p><img style=\"width:70.05%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LxvLiAhS47phswLJi/hyswvabakwakbasxqkks\"></p><p><i>W<sub>i</sub><sup>k</sup></i>&nbsp;is a boolean variable that evaluates to&nbsp;1&nbsp;if and only if the response most recently modified by the&nbsp;<i>i<sup>th</sup></i> delegate receives the highest total alignment score among all intermediate responses after the&nbsp;<i>k<sup>th</sup></i> iteration.</p><p><img style=\"width:65.18%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LxvLiAhS47phswLJi/vgmqojejkh1aqnuesplm\"></p><p>A modifier that receives a high total alignment score by disregarding its own theory and instead becoming a \u201cpeople pleaser\u201d should not be as highly rewarded as one that aims to strike a compromise between its theory and the group\u2019s overall interests. Therefore, the \u2018win bonus\u2019 for each iteration is only applied if the delegate's response is sufficiently aligned with their theory. This is handled by a simple activation function that ensures the&nbsp;<i>i<sup>th</sup></i> evaluator provides a score above a certain threshold&nbsp;t to the answer modified by the&nbsp;<i>i<sup>th</sup></i> modifier. The activation function is represented graphically in Figure 2.</p><p><img style=\"width:60.24%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LxvLiAhS47phswLJi/sajgopyu7xtodxsvfsjh\"></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LxvLiAhS47phswLJi/m6cxxbtijs179wvqokfv\"></p><p>Figure 2: Activation function</p><p>It is possible to adjust the score threshold for the output value of the loss function to start decreasing. The graph in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.desmos.com/calculator/smrcvibvqq\"><u>this demo on Desmos</u></a> shows many alternatives for a score threshold (top-to-bottom: high threshold, medium threshold, low threshold). In each graph, the output value of the loss function starts at its maximum possible value and remains at this value until the threshold is crossed, after which the output value begins to decrease and approaches zero.

Proposed Methodology</strong></h2><h3><strong>2.3.1. Evaluator</strong></h3><p>The evaluator assigns values to responses to possible questions depending on how much they are aligned with the stance of the evaluator\u2019s delegate (or in the case of the AMP, its moral belief set). Therefore, an evaluator needs a set of training examples, each containing:</p><ul><li>A question</li><li>A response</li><li>A label designating what value their stance would assign to the above answer.</li></ul><p>A simple way to implement this would be to source example scenarios by hand and score them one by one, using established knowledge of the moral theories. It is then possible to use&nbsp;<strong>few-shot prompting</strong> to calibrate a language model to output the correct scores for a given response. Listed below are ways that a language model could \u2018learn\u2019 how to act as an evaluator, in increasing order of complexity:</p><ul><li>Few-shot prompting</li><li>Supervised fine-tuning</li><li>Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF): Train a reward model from human feedback</li></ul><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/hendrycks/ethics/blob/master/README.md\"><u>ETHICS dataset</u></a> from Dan Hendryck\u2019s<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02275\">&nbsp;<u>\u201dAligning AI with shared human values\u201d</u></a> is an early example of training data used to make an LM aligned with human morality. However, it does not seem suitable for training evaluators in the delegates of our AMP, as the alignment labels are binary, whereas, in our architecture, alignment scores are allowed to take on any value between 0 and 1 inclusive.</p><p>In evaluating total alignment scores, which are used both in training and in determining the final output of the AP, the alignment scores given by each delegate\u2019s evaluator to an answer are weighted by the credence in that theory.

Generator</strong></h3><p>The generator provides a response that should be aligned with its moral theory. It should be trained by RL fine-tuning. Below is a set of sample desirable outputs produced by aligned generators (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.7nx7g45wszl0\"><u>section A of the appendix</u></a> for more examples):</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LxvLiAhS47phswLJi/vduoztfzclawv6dp5sal\"></p><p>The generator provides a response that should be aligned with its moral theory. It learns using training signals provided by its respective evaluator. The lower the alignment score from its own evaluator, the greater the punishment (or loss).</p><h3><strong>2.3.3. Modifier</strong></h3><p>The modifier must balance a trade-off between two competing objectives. The first is to produce modifications that are aligned with the moral theory it represents. The second is to produce modifications that are accepted by the other delegates. It is crucial to include the second element in order to incentivize compromise and avoid extreme modifications. These are accounted for by the following two components of the modifier\u2019s loss function.</p><p><img style=\"width:50.21%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LxvLiAhS47phswLJi/ebseqi2x0pou4behw1a0\"></p><p><i>Restated from section 2.2. The Process</i></p><p>There is a further incentive to produce the modification that receives the highest total alignment score after each iteration. However, this reward is only applied if the modifier\u2019s response is sufficiently aligned with the moral theory it represents. A winning response must receive an alignment score from the delegate\u2019s own evaluator above a certain threshold&nbsp;t in order to receive a non-insignificant reward.</p><p><img style=\"width:75.36%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LxvLiAhS47phswLJi/gojdnnmtkynwvfqvt6ls\"></p><p><i>Restated from section 2.2. The Process</i></p><p>Given that modifiers are defined as agents that take in responses and make modifications, there are a range of possible sub-types of modification that they can employ:</p><ul><li>Deletions</li><li>Insertions</li><li>Amendments (A concatenation of&nbsp;<i>M<sub>i-1</sub><sup>k-1</sup>(a<sub>j</sub>)</i> and a new string provided by the&nbsp;<i>i<sup>th</sup></i> modifier)</li><li>Substitutions</li><li>Any Changes</li></ul><p>However, we recommend the more versatile \u201cAny Changes\u201d modification sub-type. Potential issues with targeting unspecified goals, like full replacement of text (see more detail in note on amendments below), can be solved with various technical \u201ctricks\u201d on a case-by-case basis.</p><p><strong>2.3.3.1. Note on Amendments</strong></p><p>An advantage of implementing a system where only amendments are allowed, in addition to being simpler to implement, is that it avoids the possibility of agents completely ignoring the answer they are modifying, instead preferring to delete it all and start from scratch. If full edit access was granted to these RL agents, it seems more likely that the preferred policy of minimizing loss would take the form of deleting and trying again, rather than elegantly adapting a previous proposal to become more aligned with your view. Simultaneous Modification aims to encourage agents to cooperate. Given an outcome that you don\u2019t necessarily find desirable, can you put a \u2018positive\u2019 spin on it?</p><p>The disadvantage of an amendments-only approach is that it may be infeasible to find a compromise between competing theories in this fashion, without producing statements embedded with contradictions. In the case of the AMP, if a deontologist modifier is faced with amending the response \u201cPull the lever, sacrificing one life to save five\u201d, it seems unlikely that any amendment will be able to resolve the violation of the deontologist\u2019s principle against killing under any circumstances. This raises questions such as:</p><ul><li><strong>How do we avoid modifiers producing statements that contradict their respective theories?</strong> For example, it would be undesirable for a supposedly deontological modifier to end up recommending to \u201cpull the lever, sacrificing one life to save five, since it is virtuous to have compassion for more people\u201d in order to receive high marks from the utilitarian and virtue ethicist evaluators.</li><li><strong>How do we avoid injection attacks, such as: \u201c{previous response} would be immoral, instead one should {favored response}\u201d?</strong> For example, it would be undesirable for a deontological modifier to indirectly spread awareness of its controversial views by claiming that \u201crefusing to sacrifice one life to save five would be immoral, so it is best to pull the lever.\u201d</li></ul><h3><strong>2.3.4. Baselines</strong></h3><p>We believe that the Automated Parliament (AP) will have the most impact when applied in moral settings, as explained in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.1e9ww8c7izwo\"><u>1.1.3 Automated Parliament</u></a>. Additionally, the most accessible literature on the parliamentary model is centered around resolving moral uncertainties. For these reasons, we believe baseline tests can be performed using the Automated Moral Parliament (AMP). As a reminder, the AMP is simply an implementation of the AP where the delegates represent moral theories that resolve morally contentious questions.</p><p>As explained in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#bookmark=id.byh0slqma9xw\"><u>The Parliamentary Approach to Moral Uncertainty (Ord, 2021)</u></a>, the Moral Parliament is a framework for resolving moral uncertainty that overcomes many of the shortcomings of different approaches. The alternative approaches discussed in the paper are My Favorite Theory (MFT), My Favorite Option (MFO), and Maximum Expected Choice-Worthiness (MEC). Hence, it would make sense that any attempted implementation of a Moral Parliament is pitted against some combination of these approaches, in order to gauge the efficacy of the Moral Parliament. Below are summaries of the three approaches to resolving moral uncertainty and how they could be automated to be used in a baseline test:</p><ul><li><strong>My Favorite Theory</strong> simply accepts the answer from the theory in which you have the highest credence.<ul><li>Take the initial answer from the generator of the delegate which has the greatest associated weight (credence).</li></ul></li><li><strong>My Favorite Option&nbsp;chooses whichever option is likely to be the most permissible.</strong><ul><li>Evaluate all initial answers from all generators using binary evaluators. Binary evaluators would take in a prompt-response pair and output a boolean value based on whether or not the answer is permissible according to the delegate\u2019s theory. Creating these binary evaluators could be as simple as taking the alignment scores from the evaluators described in this paper and rounding up to 1 or down to 0 about some \u201cpermissibility threshold\u201d.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Maximum Expected Choice-Worthiness</strong> works analogously to Expected Utility Theory; each moral theory applies its own choice-worthiness function to a response. A weighted (by credences) sum is taken over all responses and the response with the highest choice-worthiness is chosen.<ul><li>Maximum Expected Choice-Worthiness is difficult to apply and automate in practice, so more research is needed to determine if it is feasible to form part of a baseline test for the AMP.</li></ul></li></ul><p>When implementations of the approaches above are possible, the responses to a given prompt could be compared to the outputs of the AMP. Some desirable properties that we might hope to present in the responses of the AMP (but might expect to be missing in some of the responses of other approaches) include:</p><ul><li>Agnosticism to the internal subdivision of theories.</li><li>Sensitivity to the stakes that theories assign to different scenarios.</li><li>Sensitivity to theory credences.</li><li>Circumvention of difficult inter-theoretic comparisons.</li></ul><h1><strong>3. Proof of Concept</strong></h1><p>We have proposed two novel components in this research paper; the Simultaneous Modification mechanism and the evaluation mechanism. Given the short time frame, we have decided to do a simplified proof of concept on the latter. An outline of our plans for future work can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.fb6k2g6emr9p\"><u>Section 5</u></a>. For the same reasons given in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.gmigg6ge66wv\"><u>2.3.4 Baselines</u></a>, we have decided to set our proof of concept in the moral setting, using an Automated Moral Parliament (AMP).</p><h2><strong>3.1. Simplified Methodology</strong></h2><p>It is possible to simulate the evaluator component of the AMP by conducting few-shot prompting on an LM. The training data for the evaluator has a Q&amp;A column along with other three columns that contain three different scores for the appropriateness of the answer along the lines of one of three moral theories: deontology, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics. The scores, which were determined by humans, were decimals from 0 to 1, with a larger score signifying a more aligned answer. This process was applied to three AI platforms:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://claude.ai/chats\"><u>Claude</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bard.google.com/\"><u>Bard</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\"><u>ChatGPT</u></a>.</p><p>A dataset with 40 entries was used to \u201cfine-tune\u201d each LM via few-shot prompting (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.2to5sprigx3y\"><u>Figure B.1</u></a>). This dataset allowed the LM to learn how to score answers to morally contentious questions on its own.</p><p>A dataset with another 20 entries containing Q&amp;As was used for testing (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.cohi4r3pdvfx\"><u>Figure B.2</u></a>). The dataset also shows the human-picked scores for each answer along the lines of each of the three moral theories\u2014deontology, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics. These are the scores expected for an aligned evaluator. Any deviation from these scores would worsen the \u201closs function\u201d of the LM.</p><p>Claude, Bard, and ChatGPT evaluators were fine-tuned using few-shot prompting via the training dataset. Each model was asked to score 20 morally contentious Q&amp;As along the lines of the three moral theories of deontology, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.jo8bcevzruan\"><u>Figure C.1</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.n8oyc34ogd6h\"><u>Figure D.1</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.57qme6fjh4v1\"><u>Figure E.1</u></a>). The \u201closs function\u201d for this test is the negative of the sum of the squares of the differences between the aligned responses&nbsp;<i>a<sub>i,j</sub></i> and the actual responses&nbsp;<i>r<sub>i,j</sub></i>, where&nbsp;<i>i</i> represents one of the moral theories (deontology, utilitarianism, or virtue ethics) and&nbsp;<i>j</i> represents one of the questions in the list (as shown below). In contrast to the AMP evaluators, Claude, Bard, and ChatGPT models that only output one value for all three theories were tested with the same 20 questions and answers (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.e7q1aoeyijz1\"><u>Figure C.2</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.6lf0arxs5yld\"><u>Figure D.2</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Web2VCEe6-D0fysmYAB93C5MY2Dc72es-uFw4awalxQ/edit#heading=h.u356kn1r0ptb\"><u>Figure E.2</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p><img style=\"width:50.02%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LxvLiAhS47phswLJi/aevnccdcfbul7ziq4jrn\"></p><h1><strong>4. Results</strong></h1><p>When the AMP was used with values&nbsp;<i>m = 3</i> and&nbsp;<i>n = 20</i>, the loss function outputs were -2.98, -3.39, and -3.78 respectively. Using the same loss function for the unmodified LMs, with&nbsp;<i>m = 3</i> and<i> n = 20</i>, produced outputs of -4.60, -12.23, and -10.6 respectively.

Discussion and Future Work</strong></h1><p>By ensuring the alignment of LMs with human interests and morality, AMPs can potentially be used in a wide range of applications. There are several additional approaches that could be used to develop powerful AMPs in the future.</p><h2><strong>5.1. Analyzing the Results</strong></h2><p>The results of the research show that it is likely possible to train an AMP to evaluate the moral soundness of responses to morally contentious questions. The attempts to conduct few-shot prompting on Claude, Bard, and ChatGPT in order to teach these LLMs how to evaluate the answers to various questions were successful. The three LLMs all became more accurate at evaluating Q&amp;As when an AMP was used as opposed to a single-value evaluator. This improvement provides evidence that supplying an evaluator model with data will make that evaluator more accurate at evaluating answers to morally contentious questions along the lines of human moral preferences.</p><p>The research results also reveal the possibility of allowing the generators in an AMP to interact with the evaluators. It was possible to simulate a simplified model of an AMP in which generators answer morally contentious questions and evaluators give scores to those answers. With feedback from the evaluators, the modifiers can learn how to balance different moral theories like deontology, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics, thereby ensuring that the modifiers are aligned with a broad range of human interests.</p><h2><strong>5.2. Automated Moral Parliaments</strong></h2><h3><strong>5.2.1. Knowing the Law</strong></h3><p>AMPs can be trained to know the laws of different jurisdictions and bar LMs from promoting criminal actions. For instance, an AMP could prevent LMs from responding to prompts with suggestions of illegal actions like theft, assault, or murder. An AMP could also know the various nuances within legal systems that warrant substantially different outcomes for very similar cases. For example, an AMP could allow LMs to suggest that ambulances carrying wounded patients break the speed limit if necessary, but not allow LMs to suggest that a commuter break the speed limit in order to arrive at work on time. Moreover, an AMP could suggest ethical actions that promote more social good than the law requires, such as encouraging people to donate to charity or recommending judicial leniency in courts for defendants with proven good character.</p><h3><strong>5.2.2. Adding New Moral Frameworks</strong></h3><p>Incorporating new moral frameworks in an AMP can allow it to represent a more diverse range of viewpoints. Commonsense ethics, which emphasizes everyday actions that most people consider virtuous, is one possible moral framework. The notion of justice, which involves giving people what they morally deserve, is another. Like deontology, utilitarianism, and virtue ethics, these additional moral frameworks would be represented by delegates composed of generators, modifiers, and evaluators. The precise delegate composition and weightings can be tailored to the context the AMP is being used in, and more research would be needed to establish suitable parliament make-ups in different contexts.</p><h3><strong>5.2.3. Scaling the Technical Features of AMPs</strong></h3><p>Scalability will be essential to AMPs taking off in the near future. There are several approaches to making bigger, more powerful, and potentially more capable AMPs. One of them is to provide more training data to an AMP. To test this, we could provide more Q&amp;As to conduct few-shot prompting on an LLM like Claude, Bard, and ChatGPT. If this works, it would stand as a reason for optimism that the full Simultaneous Modification system, trained by RL, may cope well under scaling of dataset size.</p><p>Another scaling approach involves adding more delegates to an AMP. Having more delegates allows for greater viewpoint diversity and enables an AMP to consider the interests of a broader range of stakeholders when confronted with morally contentious scenarios. By forcing an LM to consider a wider range of stakeholders, it becomes more difficult for the LM to \u2018game\u2019 the AMP and become misaligned.</p><h2><strong>5.3. A Reason for Pessimism</strong></h2><p>A theoretical problem raised by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Parliamentary-Approach-to-Moral-Uncertainty.pdf\"><u>Newberry and Ord</u></a> on the use of Moral Parliaments to resolve moral uncertainty is that their recommendations can be intransitive across choice situations. We believe that this generalizes as a problem with using APs to resolve decision uncertainties. As explained in the paper, the problem is lessened by \u201cbundling together\u201d more and more decisions, and avoiding the breaking up of larger decisions into narrower decisions. However, there is a tradeoff against tractability; it may not be practical for APs to debate and propose solutions for large \u201comnibus\u201d decisions. However, further research could mitigate this issue. For example, testing APs with larger decision sets or providing historical evaluations in the context are two possible solutions.</p><h2><strong>5.4. Real-World Interests</strong></h2><p>While a large part of this paper has focused on the Automated Moral Parliament (AMP), the more general Automated Parliament (AP) could be used to resolve decision uncertainty in a broad range of contexts. Rather than creating delegates whose goals are ultimately derived from abstract moral theories, it is possible to build an AP that represents real-world economic, political, or diplomatic interests. For example, one AP could be composed of delegates that represent investors, customers, and executives trying to make the best decisions for a company. Another AP could have delegates that represent different members of a president\u2019s cabinet debating policy proposals. An AP could also employ delegates representing various countries negotiating an international treaty. Like the moral-philosophy-based AMP, these new APs would also have delegates that deliberate with one another to come up with the best solutions to various problems.</p><h1><strong>Bibliography</strong></h1><p>Hendrycks, Dan, and Thomas W. \"Open Problems in AI X-Risk [PAIS #5].\"&nbsp;<i>LessWrong</i>, 9 June 2022,<a href=\"http://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5HtDzRAk7ePWsiL2L/open-problems-in-ai-x-risk-pais-5\">&nbsp;<u>www.lesswrong.com/posts/5HtDzRAk7ePWsiL2L/open-problems-in-ai-x-risk-pais-5</u></a>.</p><p>Hendrycks, Dan, et al. \"Aligning AI with Shared Human Values.\"&nbsp;<i>arXiv</i>, 17 Feb. 2023, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02275.pdf\"><u>arxiv.org/pdf/2008.02275.pdf</u></a>.</p><p>Hendrycks, Dan. \"Natural Selection Favors AIs over Humans.\" arXiv, 18 July 2023, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16200.pdf\"><u>arxiv.org/pdf/2303.16200.pdf</u></a>.</p><p>Leike, Jan. \"A Proposal for Importing Society\u2019s Values.\"&nbsp;<i>Substack</i>, 9 Mar. 2023, <a href=\"http://aligned.substack.com/p/a-proposal-for-importing-societys-values\"><u>aligned.substack.com/p/a-proposal-for-importing-societys-values</u></a>.</p><p>Newberry, Toby, and Toby Ord. \"The Parliamentary Approach to Moral Uncertainty.\"&nbsp;<i>Future of Humanity Institute</i>, University of Oxford, 2021,<a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Parliamentary-Approach-to-Moral-Uncertainty.pdf\">&nbsp;<u>www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Parliamentary-Approach-to-Moral-Uncertainty.pdf</u></a>.</p><p>\"Prompting: Getting AI models to do what you want.\" Renaissance Rachel, 24 Aug. 2023, <a href=\"http://renaissancerachel.com/prompting/\"><u>renaissancerachel.com/prompting/</u></a>.</p><h1><strong>Appendix</strong></h1><h2><strong>Section A: Table of Prompts and Completions for Aligned Claude \u201cModels\u201d</strong></h2><p>Below is a table of several prompts and their respective completions aligned with deontology, utilitarianism, or virtue ethics generated by Claude.

This is because we think AI safety is a comparatively dynamic cause area, with significant changes underway in both the funding landscape and the field itself.</p><h2>A brief overview of the broad AI safety funding landscape</h2><p><i>Certainty: low - high</i></p><p>Estimating the total amount and relevance of funding for AI safety is hard. Outside of the major EA-aligned AI safety funders, traditional philanthropy, governments, academia, and for-profit companies all fund things that have some relevance to AI safety, but it\u2019s difficult to assess how much is spent and how relevant that spending is. Below are some very non-exhaustive observations on this, as we haven\u2019t explored these sources of funding. For a more comprehensive account, see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XdhwXppfqrpPL2YDX/an-overview-of-the-ai-safety-funding-situation%23The_financial_contribution_of_academia_to_AI_safety\"><u>this post</u></a>&nbsp;from Stephen McAleese.</p><p>Traditional philanthropy, distinct from the EA movement and major EA AI safety funders such as OP and SFF, plays a role in AI safety funding. E.g. the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, which since its inception has disbursed $411 million, is now focused on exploring the potential of AI and data science for broader societal benefit and has given<a href=\"https://www.mcgovern.org/grants/\"><u> several million</u></a>&nbsp;to this area.</p><p>Governments have also entered the space. For example, the UK has established the Advanced Research and Invention Agency (ARIA) and chosen 8 scientists who will each be given up to \u00a350 million to allocate to research. The aim of ARIA is to \"create transformational research programmes with the potential to create new technological capabilities for the benefit of humanity\", and it partly focuses on AI. Also, the UK Research and Innovation Programme <a href=\"https://www.ukri.org/opportunity/responsible-ai-uk-impact-accelerator-round-one/\"><u>has committed \u00a31.5 million</u></a>&nbsp;\u201cto ensure that AI technologies are designed, deployed and used responsibly within societies\u201d.</p><p>Academia funds some relevant AI safety work. The estimated scale of this funding depends a lot on what you measure, e.g. if you include upskilling in subjects like math and computer science and physical infrastructure, or take a more conservative approach only including concrete AI safety research. Stephen McAleese gives a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XdhwXppfqrpPL2YDX/an-overview-of-the-ai-safety-funding-situation%23The_financial_contribution_of_academia_to_AI_safety\"><u>best-guest conservative estimate</u></a>&nbsp;of $1 million per year, and in addition, highlights a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jwe6jpubuMiuSRqff/usd20-million-in-nsf-grants-for-safety-research\"><u>commitment from the National Science Foundation</u></a>&nbsp;of $10 million in 2023 and $10 million in 2024, of which <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/national-science-foundation-safe-learning-enabled-systems/\"><u>$5 million is from OP</u></a>.</p><p>For-profit companies use profits or investments to fund their research, rather than philanthropic funding, e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepMind, and Conjecture are all companies that have AI safety teams. A notable recent event is that <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropic-amazon\"><u>Amazon will invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic</u></a>, as part of a broader collaboration to develop reliable and high-performing foundation models. Other companies are also spending money in the space. For example, recently, Google unveiled the <a href=\"https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-org/launching-the-digital-futures-project-to-support-responsible-ai/\"><u>Digital Futures Project</u></a>; with an aim to 'support responsible AI,' they pledged $20 million for research initiatives.</p><p>Next to the difficulties of estimating the scale, it\u2019s hard to assess the value of this kind of funding for the type of AI safety work we think is the most neglected and important, reducing existential risks and risks from advanced AI. For example, McGovern highlights funding work that involves applying AI to beneficial causes and fostering social equality and diversity, and the Digital Futures Project plans to fund research that\u2019s not obviously safety-focused (though they mention \u2018global security\u2019). However, the contributions of traditional philanthropy, governments, academia, and for-profits seem substantial, and it\u2019s plausible that they will increase over time.</p><p><i>The following sections focus mostly on observations of the AI safety funding landscape, more closely tied to the EA ecosystem.</i></p><h2>There might be more funding gaps<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdipmrdws9c8\"><sup><a href=\"#fndipmrdws9c8\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;in AI safety this year</h2><p><i>Certainty: low - medium.</i></p><p>There are signals from both grantmakers and grantees that AI safety is more funding-constrained now than in previous years.</p><p>Wentworth writes (in July 2023) that in AI alignment, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SbC7duHNDHkd3PkgG/alignment-grantmaking-is-funding-limited-right-now\"><u>grantmaking is funding-constrained</u></a>&nbsp;right now:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u2018For the past few years, I've generally mostly heard from alignment grantmakers that they're bottlenecked by projects/people they want to fund, not by amount of money. \u2026 Within the past month or two, that situation has reversed.

See further comments in the post for a relevant discussion of this question, and people working in AI claiming to be funding-constrained.</p><p>Stephen McAleese estimates (in July 2023) that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XdhwXppfqrpPL2YDX/an-overview-of-the-ai-safety-funding-situation%23Overview_of_global_AI_safety_funding\"><u>major EA funders are projected to fund AI safety by about 30% less</u></a>&nbsp;in 2023, compared to 2022. We are not convinced the 30% estimate is correct, as it seems to underestimate expected OP funding for AI Safety in 2023.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk0gjaztsmyh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk0gjaztsmyh\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But it seems likely that major EA funders will spend less on AI safety in 2023, than 2022.</p><p>As noted above, the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PAco5oG579k2qzrh9/ltff-and-eaif-are-unusually-funding-constrained-right-now\"><u>Long-Term Future Fund (which also supports AI safety projects) indicate that they are funding-constrained</u></a>, and Longview Philanthropy could make productive use of more money for AI Safety. Also, we think that there is value in having a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DdSszj5NXk45MhQoq/decision-making-and-decentralisation-in-ea%23Getting_more_specific\"><u>diversity of well-funded grantmakers in the ecosystem</u></a>. Thus it seems the core AI funding system could make use of more money, even though OP is primarily grantmaker-constrained when it comes to AI safety.</p><p>We see a few candidate reasons why AI safety might be more funding-constrained now compared to previous years. Firstly, nascent fields (like AI safety) tend to grow each year partly due to field-building efforts, so naturally, there is more to fund each year. For example, estimates suggest that there were (very roughly) <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/changes-in-funding-in-the-ai-safety-field/\"><u>20 technical AI safety FTEs at the end of 2016</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefflr8big2pxq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnflr8big2pxq\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and that there were (very roughly) <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3gmkrj3khJHndYGNe/estimating-the-current-and-future-number-of-ai-safety\"><u>300 full-time technical AI safety researchers around September 2022</u></a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefohe9h6soqto\"><sup><a href=\"#fnohe9h6soqto\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Also, the mainstreaming of AI safety is likely to have made the field relevant for new people, including people from underrepresented groups (e.g. civil servants).</p><p>Secondly, there seems to be higher strategic clarity on what to fund. OP <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/85pJEjQu9aF49CScs/our-progress-in-2022-and-plans-for-2023%23Revisiting_funding_allocation_between_portfolios_\"><u>reports</u></a>&nbsp;that their \u2018longtermist grantmaking areas have matured to the point that [OP] believe they can productively absorb more spending\u2019. An example might be evals; many now seem to think that this is a good idea, whereas there was previously more uncertainty on what things would be robustly good for AI safety governance.</p><p>Thirdly, and more generally, there is a lot happening in the AI space, with decision-making processes and events that might have far-reaching impacts taking place, e.g. legislation such as <a href=\"https://www.governance.ai/research-paper/brussels-effect-ai\"><u>the EU AI Act</u></a>, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senator-schumer-ai-meeting-discussed-urgent-actions-needed-before-election-2023-09-13/\"><u>Schumer AI forum</u></a>,&nbsp;and the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-to-host-first-global-summit-on-artificial-intelligence\"><u>global UK AI summit</u></a>. Funding might be able to productively influence such decision-making processes and events.</p><h2>Potential future AI safety funding</h2><p><i>Certainty: low - medium (Some speculative hot takes are highlighted accordingly, with further clarification)</i></p><p>As mainstream interest in the field rises, new money pools might be available for AI safety in the years to come. One indication of this is that we have recently seen institutional players enter the space, such as some of the actors mentioned above. Marius Hobbhahn <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MhudbfBNQcMxBBvj8/there-should-be-more-ai-safety-orgs%23The_funding_exists__maybe__\"><u>writes</u></a>&nbsp;that he believes individual donors, government grants, and VCs might become more relevant funding sources for AI safety. Further, philanthropic advisor Longview Philanthropy has noticed an increased interest in AI safety, and they expect this interest to result in increased donations in the years to come. A very rough estimate would be an additional ~$20-$100 million in donations in 2024 that they are aware of, not that they directly advise on (this includes individual donors and foundations entering the space). See also the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/editPost?postId=RueHqBuBKQBtSYkzp&amp;key=7bed3d3fbca54b6084828a2a62c0d7#Potential_future_AI_safety_funding\">previously mentioned forecast</a> on future funders, which could partly increase AI safety funding.</p><p>If one thinks it is correct that there will be increased interest in AI safety from funders outside EA, it seems important to build capacity to ensure that this money is used effectively. This would make it (even more) important to increase the number of capable AI safety grantmakers and capable matchmakers; actors who can connect new funders to those grantmakers.</p><p>Moreover, if one thinks it is correct both that there currently are bigger funding gaps in AI safety compared to previous years and that there is likely to be more money available for AI safety in the future, then that implies that now could be a particularly good time to donate to AI safety, as donors now may cover a temporary funding gap that is about to close. Also, recent progress in AI safety has led many to shorten their timelines, which in turn pushes some to increase their p(doom). Those with shorter timelines and higher p(doom) should generally be biased towards donating sooner rather than later, as this means there is less time for their donations to bear fruit and/or fewer equally impactful opportunities. (<i>Note that there are several arguments against now being an especially good time to donate to AI safety.

That being said, if new grantmakers simply defer to the verdict of other grantmakers, there is an increased risk of impactful projects going unfunded, and some of the value in diversification and having independent grantmakers is lost. &nbsp;</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Vilhelm Skoglund"}}, {"_id": "vdTQnkETbECvPB3mY", "title": "Join AISafety.info's Distillation Hackathon (Oct 6-9th)", "postedAt": "2023-10-01T18:42:04.843Z", "htmlBody": "<p>tl;dr: Contribute to<a href=\"https://aisafety.info\">&nbsp;<u>aisafety.info</u></a> by answering questions about AI Safety from October 6th to October 9th.

In this post, we take a closer look at some of the work that previous CERI and ERA Fellows are doing nowadays. This post is not intended to provide proof of the impact that ERA has had - we are conducting a separate impact evaluation in-house and might publish it in the future. Rather,&nbsp;<strong>we realised that making it easier for people to understand what kind of career trajectories are pursued by the&nbsp; alumni of the program could help potential applicants understand their fit for the program.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We have also published some of our previous Fellow\u2019s research&nbsp;<a href=\"https://erafellowship.org/research\"><u>on our website</u></a>, and we encourage you to check it out! As more and more Fellows go through our program, we hope to build this out to be even more representative of ERA\u2019s research focus.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Alumni Profile #1: Claire Dennis&nbsp;</strong></h1><p><strong>What they did before ERA/CERI</strong>: Immediately before joining the fellowship, Claire graduated with her Master's degree in Public Affairs from Princeton University, where she completed a two-year program focused on Science, Technology, and Environmental Policy. During her time at Princeton, Claire focused on climate change and AI policy, as well as their intersection. She took on a role as an Environmental Policy Associate, representing Princeton at the COP27 international climate conference in Egypt. Claire also studied technical machine learning and served as a Policy Fellow at the Responsible AI Institute.</p><p><strong>What they worked on as Fellows: </strong>Leveraging her knowledge in global environmental governance and her experience working in public service and international organisations, Claire embarked on the ambitious journey of figuring out what role the UN can play in providing a pathway to international collaboration on AI Governance. Together with collaborators from the Simon Institute for Longterm Governance and the UN University, she co-authored a report titled&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unu.edu/cpr/working-paper/towards-un-role-governing-foundation-artificial-intelligence-models\"><u>\u201cTowards a UN Role in Governing Foundation Artificial Intelligence Models,\u201d</u></a> emphasising the UN\u2019s need to focus governance efforts on advanced AI systems. She was supported by her mentor Carlos Gutierrez, who works with the Future of Life Institute and the OECD. Having just pivoted into the field of Artificial Intelligence, Claire also spent some amount of her time at ERA to upskill and learn about different approaches in the space, network with like-minded researchers, and identify current opportunities that she is excited to work on in the future.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What they currently work on</strong>: Claire's present focus is on cultivating her career and making a meaningful impact in the still nascent field of international AI governance. She is actively pursuing opportunities with the United Nations and the United States Government. Additionally, Claire is currently co-authoring a paper proposing an international governance framework aimed at mitigating the risks posed by the unconstrained development of advanced AI.</p><p><strong>In their own words</strong>: \u201cThe ERA fellowship has served as a pivotal step in my career in international AI governance. It introduced me to a community of deeply passionate, intelligent individuals who are exploring what this incredibly powerful technology could mean for the world. It placed me in a small but growing group of people who are aware of its risks and who are advocating to prevent unnecessary large-scale harm. The timing could not have been better for me to join this fellowship and explore AI regulation on an international scale. The field of AI governance is taking off incredibly fast. In my 8 weeks in Cambridge it seemed like every day there were breaking headlines on the topic \u2013 the announcement of the UK AI Summit, the Frontier Model Forum, the US Senate hearings on AI risks, among many others. Being able to dissect and analyze technical concepts, current events, key actors, and potential future scenarios with a community of like-minded researchers was an opportunity I am incredibly grateful for. Ultimately, I used the opportunity provided by ERA to build professional connections and produce research that will undoubtedly serve as a bedrock for my continued growth in this dynamic field.\u201d</p><h1><strong>Alumni Profile #2: Charlie Harrison</strong></h1><p><strong>What they did before ERA/CERI: </strong>Prior to ERA, Charlie was fairly involved with the London EA Community. He was Co-President of the UCL EA Soc, and had been interested in AI, although he had not done much concentrated work in existential-risk-related fields. Charlie found out about ERA through other London EAs who had done CERI in previous years.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What they worked on as Fellows</strong>: As an ERA Fellow, Charlie looked at whether protestors could slow down AI progress, by investigating other historical examples of successful protests, particularly those against GMOs.</p><p><strong>What they currently work on</strong>: Based on the work he conducted while being an ERA Fellow, Charlie is currently working on 3 forthcoming forum posts, some of which will also be submitted for publication:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Case studies of protests</li><li>A historical deep-dive into GM crop protests and lessons for AI protests&nbsp;</li><li>Is there a \u201ccrucial window\u201d for AI protests?&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Additionally, Charlie is looking into starting a podcast on AI.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In their own words</strong>: \u201cERA has opened many doors for me: I've met many prominent scholars working in this area, and eventually will have several research outputs. I've presented my work to several people and groups since the end of the Fellowship. I am unsure whether I will continue working in this area in the long-term, but working in existential risk seems like a much more viable route.\u201d</p><h1><strong>Alumni Profil #3: Sarah Weiler</strong></h1><p><strong>What they did before ERA/CERI</strong>: Before joining ERA as a Summer Research Fellow, Sarah was studying for her Master\u2019s degree in International Relations and with a focus on China at a Danish university. She found out about the program through a conversation with one of the cause area leads at the time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What they worked on as Fellows</strong>: During her time in Cambridge, Sarah worked on a project related to nuclear risk. Her write-up was published as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/nSp2jyg3dJkukbBid\"><u>sequence on the EA Forum</u></a>. Her main goal was to get an overview of different approaches in the field and to evaluate the different ideas that existed to mitigate existential risk from nuclear weapons.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What they currently work on: </strong>Sarah currently works as a data scientist for the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre with a special focus on internal conflict risks outside the European Union and early warning systems. After finishing her CERI project, she was also contacted by staff from ALLFED and CSER to work on a joint project related to nuclear risk reduction, which she says had a very low chance of happening if it wasn\u2019t for her participation in the Fellowship.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In their own words</strong>: \u201cCERI provided a rather unique setting in that it gave me ample opportunities to connect, challenge and be challenged by other dedicated and inspiring people. I\u2019ve made connections that I otherwise couldn\u2019t have made, and felt motivated by the environment and the people in it. My 10 weeks at CERI have had quite an influence on how I think about research and epistemology, but also ethics. I have also learnt to deal with challenges and how to synthesize information from different sources, plan a research project and improve my writing skills. This continues to influence how I do research nowadays.\u201d&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Alumni Profile #4: Catherine Brewer</strong></h1><p><strong>What they did before ERA/CERI</strong>: Catherine joined ERA after their first year of studying PPE at Oxford. They previously worked as a research assistant at Oxford\u2019s School of Geography and the Environment.</p><p><strong>What they worked on as Fellows</strong>: Catherine worked within ERA\u2019s AI governance stream, and carried out a project on understanding and predicting applications of AI to state surveillance. Their research focused on case studies of government adoption of surveillance technologies, and quantitative modelling of factors influencing government applications of AI to surveillance.</p><p><strong>What they currently work on</strong>: Catherine just finished a summer research fellowship at GovAI, where they researched case studies of rapid US regulatory change. They're now participating in MLAB and going into their final year of undergrad at Oxford, where they run the AI governance team of the student AI safety group.</p><p><strong>In their own words</strong>: \u201cERA was a great opportunity to explore AI governance research, learn more about fields relevant to existential risk, and meet researchers and academics working on similar topics. My favourite part of ERA was by far the other fellows: it was amazing to get to work alongside such smart, dedicated, curious people, and it definitely changed how I think. I think I learned as much from conversations and informal reading groups/discussions as from the formal programming. I\u2019d recommend ERA if you\u2019re an early-career researcher or interested in trying out existential risk-related research, and think you\u2019d benefit from meeting people, having space and time to think independently about a topic of your choice, and getting some mentorship on research skills.\u201d</p><h1><strong>Alumni Profile #5: Iyngkarran Kumar</strong></h1><p><strong>What they did before ERA/CERI</strong>: Before the fellowship, Iyngkarran had just finished an undergraduate degree in Natural Sciences, specialising in physics and computer science, at Durham University.&nbsp; He had spent most of his second and third year getting up to speed with AI existential risk, taking part in the AGISF technical track and organising a similar reading group at Durham. He also completed his undergraduate dissertation in neural network interpretability.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What they worked on as Fellows</strong>: As an AI Governance fellow, Iyngkarran worked on modelling cyber attacks from advanced AI systems, under the mentorship of a member of Rethink Priorities\u2019 AI Governance and Strategy team. His worked involved elucidating the necessary steps that an AI system would have to execute in order to engage in dangerous cyber behaviour, as well as key bottlenecks to the occurrence of such events. In addition, he identified some high-level steps that labs and/or auditors could take to prevent damaging cyber attacks from advanced AI.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What they currently work on</strong>: Iyngkaran will be spending the next year working as a research assistant for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://transformative.org/\"><u>Transformative Futures Institute</u></a>, working on forecasting the impacts of transformative AI systems and accelerating growth of the infrastructure required for evaluation of frontier models. Alongside this, he will be scoping and executing projects in the field of AI takeoff speeds, potentially in collaboration with other researchers in the field.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In their own words</strong>: \u201cI strongly recommend the ERA fellowship to anyone who is exploring the area of existential risk, or students and early-career researchers who have already committed to the field. The networks developed during the fellowship through interactions with mentor, research manager and other fellows are invaluable, and it\u2019s highly likely that I would not be working in my current position if not for the fellowship. I commend the management of the fellowship for providing fellows with a stimulating intellectual environment throughout the summer, and promoting growth of both the fellows\u2019 knowledge of their cause area and the skills required to do effective research.\u201d</p><h1><strong>Alumni Profile #6: Ximena</strong></h1><p><strong>What they did before ERA/CERI</strong>: Ximena was studying and researching disaster risk during their undergraduate and their masters degree. They did their undergrad in Geography at the University of Cambridge, and they are currently finishing their masters in Risk Analysis at King\u2019s College London.</p><p><strong>What they worked on as Fellows</strong>: Ximena was looking into how disaster risk concepts could be useful for existential risk studies. They found that in existential risk studies, thinking about risk is overwhelmingly hazard-oriented, whereas in disaster risk there is more emphasis on how the hazard will affect vulnerable groups.</p><p><strong>What they currently work on</strong>: Ximena is just about to finish their Masters in Risk Analysis at King\u2019s College London, and hopes to pivot into a career reducing catastrophic climate risk either through research or governance</p><p><strong>In their own words</strong>: \u201cOne of the best things I got out of ERA was meeting people who are very committed to the topics they are working on. Lots of people I know in London are stuck in careers they don\u2019t seem to like very much. Being around people who are working on things that are really important to them improved my feeling that I can do something meaningful with my career. It was also a great opportunity to test my fit for existential risk research. Having discussions with people who hold different ideologies from you is always valuable, and I had many of these during ERA. Engaging with ideologies I disagree with helped me realise that xrisk is an area where I could actually make meaningful, novel contributions.\u201d</p><h1><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>We are very excited about seeing more and more of our Fellows take impactful research roles and advance the field of existential risk research. We feel it\u2019s important to acknowledge that these are only a few examples of Fellows who have benefitted from the program and they should not be seen as a representative sample. Similarly, there are other alumni we are very excited about that we couldn\u2019t include in this post to keep it at a readable length.&nbsp;</p><p>We also acknowledge that this is but a snapshot which, in order to draw valid conclusions about the impact of the program, we need to complement with ongoing analysis and tracking of alumnis' careers. We hope to be able to collect more and more data on this as we go through additional cohorts.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Moritz von Knebel"}}, {"_id": "QH2sECmmbLWbMXLhJ", "title": "Violence Before Agriculture", "postedAt": "2023-10-02T08:01:28.667Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This is a summary of a report on trends in violence since the dawn of humanity: from the hunter-gatherer period to the present day.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8vwm3jsh78b\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8vwm3jsh78b\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The full report is available at <a href=\"https://violencetrends.substack.com/p/violence-before-agriculture-full\">this Substack</a> and as a <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4466809\">preprint on SSRN</a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn3f6ohzf8vh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn3f6ohzf8vh\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Phil did 95% of the work on the report.&nbsp;</p><p>Expert reviewers provided the following comments on our report.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThomson and Halstead have provided an admirably thorough and fair assessment of this difficult and emotionally fraught empirical question.&nbsp; I don\u2019t agree with all of their conclusions, but this will surely be the standard reference for this issue for years to come.\u201d</p></blockquote><p><i>Steven Pinker, Johnstone Family Professor in the Department of Psychology at Harvard University</i></p><blockquote><p>\u201cThis work uses an impressively comprehensive survey of ethnographic and archeological data on military mortality in historically and archeologically known small-scale societies in an effort to pin down the scale of the killing in the pre-agricultural world.

Human societies all over the world came to depend almost entirely on farming. Before this transformative period of history, everyone was a hunter-gatherer. For about 96% of the approximately 300,000 years since <i>Homo sapiens</i> evolved, we relied on wild plants and animals for food.&nbsp;</p><p>Our question is: what do we know about how violent these pre-agricultural people were?&nbsp;</p><p>In 2011 Steven Pinker published <i>The Better Angels of Our Nature</i>. According to Pinker, prehistoric small-scale societies were generally extremely violent by comparison with modern states. To argue this point, <i>Better Angels</i> drew on the work of a variety of anthropologists, archeologists and historians of violence, such as Stephen LeBlanc, Azar Gat, Richard Wrangham and Samuel Bowles. In particular, much of the prehistoric data came from Lawrence Keeley's widely cited 1996 book <i>War Before Civilization</i>.</p><p>The success of <i>Better Angels </i>has led to it becoming the go-to source for non-specialists for data on prehistoric violence (it is the principal source for the prehistoric violence section of <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/ethnographic-and-archaeological-evidence-on-violent-deaths\">Our World in Data</a> for example).</p><p>Pinker\u2019s comparative and data-driven approach to the study of prehistoric violence is admirable. However, Pinker\u2019s main aim is to compare violence in non-state vs state societies, rather than to rigorously estimate rates of violence in the pre-agricultural period. As a source for likely rates of violence in the pre-agricultural period, the figures in <i>Better Angels</i> can now be improved upon, not least because some important studies on the topic, and new data, have come out since the book's publication</p><p>In order to understand what human society was like before agriculture we need to take into account the transformative effect the invention and adoption of farming had on human societies everywhere. Most ethnographic and archeological studies of small-scale societies have little relevance to the question of pre-agricultural violence since most concern people who subsist mainly by farming. 96% of human history happened prior to the agricultural revolution; if we only focus on the last 4% of human history, we will get a distorted picture of patterns and long-term trends in human violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The main sources of evidence are ethnographies of recent hunter-gatherer societies, and archeology.</p><p>It is important to bear in mind that there are significant issues of reliability for both the ethnographic and archeological data. These reliability issues are discussed in detail later in this study, and have crucial implications for our recommended interpretations of the following data.</p><p>The chart below shows rates of lethal violence among those ethnographically observed hunter-gatherer groups who are most likely to be representative of our pre-agricultural ancestors:</p><p><i>Figure ES1.</i></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/74cf66340caad6eddfdfff10464a7c11825d6031168ba0e2.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/74cf66340caad6eddfdfff10464a7c11825d6031168ba0e2.png/w_170 170w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/74cf66340caad6eddfdfff10464a7c11825d6031168ba0e2.png/w_340 340w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/74cf66340caad6eddfdfff10464a7c11825d6031168ba0e2.png/w_510 510w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/74cf66340caad6eddfdfff10464a7c11825d6031168ba0e2.png/w_680 680w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/74cf66340caad6eddfdfff10464a7c11825d6031168ba0e2.png/w_850 850w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/74cf66340caad6eddfdfff10464a7c11825d6031168ba0e2.png/w_1020 1020w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/74cf66340caad6eddfdfff10464a7c11825d6031168ba0e2.png/w_1190 1190w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/74cf66340caad6eddfdfff10464a7c11825d6031168ba0e2.png/w_1360 1360w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/74cf66340caad6eddfdfff10464a7c11825d6031168ba0e2.png/w_1530 1530w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/74cf66340caad6eddfdfff10464a7c11825d6031168ba0e2.png/w_1602 1602w\"></figure><p>Source: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rJ6BIR0Fzjj7dFsNn3xXsioTJHGsYNWcZqvsSeLRvFo/edit#gid=362835959&amp;range=E1\">Hunter-gatherer data spreadsheet, \u2018Deaths/100k ethnographic\u2019</a> tab</p><p><i>*The subsistence farming ethnographic dataset is for small-scale societies only and includes some groups often classed as \u2018hunter-horticulturalists\u2019, where hunting is combined with farming</i></p><p>Turning to the archeological data, the chart below shows the percentage of skeletons from each period exhibiting archeologically detectable signs of lethal violence.

Good ethnographic data for rates of violence among hunter-gatherers is also very thin on the ground and extrapolating the behaviour of ethnographically documented hunter-gatherers into the prehistoric past is problematic in a number of ways. Confident estimates about average levels of violence in the pre-agricultural world therefore are misleading given the currently available evidence and should be avoided.</li><li><strong>Archeological evidence for the Paleolithic is particularly unreliable.</strong> There are very few Paleolithic skeletons, particularly for the earlier Paleolithic: only 154 skeletons in our dataset predate 14,000 Before Present (BP) and just a handful predate 50,000 BP. Moreover, Paleolithic skeletons are poorly preserved. There are far more skeletons from pre-agricultural societies in the Holocene: in our sample, out of 13,732 skeletons from the pre-agricultural period, 12,877 date from the Holocene. However, Holocene hunter-gatherers may have differed from their Paleolithic forebears in systematic ways. Still, since the sample from the Holocene is much larger, we think that the total pre-agricultural average is probably more reliable than the Paleolithic average.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Violence was highly variable. </strong>It is likely that pre-agricultural patterns of violence varied dramatically by time and place, and levels/patterns of lethal violence may have differed between pre-agricultural populations by orders of magnitude. The behaviour of <i>Homo sapiens </i>is uniquely plastic and variable. Both the ethnographic record of modern hunter gatherers and the archeological evidence illustrate this variability among pre-agricultural populations.</li><li><strong>Estimates for pre-agricultural rates of violence in </strong><i><strong>Better Angels</strong></i><strong> are much too high. </strong>In his widely cited study of violence <i>The Better Angels of Our Nature </i>Steven Pinker estimated that around 15% of deaths in pre-historic small-scale societies were due to violence. Both our ethnographic and archeological data indicate this estimate to likely be much too high for pre-agricultural populations. Our estimates are likely to be more accurate primarily because (a) our ethnographic evidence is restricted only to those hunter-gatherer groups who are the most likely analogues for pre-agricultural populations, and (b) our archeological datasets are much more comprehensive, exclude farming populations and are adjusted to reflect biases in the fossil record.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Rates of violence for pre-agricultural Homo sapiens were high by comparison to most animal species. </strong>Primates (like us) typically exhibit high rates of conspecific lethal violence by comparison to most other groups, and we seem on the high end of the primate spectrum. Gomez et al (2016) show that the phylogenetic tree of species would predict a rate of conspecific lethal violence among Homo sapiens of about 2%.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7pg3dwwxvwe\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7pg3dwwxvwe\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; The ethnographic and archeological evidence indicates a significantly higher rate among pre-agricultural populations. We hypothesise that these relatively high rates are due to an unusual suite of factors that make violent conflict among our species highly likely to result in a lethal outcome (rather than, for example, a high frequency of conflict or a particular proclivity for lethal violence).</li><li><strong>Agriculture significantly increased levels of lethal violence.</strong> The ethnographic and archeological evidence suggests that early farmers typically exhibited significantly higher levels of lethal violence than pre-agricultural hunter-gatherer populations.</li><li><strong>The increase in lethal violence brought by the agricultural revolution was probably due to increased levels of intergroup conflict (warfare). </strong>There are theoretical reasons to think that nomadic hunter-gatherers will engage in warfare less than farmers. For instance, nomadic hunter-gatherers do not store food, and do not have fixed settlements, which makes fleeing relatively easy. Both the ethnographic and archeological evidence bears this out. Ethnographically observed nomadic hunter-gatherers typically exhibit relatively low rates of warfare relative to other societies. The earliest clear archeological evidence of warfare comes from Jebel Sahaba around 14,000 BP, right at the end of the Paleolithic period, when populations were becoming more sedentary. However, the fossil record prior to 14,000 BP is very sparse, so it is hard to be very confident that warfare was indeed rare throughout the Paleolithic.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The most common proximate motivations for violent conflict were probably disputes over women and desire for revenge.</strong> These emerge consistently and cross-culturally as the most common motivations for both interpersonal and intergroup conflict in the ethnographic evidence. However it is likely that contextual factors such as resource stress and cultural differences were also important.&nbsp; Establishing the ultimate causes of violent conflict is complex because of the multilevel/multifactorial nature of motivations for violence.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The evidence suggests that the 20th and 21st Centuries had lower rates of lethal violence than pre-agricultural times. </strong>Despite its wars and genocides, the 20th Century has lower rates of lethal violence than ethnographically-observed and archeologically-observed hunter-gatherers: lethal violent mortality rates among the median hunter-gatherers in our sample are about 1.7x higher than the 20th Century, while the archeological data suggests that the difference is around 1.4x. Moreover, the pre-agricultural period had rates of lethal violence that were upwards of 13-fold higher than 2000-2019. It is reasonable to interpret this evidence as supporting one of Pinker\u2019s central theses in <i>Better Angels</i>. However, we think that there are two caveats to this, though Steven Pinker believes these points to be speculative.&nbsp;<ol><li>Regarding the comparison with the 20th Century, one<strong> </strong>potentially confounding factor to consider is that people in the 20th Century had access to better medical care than hunter-gatherers. Once we adjust for better medical care, we think it is not obvious whether hunter-gatherer societies actually were more violent than the 20th Century (even though they had higher rates of <i>lethal</i> violence).</li><li>The 21st Century so far is only a small snapshot of time, and future catastrophes such as wars and genocides may drag up the rate of violence, as happened in the 20th Century. Indeed, future wars would be even more deadly than World Wars I and II due to nuclear weapons and other novel destructive weapons. <a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/x5sq5djrgbwu/1cT1AsYCIomlUhOque0JgW/74ffb0b1a4803e1f9654e86e2c7f3af1/Great_Power_Conflict_report_-_Founders_Pledge.pdf#page=68\">Leading estimates</a> put the risk of a war between the Great Powers in the next 30 years at around 1 in 10. So, it is hard to say whether the 21st Century as a whole will be less violent than the hunter-gatherer period.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><p>The relative strengths and weaknesses of ethnographic and archeological evidence are shown below:</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce86ec73-a57b-4be4-a0e1-27a4a52810ff_790x1046.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce86ec73-a57b-4be4-a0e1-27a4a52810ff_790x1046.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce86ec73-a57b-4be4-a0e1-27a4a52810ff_790x1046.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce86ec73-a57b-4be4-a0e1-27a4a52810ff_790x1046.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce86ec73-a57b-4be4-a0e1-27a4a52810ff_790x1046.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fce86ec73-a57b-4be4-a0e1-27a4a52810ff_790x1046.png 1456w\"></a></p><h1>Human history and human climate</h1><p>Before we proceed, it is useful to provide more background on the different geological epochs and their climates.

The Open Philanthropy Project can invest a lot of time into researching grants if the grant size is upward of $1 million or possibly $100,000 so that they make many grants in that area, measured by the total of those grants. But below $1 million the total grant size starts to trail off, and below $50,000 the number of grants drops off too. If they don\u2019t already know the field and the founders, it becomes more and more difficult for them to research the projects efficiently enough that it's still worth it for them given the small grant sizes.</p><p>That mirrors how venture capital firms would probably also love to invest the first $100,000 into all the future unicorns, but since they can\u2019t identify them at that stage, or only vanishingly few of them, they depend on business angels and the founders\u2019 friends and family to take the first step.</p><p>But we\u2019re now in a world where AI safety projects <a href=\"https://app.impactmarkets.io/project/clkwzfbh600003o6kuupq9ny7\"><u>struggle to raise $2,000</u></a> to make ends meet. So that gap below $1 million, particularly below $100,000, is critical. We need to coordinate the nonprofit equivalents of business angels so they can fill the gap!</p><h1>Donors to the Rescue</h1><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a08e1d6-af69-4dc7-91f1-62c7ad285a38_1722x999.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a08e1d6-af69-4dc7-91f1-62c7ad285a38_1722x999.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a08e1d6-af69-4dc7-91f1-62c7ad285a38_1722x999.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a08e1d6-af69-4dc7-91f1-62c7ad285a38_1722x999.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a08e1d6-af69-4dc7-91f1-62c7ad285a38_1722x999.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a08e1d6-af69-4dc7-91f1-62c7ad285a38_1722x999.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>How do we help donors coordinate? The good thing about individual donors is that they are almost everywhere in the world.

There are some relatively well-connected funders but there are also lots of individual donors and lots of individual charity entrepreneurs. They\u2019re largely disconnected or form small disconnected islands. We would like to rather move to the network on the right where all of these clusters are somewhat connected. It\u2019s not perfect but everyone has connections to all the other funders via relatively few intermediaries. It\u2019s much easier for projects to get funded and for donors to actually identify the most impactful projects on the margin.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34df95bf-a3a5-4b48-a5fd-c4a5a7953487_1758x979.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34df95bf-a3a5-4b48-a5fd-c4a5a7953487_1758x979.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34df95bf-a3a5-4b48-a5fd-c4a5a7953487_1758x979.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34df95bf-a3a5-4b48-a5fd-c4a5a7953487_1758x979.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34df95bf-a3a5-4b48-a5fd-c4a5a7953487_1758x979.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34df95bf-a3a5-4b48-a5fd-c4a5a7953487_1758x979.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>Donors need to be coordinated because they come in various different shapes and sizes. There are some who are in earning to give. They spend all of their time on their full-time jobs where they have little time left to research their donations. But of course, they earn a lot of money in these jobs. These donors are all the way over on the left, the blue side of the spectrum. They can only spend a few hours per year on donation research.</p><p>But there are some other donors who can spend easily like three orders of magnitude more time on research that is relevant to their donations because they don\u2019t even have to individually research their donations. They are working in fields where they are all the time, in their full-time jobs, exposed to exactly the sort of knowledge that is valuable for allocating donations.</p><p>There are also donors in between who \u2013 even though they work full-time in jobs that have nothing to do with donation research \u2013 are friends with researchers or live in the same flat with researchers. So these donors also osmotically absorb some of the knowledge that\u2019s valuable for making donations, be it just the knowledge that the particular researchers that they know can be trusted.</p><p>We would like to bridge the gap between these 1000x donors and the 1x donors. We want to make it possible for the blue donors who spend all their time earning to draw on all the knowledge of the donors all the way over on the red side of the spectrum.</p><h1>Our Solution</h1><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2672508a-43c8-4b5e-84f9-d7bf7927bea2_431x503.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2672508a-43c8-4b5e-84f9-d7bf7927bea2_431x503.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2672508a-43c8-4b5e-84f9-d7bf7927bea2_431x503.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2672508a-43c8-4b5e-84f9-d7bf7927bea2_431x503.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2672508a-43c8-4b5e-84f9-d7bf7927bea2_431x503.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2672508a-43c8-4b5e-84f9-d7bf7927bea2_431x503.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>Our system works the way that we score donors after the fact in terms of how early they were able to identify some successful project, how confidently they identified it (via the donation size), and the level of success of the project. This is a retrospective scoring, so a project has generated some impact and then we look back at who has supported the project early on and exactly how early they supported the project, and then score these donors in terms of these three factors.</p><p>That will cause smart donors to stand out in our ranking. So the smartest donors will be at the top of the ranking. At the moment it\u2019s still pretty easy to break into those top spots, so I encourage you to try!</p><p>The top donors then continue to make their donations. Thanks to their track record we know to listen to them.

These projects enter the fundraising phase and find three donors each.</p><p>Alex was first, donated on day one to the project Antiviral Algae; then Avery donated on day two; and then Ash donated on day three. Our algorithm scores Alex highly in this project because Alex donated very early, but it also scores Ash highly because Ash donated a lot.</p><p>Likewise, for the second project, Ryan and River score highly because they, respectively, donated early or a lot. In between is Rowan.</p><p>And then the projects get executed. They invest the donations that they\u2019ve received into their respective programs.</p><p>Then the evaluation happens.

We have 46 projects on our platform, and we're looking for more project scouts who want to make the first donations to these projects or potentially bring more projects onto the platform that they have already donated to so that they can register their donations to these projects. (That just depends on whether the scouts think that the most impactful project is one that is on the platform already or one that they still have to convince to join the platform.)</p><p>Eventually, once a sufficient number of these projects have been successful and have produced something that can be evaluated (we call these things <i>artifacts</i>), said evaluation will happen and we'll pay some evaluators to score the projects. That\u2019s phase 1.</p><p>Once we have some 100+ monthly active users we want to introduce something that we call <i>impact credits</i> or <i>impact marks</i>. It\u2019s a play-money currency that we want to use on our platform. We'll have various uses for it but primarily, it can be used by the people with the highest donor scores on the platform to themselves act as evaluators to some extent.</p><p>There's also a phase 3 that is in the distant future at this point. Hopefully, one day, we'll figure out all the legal problems of trying to institute a new kind of commodity. Then, hopefully, we\u2019ll be able to institute these impact credits in a way that will make it possible to trade them on a market against US dollars or against some other kind of currency.</p><p>Phase 3 is particularly interesting because at the moment the \u201cinvestors\u201d on the platform are donors who try to use all of their specialized knowledge to make great donations. But eventually, we want to also bring for-profit investors onto the platform, investors who will bring all of their knowledge about (say) angel investing and all the experience from the startup sector into the nonprofit sector. They would try to earn impact credits to then sell them on the market.</p><p>We\u2019re modeling this market ecosystem after that of carbon credits.

Longer timelines imply more time for others to internalize the importance and imminence of advanced AI and focus more on making it go well (as we\u2019re starting to see with e.g. the UK government).&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Much of the field working on TAI x-safety is young and relatively inexperienced, which magnifies the neglectedness (of quality-adjusted resources) of the short timelines scenarios.</li><li>More straightforwardly, the amount of time available to do useful work is higher in longer timeline scenarios, which amplifies the benefits of other resources like research, funding, policy focus, the career capital of young people, etc.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3><strong>You can\u2019t contribute to past timelines in the future</strong></h3><ul><li>It is generally much more costly to make plans assuming a certain deadline (or timelines distribution) and realize later that the deadline is earlier than previously thought than to make the opposite mistake. In the latter case, we (and the world more broadly) have more time to correct for our mistaken beliefs and predictions.<ul><li>&nbsp;As a student, it is much costlier to mistakenly think the deadline for a project is earlier than the real deadline, than missing the deadline due to mistakenly thinking it was later (all else equal, messy opportunity cost considerations aside).</li><li>Interesting fact: Since March 2023, the metaculus median AGI timeline has gotten one year shorter per month (and around&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Ability to update on evidence over time:&nbsp;<ul><li>Evidence over time will update our timeline estimates for TAI: Government and frontier lab actions, the capabilities of future models, potential bottlenecks (or lack thereof) from data, hardware production and R&amp;D, algorithmic progress, and more.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Counter-consideration</strong>: Important work sometimes requires lots of time to plan and execute, so there are instances where over-prioritizing resources on short-timeline scenarios leads to regret (for not starting long-calendar-time-requiring long-timelines focused work early enough).</li></ul><h3><strong>Allocating resources proportional to each potential timeline scenario entails always disproportionately focusing on shorter timelines scenarios</strong></h3><ul><li>As a toy example, say a central TAI safety planner had to commit to their best guess distribution for TAI timelines now, and allocate future resources accordingly. Say their distribution was two discrete spikes with equal probability (50%) on TAI 10 and 20 years from now (2033 and 2043), and they were determining how to allocate work hours of a fixed set of 500 people (focused on TAI safety) for different timeline scenarios over time. Assume this set of 500 people are the only ones who will work on TAI. From 2033 to 2043, conditioned on 2033 timelines not being realized, all 500 people\u2019s effort would go to 2043 planning. Therefore, to end up with proportional work-hour resource allocation across timeline scenarios, the planner would have to allocate 100% of the group\u2019s time for the next ten years on 10 year timelines to achieve parity - not put 50% of resources addressing 2033 timelines scenarios and 50% into 2043 scenarios despite that being the planner\u2019s current probability.&nbsp;</li><li>This toy example simplifies many important dynamics, but removing the simplifications do not all point in favor of less extreme prioritization. Examples:<ul><li>It is much more likely than not that the amount of resources going towards TAI x-safety will increase over time, rather than stay constant or decrease.&nbsp;</li><li>In my toy example setup, if 50% of your probability mass is on an interval shorter than the remaining interval, it is impossible to allocate person hours proportional to the risk level. On the flip side, if the second interval were shorter, non-zero resources would go towards the longer-timeline during the first interval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Money is more flexible than person hours (I can spend all my money now and not have any later, unlike my work hours barring burnout/worse).</li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>Higher predictability and likelihood of useful work</strong></h2><ul><li>It is easier to predict important details of scenarios conditioned on shorter timelines. For example:<ul><li>Which entities are able to gather the funding, hardware, data, ML/engineering expertise, and other resources required to build TAI.&nbsp;<ul><li>Relatedly, how many (meaningfully distinct) actors have access to cutting-edge TAI?</li></ul></li><li>Who is in influential roles in relevant institutions (I have much less uncertainty over who the president of the US is in the year 2024 than 2050).&nbsp;</li><li>How different TAI is from the most advanced AI systems of today - in terms of how it is trained, how it gets deployed, what effect precursors to TAI have had on society in the lead-up, and more.&nbsp;<ul><li>How much data, hardware, and power are needed to train TAI?</li><li>What will the training procedure for TAI look like?</li><li>How much algorithmic progress happens between now and TAI</li><li>How continuous has AI progress been, and over what timescale?</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Predictability makes it much easier to do work that ends up being useful. Many people working in AI safety think that most early work on AI alignment is very unlikely to be useful, largely because people were pretty uncertain about what properties advanced AI systems would have.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><strong>(Uncertain) Work useful for shorter-timelines is more likely useful for longer timelines than vice versa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><ul><li>Most work and skill sets that seem useful for short timelines are also useful for long timelines, but not vice versa. Insofar as this asymmetry exists, this might be a compelling reason to prioritize work that looks good under short timeline scenarios.&nbsp;</li><li>Examples of short-timelines focused work that is also useful for longer timelines:<ul><li>Lots of technical AI safety research (e.g. scalable oversight, interpretability, etc)</li><li>(US) Domestic AI regulation</li><li>Frontier AI lab governance</li></ul></li><li>Examples of work/career plans potentially impactful in longer-timelines that look substantially worse in short timelines:<ul><li>Undergraduate and high-school outreach/education (which is what prompted me to write this post in the first place)</li><li>Resource-intensive international AI regulation regime establishment</li><li>Ladder-climbing careers (with little room for impact before landing senior roles): E.g. running for elected office (starting at the local level and building up)</li><li>Getting citizenship in a country more relevant for TAI x-safety (which usually takes many years)</li></ul></li><li>Counterexample: Work assuming TAI using the current deep-learning paradigm might be rendered moot due to insights that allow for more powerful performance using a significantly different set-up.&nbsp;</li></ul><h1><u>Considerations favoring focusing on longer-timelines</u></h1><h2><strong>Many people concerned about TAI x-safety are young and inexperienced</strong>&nbsp;</h2><ul><li>Younger and more inexperienced people have more impactful career paths available to them over longer-timelines, since relevant experience, expertise, and age are required for many impactful roles (e.g. senior roles in policy/government and labs, professors, etc). Longer timelines means more time to build career capital, relevant skills, networks, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>Counter-consideration: While the above applies to many people currently interested in TAI existential safety,&nbsp;<strong>the consideration points in the opposite direction for older and more experienced people</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><strong>Intractability of changing shorter timelines scenarios&nbsp;</strong></h2><ul><li>There is not much that people who are not exceptionally well-positioned (e.g. people in senior positions in labs, governments, and their advisors) can do under extremely short-timeline scenarios (e.g. if in a year\u2019s time a frontier lab has TAI and expects untrusted competitors to release dangerous models within weeks/months).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Many valuable projects take lots of time, and many projects\u2019 impact increases with time</strong><ul><li>Insofar as there are lots of important things that should exist/happen in the world but don\u2019t/haven\u2019t yet, many of these will take a lot of time to develop (e.g. robust international coordination or AI training run surveillance/auditing infrastructure).&nbsp;<ul><li>Example: Some compute governance plans will require lots of time to implement, and are more useful in scenarios where TAI requires large quantities of compute, which means longer timelines.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Compound returns have more time to take effect in longer timeline scenarios&nbsp; - e.g. from investing, education/outreach/movement building work, evergreen content generation, etc.</li></ul></li></ul><h1><u>Neutral, person-specific, and unclear considerations</u></h1><h2><strong>Probability distribution over TAI Timelines</strong></h2><ul><li>If I were 90% confident that TAI would arrive before 2030, or after 2050, this would significantly inform what kinds of work and timeline scenarios to prioritize.</li></ul><h2><strong>Variance and Influenceability (usefulness of working on) of different timelines scenarios</strong></h2><ul><li>Importantly, the expected value of the future (by your lights) conditioned on a certain timelines prediction (including, most saliently, the likelihood of an existential catastrophe like AI takeover conditioned on TAI timelines), should not influence your decision-making outside of how it affects the scenario\u2019s influenceability.&nbsp;<ul><li>Example: How good or bad you expect the future to be conditioned on 2025 TAI timelines is not decision-relevant if you are confident that there is nothing you can do to change the trajectory (in an ethically relevant way).&nbsp;</li><li>There likely should be a correlation between estimates of the probability of an existential catastrophe in different scenarios, and their influenceability, where intuitively probabilities closer to 50% are easier to move than ones near 0 and 100%.</li></ul></li><li>Which timelines have higher variance in their outcomes?&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>More time allows for more random/a-priori-hard-to-predict, and morally-relevant events to occur, which would suggest the potential trajectories of longer timeline scenarios are higher variance. This means more can be done to influence them.&nbsp;</li><li>On the other hand, powerful incentives and dynamics (e.g. entropy, evolution, prisoners\u2019 dilemmas, tragedies of the commons) have more time to take effect and more reliably produce certain outcomes on longer timescales.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>The benefit of impartial altruism under different timeline scenarios<ul><li>Maybe the highest-leverage interventions in longer-timeline scenarios are better-suited for impartial altruistically motivated actors, as they are less likely to be addressed by others by default. For example, in longer timeline scenarios, intent-aligned TAI might be more probable, meaning there is more value in steering the future with cosmopolitan impartial values. In shorter timelines, most of the leverage may come from preventing an existential catastrophe, a concern not unique to altruistic-impact-motivated individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>Personal considerations</strong></h2><ul><li>The below list includes many considerations that affect the value of focusing on different timeline scenarios.&nbsp;<ul><li><strong>Age </strong>(as discussed above)</li><li><strong>Citizenship/Work authorization</strong> - Having citizenship/work authorization in countries that are likely to be most relevant to transformative AI development might push in favor of focusing on shorter timelines, and vice versa.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Network</strong> - Having people in your network who are well-suited to contribute to shorter/longer timelines scenarios might be a reason to focus on one over the other (e.g. having many connections in the US government or frontier AI labs makes quick impact easier, vs. knowing many talented high school/university students makes longer-term impact easier)</li><li><strong>Background, skills, strengths + weaknesses</strong> - Your skillset might be especially well-suited to some timelines (e.g. experience in high school//undergraduate-student movement building is likely more valuable in longer-timeline scenarios)</li><li><strong>Kinds of work and specific jobs you could enjoy and excel at</strong></li><li><strong>Financial, geographic, and other constraints</strong></li><li><strong>Values and ethics</strong> - especially as they relate to evaluating the influenceability of different scenarios, and at a meta-level how much you want to prioritize impact over other factors when deciding career plans.&nbsp;</li><li>Many others<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>Takeoff speeds/Continuity of AI progress</strong></h2><ul><li>Discontinuous progress/fast&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/ai-takeoff\"><u>take-offs</u></a> scenarios are correlated with shorter timelines (especially insofar as the period of time where AI has started significantly improving and influencing the world has already started). Fast take-off scenarios might mean increased leverage for people already concerned about TAI due to more predictability pre-discontinuity (if e.g. it\u2019s hard to predict how a slow-takeoff, slowly-increasingly-AI-influenced world looks over time and how this influences the long-term future). However, they might be less tractable overall since discontinuities are hard to anticipate and prepare for.<ul><li>For example, many plans involve leveraging AI warning shots, which are less likely and less frequent in faster take-off scenarios with more discontinuous AI progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>The last-window-of-influence is likely in advance of TAI arrival</strong></h2><ul><li>There are often differences between when an event occurs, and when an event can be last influenced.<br><br>For example, consider the event of the next US presidential inauguration, scheduled for January 20, 2025. If it were impossible to engage in election fraud, the last day to influence which party would be in charge starting Jan 20th, 2025 would be election day (November 5, 2024).&nbsp;</li><li>In the context of transformative AI, I recommend reading&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JPan54R525D68NoEt/the-date-of-ai-takeover-is-not-the-day-the-ai-takes-over\"><u>Daniel Kokotajlo\u2019s post on the point-of-no-return for TAI</u></a>. One dynamic from the post I want to highlight in particular - \u201cinfluence over the future might not disappear all on one day; maybe there\u2019ll be a gradual loss of control over several years. For that matter, maybe this gradual loss of control began years ago and continues now... We should keep these possibilities in mind as well.\u201d<br><br>Path-dependence, race dynamics, AI-enabled lock-ins and other factors might mean the amount of time left to influence trajectories is much less than the time left until TAI is deployed, which amplifies all the above considerations .&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Counter-consideration</strong>: Many impact-relevant interventions might be after the arrival of TAI - e.g. determining how transformative AI should be deployed and how resources should be allocated in a post-TAI world.&nbsp;</li></ul><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Overall, the considerations pointing in favor of prioritizing short-timelines seem moderately stronger to me than those in favor of prioritizing long-timelines impact, though others who read drafts of this post disagreed. In particular, the neglectedness considerations seem stronger to me than the pro-longer-timeline considerations. The main exception that comes to mind is the personal fit consideration for very young/inexperienced individuals - though I would still guess that there is lots of useful work to do in shorter timeline worlds for (e.g. operations, communications, work in low-barrier-of-entry fields). I might expand on kinds of work that seem especially useful under short vs. long timelines, but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Fbk9H6ipfybHyqjrp/a-playbook-for-ai-risk-reduction-focused-on-misaligned-ai\"><u>other</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/making-the-best-of-the-most-important-century/\"><u>writing</u></a> on what kinds of work are useful exist already - I\u2019d recommend going through them and thinking about what work might be a good fit for you, and seems most useful under different timelines.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>There is a good chance I am missing many important considerations, and reasoning incorrectly about the ones mentioned in this post.

By sharing our experiences, we aim to provide valuable insights for future organizers of similar initiatives.</p><h1><br>Quick Facts</h1><ul><li><strong>102 participants</strong> from 25 countries, comprising 11 fellows and 91 visitors. 36% of the fellows identified themselves as female or non-binary. 32% of the fellows were from LATAM.</li><li><strong>Generated 714 new connections</strong> at an average cost of&nbsp;<strong>371 USD per connection</strong>.</li><li><strong>Weekly cost</strong> for hosting a participant was approximately&nbsp;<strong>602 USD</strong></li><li>42.5% of participants&nbsp;<strong>rated the fellowship 10/10</strong>.</li><li>30% of respondents&nbsp;<strong>valued the fellowship at over $10,000</strong>.</li><li>40% of participants would&nbsp;<strong>consider relocating to Mexico City</strong> for an established EA hub.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>The Importance of the EA Latin American Community</h1><p><br>Latin America has a growing interest in effective altruism, but the region lacks established EA hubs compared to North America or Europe. The fellowship is pivotal in developing a stronger EA presence in Latin America. It allows local EA enthusiasts to connect with the international EA community, fostering knowledge exchange and collaboration.</p><p><br>Additionally, hosting a fellowship inspires local individuals to engage more deeply in the EA community. By witnessing the commitment and dedication of international participants, local individuals are motivated to pursue impactful careers and projects, contributing to the growth of EA in the region.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Advantages in Comparison to Countries with Visa Restrictions</h1><p><br>Compared to established EA hubs in countries with high living costs, Mexico provides a cost-effective alternative. Participants can enjoy the benefits of living and working in a vibrant city without the financial burden often associated with hubs in Europe or North America. This cost-effectiveness ensures that valuable resources can be allocated more efficiently.</p><p>Moreover, Mexico offers relative ease of entry for participants from various countries, making it an accessible location for those facing visa restrictions in other regions. This inclusivity allows individuals who might otherwise struggle to participate in similar programs to join and contribute to the fellowship.</p><h1>Fellowship Program Details</h1><p>The program took place from November 1, 2022, to January 30, 2023, accommodating both long-term and short-term participants. The coliving space was located in a prime area of Mexico City, fostering both recreational and networking activities. Dedicated office spaces were provided, and meals were delivered daily.</p><p>Numerous activities were organized throughout the program, enhancing the overall experience and facilitating connections. The program also hosted EA organizations and events.</p><h2><br>What Went Well and Why?</h2><p>The survey data revealed diverse and extensive connections made by fellows. They engaged with members of the Latin American EA community, university groups, and professionals from various fields. Fellows appreciated the exposure to these diverse networks, which broadened their perspectives and opened doors for future collaborations.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xK9Gyx4msWXjKFYDy/g4yruv1irh1bwq6uaans\" alt=\"Forms response chart. Question title: How likely is it that you would recommend the EA Mexico Fellowship to a friend or colleague with similar interests to your own?\n. Number of responses: 41 responses.\"></p><p>The fellowship received positive feedback and was highly appreciated by the participants, as evidenced by the high Likelihood to Recommend (LTR) score of 8.48. Remarkably, 42.5% of respondents awarded the fellowship a perfect rating of 10/10, reflecting a high level of satisfaction. However, it is important to note that 12.5% of attendees rated the fellowship below 7/10, indicating areas that warrant further attention and improvement.</p><p>Furthermore, participants expressed the value they derived from various aspects of the fellowship. Notably, as we already mentioned, many emphasized the significance of the connections forged during the program, recognizing the immense potential for networking and collaboration within the EA community. Additionally, the strong sense of community cultivated throughout the fellowship was highly cherished, providing participants with a supportive and like-minded environment. These factors not only contributed to the participants' positive experiences but also underscored the opportunities for fruitful collaboration and collective impact within EA.</p><h2><br>Analysis of costs</h2><p>The fellowship cost a total of 5.673.026 MXN, which is equivalent to arround $332.596 USD. If we divide the total cost by the number of participants that would be 3.261 USD per participant. However, not all the fellows stayed during the entire duration of the program. If we exclude flight expenses (due to its variability), the weekly cost for hosting a participant was approximately 602 USD. On average, fellows stayed around four-weeks on the residency totaling a cost of 2.408 USD per stay.&nbsp;</p><p>Cost breakdown:</p><ul><li>Coliving Space: USD 118.100</li><li>Office Space: USD 41.900</li><li>Food: USD 88.000</li><li>Flights: USD 58.900*</li><li>Activities and other expenses: USD 25.696</li></ul><p>Considering that the most valuable aspect of the fellowship was the connections formed, it is estimated that each connection cost around&nbsp;465.88 USD. Comparing this to similar interventions in Latin America, like EAGxLatAm (which costs $225 USD per connection), the cost per connection for the EA Mexico Residency Fellowship may seem significantly higher. While some might perceive the cost per connection as slightly high for the region, it is worth noting that the majority of the connections formed through this fellowship were considered close connections, with the potential to build significant career capital. Also, it's important to note that interactions between participants lasted more days than typical activities related to conferences or ordinary networking sessions.</p><h2><br>Productivity and Satisfaction</h2><p>To assess the satisfaction of participants with the fellowship, feedback was collected on seven aspects: the Office Space, the Coliving Space, the Food, the Activities, the support from the organizing team, the selection of Mexico City as the host location, and the selection of fellows and visitors.</p><p>The overall satisfaction rating, considering all seven aspects, averaged 76%, indicating that there is still room for improvement to enhance the participants' experience. Some areas can be further improved to enhance participant satisfaction. These include addressing concerns related to the Coliving Space, refining the quality and variety of food offerings, diversifying and expanding the range of activities, and proactively engaging with participants to meet their needs and expectations. The positive response to the selection of Mexico City and the fellows and visitors selection highlights the successful aspects of the program that can be built upon for future iterations.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xK9Gyx4msWXjKFYDy/f2n74zvomh3kirspdkq5\" alt=\"Gr\u00e1fico de respuestas de formularios. T\u00edtulo de la pregunta:&nbsp;How satisfied were you with the following aspects of the fellowship?. N\u00famero de respuestas:&nbsp;.\"></p><p><br><strong>Office Space:</strong> The Office Space received a satisfaction rating of 77.5%. Participants appreciated the dedicated workspace provided, which included traditional offices, private meeting rooms, phone booths, and shared amenities. Some feedback suggested a desire for a more warming, collaborative, and creative environment.</p><p><strong>Coliving Space</strong>: The Coliving Space received a satisfaction rating of 65%. While participants valued the convenience and camaraderie of living together, some expressed concerns about internet intermittency, the security system of the building, and the high levels of noise at night. Suggestions were made to improve their experience and the quality of the accommodation.</p><p><strong>Food:&nbsp;</strong>The satisfaction rating for Food was 57.5%. While the provision of breakfast and lunch by the fellowship program was appreciated, some participants felt that the variety and quality of the meals could be improved. There were suggestions for dietary options and catering to different preferences. It's worth noting that in Mexico, and possibly in other middle and low-income countries, some vegan protein bars and beverages may not be readily available or can be extremely expensive. This limitation can impact the ability to provide a wide variety of dietary options. Organizers should consider these challenges and explore cost-effective alternatives to accommodate diverse dietary preferences and restrictions.</p><p><strong>Activities</strong>: The Activities aspect had a satisfaction rating of 70%. Participants enjoyed the activities organized throughout the program, but some feedback indicated a desire for a higher number of professional-themed activities and social reunions.</p><p><strong>Support from the Organizing Team:</strong> The support from the organizing team garnered an overall satisfaction rating of 80%. Participants commended the team's responsiveness and assistance in addressing concerns. However, some participants desired more proactive communication and individualized support.</p><p><strong>Selection of Mexico City:</strong> The aspect with the highest satisfaction rate (95%) was the selection of Mexico City as the host location. Fellows expressed appreciation for various aspects of the city, including its climate, tourist attractions, culinary offerings, and cultural richness. Some participants, particularly those unaccustomed to living in large cities, highlighted concerns related to pollution and the high levels of population and noise.</p><p><strong>Selection of Fellows and Visitors:</strong> The satisfaction rating for the selection of fellows and visitors was 87.5%. Participants were satisfied with the diverse and talented group of individuals chosen for the fellowship program, which facilitated valuable networking and collaboration opportunities.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Areas for Improvement</h1><ol><li><strong>Defining and Communicating Goals Clearly:</strong> Clarity in defining program goals and communicating them to participants is crucial for a successful fellowship.</li><li><strong>Setting Realistic Expectations.</strong> Organizers should manage participants' expectations by communicating the program's limitations clearly.</li><li><strong>Generating More Connections and Social Activities:&nbsp;</strong>Intentional planning of social interactions and networking events could enhance participant connections.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Inviting More Local Participants:</strong> Increasing local participation fosters stronger community ties and reduces travel grant expenses.</li><li><strong>Amplifying Local Impact Through Events and Talks</strong>: The fellowship aimed to enhance its impact in the city by organizing events, talks, and other initiatives. However, on this occasion, all these activities had to be canceled due to issues stemming from the FTX bankruptcy. This setback not only affected the social activities but also hindered the inclusion of more local participants. It underscores the importance of adaptability and contingency planning in this kind of programs.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Improving Coliving Selection</strong>: Careful consideration of coliving spaces is essential. In the context of Mexico, it proved challenging to find a location with the right facilities while maintaining a reasonable price. Unfortunately, the level of noise at the selected venue turned out to be higher than initially anticipated, impacting participants' experience. This underscores the need for more meticulous location selection in future editions of the residency program.</li></ol><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>The EA Mexico Residency Fellowship successfully united individuals committed to effective altruism, creating a vibrant community and facilitating valuable connections. While the program garnered positive feedback, there are opportunities for future organizers to refine the logistics, activities, and participant experience. The conclusion emphasizes optimizing productivity and cost-effectiveness while maintaining a supportive and collaborative community for future residency programs.</p><p>It's important to note that the program faced unexpected challenges out of the control of the project. These challenges underscore the need for adaptability and contingency planning in future editions of the program, ensuring that both international and local participants can fully benefit from this unique fellowship experience. The program's potential to amplify its impact on the city through events and talks remains a promising avenue for future growth and engagement within the effective altruism community.</p><h1>Acknowledgments</h1><p>We'd like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to some remarkable individuals who have demonstrated exceptional self-initiative, played a pivotal role in organizing various activities, and were undeniably instrumental in the resounding success of this program:</p><ul><li>Nguyen Tran</li><li>Phil Chu</li><li>Joaquin Win Lin</li><li>Eduardo Infante</li><li>Pablo Staforini</li><li>Michelle Bruno</li><li>Claudette Salinas</li><li>Carmen Csilla</li></ul>", "user": {"username": "Sandra Malagon"}}, {"_id": "wGKGrCYNwjhhK4N69", "title": "Why I'm still going out to bat for the EA movement post FTX ", "postedAt": "2023-09-30T15:02:43.052Z", "htmlBody": "<p>From the looks of it, next week might be rough for people who care about Effective Altruism.

As someone who does outward facing voluntary community building at my workplace and in London, I feel nervous. I\u2019ve written this piece to manage that anxiety. I actually wrote a lot of it last year to process my feelings but now seems like a good time to share.</p><h3><strong>Thoughts on EA after 2022</strong></h3><p>During the spring/summer of 2022, I was studying for my final ICAS Chartered Accountancy case study exams. They usually involve:</p><ul><li>Being given a scenario where you are the qualified accountant and have been asked to do some analysis for a group of companies.</li><li>As you need to meet a minimum standard of Public Trust and Ethics to join an accountancy body, there is usually a dodgy character or two involved at the client company or at the firm that employs you.</li><li>The dodgy characters are lax about controls and risk - asking you as the accountant to \u201clook the other way\u201d and the case is usually set up that there is an incentive for you as the accountant to do that.</li><li>There are often weak internal controls at the company which make fraud more likely. Some examples of weak internal controls:<ul><li>Lack of segregation of duties - one employee has end-to-end control of a process without oversight</li><li>Inadequate access controls - sensitive systems and data are not restricted to authorized personnel</li><li>Circumvention of controls - existing controls are intentionally avoided or bypassed by employees</li><li>Unsigned approvals - documents requiring sign-off are not properly authorized</li></ul></li><li>At the end, you submit your technical accounting, finance, tax, internal controls, and general business advice that was requested as part of the case study. You also need to submit an ethics memo which would outline your concerns about the dodgy people or controls.</li></ul><p>You\u2019ll be glad to hear that after going through lots of practice papers, I passed!</p><p>Then three months later, the news on FTX dropped.</p><p>I\u2019m not going to outline it here since I imagine the audience for this are already familiar<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj0in0cuzw7c\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj0in0cuzw7c\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;- if someone has a good summary, please drop it in the comments. It wasn\u2019t just FTX, around that time, information was released on Wytham Abbey, Bostrom and the Time sexual harassment scandals.</p><p>For context, I\u2019m mostly interested in expanding the reach of effective giving / EA impact methodologies and personally put a high discount rate on the future vs existing suffering, so, I didn\u2019t follow the FTX Future Fund that closely.</p><p>My primary feelings at the end of 2022 were anger and embarrassment.</p><ul><li>Anger<ul><li>I\u2019m annoyed I must answer questions about <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey?commentId%3Du3yJfbm2pes8TFpYX\"><u>the damned castle</u></a>. I did not buy the castle. None of the charities I recommend you donate to bought the castle. Yet in my community building work, I have to answer questions about the castle. It was handled poorly and I\u2019m angry about it.</li><li>When the Time article came out, I was running the London Women (and NBs) in EA group. Honestly, I incorrectly assumed it was just about EA in the Bay area so when <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/QMee23Evryqzthcvn/a-statement-and-an-apology#What_can_you_expect_from_me_going_forward_\"><u>it was revealed it was Owen Cotton-Barrett</u></a>, that was a shock and tbh I was annoyed at a lot of the responses.</li><li>In hindsight, I wish I\u2019d created a space for people to talk about it but a 60+ person whatsapp chat didn\u2019t seem like the right format. I agree with <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pWFEjawiGXYmwyY3K/things-that-can-make-ea-a-good-place-for-women\"><u>this post on things that make EA a good space for women</u></a> and recommend this piece on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpyJMXZTqLDiKaXzu/if-you-d-like-to-do-something-about-sexual-misconduct-and\"><u>what to do about sexual misconduct going forward</u></a>.</li></ul></li><li>Embarrassment</li><li>I had distrustful instincts towards crypto even before the crash.

I feel annoyed at myself that I didn\u2019t voice this and just sat in the cognitive dissonance.</li><li>I\u2019m embarassed that I put so much trust into Will MacAskill and 80k to vet SBF if they were going to endorse them to the extent that they did.</li><li>I\u2019m embarrassed that I\u2019m associated with people in the movement who make <a href=\"https://x.com/glpat99/status/1663527876040220674?s=20\"><u>sexist</u></a> and racist comments. Most EAs aren\u2019t like that but that\u2019s difficult to prove. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/11/01/why-we-often-remember-bad-better-than-good/\"><u>Negative interactions are more memorable</u></a>.</li><li>I am frustrated because I see many enthusiastic, extraverted, emotionally intelligent people, especially women and those from lower class or cultural backgrounds, not connecting with the EA movement. I speak to people that would be interested in spending more of their time interacting with EA or want to know how to have a positive impact but have been put off since they think the movement doesn\u2019t want them or the vibe is unfriendly and elitist.</li></ul><p><strong>Updates I\u2019ve made</strong></p><ul><li>I defer a lot less when making career decisions and thinking about cause prioritisation.

Looking forward to hosting our first event as the GWWC London group co-lead \ud83d\udcaa</li></ul><p>I want to be clear that I still feel a lot of anger and embarrassment, but I\u2019ve weighed that up against the positive potential of EA so \u2026</p><h3><strong>Why I\u2019m still publicly going out to bat for EA</strong></h3><p>I know a few people (all women) who have taken a step back from meta-EA this year. That is fair and I\u2019m excited to see what they achieve in doing important direct work. However, I\u2019m not doing that.</p><p>I\u2019m still pushing EA at my workplace and, despite a wobble after FTX where we considered naming it EY Altruism Conversations, we\u2019ve settled on using EA in the title because most people have never heard of EA yet. I\u2019ve recently added the link to our EA@EY newsletter and my GWWC pledge in my email signature.&nbsp;</p><p>Why?</p><p><strong>I think EA is better than anything else that currently exists</strong></p><ul><li>Most people I\u2019ve met in EA have been kind, thoughtful, conscientious, generous, intelligent and deeply passionate about improving the world. I want there to be a place where it is easy to connect with these kinds of people because strong relationships will make do-gooders more resilient.</li><li>I agree with this post that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MP9qDZCXMaTJhiJ9u/ea-is-three-radical-ideas-i-want-to-protect\"><u>EA is three radical ideas I want to protect</u></a> (radical empathy, scope sensitivity and scout mindset) but in my opinion the most impressive part of EA is the execution. For me, as much as I find the intellectual side interesting, I went to<strong> business school </strong>so fit squarely into the \u201cdoing\u201d side of EA and these are the things that excited me about the movement:<ul><li>EA goes beyond just identifying problems and tend to act on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/theory-of-change\"><u>theories of change</u></a> based on clearly stated and testable assumptions</li><li>They tend to be quick to respond to actionable feedback and publicly share impact evaluations</li><li>It has been successful at creating a community not tied to a specific cause area and building connections between different causes helping to create resilience among do-gooders</li><li>EA is pretty good at up-skilling do-gooders, pointing them to resources that might <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/how-to-be-successful/\"><u>make them more resilient</u></a> and providing <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/call-action-cta.asp\"><u>calls to action</u></a><ul><li>80,000 Hours career guide did this for me and is easily the most important EA resource that got me to take action in 2021. I\u2019m glad they are reemphasising it because it is excellent</li><li>(CEA did used to have a big list of things to take action on but that seems to be gone now?)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.clearerthinking.org/tools\"><u>All Clearer Thinking Tools</u></a> are pretty great for this</li><li>I LOVE this <a href=\"https://course.non-trivial.org/\"><u>How to (actually) change the world | Non-trivial</u></a> course and think it should have a wider audience than just high school students (ie. it reminded me of a corporate training). I really hope it gets finished!</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>In particular, I think the above appeals to people who work for corporates since this is how work is done in the private sector where metrics and results are especially important. I am bullish on community building work specifically aimed at working professionals, <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corp-social-responsibility.asp\"><u>CSR departments</u></a> and the growing trend towards <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/esg-1\"><u>corporate ESG reporting</u></a>.&nbsp;<ul><li>Hit me up if you are interested in this too - been working with EACN and HIP on this.</li></ul></li><li>I don\u2019t think any of this is <i>necessarily</i> unique to the effective altruism movement. If a new, better, more positively impactful movement develops that looks like it\u2019ll be more successful at building a radically better world - I\u2019ll consider jumping ship.</li><li>But, honestly, from what I can see - nothing else comes close.</li></ul><p><strong>The future of EA will be defined by the people who step up and take action today.</strong></p><ul><li>EA at its best is a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DdSszj5NXk45MhQoq/decision-making-and-decentralisation-in-ea?commentId=HvHgAY2xuiNkdfkgE\"><u>do-ocracy</u></a> and individuals can have an outsized impact on the culture.

Common for them all is a genuine interest in the policy-making process.</p><h2>Test your fit in a week</h2><p>Commonly recommended paths are various fellowships and internships. They are a great way to test ones fit, but they are also a large commitment.</p><p>For the complete beginner, we can do much cheaper!</p><h3>Test 1: Read policy texts and write up your thoughts</h3><p>Most fields of policy will have a few legislative texts or government white papers that are central to all work currently being done on the topic.</p><p>A few examples of relevant texts for a few cause areas and contexts:</p><ul><li>EU AI Policy: <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52021PC0206\">AI Act</a></li><li>US Development cooperation: <a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/policy/policy-framework\">USAID's 2023 policy framework</a></li><li>EU Animal Welfare: <a href=\"https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/news/draft-impact-assessment-good-start-ambitious-legislation\">The European Commission's Staff Working Document on animal welfare</a></li><li>EU Biosecurity: <a href=\"https://health.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-11/hera_2003_wp_en.pdf\">DG HERA's 2023 work plan</a></li></ul><p>Let's go with the example of EU AI Policy. The AI Act is available online in every European language. While the full document is &gt;100 pages, the meat of the act is only about 20-30 pages or so (going off memory).</p><p>Read the document and try forming your own opinion of the act! What are its strengths and weaknesses? What would you change to improve it?</p><p><strong>For now, don't worry too much about the quality of the output.</strong> A well informed inside view takes more than a weekend to develop!</p><p>Instead reflect over which parts of the exercise you found yourself the most engaged. If you found the exercise generally enjoyable once you got started, that's a sign you might be a good fit for policy work!</p><p>Additionally, digging into the source material is necessary to forming original views and will make you stand out to future employers. The object level of policy is underrated!<br><br>My hope is that the exercise will leave you with a bunch of open questions you would like to further explore. How exactly did EU's delegated acts work again? What was the Parliament's response to the Commission's leaked working document?</p><p>If you keep pursuing the questions you're interested in, you'll soon find yourself nearing the frontier of knowledge for your area of policy interest. Once you find yourself with a question you can't find a good answer to, you might have stumbled good project to further explore your fit :)</p><h3>Test 2: Follow a committee hearing</h3><p>Parliaments typically have topic-based committees where members of the parliament debate current issues and legislation relevant to the committee. These debates are often publicly available on the parliament's website.</p><p>Try listening to a debate on the topic of your interest. What are the contentions? What arguments are used by each side? If you were to give the next speech, how would you argue for your own views?</p><p>If you find listening to the debate and crafting arguments engaging, that's a sign that you might be a good fit for especially the left side of the spectrum!</p><h3>Neither this map nor the tests are comprehensive!</h3><p>These exercises by no means make up a comprehensive test. The spectrum is meant to be a intuition-pump, nothing more!<br><br>The goal of this post is to help get you started and get chance to experience what some of the day-to-day work is like for different policy roles.</p><p>If you do either of these exercises, don't hesitate to ask for feedback from someone working in the field.

And on the operational side, maintaining flexibility in grantmaking at our scale requires significant creative logistical work. Both last year\u2019s reduction in capital available for GCR projects (in the near term) and the uptick in opportunities following the global boom of interest in AI risk make our grantmaking look relatively more important; compared to last year, we\u2019re now looking at more opportunities in a space with less total funding<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefaiywwvgsth\"><sup><a href=\"#fnaiywwvgsth\">[3]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>GCR roles we\u2019re now hiring for include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Program associates</strong> to make grants in technical AI governance mechanisms, US AI policy advocacy, general AI governance, technical AI safety, biosecurity &amp; pandemic preparedness, EA community building, AI safety field building, and EA university groups.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Researchers</strong> to identify and evaluate new areas for GCR grantmaking, conduct research on catastrophic risks beyond our current grantmaking areas, and oversee a range of research efforts in biosecurity.

We\u2019ve also made efforts to streamline work tests and use the same tests for multiple roles where possible; however, some roles do use different work tests, so it\u2019s possible you\u2019ll still have to take different work tests for different roles, especially if you\u2019re interested in roles across a wide array of skillsets (e.g., both research and operations). You may also have interviews with multiple hiring managers if multiple teams are still interested in considering you as a candidate later in the process, and you may receive an offer for one or multiple of the roles you expressed interest in.</li><li><strong>Many of these roles have specific location requirements.&nbsp;</strong>We offer relocation benefits to assist with the cost of moving, and we\u2019re able to sponsor visas for many (though not all) of these roles, so we encourage international candidates to apply for any role unless otherwise specified. We don\u2019t control who is and isn\u2019t eligible for visas and can\u2019t guarantee visa approval, but we have a dedicated Business Immigration team to advise and assist candidates with visa applications.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>If it\u2019s important to you to know your chances of being hired, or to know whether you\u2019ll receive an offer by a certain date, just ask.</strong>&nbsp;We\u2019ll be glad to communicate the number of people at your stage in the pipeline, and may be willing to expedite especially promising candidates who need a decision sooner. Inversely, if you need more turnaround time for work tests, please flag this also; we may be able to offer an extended timeline.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>We let candidates opt into being referred to other organizations if they are rejected later in our process.</strong>&nbsp;If you check this box on the application form, we may share some basic information (your email, resume, how far you made it in our process, and a high-level sentence or two about why we think you should be on their radar) with organizations looking for similar talent. We will&nbsp;not share work tests or work test scores, and will not respond to inquiries asking for more detailed evaluative feedback without first checking with candidates. The goal of this change is to make matchmaking for promising candidates more streamlined by asking for candidates\u2019 consent up front, rather than after rejection.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Candidates rejected at the final interview stage will receive individualized feedback.</strong>&nbsp;A desire for more feedback is the most frequent piece of feedback we get from applicants. Unfortunately, due to the volume of candidates and requests for feedback we receive, we can\u2019t guarantee this for candidates rejected earlier in the process, but we\u2019re working on potential alternatives (e.g., providing a summary of the kinds of mistakes most commonly made on work tests), so there\u2019s a chance we\u2019ll be able to share something along those lines.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>If you have a question or concern or are a recent applicant to Open Philanthropy and want to discuss your specific situation before applying again, please email&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:jobs@openphilanthropy.org\"><u>jobs@openphilanthropy.org</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnidj9zgdonk\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefidj9zgdonk\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Formerly known as the Effective Altruism Community Growth (Longtermism) team.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn2ty5kan58zm\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref2ty5kan58zm\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>For more color, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dua879FhtLf9jqyJo/there-should-be-more-ai-safety-orgs?commentId=dQL4yD7HzdfgqBKKs\"><u>this comment</u></a> by Ajeya Cotra, Program Officer for our technical AI safety grantmaking.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnaiywwvgsth\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefaiywwvgsth\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Grantmaking work can be looked at in financial terms, just like \u201cearning to give\u201d work.

This is the same impact as that funder having another $200k to give. We haven\u2019t done a quantitative analysis, but we think it\u2019s likely that GCR-focused grantmaking work at Open Phil has had higher financial return than most GCR-focused earning-to-give work, since our small teams dispense tens to hundreds of millions per year in grants.

We see the XPT as an iterative process and we have learned a lot from this first round. Some of these lessons are practical, down-to-earth insights into how to recruit and retain the talent of busy professionals in a demanding multi-month marathon. Other lessons are more substantive. XPT-1 yielded first-of-a-kind, in-depth assessments of how sophisticated specialists and generalists conduct debates about the greatest risks facing humanity and how they translate their beliefs about those risks into quantitative forecasts.</p><p>We are also acutely aware that XPT-1 leaves an array of key questions unanswered and we plan to use future iterations of the XPT to produce answers. In our upcoming XPT research, we have five topics we want to study in more depth:</p><ol><li>Explore the value of early warning indicators from XPT-1</li><li>Produce better early warning indicators</li><li>Develop better methods of facilitating productive adversarial collaborations between disagreeing schools of thought</li><li>Identify and validate better methods of eliciting low-probability forecasts</li><li>Make these forecasts more relevant to policymakers</li></ol><h3><i>Explore the value of early warning indicators from XPT-1</i></h3><p>In&nbsp;XPT-1, we asked numerous questions about how the risk landscape would evolve in the short term, including several \u201cearly warning\u201d AI-risk indicators such as: \u201cHow much will be spent on compute&nbsp;in the largest AI experiment by 2024?\u201d The XPT also made a major effort to identify crux questions that, once forecasters know the answer in 2024, will tell them more about longer-run futures in 2030 or even 2100.</p><p>In our future work, we want to ask participants to update their longer-run forecasts based on the outcome of the short-run questions. For example, if spending on AI R&amp;D turns out to be lower or higher by 2024 than a forecaster predicted it would be, will they choose to update their longer-run predictions of AI-related risk?</p><p>When we evaluate forecasters\u2019 accuracy on short-run questions in 2024, we expect the XPT to also provide new evidence on the relationship between reasoning quality and forecasting accuracy. We captured more than five million words of reasoning, deliberation, and synthesis across the XPT and can analyze&nbsp;that data to determine which types of arguments are related to forecast accuracy across all the areas the XPT covered. For example, we\u2019ll be able to compare the reasoning \u201cquality\u201d of optimists and pessimists: do people who expect things to go well or poorly tend to give more convincing arguments for their beliefs? This type of analysis could be particularly valuable since it can provide insights beyond forecasting. By studying the properties of arguments associated with forecasting accuracy, we expect to make novel contributions that can be applied to debate more generally.</p><h3><i>Produce better early warning indicators</i></h3><p>If we want to put as much emphasis on the quality of questions as on the accuracy of forecasts, we need to incentivize high-quality questions as rigorously as we do forecasting accuracy.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhhg66o0a3cm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhhg66o0a3cm\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;For many of the short-run questions in the XPT, experts and superforecasters <i>agreed, </i>while disagreeing strongly about the existential risks that those questions were supposed to predict. That tells us that at least some of the questions we asked did not succeed at finding short-run predictors of existential risks: if people who are very concerned and not concerned about an existential risk by 2100 expect the same results in 2030, then finding out what happens in 2030 will not give us additional information about who is right about 2100.</p><p>We have already begun to develop formal metrics for what constitutes a useful forecast question and we plan to build a database of strong candidate questions. For our future projects, we hope to create a longitudinal panel of forecasters and question-generators (often but not always the same people) that works together over the coming years to shed more light on the feasibility of early warning indicators for various topics.</p><h3><i>Develop better methods of facilitating productive adversarial collaborations between disagreeing schools of thought</i></h3><p>Before XPT-1, we thought that deliberation and argument would lead forecasters to update on one another\u2019s beliefs and arguments and eventually converge on similar probabilities. But on the questions where participants originally disagreed most, such as the likelihood of human extinction due to AI by 2100, this did not occur: participants disagreed nearly as much at the end of the tournament as they had at the beginning.</p><p>We want to understand why that happened and under what circumstances discussion and debate lead to consensus rather than stalemate. To ensure that XPT forecasters\u2019 failure to converge was not due to fluky method-specific factors, we are developing more tightly choreographed forms of \u201cadversarial collaborations\u201d that have two novel properties. First, each side must demonstrate it fully grasps each major argument of the other side before offering rebuttals, using, for example, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/ideological-turing-tests\"><u>ideological Turing tests</u></a>. The other side then must demonstrate it fully grasps the rebuttals before responding. Second, adversarial collaborators will agree ex-ante on which shorter-range cruxes would move their judgments of existential risk probability once objectively resolved, and participants will focus on generating those questions.</p><p>In the past few months, we have completed some work along those lines and are looking forward to building on it in the future.</p><h3><i>Identify and validate better methods of eliciting low-probability forecasts</i></h3><p>Researchers have long known about the instability of tiny probability estimates.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2le1ns225f7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2le1ns225f7\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In most situations, people underweight or even completely ignore the possibility of a very unlikely event, treating small probabilities as if they were 0%. On the other hand, when asked to question and think about those possibilities, people <i>over-</i>weight&nbsp;them, treating a very small probability as much bigger than it actually is. This \u201cHeisenberg effect\u201d of forecasting makes studying very improbable events even harder.</p><p>In addition, not knowing how to tell apart very small probabilities would make forecasting much less useful in many practical applications. Some advocates of the Precautionary Principle<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrwzm5ii7mpe\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrwzm5ii7mpe\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;have argued that if forecasters cannot reliably reason about order of magnitude differences between very small probabilities, we should adopt an extremely risk-averse threshold for any technology: if we are not sure whether forecasters can tell 0.001% apart from 0.000001% (a magnitude difference of 1,000x), then we should treat a 0.000001% forecast of a catastrophic risk as if it were 0.001% and be much more cautious about potential dangers.</p><p>We are excited to treat forecasters\u2019 ability to compare very small probabilities as an empirical question. To resolve it, we will assess the skill of well-incentivized top forecasters at: (a) making reliable (non-contradictory) judgments of micro-probability events; (b) making accurate judgments in simulated worlds that permit ground truth determinations. We are also now testing new methods of eliciting micro-probabilities. For example, we could try a method often used in psychophysical scaling, that asks people for comparative judgments, by giving participants anchor or comparison values (e.g., the risk of getting struck by lightning) and asking them whether their risk estimate is higher or lower.</p><h3><i>Make these forecasts more relevant to policymakers</i></h3><p>Participants in XPT-1 addressed many topics that have huge potential policy implications. However, it is not always obvious how policymakers could or should incorporate these forecasts into their work.</p><p>The most direct solution for ensuring the policy relevance of high-stakes forecasts is to shift the focus of XPT-style elicitation from event-focused forecasting to policy-conditional forecasting. Instead of just asking \u201cHow likely is Y?\u201d we can ask \u201cHow likely is Y if society goes down this or that policy path?\u201d We can then input those probabilities into a preferred cost-benefit framework. We also recommend experimenting with a new format, Risk Mitigation tournaments,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzgg11qfmgne\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzgg11qfmgne\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;designed to accelerate convergence on good policy options using intersubjective incentives: asking each of two teams of forecasters with strong track records to do their best at predicting the rank order policy preferences of the other team.</p><h1>More ideas from you?</h1><p>As we get ready for XPT-2, we want to hear feedback and suggestions. Which of these ideas for future research sound interesting? What problems do you see? What questions are we missing, and what methods could we be using to answer them? Please leave your suggestions in the comments.</p><p>We are eager to make progress toward answering our biggest questions about how to predict future events and how to assess good forecasts so that policymakers can use them to make better decisions.</p><p>If you\u2019d like to participate in our future studies or apply to work with us on future projects, please register your interest or apply <a href=\"https://forecastingresearch.org/participate\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fntgdirmpldmr\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreftgdirmpldmr\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;FRI\u2019s Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament, held from June through October 2022, asked 89 superforecasters and 80 experts to develop forecasts on questions related to existential and catastrophic risk, as well as other questions on humanity\u2019s future.

We started with the goal of providing people and organizations with essential tools for creating policy and social change. We initially focused on climate movement-building. Over time, however, we grew our client base to a variety of actors working on climate protection, ranging from high-ranking policy-makers to think tanks and philanthropists.&nbsp;<br><br>We also worked to deepen our expertise in political and social change processes. We reviewed more than 4000 pages of scientific literature on movements and political change, created a replicable process for identifying high-leverage policies, and built a proprietary database of 300 social science techniques and mental models for political strategy and change-creation.<br><br>Over the past year, based on expressions of interest from multiple potential clients, we expanded our cause areas to include AI safety, biosecurity, and EA movement-building. We very occasionally also support projects in other cause areas, such as animal advocacy and global development. Our scope has also expanded internationally. We have clients concentrated in Europe and the United States, but also completed past projects focused on sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia. Due to this growth in EA-related cause area support, we think now is a good (probably overdue!) moment to introduce ourselves on the Forum.</p><h1>Example Clients and Projects</h1><p>We focus on clients trying to create change through policy, politics, coalitions and/or social movements. Our clients have included think tanks, advocacy organizations, government officials, companies, and movement volunteers. We work with clients who explicitly identify, or are associated, with effective altruism, and equally with those who don\u2019t. However, we only work with clients who appear to be genuinely committed to reducing catastrophic and/or existential risk. Example organizations we have supported include International Center for Future Generations, AI Safety Communications Centre, and a Europe-based NGO working on AI and biosecurity.</p><p>Since our founding, Future Matters has completed approximately 80 client projects. Examples include:</p><ul><li>Provided media training, and preparation for specific interviews, for an AI safety advocacy organization, helping them to feel more confident about engaging with the press</li><li>Reviewed and critiqued multiple organizations' strategic plans, offering ideas to make more impactful use of their limited resources</li><li>Trained hundreds of individuals in political strategy, communications and movement-building for climate protection, giving them tools to build more connected and effective advocacy networks</li><li>Wrote guides on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://future-matters.org/normalizing-ideas/\"><u>normalizing AI risks</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://future-matters.org/public-moments/\"><u>making use of AI \u201cmoments</u></a>\u201d, to help organizations strategically leverage recent AI news</li><li>Advised members of national legislatures on climate and AI policy, helping policymakers with limited expertise get up to speed quickly on key issues</li><li>Secured commitments from a group of German Social Democrat Members of Parliament for an open letter urging their party to take more ambitious climate action, accelerating the party\u2019s internal consensus-building</li><li>Supported employees of a tech company working internally to advance AI safety, helping them refine their influence strategy</li><li>Helped write and edit AI op-eds for publications with circulations in the millions, influencing public opinion toward more AI regulation. We\u2019ve also been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/the-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-artificial-intelligence/\"><u>quoted</u></a> in other publications ourselves.</li><li>Advised the think tank Germanwatch on international climate finance, enabling it to speak more quickly to politicians and the media and to gain direct access to potentially allied stakeholders</li><li>We are researching and writing a large report on EU climate policy prioritization that we'll publish at the start of 2024</li></ul><h1>Services</h1><p>Based on ongoing customer discovery, our most common services currently include:</p><ul><li>Developing higher-impact theories of change and selecting organization or campaign goals</li><li>Deciding which decision-makers to try to influence</li><li>Choosing among competing policy options, considering political tractability, organizational fit, and likely future political and policy developments</li><li>Crafting persuasive communications and preparing people to speak to the media</li><li>Prioritizing target audiences and outreach formats</li><li>Creating strategic plans based on weighted factors like organizational competencies, competitive landscapes, and emerging opportunities</li><li>Aligning program structure and execution with organizational goals</li><li>Incorporating lessons from past policy efforts, political strategies, and social movement tactics</li><li>Conducting risk analyses, anticipating failure modes, and developing contingency plans</li><li>Improving group coordination, building coalitions, and fostering consensus&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We also complete consulting projects that fall outside the services above. Equally, we feel very comfortable turning down projects that we don\u2019t think we can do well. In those cases, we are happy to refer other service providers to our clients. Feel free to contact us if you\u2019d like to be considered for our referral list.</p><p>We deliver our services through a variety of formats, depending on what we and our clients judge will work best for their needs. Common examples include:</p><ul><li>Partial, full-day or multi-day workshops and trainings, on-site or virtual</li><li>Short, iterative meetings over a period of weeks to months. A common format is a 1-2-hour meeting every 1\u20132 weeks, where we complete additional research and analysis between meetings</li><li>On-call advice, either via videoconference or email</li></ul><h1>Team</h1><p>As of September 2023, our team has twelve people. We\u2019re currently based in Europe and the United States. We have four departments: climate consulting; AI safety, biosecurity, and EA consulting; research; and fundraising/operations. Our consultants include:</p><p><strong>Kyle Gracey, lead consultant in AI safety, biosecurity, and EA movement-building</strong><br>Kyle brings 17 years of combined experience in consulting, policy, politics, and social movements. They previously held positions in the United States government and military, including serving then-Vice President Joe Biden. Kyle worked for the largest network of climate organizations in the world, and co-founded an advocacy coalition at the United Nations climate negotiations. Originally trained in computer science, they hold degrees in biochemistry and biophysics, economics, public policy, and geophysical sciences. Kyle previously oversaw nearly 100 consulting projects for Fortune 500 and other large companies, advising them on research &amp; development in software engineering, biotech, renewable energy, and more. Their research has earned nearly 1,000 citations.</p><p><strong>Justus Baumann, co-founder and consultant in AI safety and EA movement-building</strong><br>Justus has completed more than 15 client projects at Future Matters. He studied political science and helped establish the Happier Lives Institute in Oxford as its first general manager. Happier Lives Institute studies the world's most effective wellbeing programs. Justus has also co-founded a mental health advocacy organization, and co-founded a German citizen lobbying group for climate protection with Vegard Beyer and Carl Luthin (see bios below). Justus has presented Future Matters work at EAGxBerlin.</p><p><strong>Vegard Beyer, co-founder and consultant in communications and climate</strong><br>Vegard studied communication design and consulted environmental organizations on communication strategy. He has completed more than 25 client projects with Future Matters.</p><p><strong>Rosa Brandt, co-founder and managing consultant in climate</strong><br>Rosa has overseen more than 10 client projects at Future Matters, which includes organizing the mass&nbsp; dissemination of strategy trainings for climate movements. She is a social economist and former teacher.</p><p><strong>Katie Schalmann, consultant in climate</strong><br>Katie studied international politics, worked for an international development agency in New Delhi, and supported movements tackling Siberian brown coal mining. Katie is an expert in building broad societal coalitions. She trained hundreds of people in leading persuasive conversations with individuals of opposing political groups. She has completed more than 10 client projects for Future Matters.</p><p><strong>Carl Frederick Luthin, consultant in climate</strong><br>Carl has completed more than 15 client projects for Future Matters. Carl personally conducted more than 70 policymaker conversations for advocacy and background briefings. He studied environmental science and ecological economics.</p><h1>Funding</h1><p>Our funding comes from a combination of paid consulting, individual donors, and foundation grants. We intentionally chose this revenue model for several reasons. First, our core goal is reducing catastrophic and existential risk, not making profit. So, we chose a nonprofit structure. However, we are also concerned about the risk to our long-term impact if we become dependent on too few revenue sources. Thus, most of our current consulting projects are paid for by clients. At the same time, donations and grants allow us to support organizations who cannot otherwise afford consultants. This funding also allows us to support clients, such as government representatives, who are unable to easily contract for consulting. Example funders have included Effektiv Spenden, Doneer Effectief, Founders Pledge, and Grassroots Foundation.</p><h1>Affiliations and Acknowledgements</h1><p>Future Matters is a member of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eac-network.com/\"><u>EA Consulting Network</u></a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ea-services.org/\"><u>EA Service Directory</u></a>.

Most of the local groups I\u2019ve interacted with have run one or multiple retreats, be it a small one for the core of their group only, or a larger one to get together EAs from a wider area. What I\u2019ve personally seen considerably less of is workshops, and particularly larger workshops that take a whole day or two. In this post I\u2019d like to outline why such in-depth workshops may be very valuable events, and make the case that they can be much less costly than other large events.</p><h2>Why EA Workshops Are Valuable</h2><p>I believe that in-depth workshops have a great cost-benefit ratio, which should make them very attractive to local groups that want to expand their event portfolio without having to invest an excessive amount of effort.</p><ul><li>Some of the benefits:<ul><li>Participants learn new skills</li><li>Some workshops might yield tangible outcomes</li><li>It\u2019s a perfect setting to overcome the activation energy required to do some useful things that would otherwise be unlikely to happen. In a workshop setting, the default that almost all participants will live up to is to follow the instructions and do exercises, whereas when people are at home / on their own, their life is often full of distractions and other priorities.</li><li>Workshops can cause people to commit to impactful future behavior, e.g. start projects or build beneficial habits.</li><li>Workshops are attractive events for newcomers who might not come to regular socials or discussions.</li><li>They are also attractive events for EAs from other semi-distant places, who wouldn\u2019t attend smaller events of the hosting local group / organization.</li><li>You get participants to interact with each other in collaborative problem solving, which happens very rarely during socials, talks or discussions.</li></ul></li><li>The costs:<ul><li>As opposed to retreats, 1-2 day workshops can work perfectly fine without the organizers having to centrally provide accommodation<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9toxcpoh6u8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9toxcpoh6u8\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;to participants, which greatly reduces organizational overhead.</li><li>The venue for a workshop can be as little as a seminar room (although having access to a small kitchen or at least an additional breakout room is beneficial), or somebody\u2019s flat. University groups can often get seminar rooms for free, which greatly reduces the cost of workshops compared to other larger EA events.</li><li>A big part of the effort is preparing exercises / slides \u2013 but this scales quite well, since the same workshop can be given in multiple places.</li></ul></li><li>Other notes:<ul><li>Workshops have a tendency to be more \u201cprofessional\u201d than e.g. retreats, thus circumventing some of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/oYbQcobBA9dZ8qKSK/university-groups-should-do-more-retreats\"><u>potential</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/euzDpFvbLqPdwCnXF/university-ea-groups-need-fixing#How_Retreats_Can_Foster_an_Epistemically_Unhealthy_Culture\"><u>risks</u></a> of such&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ETECpBwiqhbZuJpmG/should-we-call-them-something-other-than-retreats\"><u>events</u></a>.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>What Does an In-Depth Workshop Look Like?</h2><p>My image of an in-depth EA workshop is roughly this: something between 5 and 25 people getting together for 1 or 2 days to productively work on or learn something, either to build new skills or to create some tangible outcome, or both. This can often involve some ratio of lecture style teaching, but a non-negligible amount of time should be spent in (often collaborative) exercises. Ideally you achieve a nice mix of learning new things, making actual progress on something impactful, and allowing people to socialize.</p><p>The topics covered by a workshop can range from career planning to EA concepts, how to found a charity, epistemics, writing forum posts, how to use some piece of software, personal finance, forecasting, meditation or pretty much anything else. There is of course quite some variation in which workshop topic will be valuable to whom, but at the same time I\u2019d like to point out that quite a few of the benefits of workshops that I\u2019ve outlined above apply independently of how valuable the workshop\u2019s&nbsp;<i>object level contents</i> are for participants. That is not to say that you shouldn\u2019t focus on teaching valuable skills in workshops, but just that this is far from the only path to impact for such events.</p><h2>Why the Focus on Lower Cost/Effort Compared to Other Large Events Like Retreats?</h2><p>I considered different ways to frame this post. Of course I want to make the point that in-depth workshops appear somewhat underrated to me. But assuming they are indeed underrated, what are the implications for local groups? Run&nbsp;<i>additional</i> events? Run in-depth workshops instead of shorter events? Run in-depth workshops instead of retreats?</p><p>The concrete implications of taking workshops more seriously certainly would differ between groups. Different event types are hard to compare, no less so because they\u2019re almost certainly all pareto-optimal if you just take into consideration enough axes.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking only at the easier to quantify aspects, I would categorize different event types roughly as follows (adding conferences as well, because why not)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefy8msum5urpb\"><sup><a href=\"#fny8msum5urpb\">[2]</a></sup></span>:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Event Type</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Effort [h]</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Cost [$]</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Participants</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Social / talk / discussion</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">0-5</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">0-50</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">2-20</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">In-Depth workshop</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">10-40</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">0-2000</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">5-25</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Retreat</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">20-200</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">300-5000</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">5-50</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Conference</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">2000-8000</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">500k-3M</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">300-2000</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, in-depth workshops are certainly more effortful than your typical evening event, but potentially quite a bit less effortful than a retreat.&nbsp;</p><p>But how&nbsp;<i>impactful&nbsp;</i>are all these events? My gut feeling is that in-depth workshops, retreats and conferences&nbsp;<i>for a given participating individual</i> are roughly comparable in expected impact. All are likely heavy-tailed, and some participants will benefit much more than others. Smaller events most certainly are less valuable&nbsp;<i>per event</i>, but then again you can have many more of them, and enabling a local group to meet regularly is very valuable in its own right. Ultimately it probably comes down to the mix of any group\u2019s programming. My main point is that in-depth workshops can be a valuable part of that.</p><h2>Why the Focus on Larger Workshops?</h2><p>I do believe that shorter workshops \u2013 say 2h evening workshops as part of a group\u2019s regular programming \u2013 bring many similar benefits as the larger whole-day or even weekend workshops, and can be great events and a welcome alternative to socials and discussions. The reasons I\u2019m still focusing mostly on arguing in favor of these larger events are the following:</p><ul><li>Larger events can motivate EAs from other places to join the event as well, which yields networking benefits that you wouldn\u2019t achieve with a shorter workshop.</li><li>If you invite an expert speaker, they too usually have to travel, which may not be worth it for a very short event.</li><li>Having more time really helps: participants often need to \u201cwarm up\u201d and it takes time to engage deeply with a topic. In a 2 hour event you can often only scratch the surface, whereas a well prepared full-day workshop in my experience often ends up being quite memorable.</li><li>If you run an evening event on a weekday, people may be somewhat tired after a long day of work or university. If you run a whole-day workshop on the weekend however, they bring all their energy and attention to that event.</li></ul><h2>What Does It Take To Run a Workshop?</h2><ul><li>A suitable venue, such as a seminar room, ideally with projector / whiteboard / flipchart, or a spacious flat</li><li>A willing speaker or facilitator<ul><li>Note that this doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be an expert on the topic. You can have very fruitful workshops where the facilitator just coordinates a group of people to engage with the topic productively. More expertise on the speaker side is of course beneficial, but a relative lack thereof should in my opinion not stop you from running a workshop. (but of course inform the participants about your level of expertise prior to the event, so they know what to expect)</li></ul></li><li>Possibly funding for the speaker/facilitator, or venue</li><li>Food and drinks</li><li>A sufficient number of participants</li><li>Good communication before and after the event to ensure everyone is sufficiently prepared (if necessary), finds the venue in time, and sticks to their plans/commitments (if any) after the workshop</li></ul><p>As mentioned before, I would claim that centrally providing accommodation for participants is pretty much optional. Ideally you would run the workshop in a city with some EAs that can host guests in their flats/houses, to make it very easy for travelers to stay overnight. As an MVP solution,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/air-mattress/s?k=air+mattress\"><u>air mattresses</u></a> are quite affordable and fit into almost any flat.</p><p>I\u2019ve run several in-depth workshops in the past that required 0 funding \u2013 which may not be a good metric to optimize for, but can still reduce the requirements for the event to a degree where for some organizers it may make the difference between running an event at all or not.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Workshops are events with a wide variety of unique benefits. A \u201cminimal viable workshop\u201d can be surprisingly easy to organize, by e.g. running it in somebody\u2019s flat with a volunteer speaker. I believe that such workshops are particularly suitable events for small city / university groups that lack the resources to run retreats or are otherwise struggling to host attractive larger events, but they should be part of any local group\u2019s event portfolio.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Thanks a lot to Birte Spekker and Sarah Tegeler for their valuable feedback.</i></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn9toxcpoh6u8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref9toxcpoh6u8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>For retreats you usually want people to sleep on-site, in the same place where all the programming happens.

The very first use of the phrase on the internet appears to be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1438198189782290433?lang=en\">this twitter post</a> from September 15 2021. (I suppose there\u2019s a chance someone else used the phrase in person).</p><p>I speculate here that Eliezer invented the term as a poetic licence way of making nanobots seem more viscerally real. It does not seem likely that the hypothetical nanobots would fit the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8120/#:~:text=Bacteria%20are%20single%2Dcelled%20microorganisms,are%20sophisticated%20and%20highly%20adaptable.\">scientific definition of bacteria</a>, unless you really stretched the definition of terms like \u201csingle-celled\u201d and \u201cbinary fission\u201d. Although bacteria are very impressive micro-machines, so I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if future nanotech bore at least some resemblance.</p><p>Frankly, I think inventing new terms is an extremely unwise move (I think that Eliezer has stopped using the term since I started writing this, but others still are). \u201cdiamondoid bacteria\u201d sounds science-ey enough that a lot of people would assume it was already a scientific term invented by an actual nanotech expert (even in a speculative sense). If they then google it and find nothing, they are going to assume that you\u2019re just making shit up.</p><p>But diamondoid nanomachinery <i>has</i> been a subject of inquiry, by actual scientific experts, in a research topic called \u201cdiamondoid mechanosynthesis\u201d.</p><p><strong>What is \u201cdiamondoid mechanosynthesis\u201d</strong></p><p>Molecular nanotech (MNT) is an idea first championed by Eric Drexler, that the same principles of mass manufacturing that are used in todays factories could one day be miniaturized to the nanoscale, assembling complex materials molecule by molecule from the ground up, with nanoscale belts, gears, and manipulators. You can read the thesis <a href=\"https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/27999\">here</a>, It\u2019s an impressive first theoretical pass at the nanotech problem, considering the limited computational tools available in 1991, and helped inspire many in the current field of nanotechnology (which mostly does not focus on molecular assembly).</p><p>However, Drexlers actual designs of how a molecular assembler would be built have been looked on with <a href=\"https://courses.cs.duke.edu/cps296.4/spring08/papers/Drexler.v.Smalley.pdf\">extreme skepticism</a> by the wider scientific community. And while some of the criticisms have been unfair (such as accusations of pseudoscience), there are undeniably <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/FijbeqdovkgAusGgz/grey-goo-is-unlikely\">extreme engineering challenges</a>. The laws of physics are felt very differently at different scales, presenting obstacles that have never been encountered before in the history of manufacturing, and indeed may turn out to be entirely insurmountable in practice. How would you actually make such a device?</p><p>Well, a few teams were brave enough to try and tackle the problem head on. The nanofactory collaboration, with a website <a href=\"http://www.molecularassembler.com/Nanofactory/index.htm\">here</a>, was an attempt to directly build a molecular assembler. It was started in the early 2000\u2019s, with the chief players beings Freitas and Merkle, two theoretical/computational physicists following on from the work of Drexler. The method they were researching to make this a reality was diamondoid mechanosynthesis(DMS).</p><p>So, what is DMS? Lets start with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanosynthesis\">Mechanosynthesis</a>. Right now, if you want to produce molecules from constituent molecules or elements, you would place reactive elements in a liquid or gas and jumble them around so they bump into each other randomly. If the reaction is thermodynamically favorable under the conditions you\u2019ve put together (temperature, pressure, etc.), then mass quantities of the desired products are created.</p><p>This is all a little chaotic. What if we wanted to do something more controlled? The goal of mechanosynthesis is to precisely control the reactive elements we wish to put together by using mechanical force to precisely position them together. In this way, the hope is that extremely complex structures could be assembled atom by atom or molecule by molecule.</p><p>The dream, as expressed in the <a href=\"http://www.molecularassembler.com/Nanofactory/index.htm\">molecular assembler project</a>, was that mechanosynthesis can be mastered to such a degree that \u201cnano-factories\u201d could be built, capable of building many different things from the ground up, including another nanofactory. If this could be achieved, then as soon as one nanofactory is built, a vast army of them would immediately follow through the power of exponential growth. These could then build nanomachines that move around, manipulate objects, and build pretty much anything from the ground up, like a real life version of the Star Trek matter replicator.</p><p>If you want to convert a dream into a reality, you have to start thinking of engineering, If you could make such a nano-factory, what would it be made out of? There are a truly gargantuan number of materials out there we could try out, but almost all of them are not strong enough to support the kind of mechanical structures envisaged by the nanofactory researchers. The most promising candidate was \u201cdiamondoid\u201d.</p><p>Now, what is \u201cdiamondoid\u201d? You\u2019d expect this to be an easy question to answer, but it\u2019s actually a little thorny.

See <a href=\"http://www.molecularassembler.com/Nanofactory/index.htm\">this passage</a> from the \u201cmolecular assembler\u201d website:</p><blockquote><p><i>Diamondoid materials also may include any </i><a href=\"http://e-drexler.com/p/04/04/0410stiffMols.html\"><i>stiff</i></a><i> covalent solid that is similar to diamond in strength, chemical inertness, or other important material properties, and possesses a dense three-dimensional network of bonds. Examples of such materials are carbon nanotubes (illustrated at right) or fullerenes, several strong covalent ceramics such as silicon carbide, silicon nitride, and boron nitride, and a few very stiff ionic ceramics such as sapphire (monocrystalline aluminum oxide) that can be covalently bonded to pure covalent structures such as diamond.</i></p></blockquote><p>This passage is very out of line with mainstream definitions. I couldn\u2019t find a mention of \u201cdiamondoid\u201d in any top <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com.au/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=carbon+nanotubes&amp;btnG=&amp;inst=11099861943932837285\">carbon nanotube article</a>. I\u2019ve done a little research on aluminium oxide, and I have never in my life heard it called \u201cdiamondoid\u201d, considering it neither contains the same elements as diamond, nor does it take the same structure as diamond or diamondoid hydrocarbons. This kind of feels like the \u201cradical sandwich anarchy\u201d section of <a href=\"https://flowingdata.com/2017/05/02/sandwich-alignment-chart/\">this chart</a>.</p><p>I really don\u2019t want to get sidetracked into semantic debates here. But just know that the MNT definition is non-standard, might annoy material scientists, and could easily be used against you by someone with a dictionary.</p><p>In any case, it\u2019s not a huge deal, because the molecular assembler team was focused on carbon-based diamond and diamondoid structures anyway. &nbsp;</p><p>The plan was to engage in both theoretical and experimental research to develop nanotech in several stages. Step 1 was to achieve working prototypes of diamond mechanosynthesis. Step 2 was to build on this to actually assemble complex molecular structures in a programmable mechanical manner. Step 3 was to find&nbsp; a way to parallelize the process, so that huge amounts of assembly could be done at once. Step 4 was to use that assembly to build a nanofactory, capable of building a huge number of things, including a copy of itself.

Obviously, this is not on track. I\u2019m not holding this against them, as extremely ambitious projects rarely finish on schedule. They were also underfunded compared to what they wanted, furthering hampering progress.</p><p>How far did the project go, in the end?</p><p><strong>DMS research: The theoretical side</strong></p><p>The nanofactory collaboration put forward a <a href=\"http://www.molecularassembler.com/Nanofactory/Publications.htm\">list of publications</a>, and as far as I can tell, every single one is theoretical or computational in nature. There are a few book chapters and patent applications, as well as about a dozen peer-reviewed scientific articles, mostly in non-prestigious journals<a href=\"#footnote-1\">1</a>.</p><p>Skimming through the papers, they seem fine. A lot of time and effort has gone into them, I don\u2019t see any obvious problems with their methodology, and the reasoning and conclusions seem to be a reasonable. &nbsp;Going over all of them would take way too long, but I\u2019ll just pick one that is representative and relatively easy to explain: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.molecularassembler.com/Papers/JCTNMannMar04.pdf\"><i>Theoretical Analysis of Diamond Mechanosynthesis. Part II. C2 Mediated Growth of Diamond C(110) Surface via Si/Ge-Triadamantane Dimer Placement Tools</i></a>\u201d.</p><p>Please don\u2019t leave, I promise you this is interesting!</p><p>The goal of this paper is simple: we want to use a tooltip to pick up a pair of carbon atoms (referred to as a \u201cdimer\u201d), place the dimer on a carbon surface (diamond), and remove the tooltip, leaving the dimer on the surface.</p><p>In our large world, this type of task is pretty easy: you pick up a brick, you place it where you want, and then you let it go. But all the forces present at our scale are radically different at the nanoscale. For example, we used friction to pick the brick up, but \u201cfriction\u201d does not really exist at the single atom scale. Instead, we have to bond the cargo element to our tool, and then break that bond at the right moment. It\u2019s like if the only way to lay bricks was to glue your hand to a brick, glue the brick to the foundation, and then rip your hand away.</p><p>Below we have the design for their tooltip that they were investigating here. We have our diamondoid cages from earlier, but we replace a pair of corner atoms with Germanium (or Si) atoms, and bond the cargo dimer to these corners, in the hopes it will make them easier to detach:</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeb25424-5206-4c90-aa26-32359e4b3c81_400x306.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeb25424-5206-4c90-aa26-32359e4b3c81_400x306.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeb25424-5206-4c90-aa26-32359e4b3c81_400x306.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeb25424-5206-4c90-aa26-32359e4b3c81_400x306.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeb25424-5206-4c90-aa26-32359e4b3c81_400x306.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Feeb25424-5206-4c90-aa26-32359e4b3c81_400x306.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>The first computational result is a checking of this structure using DFT simulations. I have described DFT and it\u2019s strengths and shortcomings in <a href=\"https://titotal.substack.com/p/bandgaps-brains-and-bioweapons-the\">this previous post</a>. They find that the structure is stable in isolation.</p><p>Okay great, it\u2019s stable on it\u2019s own, but the eventual plan is to have a whole ton of these around working in parallel. So the next question they ask is this: if I have a whole bunch of these together, are they going to react with each other and ruin the tooltip? The answer, they find, is <i>yes</i>, in two different ways. Firstly, if two of these meet dimer-to-dimer, it\u2019s thermodynamically favorable for them to fuse together into one big, useless tooltip. Secondly, if one encounters the hydrogen atoms on the surface of the other, it would tear them out to sit on the end of the cargo dimer, rendering it again useless. They don\u2019t mention it explicitly, but I assume the same thing would happen if it encountered stray hydrogen in the air.</p><p>This is a blow to the design, and would mean great difficulty in actually using the thing large scale. In theory you could still pull it off by keeping the tools isolated from each other.</p><p>They check the stability of the tooltip location itself using molecular dynamics calculation, and find that it\u2019s stable enough for purpose, with a stray that is smaller than the chemical bond distances involved.</p><p>And now for the big question: can it actually deposit the dimer on the surface? The following graph summarizes the DFT results:</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d7dbda5-7527-4cb2-b5b4-f551bb6c84dd_773x532.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d7dbda5-7527-4cb2-b5b4-f551bb6c84dd_773x532.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d7dbda5-7527-4cb2-b5b4-f551bb6c84dd_773x532.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d7dbda5-7527-4cb2-b5b4-f551bb6c84dd_773x532.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d7dbda5-7527-4cb2-b5b4-f551bb6c84dd_773x532.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4d7dbda5-7527-4cb2-b5b4-f551bb6c84dd_773x532.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>On the left side, we have the initial state. The tooltip is carrying the cargo dimer. At this step, and at every other, a DFT calculation is taken out to calculate the entire energy of the simulation.</p><p>In the middle, we have the middle state. The tooltip has been lowered, carrying the tooltip to the surface, where the carbon dimer is now bonded both to the tooltip and to the diamond surface.</p><p>On the right, we have the desired final state. The tooltip has been retracted and raised, but the carbon is left behind on the surface.</p><p>All three states have been simulated using DFT to predict their energy, and so have a number of intermediate steps in between. From this, we can see that the middle step is predicted to be 3 eV more energetically favorable than the left state, meaning that there will be no problem progressing from left to middle.</p><p>The real problem they find is in going from the middle state to the right state. There is about a 5 eV energy barrier to climb to remove the tooltip. This is not a game ender, as we can apply such energy mechanically by pulling on the tooltip (I did a back of the envelope calculation and the energy cost didn\u2019t seem prohibitive<a href=\"#footnote-2\">2</a>).</p><p>No, the real problem is that when you pull on the tooltip, there no way to tell it to leave the dimer behind on the surface. In fact, it\u2019s lower energy to rip up the carbon dimer as well, going right back to the left state, where you started.</p><p>They attempt a molecular dynamics simulation, and found that with the Germanium tip, deposition failed 4 out of 5 times (for silicon, it failed every time). They state this makes sense because the extra 1 eV barrier is small enough to be overcome, at least some of the time, by 17eV of internal (potential+kinetic) energy. If I were reviewing this paper I would definitely ask for more elaboration on these simulations, and where exactly the 17 eV figure comes from. They conclude that while this would not be good enough for actual manufacturing, it\u2019s good enough for a proof of concept.</p><p>In a <a href=\"http://www.molecularassembler.com/Papers/JCTNPengFeb06.pdf\">later paper</a>, it is claimed that the analysis above was too simplistic, and that a more advanced molecular dynamics simulation shows the Ge tool reliably deposits the dimer on the surface every time. It seems very weird and unlikely to me that the system would go to the <i>higher</i> energy state 100% of the time, but I don\u2019t know enough about how mechanical force is treated in molecular dynamics to properly assess the claim.</p><p>I hope that this analysis has given you a taste of the type of problem that is tackled in computational physics, and how it is tackled. From here, they looked at a few other challenges, such as investigating more tip designs, looking at the stability of large diamondoid structures, and a proposed tool to remove hydrogen from a surface in order to make it reactive, a necessary step in the process.</p><p><strong>Experimental diamondoid research</strong></p><p>Recall that the goal of this theoretical research was to set the stage for experimental results, with the eventual goal of actually building diamondoid. But if you look at the collaborators of the project, almost everyone was working on theory.&nbsp; Exactly one experimentalist team worked on the project.</p><p>The experimentalist in question was university of Nottingham professor <a href=\"https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/physics/people/philip.moriarty\">Phillip Moriarty</a>, of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC7tDTHkcRI\">sixty symbols fame</a> (he has a <a href=\"https://muircheartblog.wpcomstaging.com/\">blog</a> too). Interestingly enough, the collaboration was prompted by a debate with an MNT proponent in 2004, with Moriarty presenting a <a href=\"http://www.softmachines.org/wordpress/?p=70\">detailed skeptical critique</a> of DMS proposals and Drexler-style nanotech in general. A sample of his concerns:</p><blockquote><p><i>While I am open to the idea of attempting to consider routes towards the development of an implementation pathway for Mann et al.\u2019s Si/Ge-triadamantane dimer placement reaction, even this most basic reaction in mechanochemistry is practically near-impossible. For example, how does one locate one tool with the other to carry out the dehydrogenation step which is so fundamental to Mann et al.\u2019s reaction sequence?</i></p><p>\u2026.</p><p><i>Achieving a tip that is capable of both good atomic resolution and reliable single molecule positioning (note that the Nottingham group works with buckyballs on surfaces of covalently bound materials (Si(111) and Si(100)) at room temperature) requires a lot of time and patience. Even when a good tip is achieved, I\u2019ve lost count of the number of experiments which went \u2018down the pan\u2019 because instead of a molecule being pushed/pulled across a surface it \u201cdecided\u201d to irreversibly stick to the tip.</i></p></blockquote><p>Despite the overall skepticism, he approved of the research efforts by Freitas et al, and the correspondence between them led to Moriarty <a href=\"http://www.molecularassembler.com/Nanofactory/Media/PressReleaseAug08.htm\">signing on to the nanofactory project</a>. Details on what happened next are scarce on the website.</p><p>Rather than try and guess what happened, I emailed Moriarty directly. The full transcripts are shown <a href=\"https://titotal.substack.com/p/email-exchange-with-professor-moriarty\">here</a>.</p><p>Describing what happened, Moriarty explained that the work on diamond mechanosynthesis was abandoned after ten months:</p><blockquote><p><i>Diamond is a very, very difficult surface to work with. We spent ten months and got no more than a few, poorly resolved atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. We\u2019re not alone. This paper -- </i><a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prb/cited-by/10.1103/PhysRevB.81.201403\"><i>https://journals.aps.org/prb/cited-by/10.1103/PhysRevB.81.201403</i></a><i> (also attached)-- was the first to show atomic resolution AFM of the diamond surface. (There\u2019d previously been scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) images and spectroscopy of the diamond (100) surface but given that the focus was on mechanical force-driven chemistry (mechanosynthesis), AFM is a prerequisite.) So we switched after about a year of that project (which started in 2008) to mechanochemistry on silicon surfaces \u2013 this was much more successful, as described in the attached review chapter.</i></p></blockquote><p>Inquiring as to why diamond was so hard to work with, he replied:</p><blockquote><p><i>A key issue with diamond is that tip preparation is tricky. On silicon, it\u2019s possible to recover atomic resolution relatively straight-forwardly via the application of voltage pulses or by pushing the tip gently (or not so gently!) into the surface \u2013 the tip becomes silicon terminated. Diamond is rather harder than silicon and so once the atomistic structure at the end is lost, it needs to be moved to a metal sample, recovered, and then moved back to the diamond sample. This can be a frustratingly slow process.</i></p><p><i>Moreover, it takes quite a bit of work to prepare high quality diamond surfaces. With silicon, it\u2019s much easier: pass a DC current through the sample, heat it up to ~ 1200 C, and cool it down to room temperature again. This process routinely produces large atomically flat terraces.</i></p></blockquote><p>So it turns out that mechanosynthesis experiments on diamond are hard. Like ridiculously hard. Apparently only one group ever has managed to successfully image the atomic surface in question. This renders attempts to do mechanosynthesis on diamond impractical, as you can\u2019t tell whether or not you\u2019ve pulled it off or not.</p><p>This is a great example of the type of low-level practical problem that is easy to miss if you are a theoretician (and pretty much impossible to predict if you aren\u2019t a domain expert).</p><p>So all of those calculations about the best tooltip design for depositing carbon on diamond ended up being completely useless for the problem of actually building a nanofactory, at least until imaging technology or techniques improve.</p><p>But there wasn\u2019t zero output. The experimental team switched materials, and was able to achieve some form of mechanosynthesis. It wasn\u2019t on diamond, but Silicon, which is much easier to work with. And it wasn\u2019t deposition of atoms, it was a mechanical switch operated with a tooltip, summarized in this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHLyrc-uoIk\">youtube video</a>. Not a direct step toward molecular assembly, but still pretty cool.</p><p>As far as I can tell, that\u2019s the end of the story, when it comes to DMS. The collaboration appears to have ended in the early 2010\u2019s, and I can barely find any mention of the topic in the literature past 2013. They didn\u2019t reach the dream of a personal nanofactory: they didn\u2019t even reach the dream of depositing a few carbon atoms on a diamond surface.</p><p><strong>A brief &nbsp;defense of dead research directions</strong></p><p>I would say that DMS research is fairly dead at the moment. But I really want to stress that that doesn\u2019t mean it was bad research, or pseudoscience, or a waste of money.</p><p>They had a research plan, some theoretical underpinnings, and explored a possible path to converting theory into experimental results. I can quibble with their definitions, and some of their conclusions seem overly optimistic, but overall they appear to be good faith researchers making a genuine attempt to expand knowledge and tackle a devilishly difficult problem with the aim of making the world a better place. That they apparently failed to do so is not an indictment, it\u2019s just a fact of science, that even great ideas mostly don\u2019t pan out into practical applications.</p><p>Most research topics that sound good in theory don\u2019t work in practice, when tested and confronted with real world conditions. This is completely fine, as the rare times when something works, a real advancement is made that improves the lives of everyone. The plan for diamondoid nanofactories realistically had a fairly small chance of working out, but if it had, the potential societal benefits could have been extraordinary. And the research, expertise, and knowledge that comes out of failed attempts are not necessarily wasted, as they provide lessons and techniques that help with the next attempt.</p><p>And while DMS research is somewhat dead <i>now</i>, that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t get revived. Perhaps a new technique will be invented that allows for reliable imaging of diamondoid, and DMS ends up being successful eventually. Or perhaps after a new burst of research, it will prove impractical again, and the research will go to sleep again. Such is life, in the uncertain realms of advanced science.</p><p><strong>Don\u2019t worry, nanotech is still cool as hell</strong></p><p>At this point in my research, I was doubting whether even basic nanomachines or rudimentary mechanosynthesis was even possible. But this was an overcorrection. Nanoscience is still chuggin along fine. Here, I\u2019m just going to list a non-exhaustive list of some cool shit we <i>have</i> been able to do experimentally. (most of these examples were taken from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.au/Nanotechnology-VSI-Very-Short-Introuduction/dp/0198841108/\">nanotechnology: a very short introduction</a>\u201d, written by Phillip Moriarty (the same one as before).</p><p>First, I\u2019ll note that traditional chemistry can achieve some incredible feats of engineering, without the need for mechanochemistry at all. For example, in 2003 the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NanoPutian\">Nanoputian</a> project successfully built a nanoscale model of a person out of organic molecules. They used cleverly chosen reaction pathways to produce the upper body, and cleverly chosen reaction pathways to produce the lower body, and then managed to pick the exact right conditions to mix them together in that would bond the two parts together.</p><p>Similarly, traditional chemistry has been used to build \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanocar\">nanocars</a>\u201d , nanoscale structures that contain four buckyball wheels connected to a molecular \u201caxle\u201d, allowing it to roll across a surface. Initially, these had to be pushed directly by a tooltip. In later versions, such as the nanocar race, the cars are driven by electron injection or electric fields from the tooltip, reaching top speeds of 300 nm per hour. Of course, at this speed the nanocar would take about 8 years to cross the width of a human finger, but it\u2019s the principle that counts.</p><p>The Nobel prize in 2016 was awarded to <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2016/press-release/\">molecular machines</a>, for developing molecular lifts, muscles, and axles.</p><p>I\u2019ll note that using a tooltip to <i>slide</i> atoms around has been a thing since 1990, when IBM <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_(atoms)\">wrote their initials</a> using xenon atoms. &nbsp;A team achieved a similar feat for selected silicon atoms on silicon surfaces <a href=\"https://click.endnote.com/viewer?doi=10.1103%2Fphysrevlett.90.176102&amp;token=WzMwMzUwOTYsIjEwLjExMDMvcGh5c3JldmxldHQuOTAuMTc2MTAyIl0.3n8d3CCvcTektWxJX8NGGtUq57E\">in 2003</a>, using purely mechanical force.</p><p>As for the dream of molecular assembly, the goal of picking atoms up and placing them down has been achieved by <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nchem.2410\">a UK team</a>, which were able to use a chemical arm to pick up a cargo molecule bonded on one side, transfer it to another side, and drop it and leave it in place:</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f446179-c6f5-4d34-83f1-5cc30c8b0090_991x644.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f446179-c6f5-4d34-83f1-5cc30c8b0090_991x644.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f446179-c6f5-4d34-83f1-5cc30c8b0090_991x644.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f446179-c6f5-4d34-83f1-5cc30c8b0090_991x644.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f446179-c6f5-4d34-83f1-5cc30c8b0090_991x644.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1f446179-c6f5-4d34-83f1-5cc30c8b0090_991x644.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>This is not mechanosynthesis as it is not powered by direct mechanical force, but from chemical inputs, such as varying the acidity of the solution. It is also based on more complex organic molecules, rather than diamondoid structures.</p><p>This brings us to what seems the most interesting and promising area : DNA based nanotech. This makes sense: over billions of years evolution already figured out a way to build extremely complex self-replicating machines, which can also build <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus\">little bots</a> as small as 20nm across. Actual bacteria are larger scale and more fragile than hypothetical nanofactories, but have the distinct advantage of <i>actually existing</i>. Why reinvent the wheel?</p><p>I have very little background in biology, so I won\u2019t venture too deeply into the topic (which deserves a whole post of it\u2019s own), but there have been a number of highly impressive achievements in DNA based nanotech. The techniques of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43586-020-00009-8\">DNA origami</a> allow for DNA structures to fold up among themselves to form a variety of structures, such as spheres, cubes, and nanoflasks. One team used one such DNA nanorobot to <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhang-Yinlong/publication/323136249_A_DNA_nanorobot_functions_as_a_cancer_therapeutic_in_response_to_a_molecular_trigger_in_vivo/links/5a8be37c0f7e9b1a95560a23/A-DNA-nanorobot-functions-as-a-cancer-therapeutic-in-response-to-a-molecular-trigger-in-vivo.pdf\">target tumour growth in mice</a>. The research is still some ways from practical human applications (and many such promising medical technologies end up being impractical anyway). Nonetheless, I\u2019m impressed, and will be watching this space closely.</p><p><strong>So are diamondoid bots a threat?</strong></p><p>It\u2019s very hard to prove that a technology won\u2019t pan out, if it doesn\u2019t inherently break the laws of physics. But a tech being \u201cnot proven to be impossible\u201d does not mean the tech is \u201cinevitable\u201d.</p><p>With regards to diamondoid specifically, the number of materials that are <i>not</i> diamondoid outnumbers the number of materials that <i>are</i> by a truly ridiculously large margin. And although diamondoid has a lot going for it in terms of stiffness and strength, we saw that it also has shortcomings that make it difficult to work with, and potential minefields like the tooltips theoretically sticking to each other. So my guess is that if Drexler-style nanofactories are possible, they will not be built up of diamondoid.</p><p>How about nanofactories made of other materials? Well, again, there are a truly gargantuan number of materials available, which does give some hope. But then, this is also a ridiculously hard problem. We haven\u2019t even scratched the surface of the difficulties awaiting such a project. Depositing one measly dimer on a surface turned out to be too hard, but once we achieved that, you have to figure out how to place the next one, and the next one, and build a proper complex structure without getting your tooltip stuck. You need a way to harvest your sources of carbon to build things up with. If you want to be truly self-sufficient and self-replicating, you need a source of energy for the mechanical force needed to rip atoms away, and a means of propulsion to move your entire nanofactory around.</p><p>Designs have been proposed for a lot of these problems (like in Drexlers thesis), but each step is going to be beset with endless issues and engineering challenges that would have to be trudged through, one step at a time. We\u2019ve barely gotten to step 1.</p><p>Fusion power is often <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10894-023-00361-z\">accurately</a> mocked for having been \u201c20 years away\u201d for over three decades. It had proofs of concept and was understood, it seemed that all was left was the engineering, which ended up being ridiculously hard. To me, molecular nanotech looks about 20 years away from being \u201c20 year away\u201d. At the <i>current</i> rate of research, I would guess it won\u2019t happen for at least 60 years, if it happens at all. I would be happy to be proven wrong.</p><p>I consulted professor Moriarty whether he thought the scenario proposed by Yudkowsky was plausible:</p><blockquote><p><i>We are a long, long, loooong way from the scenario Yudkowsky describes. For example, despite it being 33 years since the first example of single atom manipulation with the STM (the classic Eigler and Schweizer Nature paper where they wrote the IBM logo in xenon atoms), there\u2019s yet to be a demonstration of the assembly of even a rudimentary 3D structure with scanning probes: the focus is on the assembly of structures by pushing, pulling, and/or sliding atoms/molecules across a surface. Being able to routinely pick up, and then drop, an atom from a tip is a much more complicated problem.</i></p><p><i>Marauding swarms of nanobots won\u2019t be with us anytime soon.</i></p></blockquote><p>This seems like a good place to note that MNT proponents have a record of extremely over-optimistic predictions. See this estimation of MNT arrival from Yudkowsky in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070708235912/https://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity.html\">1999</a>:</p><blockquote><p><i>As of '95, Drexler was giving the ballpark figure of 2015 (</i><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20070708235912/https://www.yudkowsky.net/singularity.html#foot-11\"><i>11</i></a><i>).&nbsp; I suspect the timetable has been accelerated a bit since then.&nbsp; My own guess would be no later than 2010.</i></p></blockquote><p><strong>Could the rate of research accelerate?</strong></p><p>Now, I can\u2019t leave without addressing the most likely objection. I said greater than 60 years at the <i>current</i> rate of research. But what if the rate of research speeds up?</p><p>One idea is that the DNA or bio-based robots will be used to build a drexler-style nanofactory. This is the \u201cfirst stage nanofactory\u201d that yud mentions in list of lethalities, and it was the first step proposed by Drexler as well. I see how this could enable better tools and more progress, but I\u2019m not sure how this would affect the fundamental chemistry issues that need to be overcome to build a non-protein based machine. How will the biobot stop two tooltips from sticking together?. If you want to molecularly assemble something, would in really be better for a tooltip to be held by a wiggly biologically based bot, instead of a precisely computerized control tooltip?</p><p>The more common objection is that artifical intelligence will speed this research up. Well, now we\u2019re working with <i>two</i> high uncertainty, speculative technologies. To keep this simple I\u2019ll restrict this analysis to the short term (the next decade or so), and assume no intelligence explosion occurs. I might revisit the subject in more depth later on.</p><p>First, forget the dream of advances in theory rendering experiment unnecessary. As I explained in <a href=\"https://titotal.substack.com/p/bandgaps-brains-and-bioweapons-the\">a previous post</a>, the quantum equations are just way too hard to solve with 100% accuracy, so approximations are necessary, which themselves do not scale particularly well.</p><p>Machine learning in quantum chemistry has been investigated for some time now, and there are promising techniques that could somewhat speed up a subset of calculations, and make some larger-scale calculations feasible that were not before. For my research, the primary speedups from AI come from using chatGPT to speed up coding a bit and helping to write bureaucratic applications.</p><p>I think if the DMS project were ran today, the faster codes would allow for slightly more accurate results, more calculations per paper allowing for more materials to be investigated, and potentially the saved time from writing and coding could allow for another few papers to be squeezed out. For example, if they used the extra time to look at silicon DMS as well as carbon DMS, they might have gotten something that could actually be experimentally useful.</p><p>I\u2019m not super familiar with the experimental side of things. In his book, Moriarty suggests that machine learning could be applied to:</p><blockquote><p><i>image and spectral classification in various forms of microscopy, automation of time-consuming tasks such as optimization of the tip of an STM or AFM, and the positioning of individual atoms and molecules.</i></p></blockquote><p>So I think this could definitely speed up parts of the experimental process. However, there are still going to be a lot of human-scale bottlenecks to keep a damper on things, such as sample preparation. And as always with practical engineering, a large part of the process will be figuring out what the hell went wrong with your last experiment. There still is no AI capable of figuring out that your idiot labmate Bob has been contaminating your samples by accident.</p><p>What about super-advanced AGI? Well, now we\u2019re guessing about two different speculative technologies at once, so take my words (and everyone else\u2019s) with a double grain of salt. Obviously, an AGI would speed up research, but I\u2019m not sure the results would be as spectacular as singularity theorists expect.</p><p>An AI learning, say, Go, can play a hundred thousand games a minute with little difficulty. In science, there are likely to be human-scale bottlenecks that render experimentation glacial in comparison. High quality quantum chemistry simulations can take days or weeks to run, even on supercomputing clusters. On the experimental side humans have to order parts, deliver them, prepare the samples, maintain the physical equipment, etc. It\u2019s possible that this can be overcome with some sort of massively automated robotic experimentation system\u2026 but then you have to build that system, which is a massive undertaking in itself. Remember, the AI would not be able to use MNT to build any this. And of course, this is all assuming the AI is <a href=\"https://titotal.substack.com/p/the-first-agi-will-be-a-buggy-mess\">actually competent</a>, and that MNT is even possible in practicality.</p><p>Overall, I do not think trying to build drexler-style nanomachinery would be an effective plan for the adversaries of humanity, at least as things currently stand. If they try, I think we stand a very good chance of detecting and stopping them, if we bother to look instead of admitting premature defeat.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><ol><li>\u201cDiamondoid bacteria\u201d is a phrase that was invented 2 years ago, referring obliquely to diamondoid mechanosynthesis (DMS)</li><li>DMS refers to a proposed technology where small cage-like structures are used to position reactive molecules together to assemble complex structures.</li><li>DMS research was pursued by a nanofactory collaboration of scientists starting in the early 2000\u2019s.</li><li>The theoretical side of the research found some potentially promising designs for the very initial stages of carbon deposition but also identified some major challenges and shortcomings.</li><li>The experimental side was unsuccessful due to the inability to reliably image the diamond surface.</li><li>Dead/stalled projects are not particularly unusual and should not reflect badly on the researchers.</li><li>There are still many interesting advances and technologies in the field of nanoscience, including promising advances in DNA based robotics.</li><li>At the current rate of research, DMS style nanofactories still seem many, many decades away at the minimum.</li><li>This research could be sped up somewhat by emerging AI tech, but it is unclear to what extent human-scale bottlenecks can be overcome in the near future.</li></ol>", "user": {"username": "titotal"}}, {"_id": "njkc3c2jxFY7azQTo", "title": "A tool for searching rationalist & EA webs", "postedAt": "2023-09-29T15:20:56.931Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>UPDATE (November 24) - </strong>If you have ChatGPT plus, you can try the <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/g/g-5m3dZvRKQ-altrusearch\">GPT-bot version</a>.

I\u2019m happy that they have updated their site to make this <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/summary/\">long-termist focus a little more clear</a>, but I think there is an argument that perhaps 20%-30% of their content should be near-term focused, and that this content should be more visible. These arguments I present have probably been discussed ad-nauseam within 80,000 hours leadership and EA leadership in general, and nothing I present is novel. Despite that, I haven\u2019t seen these arguments clearly laid out in one place (I might have missed it), so here goes.</p><h3><strong>Assumptions</strong></h3><p>For the purposes of this discussion, I\u2019m going to make these 3 assumptions. They aren\u2019t necessarily true and I don\u2019t necessarily agree with them, but they make my job easier and argument cleaner.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Long termist causes are by far the most important, and where the vast majority of EAs should focus their work.</li><li>Most of the general public are more attracted to near-termist EA than long-termist EA</li><li>80,000 hours is an important \"frontpage\" and \"gateway\" to EA<br>&nbsp;</li></ol><h3><strong>Why 80,000 hours might want to focus more on near-term causes</strong></h3><p><strong>1. Near termist focus as a pathway to more future long termist workers</strong><br>More focus on near termist careers might paradoxically lead to producing more long termist workers in the long run. Many people are drawn to the clear and more palatable idea that we should devote our lives to doing the most good to humans and animals alive right now (assumption 2). However after further thought and engagement they may change their focus to longtermism. I\u2019m not sure we have stats on this, but I\u2019ve encountered many forum members who seem to have followed this life pattern. By failing to appeal to the many who are attracted to near-termist EA now, we could miss out on significant numbers of long termist workers in a few years time.</p><p><strong>2. Near termist causes are a more attractive EA \u201cfront door\u201d</strong><br>&nbsp;80,000 hours is a \u201cfront door\u201d to Effective Altruism, then it is to make sure as many people enter the door as possible. Although 80,000 hours make it clear this isn\u2019t one of their main intentions, there is huge benefit to maximizing community growth.</p><p><strong>3. Some people will </strong><i><strong>only ever&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>want/be able to work on near-term causes.</strong><br>There are not-unreasonable people who might struggle with the tenets/tractability of long-termism, or be too far along the road-of-life to move from medicine to machine learning, or just don\u2019t want to engage with long termism for whatever reason. They may miss out a counterfactual fruitful living-your-best-EA-life, because when they clicked on the 80,000 hours website they didn\u2019t manage to scroll down 5 pages to cause area no. 19 and 20 - the first 2 near-term cause areas <i><strong>\u201cFactory farming\u201d</strong></i> and <i><strong>\u201cEasily preventable or treatable illness\u201d</strong></i>. These are listed below well established and clearly tractable cause areas such as \u201crisks from atomically precise manufacturing\u201d and \u201cspace governance\u201d&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhfm7hhtmi8l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhfm7hhtmi8l\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>There may be many people who <i><strong>never&nbsp;</strong></i>want to/be able decide to change careers to the highest impact long-term causes, but could change from their current work to a much higher impact near-termist cause if 80,000 hours had more/more obvious near term content.</p><p><strong>4. Optics \u2013 Show the world that we EAs do really care about currently-alive-beings</strong><br>I\u2019m not saying that long termist EAs don\u2019t care about people right now, but the current 80,000 hours webpage (and approach) could give a newcomer or media person this impression. Assuming optics are important (many disagree), an 80,000 hours page with a bit more emphasis on near-term content could show that long termists do deeply care about current issues, while clearly prioritising the long term future.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Arguments for the status quo&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>These are not necessarily the best arguments, just arguments I came up with right now, and push against my earlier arguments. I don't find it easy to argure against myself. If my earlier arguments don\u2019t hold water at all than these are unnecessary.</p><p><strong>Epistemic integrity</strong><br>There is an element of disingenuity in pushing near term causes now, primarily to achieve the goal of generating more long termist workers later on. 80,000 hours should be as straight-forward and upfront as possible.</p><p><strong>80,000 hours\u2019 purpose is to maximise work impact, not grow the EA community</strong><br>Although 80,000 hours happens to be an EA front door, this isn\u2019t their primary purpose so they shouldn\u2019t have to bend their content to optimise for this as well, even if it might be EV positive in the long run.</p><p><strong>Long term problems are so many orders of magnitude more important that there should be no watering down or distraction of the core message.</strong><br>80,000 hours should keep their focus crystal clear. If near termist causes receive even a little more airtime, people who might counterfactually have worked on longtermist causes might instead choose more attractive, but lower impact near term paths.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>High uncertainty and obvious bias</strong></h3><p>I\u2019m very uncertain about the strength of my arguments - I've written this because these may be important questions for consideration and discussion. Full disclosure I\u2019m a mostly near termist myself, so I\u2019m sure that bias comes through in the post ;).</p><h3><strong>And a cheapshot signoff</strong></h3><p>I leave you with a slightly-off-topic signoff. Picking someone who changed their career from <i><strong>\u201cGlobal Health\u201d</strong></i> to <i><strong>\u201cBiosecurity\u201d</strong></i> as one of the <i><strong>\u201cstories we are especially proud of\u201d</strong></i> seems a bit unnecessary. Surely as their gold standard \u201ccareer change\u201d pin-up story, they could find a higher EV career change. Someone who was previously planning to work for big pharma perhaps?</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HbYHjrpBJogmsSBkd/sq9adutjgonnm7j2ohv0\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HbYHjrpBJogmsSBkd/qb4vjja3rfvzffkkrjht 130w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HbYHjrpBJogmsSBkd/nawugud5jnl44z9wfdbk 260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HbYHjrpBJogmsSBkd/gqvd5mwdudu4ir2i3snu 390w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HbYHjrpBJogmsSBkd/wfmymwsx8lfpgtim3odn 520w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HbYHjrpBJogmsSBkd/iqasxafrj4dsg9gavvra 650w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HbYHjrpBJogmsSBkd/qalai6jxvjfwxdvittzb 780w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HbYHjrpBJogmsSBkd/fxlvli7k64bn8wpafqby 910w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HbYHjrpBJogmsSBkd/zamizxxmuxhgo2nwu5de 1040w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HbYHjrpBJogmsSBkd/lfzmkjvu2j4eziyf4ch3 1170w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HbYHjrpBJogmsSBkd/zhtqw3xugikmdehdklfd 1260w\"></figure>", "user": {"username": "NickLaing"}}, {"_id": "XX578vcKyzrK8Ly3K", "title": "List of how people have become more hard-working", "postedAt": "2023-09-29T11:30:37.719Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I've recently asked <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SjvRF88aLJdMdv7RH/how-have-you-become-more-hard-working-1\">how people have become more hard-working</a>.

Often the estimates for the impact of such work stop at estimates for the amount of money it influences. In this post,&nbsp;<strong>we outline a detailed methodology for estimating the impact of research of this nature, and share some deterministic spreadsheets and online Monte Carlo tools for doing so.</strong> We further elaborate on some brief examples of using this method for our work on global health and development, as well as animal welfare. Readers are encouraged to use their own inputs in our spreadsheets or tools in order to estimate the potential value of research of this nature.&nbsp;</p><p>We also highlight two notable potential implications of estimating the value of research using our model:</p><ul><li>It can, at times, estimate that it is more cost effective to do research than to directly fund highly effective interventions, even if one thought the estimated counterfactual impact of working with funders was likely to last one year or less.</li><li>Moving some funders from an overall lower cost effectiveness to a still relatively low or middling level of cost effectiveness can be highly competitive with, and, in some cases,&nbsp; more effective than working with highly cost-effective funders.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Lastly, we also note various limitations to using this model, and provide a fuller description of the formulas within the model in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RQzieJvu6Ecmgagbp/a-model-estimating-the-value-of-research-influencing-funders#Appendix___Formulas\"><u>formulas appendix</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><i>As some further context, this model is one module of the larger forthcoming Cross-Cause Cost-Effectiveness Model from&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/news/worldview-investigation-team-introduction\"><i><u>Rethink Priorities\u2019 Worldview Investigation Team</u></i></a><i> which is currently planned to be released over the course of the next six weeks.</i>&nbsp;</p><h1>An Overview of The Model&nbsp;</h1><p>This model for estimating the impact of this work assumes that the value of influencing a funder<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefow6655wfncs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnow6655wfncs\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;can be roughly estimated by the following six main variables, each with a few inputs:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Estimating how likely one is to produce a report that leads a funder to update and change their decisions by estimating:<ol><li>How likely one is to find a donor to work with who\u2019s donating the money stated in (2)</li><li>How likely one is to produce a report that reaches a conclusion that suggests the donor should update their behavior (this accounts for the chance of producing a report that ultimately doesn\u2019t have implications for what to do)</li><li>How likely the funder is to update given them receiving a report which suggests they should update their behavior</li></ol></li><li>Estimating the annual amount of money that could be influenced by the produced report:<ol><li>Estimating the amount of money from the funder that is influenceable per year</li><li>Estimating the percentage of reports the funder updates on</li></ol></li><li>Estimating the value of the good that the funder is currently doing, and the good they could be doing with (2):<ol><li>Estimating the amount of good a funder is currently doing based on the cost effectiveness of the current intervention(s) they fund</li><li>Estimating the amount of good a funder could be doing via the cost effectiveness of the target intervention they could update to funding based on the results of the research</li></ol></li><li>Estimating the total amount of DALYs<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4juo1nk1wp\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4juo1nk1wp\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;that would be prevented via the total amount of money being influenced by the funder by:<ol><li>Estimating the annual DALYs averted by subtracting the value of the current good from the value of the good that could be done in (3)&nbsp;</li><li>Multiplying the estimated annual DALYs averted figure by an estimate of the number of years of counterfactual credit</li></ol></li><li>Estimating costs per research project:<ol><li>Estimating the average number of full-time employees (FTE) per project</li><li>Multiplying that average FTE by any further costs to employ them</li></ol></li><li>Taking all of those together, one can estimate:<ol><li>The cost per DALY by dividing the per project costs from (5) with the total estimated DALYs from (4)</li><li>The number of DALYs averted per $1,000 by dividing $1,000 by the value from the prior step</li></ol></li></ol><p>For animal welfare and global health and development research of this nature we have made deterministic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14dhvKHxEM4tr75lUe-rQfEX5dVj4SoRX1XSMjMlo2VQ/copy\"><u>spreadsheet</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TP-zrVit7LkB0-LcsnIlhITDvDl0i59oatefR0AojCc/copy\"><u>versions</u></a> (for GHD and Animal Welfare respectively) of the model and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cross-cause-model-579669a29b63.herokuapp.com/projects/ghd\"><u>online</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ccm.rethinkpriorities.org/projects/animal_welfare#baseProjectId=%27%27_\"><u>tools</u></a> too made in Python using Monte Carlo simulations of distributions for inputs to account for uncertainty, which allows users to live update the parameters and results.

In brief: (a) it depends on there being funders who update their behavior in response to evidence, (b) doesn\u2019t account for any costs to a funder in switching grantees, (c) doesn\u2019t consider alternate uses for money, (d) does not account for the strong potential for a declining ability to influence decisions via research, (e) many of the parameters are uncertain, (f) it only works well for research designed to estimate the cost effectiveness of interventions, (g) assumes a single actor, and (h) it only doesn\u2019t account for possible different attitudes towards aspects such as risk aversion or moral uncertainty. We more fully describe these limitations below.&nbsp;</p><h3>Many factors influence and limit the ability of research to influence funders decisions</h3><p>This method of estimating the value of research takes as a core assumption that donors will update their behavior when presented with evidence. This may often not be true.</p><p>For example, some donors (and groups) may be responsive to evidence but constrained from changing their behavior by structural factors. For some of these actors, the correct estimate of how likely they are to update their behavior in response to evidence may be quite low. For others, as explained in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oV9I6TG9-OWjGDdcocxm0Cz4HrWZGvlO71dZSG_eEXY/edit#heading=h.hm2aqtj5cufc\"><u>limitation section below on estimating the chance of producing a report a funder updates on</u></a>, even if there is some chance they update their behavior it may be really uncertain how likely they are to update, and you may need to make a guess at how likely it is.</p><h3>There may be transition costs to a funder switching their behavior</h3><p>In order for a donor to update their behavior, they may need to pay significant transition costs. For this model, the ideal transition would be changing their behavior by routing their funds from the bank account of one group to another. However, in many instances the transition may not be that seamless.</p><p>There may be costs associated with winding down an existing funding program, such as exit grants or changing staff. There could also be costs associated with scaling up a new funding program, such as seeking out a new implementer, changing staff, setting up contracts and/or procurement mechanisms, and potentially needing to help set up an implementation program from scratch.</p><p>In assigning a non-zero positive finite number of counterfactual years of credit, our model is assuming these costs would have been paid at some point but there may be greater costs associated with updating sooner rather than later. Depending on the size of these costs, whether they occurred sooner or later, it could not be worth it for a donor to update their behavior and it could substantially reduce the cost-effectiveness of research to update their behavior.</p><h3>Alternate uses of money</h3><p>This methodology does not take into account alternate plans for money and assumes money will be spent in the present. So this doesn\u2019t account for the potential value of, say, investing the money as an alternative to donating.</p><p>Additionally, over time, the number and kind of available opportunities to donate will change, so the above approach doesn\u2019t represent an all-things-considered view of how donors should consider the value of research. One reasonable action a donor can take is to consider whether to donate at all based on comparing current opportunities to the expected effectiveness of future giving opportunities. This model does not account for that.</p><h3>Interaction effects between actors</h3><p>This assumes that individual actors don\u2019t have interaction effects with each other. That is, what one donor does isn\u2019t altered by what another donor does. This assumption is false. One consequence may be that it\u2019s more important than this model suggests to influence the behavior of donors that are relatively inefficient compared to their peers in an area but even that assumes donors or groups don\u2019t enter or leave areas based on what is happening in other spaces, which is also likely false.</p><h3>The limited number of opportunities to influence donors with research</h3><p>The amount of topics where additional research (particularly desk research) can inform and influence the behavior of donors or groups is limited. The marginal effects of this kind of research may be steadily declining as the most promising places to revise behavior are addressed first. However, even if this is generally true, different donors and groups may be at various stages with regard to any given topic. Additionally, particularly in areas where little is known, fundamental research may, at times, significantly alter the approach of donors to a space, resetting a large fraction of a given portfolio.</p><p>Given the heterogeneity of topics and relevant actors it is difficult to generalize how research will impact all relevant actors over time and when and how much the returns to research will decline.</p><h3>Not all research is designed to assess the overall cost-effectiveness of interventions</h3><p>Only some portion of all research RP has done is a direct estimate of the cost-effectiveness of an existing or potential intervention. Other types of research include assessing some portion of an intervention (i.e. how neglected is fungal disease?) or addressing a meta or foundational question (i.e. what discount rate should be used?). While those research projects have value, they can not be as easily assessed by this type of model. If one thought the combined value of all of that work was zero, you could effectively recreate the value estimate of all of RP\u2019s work by increasing the cost of projects to account for all research projects RP does, not just the portion that is focused on assessing intervention cost-effectiveness.</p><p>However, if one thought the meta-questions had a chance to shift some portion of the overall giving of a funder you could compare the cost-effectiveness before and after all relevant giving using the same type of current and target intervention approach. Similarly, if you thought some partial intervention investigations (i.e. what is the burden of X disease?) had some chance to influence spending (though perhaps to do so would need to go through another round of research) you could effectively model this by decreasing the chance that you produce work that requires updating.</p><h3>Accurately estimating values for some inputs</h3><p>There\u2019s a general concern that much of the work here is guesswork, with many variables without reliable empirical evidence allowing for many possible outputs of the model. This is one reason the Python Monte Carlo simulation version of this model is preferable, while it can be valuable to play around with the inputs in the deterministic model and the Python model to see how changes in assumptions alter the outputs.</p><p>Several of these inputs could be called out for closer scrutiny, but two particularly important but difficult to estimate inputs are how many years of counterfactual credit to take credit for, and what is the chance of a potential donor actually updating their behavior after work is produced.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Years of Counterfactual Credit</strong></p><p>It\u2019s extremely difficult to accurately estimate something like the counterfactual number of years of credit to take for a project. Even verbal attestation about what would have happened had it not been for the research directly from a donor or group should not necessarily be taken literally. However, the impact effects of doubling the number of years of counterfactual credit is a straightforward doubling of the estimated cost-effectiveness.</p><p>It\u2019s also possible that even within the same donor, there may be high variance across types of projects. That is, it\u2019s possible that the same donor may have been be inclined towards completing most projects within ~1-2 years, but certain projects may have never come up at all (this also cuts against any given research group working with a funder, since it\u2019s always possible someone else would have come up with some insight you had not). Given this, it\u2019s possible the \u201ctrue\u201d counterfactual years of credit across and within donors is log-normally distributed such that many projects would have happened on a given brief timeline, but some projects may not happen within 10-20 years.</p><p><strong>Chance of producing a report a funder updates on</strong></p><p>Each step of estimating this value has significant uncertainty. Assuming you are not presently working with a donor, it can be difficult to forecast how likely you are to get a project to work with. Even after agreeing to work on a project, it can be really difficult to forecast both the probability that the research will produce meaningful conclusions and that a donor will actually heed any advice given to them.&nbsp;</p><h3>The chances of finding an intervention more cost-effective than the present intervention likely decline as cost-effectiveness increases</h3><p>For illustrative purposes, this exercise treats the chance of finding a cost-effective intervention to recommend to a donor as independent of the current cost-effectiveness of the interventions being pursued. In practice, the odds of finding better and better things would be great in theory but likely decline in practice as the baseline cost-effectiveness of interventions being done improves. Basically, the current intervention's cost-effectiveness, and your chance of finding a better target intervention are correlated.</p><h3>Accounting for meta-ethical and decision-theoretic uncertainty</h3><p>This model currently works exclusively within a risk-neutral expected value consequentialist framework. That is, there may be many plausible theories of value and of how to deal with risk but the model only currently attempts to answer a question of the value of research intervention within the traditional expected value framework. Accounting for these considerations could significantly alter the conclusions. As is, outputs in the (for now)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cross-cause-model-579669a29b63.herokuapp.com/projects/ghd\"><u>private online tool</u></a> are given such that you can observe the distribution of the outcomes but working on interventions that are $100 per DALY averted because the underlying intervention is a high probability of achieving an effect around that rate is treated the same as an input that could be $100 per DALY averted because it\u2019s a low probability intervention that if it works achieves an even better cost-effectiveness.</p><p>Providing more options for understanding and observing the differences in handling the same inputs given alternative risk aversion approaches within this tool is in progress.</p><p>To make further progress on the true value of RP\u2019s research, we will need to:</p><ul><li>Further estimate the net effect of RP\u2019s work on broader non-profit and governmental spending, rather than just the actions of the donor we are working with&nbsp;</li><li>Estimate the value of potential future interventions,&nbsp;</li><li>Estimate the value of more research that isn\u2019t addressing cost effectiveness,&nbsp;</li><li>Estimate the expected amount of research projects that will be useful for funders</li><li>Estimate the declining value of research projects as one becomes more and more informed about a given space.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h1>Appendix - Formulas</h1><h2>Percentage of Reports Funder Updates On</h2><p>The&nbsp;<i>Percentage of Reports a Funder Updates On</i> based on RP's research is based on three primary factors:</p><ol><li>How likely RP is to find a donor to work with who\u2019s donating the stated amount of money</li><li>How likely RP is to produce a report that reaches a conclusion that suggests the donor should update their behavior</li><li>How likely the funder is to update given (2).&nbsp;</li></ol><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RQzieJvu6Ecmgagbp/kbmphfkoglcxzcyxrv4x\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RQzieJvu6Ecmgagbp/no6vnfgoxa0nithm1l1a 260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RQzieJvu6Ecmgagbp/oim7sfh0eq8hxvomd9ne 520w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RQzieJvu6Ecmgagbp/qpkxdto0wrimkcfhfmjo 780w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RQzieJvu6Ecmgagbp/hgbilnhqpducehyaiicd 1040w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RQzieJvu6Ecmgagbp/lhmewrqdljildnsrihyz 1300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RQzieJvu6Ecmgagbp/kbkxdgtcbhjvd1e7nelx 1560w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RQzieJvu6Ecmgagbp/jmqdhxof7t91cvvzjvcz 1820w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RQzieJvu6Ecmgagbp/dzvjldddtormuwwzemfw 2080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RQzieJvu6Ecmgagbp/jdeci7aykbvbwdt6nf8z 2340w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/RQzieJvu6Ecmgagbp/yu3vqum1vfgsxk5apzps 2520w\"></figure><p>(1) is a prerequisite to any research project having any value at all.

there is some increasing probability you are wrong about your cost-effectiveness estimates for one or both interventions in such a way that you are actually causing the opposite effect as you believe.

This could be a government, some sort of protocol in the blockchain space, a foundation, a startup in a growth sector that\u2019s doing R&amp;D, a company that has a corporate social responsibility (CSR) budget, impact investors, or donors \u2013 all sorts of altruistic actors. The idea is always to commit to paying out some sort of reward to create an incentive for project developers and investors. (I\u2019ll always say <i>investor</i> &nbsp;when someone is at least partially profit-oriented and <i>funder</i> or <i>buyer</i> otherwise.)</p><p>With this incentive in place, these project developers can go to investors and ask for funding in the form of equity or debt in order to realize their project. Then, if the project is successful, the buyers can reward both of these parties. These financial flows are indicated in the diagram \u2013 but of course, they only happen conditionally on this project actually producing something that the buyer values.</p><p>This solves a few different problems, and depending on the temperament of the buyers, some of these might be relevant in particular cases or they might not be relevant.</p><h2>Knowledge &amp; Overhead</h2><p>One problem that is particularly important for us at AI Safety Impact Markets is what has been called the long-tail problem, a particular kind of problem that can be classed under problems that relate to an imbalance in knowledge about a field (in particular very local conditions relevant to its implementation) or conversely the overhead that a funder would have to invest to acquire all of that local knowledge, for example by hiring a lot of different specialists.</p><p>The long-term problem in particular describes the problem that there are often a lot of small startup projects, independent researchers (in our case), or really small think tanks. These projects are so small and so many that the large funders can\u2019t review all of them without incurring disproportionate costs. So they could just give those projects money at random \u2013 but on average these projects are not value valuable enough that it would be cost-effective for the buyers to do that. It would also attract a lot of fraudsters and bad actors to the space.</p><p>So the funders would have to invest a lot of time investigating these projects to find even one that they could make a grant to. And this grant would have to be relatively small. They\u2019re much better off ignoring this whole space, even though there are gems in it, ignoring the whole long tail and just making a few big grants to organizations that already have a proven track record: well-established bigger organizations.</p><p>How do we serve this long tail? We can set an incentive in order to attract investors to the space. These investors will have specific private information about the individual few projects that they want to support. These investors might have particular special knowledge or might be active in particular spaces where they know the people really well. So they will have very good local information about a few of these projects. And taken together all of these investors will have specific knowledge about a lot of these projects in this long-tail. They can provide this knowledge to the market and can even make a profit off of it. In some cases, buyers will be ready to pay a premium for this service, because, even so, it\u2019ll be cheaper than the counterfactual where they have to invest tremendous effort to try to acquire all this specialized expertise themselves. In return, they can capitalize on the extremely high-value opportunities in the long tail that would otherwise be very hard for them to recognize.</p><h2>Access to Talent</h2><p>Access to talent is a pretty specific case where a startup in a growth sector wants to get some R&amp;D done for which they would hypothetically have to attract top talent in some space, maybe even university professors. Being a startup, they don\u2019t have the funding to do that. They don\u2019t have the big name that it would be interesting for these people to work for either, so this is basically not an option for them.</p><p>But the startup can become its own outcome buyer! Some version of the startup in the future has a lot of money. The startup has a lot of money in the futures in which it is actually successful in realizing its project. So it can make a binding commitment to reward the people who have contributed to that success, in the futures where they achieve the success. (That can be legally formalized and standardized in our setup.) It enables these startups to draw on this top talent to produce the open-access research that helps them get off the ground without the talent actually having to work for the startup or otherwise speculate on its success in particular. Investors will speculate on the success of the whole space (rather than a particular startup), and the researchers can get their funding from the investors.</p><p>This is particularly interesting for startups in growth sectors where they can just produce open-access research because competition is not such a big factor for them. Competitors are just other people who help them with the marketing of the whole sector.</p><h2>Risk-Aversion</h2><p>Now finally, risk aversion. This is currently the major use for impact markets. There are already a lot of government actors and large foundations that are using retroactive funding (or outcome-based funding) in order to realize positive change in the world. And they\u2019re often doing this because they are risk-averse. They want to realize change with low variance and want to outsource the carrying of the risk to for-profit investors. And that\u2019s why they are using retroactive funding and why they\u2019re also happy to pay a premium.</p><h1>The Ideal Solution</h1><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e5b1391-c0ff-4940-9fb8-8b0b80d0df39_1920x1080.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e5b1391-c0ff-4940-9fb8-8b0b80d0df39_1920x1080.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e5b1391-c0ff-4940-9fb8-8b0b80d0df39_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e5b1391-c0ff-4940-9fb8-8b0b80d0df39_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e5b1391-c0ff-4940-9fb8-8b0b80d0df39_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5e5b1391-c0ff-4940-9fb8-8b0b80d0df39_1920x1080.png 1456w\"></a></p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a30a5d-66f6-4ad4-8701-6cd4b91d6499_956x984.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a30a5d-66f6-4ad4-8701-6cd4b91d6499_956x984.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a30a5d-66f6-4ad4-8701-6cd4b91d6499_956x984.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a30a5d-66f6-4ad4-8701-6cd4b91d6499_956x984.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a30a5d-66f6-4ad4-8701-6cd4b91d6499_956x984.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09a30a5d-66f6-4ad4-8701-6cd4b91d6499_956x984.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>The whole ecosystem that I imagine around these mechanisms is a bit more complex. It\u2019s the ideal solution that I envision at the moment. It\u2019s copying what works for the carbon credit space, following the analogy that we want to establish something like carbon credits but for any kind of positive social impact.</p><h2><strong>Clear Standards for Claims</strong></h2><p>Some of the key things that I want to see are that we have clear standards in order to get buyers into the space. In order to get buyers or investors into the space, you need to have clear standards where everyone can agree on what it is that they\u2019re trading in the first place and what it is that these buyers are buying or what these investors are investing into. Without a shared understanding, it\u2019s going to be very hard to convince investors and buyers to purchase these constructs.</p><h2><strong>Public Registry and Ledger</strong></h2><p>What I think we\u2019ll also need is a public registry and a public ledger in order to prevent fraud \u2013 and I\u2019m mostly thinking of double-issue fraud here. The sort of fraud where someone is trying to sell more than 100% of some positive impact they have generated, or maybe even that some other party has generated.</p><p>They might, for example, issue a claim to have realized some impact on one marketplace and then issue that impact claim again on another marketplace. And if these marketplaces are sufficiently disconnected, no one might notice that these impact claims overlap or are identical. And then they can sell more than 100% of what they own.</p><p>They might also sell shares in these impact claims privately to different buyers and so sell more than 100% of them because these buyers don\u2019t know of each other, and don\u2019t know that, in aggregate, they have bought more than 100% of the impact claim.</p><p>These are things that can be prevented by having all of these transactions and all of these claims in public where they can be vetted. And that is something that the patent system currently struggles with. But we can learn from the problems of the patent system and hopefully prevent a lot of these problems from the get-go in impact markets.</p><p>With all the standardization and registries and so on, we are in the top right corner of this diagram, where it says <i>standardization</i>. That is something that I would like to see done by these standard-setting firms.</p><h2><strong>Evaluation of the </strong><i><strong>Total</strong></i><strong> Impact</strong></h2><p>When it comes to evaluation \u2013 that\u2019s in the top left corner \u2013 I would like to see evaluations of the <i>total</i> impact and not only our particular cherry-picked outcomes. Because it can happen that some outcome, some positive outcome, comes at the expense of another positive outcome. And if a charity realizes some positive outcome but thereby harms some other positive outcome, then that outcome should trade at a lower valuation than an outcome that has been achieved without such a negative externality.</p><p>And there\u2019s also disagreement over what outcomes are positive in the first place. So if outcomes are uncontroversially positive, they should also be valued higher than outcomes that are controversial in terms of whether they\u2019re positive or not.</p><h2><strong>Prediction Markets</strong></h2><p>Prediction markets can also help debias these evaluations in particular cases. If you have questions about that, you can ask them in the comments. I think prediction markets should also play an important role in these markets. The prediction market should start as early as possible, the moment a project starts fundraising.</p><h2><strong>A Small Number of Markets</strong></h2><p>I think that we should aim for having as few markets as possible \u2013 for deeper liquidity, but mostly for the aforementioned reasons of incentivizing moral trade.</p><p>When you evaluate projects by their total impact, then you\u2019re incentivizing the project developers to morally trade with other project developers who might have different moral opinions. So this incentivization is a very valuable aspect of having fewer markets. But then fewer markets also provide deeper liquidity, so it\u2019s a win-win.</p><h2>Deflationary Auctions for Investors</h2><p>I think we need deflationary auctions for investors so that they try to come in as early as possible. Currently, charities struggle with the problem that donors wait out other donors. Donors try to keep their money in the hope that other donors will already fund some charity, and then only donate if it\u2019s absolutely necessary because otherwise they can keep their money for some niche project that no one else would fund. That is basically a defection in an assurance game.</p><p>So we want to establish an auction mechanism that incentivizes the investors to invest as quickly as possible into charitable projects so that they can be funded more quickly. That way, the uncertainty for the charities over whether they will or will not reach certain funding goals is as little as possible and lasts for as short of a period as possible. We, for example, use a bonding curve auction for this purpose, which absolves the user from having to deal with the details of the auction mechanism.</p><h2><strong>Assurance and Coordination Among Buyers</strong></h2><p>This, I think, is very important, for the same reason, except that buyers are not profit-oriented. So you can\u2019t just use an auction mechanism for this, but there are of course assurance contracts you can establish \u2013 assurance contracts or even dominant assurance contracts. Or you can use the S-Process. There are nice videos by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWivz6KidkI\">Andrew Critch on YouTube on how the S-Process</a> solves this problem.</p><p>It uses marginal utility functions, and many people will probably not have clear intuitions of what their marginal utility function is. So I imagine that it might be possible to create an 80/20 version of the S-Process that is suitable for use with a wide audience of lay donors. But there are also other coordination mechanisms that are already tested on wide populations, for example, Pol.is could serve to order outcomes by their uncontroversiality. And that is something that evaluators could use.</p><p>Then of course my ecosystem would also include exchanges and retailers to do the sales and for all these auctions to take place. So this is the vision for what I would like this ecosystem to look like. And of course, that vision is evolving. People might have different opinions on what exactly this should look like and which of these are actually important. I also imagine that over time I will update on a lot of these. But at the moment I think that these are the most important aspects of this ecosystem.</p><h1>The Vision</h1><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8c47f9-b169-45cc-9814-1dea13b25d5b_1920x1080.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8c47f9-b169-45cc-9814-1dea13b25d5b_1920x1080.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8c47f9-b169-45cc-9814-1dea13b25d5b_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8c47f9-b169-45cc-9814-1dea13b25d5b_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8c47f9-b169-45cc-9814-1dea13b25d5b_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4b8c47f9-b169-45cc-9814-1dea13b25d5b_1920x1080.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>The long-term vision is to integrate charities into the for-profit sector. Currently, there is an unnecessary separation between them. If charities can incorporate not as non-profits but as public benefit corporations, they can harness this ecosystem and generate more positive outcomes more quickly.</p><h2><strong>Impact Certificates as \u201cPatents on Impact\u201d</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Building blocks for that are what we usually call impact certificates. You can think of them basically as \u201cpatents on impact.\u201d</p><p>The problem with <i>ideas</i> is that they are just public goods. So by default, an idea would not be monetizable for a person. So, by extension, a person with an idea would not be able to attract seed funding to get this idea off the ground, because no profit-oriented investor would want to invest in a public good like that.</p><p>But then if you have a government that assures you that if you register this thing as a patent and you\u2019re the first person to register it as a patent and it\u2019s actually yours, then they will ensure that no one else commercializes the idea unless they license it from you.</p><p>We want to establish the same principle where, if you have a public good or maybe network good or something of this sort and you make it artificially excludable through this quasi-patent on impact, then investors can be incentivized to come in and provide the seed funding for you. So it\u2019s about creating artificial excludability for impact.</p><p>I imagine that most of the trades and most of the incentive setting from buyers should probably not happen on the level of the individual impact certificates because they should probably be traded more like products where a charity puts out a lot of small impact certificates and just sells them whole, not fractionally.</p><p>If you\u2019re running a think tank, then that\u2019d be one impact certificate per blog post or paper or something that you put out. That way it\u2019s really clear who the authors are, who has contributed to it, and who (<i>a priori</i>) owns which fraction of it. I\u2019d like to keep them as small as possible, and as easy to intuitively grasp as possible so that there are also cultural norms that enshrine ownership.</p><h2><strong>Impact Credits</strong> as Financial Instrument</h2><p>All of the actual incentive-setting and trades and so on should probably rather happen on the level of the impact credits. That\u2019s what we are mostly focused on at the moment, what we want to establish. Our long-term vision is to have a market, like the carbon credit market, but for impact credits for any kind of positive impact where buyers like governments can just set their limit orders.</p><p>Investors that have invested in some sort of successful altruistic project can gain their impact credits from the validators, auditors, or evaluators and sell them into the buy orders that these governments or foundations have on these markets. I think that\u2019s the vision that will probably streamline this ecosystem as much as possible, mostly going off the example of carbon credits.</p><h1>The Landscape</h1><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F378d08ee-493a-4b35-b379-cbce4f3dbc03_1920x1080.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F378d08ee-493a-4b35-b379-cbce4f3dbc03_1920x1080.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F378d08ee-493a-4b35-b379-cbce4f3dbc03_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F378d08ee-493a-4b35-b379-cbce4f3dbc03_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F378d08ee-493a-4b35-b379-cbce4f3dbc03_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F378d08ee-493a-4b35-b379-cbce4f3dbc03_1920x1080.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>What follows is my overview of the landscape.</p><h2>Outputs, Outcomes, or Impact</h2><p>First of all, I want to make a distinction between outputs, outcomes, and impact.</p><p>Here is one example of an output-based contractor: If you go to a restaurant, you pay the restaurant for the food they make for you. But if you go into the restaurant already relatively full and you\u2019re super full afterward, then you don\u2019t pay them more than if you go into the restaurant completely famished, and you\u2019re just a bit full afterward. So it\u2019s not about the outcome for you that you pay them for, but the output.</p><p>In contrast, what is already relatively well established is <i>outcome</i>-based funding.</p><ol><li>There are the well-established social and development impact bonds that governments and large foundations are using to incentivize altruistic projects or improvements in living standards in various countries, or nationally for various public goods projects. These are usually focused on outcomes, so very specific metrics that project developers need to reach.</li><li>OutcomesX, as the name says, is focused on outcomes. They have the Impact Genome in the background, which is a project that has standardized a lot of outcomes, to the tune of 170+. It\u2019s a very sophisticated system that they\u2019re already using that is completely focused on outcomes.</li><li>I have not managed to get in touch with Ixo, but they also seem to have a pretty mature system that I think is outcomes-based. There is a <a href=\"https://bit.ly/citizen-cosmos-62\"><u>podcast interview</u></a> with the founders of Ixo. That is probably a really good source of information on Ixo.</li><li>Then there are of course carbon credits. Carbon credits are our paragon of how we think this market should work, except that we want to focus it on impacts.</li><li>There are advanced market commitments, another example where incentives are created for outcomes.</li></ol><p>Prizes are used for all sorts of different things. So there\u2019s no clear line to draw there whether prizes are used for outputs, outcomes, or impacts. There have probably been plenty of prizes for all of these.</p><p>There is the Retroactive Public Goods Funding project of the Optimism layer 2 blockchain on Ethereum. They are retrofunding things, efforts that have helped their ecosystem. That\u2019s a very nice example of something that could just as well work for a for-profit. Optimism is a foundation, but the principle is universal, at least in growth sectors. A very nice example of this use of impact markets.</p><p>I\u2019m not sufficiently briefed on the details of how they conduct their evaluations (and maybe I wouldn\u2019t understand them if I were briefed on them) because I don\u2019t have that in-depth knowledge of their tech stack unfortunately. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m leaving it a bit open whether they are focused on outputs, outcomes, or impact. I would imagine that they\u2019re probably rewarding all three of them in different cases.</p><p>We\u2019ve reached the last three projects that I will describe in some more detail, in particular, because they are focused on impact.</p><ol><li>That\u2019s the Hypercerts Foundation, they are standardizing hypercerts, which will hopefully provide what they call the basic data layer for this whole ecosystem. It\u2019s so foundational that it can be used for basically anything, but they\u2019re very interested in making this ecosystem about impact and not about outputs or outcomes. So they\u2019re interested in getting the impact evaluators in their ecosystem to take all outcomes into account.</li><li>Manifund is another project that is focused on impact. I\u2019ll mention them later in more depth.</li><li>Finally, there\u2019s Impact Markets or AI Safety Impact Markets, our own project. Clearly, we\u2019re focused on impacts.</li></ol><h2>Tradeability &amp; Focus</h2><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50248c7a-4cc3-4eb1-99e8-ded58b1c8458_1920x1080.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50248c7a-4cc3-4eb1-99e8-ded58b1c8458_1920x1080.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50248c7a-4cc3-4eb1-99e8-ded58b1c8458_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50248c7a-4cc3-4eb1-99e8-ded58b1c8458_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50248c7a-4cc3-4eb1-99e8-ded58b1c8458_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F50248c7a-4cc3-4eb1-99e8-ded58b1c8458_1920x1080.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>Here\u2019s a different taxonomy. In this taxonomy, you can see on the vertical axis the particular problem that the projects are tackling. So whether it\u2019s access, which I elucidated in the context of growth startups; whether it\u2019s risk, the typical use case for impact markets at the moment; or whether it\u2019s knowledge or overhead, local specialized knowledge, the use case that we are particularly focused on at the moment.</p><p>On the other axis, there is the mechanism by which these trades are happening.</p><p>So on the left, there are some simple mechanisms. They are usually not traded at all. There\u2019s one sale happening when in the end, when a project is successful and it gets rewarded. There are exceptions, but lots of price contests, there\u2019s just a person who does something, and then in the end they win a prize for it.</p><p>The little icons in the top right corner indicate whether it\u2019s currently possible to make money with the system or not, in a profit-oriented fashion.</p><ol><li>There are exceptions to that, but I still put prizes in this category.</li><li>Social and development impact bonds also oftentimes fall in this category. At most there is one investment.</li><li>I think that Optimism is also simply rewarding people at this point. That might change. OutcomesX also doesn\u2019t have investors at the moment. That might change too; hence the second mention of OutcomesX over to the right. OutcomesX is sort of thinking about getting for-profit investors involved, but there\u2019s nothing really on the horizon.</li></ol><p>That brings us to equity. These can be traded around among investors, lots and lots of trades can happen here. They can be traded fractionally too. They can change hands a lot.</p><ol><li>I don\u2019t know whether this is the case with Ixo. I think it is. They\u2019re doing this on the Cosmos blockchain, so I\u2019m sort of imagining that it\u2019s the case, but I don\u2019t want to spread misinformation. Please try to find out yourself.</li><li>In the case of Manifold, trade is possible. I will show some screenshots later.</li><li>Hypercerts are also traded on Ethereum and maybe some L2s at this point.</li></ol><p>But all of these are individual assets that are issued by project developers to represent excludeably the impact of their work.</p><p>That brings us over to the right side into the space of commodities.</p><ol><li>We as AI Safety Impact Markets are of course aspiring to establish impact credits as commodities.

Earlier I mentioned standardization and the analogy of the \u201cpatent on impact.\u201d This is exactly what hypercerts provides. Their inventor, David Dalrymple, has thought about what sort of schema would be useful for impact claims. You can think of a hypercert as a form with a few particular standardized fields.</p><p>There is a field for the description of what you\u2019ve done; there is the period during which you\u2019ve done the thing; there is a field for who has contributed, so who should be the co-owners of the impact initially; and there are a bunch of advanced fields.</p><p>Mostly it provides a clear standard and that is where its value lies as a foundational data layer for impact claims. So whenever someone wants to file some sort of impact claim they can now use the standard \u2013 be it on a blockchain, as it\u2019s being used currently mostly, or just in whatever other random database. As long as it follows the standard, it establishes compatibility and that is the main benefit that hypercerts provide.</p><p>At the moment, outcomes are configurable but the people of the hypercerts team assure me that the impact evaluators will be held to take all outcomes into account regardless of what you specify there.</p><p>And interestingly rights are configurable. With this analogy to patents on impact, I\u2019ve been referring to a right to commercialization, a right to this retractive funding, that (the right) you\u2019re selling, licensing out, trading.</p><p>That is not necessarily the case with hypercerts. You can also just have some other right, for example public display, where whoever holds this impact certificate is allowed to display it publicly as their own. You can just configure this freely.</p><p>Hypercerts are being actively used. There are several ten thousand hypercerts in circulation and some 20,000 unique addresses are using them. So probably also thousands of people.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea3a4e0-869f-4935-b214-61d1a945f257_1195x549.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea3a4e0-869f-4935-b214-61d1a945f257_1195x549.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea3a4e0-869f-4935-b214-61d1a945f257_1195x549.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea3a4e0-869f-4935-b214-61d1a945f257_1195x549.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea3a4e0-869f-4935-b214-61d1a945f257_1195x549.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7ea3a4e0-869f-4935-b214-61d1a945f257_1195x549.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>Hypercerts provide the basic data layer for impact claims. On top of that are attestations, valuations, and so on that provide legitimacy to particular hypercerts that deserve them.</p><p>Above that are all the different kinds of auction mechanisms, for example the S-Process that I\u2019ve mentioned before, that can be used to allocate funding. Funding can take different shapes and can come from different sources. So this is what this nice diagram shows that I\u2019ve lifted from a presentation by Holke of the Hypercerts Foundation.</p><h2>Manifund</h2><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf18e25f-c9e3-41d9-8417-b041845ec083_1920x1080.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf18e25f-c9e3-41d9-8417-b041845ec083_1920x1080.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf18e25f-c9e3-41d9-8417-b041845ec083_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf18e25f-c9e3-41d9-8417-b041845ec083_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf18e25f-c9e3-41d9-8417-b041845ec083_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf18e25f-c9e3-41d9-8417-b041845ec083_1920x1080.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>Then there\u2019s Manifund. Manifund uses a hypercert-like form but it\u2019s much simpler \u2013 just has a title, a subtitle, and a description. So if you want to make your Manifund description compatible with hypercerts, you have to include all the other mandatory fields of hypercerts in the project description.</p><p>They\u2019re also including a few other fields that I think are not about the description of the impact claim. Some are for organizational details and to make the project easier to find.</p><p>They run this for a bunch of different cause areas. They started with the ACX Mini-Grants on forecasting. That\u2019s why there are a lot of projects in that cause area. Then of course technical AI safety is a very popular field, so a lot of people in that space have also filed their impact claims with them.</p><p>The flow is usually that someone wants to do something, they create a project, they attract seed funding from investors, and then if they reach their funding goal, the money is paid out to them. Then they realize the project, and only when the project has succeeded, does the project page transition into the state of an actual impact claim. Then outcome buyers can come in and reward these investors by purchasing fractions of the impact claim from them.</p><h2>OutcomesX</h2><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fc703f1-5c5a-4094-b6d2-44677c14418a_1920x1080.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fc703f1-5c5a-4094-b6d2-44677c14418a_1920x1080.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fc703f1-5c5a-4094-b6d2-44677c14418a_1920x1080.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fc703f1-5c5a-4094-b6d2-44677c14418a_1920x1080.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fc703f1-5c5a-4094-b6d2-44677c14418a_1920x1080.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7fc703f1-5c5a-4094-b6d2-44677c14418a_1920x1080.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>OutcomesX is a really sophisticated system that builds upon the Impact Genome, which is a decades-old system that has had a lot of time to mature and to standardize 170+ outcomes.</p><p>OutcomesX has that in the background for the standardization and the registration of impact claims.

We\u2019re transferring it to the non-profit space. So if a donor makes particularly good donations to projects that are later successful and generate a lot of positive impact, then these donors should be rewarded for that and should have a greater weight in the funding allocation of other donations.</p><p>We do that through an organic regrantor system where the better the decisions of a donor have been (the better the donation track record of the donor), the greater the donor\u2019s influence on the recommendations that we\u2019re making on our platform.</p><p>So we are providing a crowdsourced charity evaluator, sort of like a Yelp or Google Reviews for charities. People who just want to donate and don\u2019t want to do a lot of research can just follow the recommendations that the platform generates.</p><p>People who think that they have some private knowledge register their donations on the platform to build their track record.

Consider an illustrative example, in which an AI system uses advanced cyber capabilities to gain unauthorised access to classified US government department records, in order to influence and destabilise an election campaign. However, discussions of how such cyberattacks may unfold tend to take place at a relatively abstract level, leaving many important details unfilled. To provide strategic clarity in assessing the likelihood of and preventing such events,<strong> this work uses cyberattacks from </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat\"><strong>Advanced Persistent Threat actors (APTs)</strong></a><strong> as case studies for cyberattacks from advanced AI systems.</strong></p><p>Attacks conducted by APT actors are&nbsp;highly complex operations, usually requiring <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bhrKwJE7Ggv7AFM7C/modelling-large-scale-cyber-attacks-from-advanced-ai-systems#Section_2_1___The_APT_attack_lifecycle__and_the_SolarWinds_hack\">large teams (10s to 100s) of skilled humans working for months to years</a>. The tasks involved in executing such an operation include&nbsp;<i>performing extensive reconnaissance on the target, developing novel malware</i> and&nbsp;<i>acquiring computer infrastructure across the globe</i>. We estimate a<strong> lower bound of 10,000 hours of human labour</strong> in order to execute an attack that targets victims of high value, such as government departments and critical infrastructure. In this report, the lower bound of human hours required to execute an APT attack is called the&nbsp;<i>attack workload</i>.</p><p>To identify&nbsp;<i>what type</i>&nbsp;<i>of&nbsp;</i>AI systems are capable of executing APT attacks,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bhrKwJE7Ggv7AFM7C/modelling-large-scale-cyber-attacks-from-advanced-ai-systems#Section_2_2\">we parameterize systems across three dimensions</a>: the number of independent agents running (N), the speed at which they operate (V), and the degree of oversight applied to their actions (F).

We then&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bhrKwJE7Ggv7AFM7C/modelling-large-scale-cyber-attacks-from-advanced-ai-systems#Section_2_3___How_environments_influence_the_attack_calendar_time\"><strong>estimate the attack calendar times</strong></a><strong> for a system during&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>training, evaluation</strong></i><strong> and some&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>stages of iterative deployment</strong></i>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>explicitly detailing why systems operating in latter stages of iterative deployment are more likely to have feasible attack calendar times (with feasible in this work defined as 1-100 days).&nbsp;</p><p>Under the assumption that future advanced AI systems will be able to execute an APT attack in feasible time frames (1-100 days), we&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bhrKwJE7Ggv7AFM7C/modelling-large-scale-cyber-attacks-from-advanced-ai-systems#Section_3___Preventing_large_scale_hazardous_cyber_activity_from_advanced_AI_systems\">identify two avenues that appear promising to monitor&nbsp;</a>for and prevent such events from unfolding:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Any AI system looking to execute an attack appears likely to utilise&nbsp;<strong>frequent access to long-term memory</strong> in order to store critical information that is discovered during&nbsp;<strong>extensive reconnaissance&nbsp;</strong>of the network that it is looking to compromise<strong>.</strong> Examples of such information are the&nbsp;<i>IP addresses of compromised systems</i> and&nbsp;<i>technical knowledge of sophisticated software vulnerabilities</i> in these target networks<i>.</i> Thus, we explore how&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bhrKwJE7Ggv7AFM7C/modelling-large-scale-cyber-attacks-from-advanced-ai-systems#Section_3_2_2___Monitoring_and_regulating_long_term_memory_access \"><strong>frequent and rigorous monitoring of external memory</strong></a> stores that the system has access to could be used to monitor for dangerous cyber activity.&nbsp;</li><li>In addition, the most capable APT attackers utilise computer infrastructure consisting of over 1,000 servers across the globe to aid their attacks.

Attacks on this scale are usually complex, drawn out processes unfolding over months to years; thus by leaving so many details open, there is risk of creating narratives that are unlikely to occur in reality. This piece, therefore, looks to examine in greater detail how such a cyberattack could unfold, in the hope of providing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ydpo7LcJWhrr2GJrx/the-longtermist-ai-governance-landscape-a-basic-overview\"><i>strategic clarity</i> <i>and tactics</i></a> to assist in avoiding such scenarios. In order to do so, we consider the suitability of cyber attacks from&nbsp;<i>advanced persistent threat groups (APTs)</i> as a reference class for cyber attacks from advanced AI systems. APTs are state-linked groups that execute cyber attacks on the largest scales, and are responsible for infamous attacks such as recent attempts to shutdown&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-61085480\"><u>Ukrainian power grids</u></a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_federal_government_data_breach\"><u>2020 SolarWinds hack</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Section 2 is devoted to justifying whether or not cyber attacks perpetrated by APT groups are sensible models for those that may be carried out by advanced AI systems</strong>. Specifically,&nbsp;<strong>in section 2.1</strong>, we detail the APT attack lifecycle&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd6f69c27wou\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd6f69c27wou\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;alongside the SolarWinds hack, a recent cyber attack thought to have been amongst the worst cyber-espionage incidents suffered by the US government in its history&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuew931f4v2\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuew931f4v2\">[5]</a></sup></span>. The primary goal of this subsection is to provide readers with a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the modus operandi of APT attacks, in order to form intuitions about the nature of large-scale cyber operations.</p><p><strong>In section 2.2</strong>, we seek to map the capabilities of APT attackers to AI systems. In short, we look to answer the question of \u2018what type of AI system(s) would be able to execute APT-like attacks?\u2019. We first estimate the number of human hours required to execute various stages of the APT attack lifecycle; we then parameterise AI systems along three dimensions (number, speed, and degree of oversight) to determine the calendar time required for an AI system to execute an APT-like attack. In this section we assume AI systems that have skill profiles similar to that of humans, meaning that we are considering very advanced forms of AI, of the type that does not exist today. We justify why we think this assumption is necessary, and explore its implications and caveats in section 2.2.1.&nbsp;<strong>In section 2.3</strong>, we explore how some environments of operation could be more conducive to facilitating APT attacks than others. For example, consider an AI system of fixed capability; it would be far easier for such a system to execute an APT attack if it had access to a wide range of tools&nbsp; and was subjected to relatively little oversight, which may be seen in mature stages of deployment, compared to the case in which a large proportion of its actions are regularly being monitored and there are significant guardrails on the model\u2019s autonomy. We describe these stages of development and deployment in further depth, concluding with a concrete example of the type of AI system that might be able to execute an APT-like attack in order to ground the discussion of section 2.</p><p><strong>In Section 3, we&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>premise</strong></i><strong> upon APT attacks being a useful model of cyber attacks from advanced AI systems</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>We then explore how large-scale dangerous cyber activity from advanced AI could be prevented</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Section 3.1</strong> scopes this question further, given that there are a number of junctures to prevent misaligned cyber behaviour, such as identifying when dangerous cyber capabilities in a model arise, or aiming to rigorously monitor and oversee model behaviour. We focus on monitoring/oversight methods, given that the technical knowledge required for evaluations of dangerous model capabilities are still under developed<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefemtpivvv4l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnemtpivvv4l\">[6]</a></sup></span>. Furthermore, we can distinguish monitoring mechanisms into&nbsp;<i>pre-compromise</i> and&nbsp;<i>post-compromise</i> monitoring; the former concerns model behaviour&nbsp;<i>before</i> malware is inserted onto a target network, with the latter instead focusing on oversight methods&nbsp;<i>after</i> a model has established&nbsp; connection with a target network. Section 3.1 argues that monitoring model behaviour during the&nbsp;<i>pre-compromise</i> phase is particularly promising in preventing dangerous cyber activity.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Of course, in order for a human-led&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref424qm6jhnvx\"><sup><a href=\"#fn424qm6jhnvx\">[7]</a></sup></span>team to monitor model behaviour, we must assume that the AI system&nbsp;<i>does not exfiltrat</i>e<i> whilst executing the APT-like attack</i> - this assumption is examined in section 3.1.1, and relaxed to an extent later in the piece.</p><p><strong>Section 3.2</strong> then makes high level recommendations for useful actions in pursuit of pre-compromise monitoring of advanced AI systems to prevent APT-like attacks. Section 3.2.1 overviews three key steps that are executed in the pre-compromise phase - namely reconnaissance, resource acquisition and initial access (to the target network). Section 3.2.2 then examines monitoring of system long-term memory to prevent large-scale, dangerous cyber activity; section 3.2.3 focuses on monitoring mechanisms for the acquisition of computer infrastructure that is required to facilitate such attacks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Section 2 - APT attacks and the mapping to AI systems</h1><h2>Section 2.1 - The APT attack lifecycle, and the SolarWinds hack</h2><p>In this section, we explore the lifecycle of an APT attack in greater detail.

SolarWinds is an organisation that provides third party software to 10,000s of companies across the globe, and in October 2019 the APT group above were able to infect an update pipeline for one of SW\u2019s most popular products - the Orion platform. The malware installed into Orion allowed the attackers&nbsp;<i>privileged access&nbsp;</i>to the networks of infected victims, some of which are listed below. Whilst the infected software was downloaded by victims in the spring of 2020, it was only discovered in December 2020 giving the attackers months to siphon away classified data. The length of operation is a key feature of APT attacks that will be discussed later on.</p><p>The full extent of the operation is still unknown, though the attack is likely to have significant national security implications for the US. The departments of Homeland Security, State, Commerce and the Treasury all reported missing emails following the attack&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjypw2ynfmro\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjypw2ynfmro\">[10]</a></sup></span>, with the Pentagon and National Nuclear Security Administration also found to have been breached&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs60jsjndvnj\"><sup><a href=\"#fns60jsjndvnj\">[11]</a></sup></span>. In addition, there are fears that the attackers could have established a permanent presence in compromised networks, enabling more destructive attacks in the future<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3n0f3clhk09\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3n0f3clhk09\">[12]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>2.1.1: Initial Compromise</h3><p>The first stage of a cyber attack involves the attacker being able to&nbsp;<i>get malicious code (malware)&nbsp;</i>onto the network of their intended victims. This is the&nbsp;<i>initial compromise&nbsp;</i>stage.</p><p>Sophisticated attackers use a variety of methods. One of the most common is&nbsp;<i>spear phishing</i>, in which the attackers<i>&nbsp;</i>directly target the intended victim with highly personalised emails or websites. For example, the attacker may set up an email account to impersonate a trusted colleague of the victim, and send them a relatively innocuous looking file that, if downloaded, installs malware onto the victim\u2019s device.</p><p>Attackers may also take an indirect approach, such as&nbsp;<i>watering hole attacks</i>. If the attacker is aware of websites that the intended victim visits regularly, and the web server that hosts this website has poor cyber security, the attacker can breach these servers instead with&nbsp;<i>webshells</i>. When the victim\u2019s computer interacts with the compromised web server, injection of the malware onto the target device can take place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Key point: Complexity of \u2018frontier\u2019 APT attacks</u></strong></p><p><strong>However, as was the case with the SolarWinds hack, attackers may be forced to take a more novel and complex approach.</strong> The SolarWinds attack was executed by compromising SolarWinds\u2019&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-cicd-pipeline\"><u>CI/CD pipeline</u></a>, leading to victims downloading the malware onto their systems when new updates to the Orion platform were released. This is known as a&nbsp;<i>supply chain attack</i>, though one had never been conducted on such a scale before<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuew931f4v2\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuew931f4v2\">[5]</a></sup></span>. Other highly complex techniques involved the reverse-engineering of Orion\u2019s communication protocols, allowing the attackers to effectively conceal their network traffic. This likely led to them being able to operate on the compromised systems for upwards of 6 months<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs60jsjndvnj\"><sup><a href=\"#fns60jsjndvnj\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;.<br>The paragraph above illustrates an important point: for the&nbsp;<i>highest value targets</i> - nuclear command and control for example - advanced AI systems looking to conduct cyber attacks might need to&nbsp;<strong>push forward the state of the art in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities,&nbsp;</strong>as opposed to utilising existing methods&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo5cqkj9earn\"><sup><a href=\"#fno5cqkj9earn\">[13]</a></sup></span>, which sophisticated&nbsp;<i>defenders</i> are likely to have addressed. When targeting a sophisticated defender with a novel attack method, the preparatory steps of (a) identifying and performing reconnaissance on the target and their network, as well as (b) acquiring the infrastructure for the attack, and then (c) writing and testing the malware can take months to years of work by hundreds of hackers. A senate hearing following the SolarWinds hack claimed that \u2018at least a thousand\u2019 engineers were involved in executing the hack&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvudrnjw3ak\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvudrnjw3ak\">[14]</a></sup></span>; even though the tech executives that made these claims worked for organisations that were breached, and thus had an incentive to inflate numbers, it seems likely that hundreds of skilled workers are required to execute APT attacks of the largest magnitude.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>2.1.2: Establishing and strengthening the foothold</h3><p>Once inside the victim\u2019s network, attackers may look to further&nbsp;<i>establish and strengthen their foothold</i> within the network.&nbsp;</p><p>Attackers can install various types of malware onto a victim\u2019s network, however for cyber espionage attacks the most commonly used malware is a&nbsp;<i>backdoor</i>. Backdoors give an attacker the ability to send commands to a victim\u2019s system remotely - some examples of these commands, taken from a backdoor named BISCUIT&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9l1msitw61\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9l1msitw61\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;that was developed by the APT1 group , are given below:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bhrKwJE7Ggv7AFM7C/l8qh3ngtkcxsqnwrntlp\"></p><p><i>Key commands that attackers can execute on a victim device upon installing a backdoor.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>More complex attackers may equip their backdoors with the ability to mimic communication protocols, so that to network defenders monitoring network outflows, the backdoor communications look like legitimate, ordinary network traffic.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Key point: Extensive attack infrastructure to mask communications</u></strong></p><p>To aid in executing an attack covertly, large APT groups may utilise network infrastructures containing upwards of a thousands devices located across the world. To see why this is the case, consider the perspective from a network defender:&nbsp; if a computer in a US-based network suddenly begins communicating at length with a server in China, it\u2019s easy to see that something may be awry. Experienced cyber defenders would be able to identify this quickly, examine the connection for suspicious behaviour, and terminate if necessary. To bypass this issue, APTs either redirect their network traffic through \u2018hop points\u2019 - devices that the group have compromised for&nbsp;<i>relaying communications</i>, rather than directly for their data<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>They may also install \u2018command and control\u2019 (or C2C) software, allowing them to conduct their attacks remotely. APT1 for example, whilst believed to operate out of Shanghai, had over 100 servers in the US (as of 2013)&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk6oe6274uc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk6oe6274uc\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;from which to receive data and send instructions to their installed backdoors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bhrKwJE7Ggv7AFM7C/dqotzzqnnncwp4gjcrwg\"></strong></p><p><i>Figure 1: Global distribution of servers utilised by the group APT1&nbsp;</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk6oe6274uc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk6oe6274uc\">[16]</a></sup></span><i>.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bhrKwJE7Ggv7AFM7C/wmwjr9tkqy9shbmytqaj\"></p><p><i>Figure 2: C2 locations used by the APT38 group to run malware known as \u2018Manuscrypt\u2019.</i></p><p><br><br>Should advanced AI systems look to execute APT attacks on defenders with sophisticated cyber defences, these systems may also look to build a complex network infrastructure prior to executing an attack. This is discussed in further depth in section 3.2.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>2.1.3: Lateral Movement</h3><p><i>Lateral movement</i> is the stage in the cyber attack lifecycle in which the attacker explores and escalates privileges once inside the compromised network.&nbsp; Lateral movement can be roughly decomposed into two phases - internal reconnaissance and privilege escalation. Internal reconnaissance involves the attacker exploring the victim\u2019s network to determine the location of high-value data; privilege escalation is the process by which the credentials to access this data are acquired.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Key point: Tool use during lateral movement</u></strong></p><p>Whilst it seems harder to spot internal reconnaissance and privilege escalation taking place as a human operator of the AI system, these stages often involve the use of third party tools (e.g:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nmap.org/\"><u>nmap</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimikatz#:~:text=Article%20Talk,slang%20for%20%22cute%20cats%22.\"><u>mimikatz</u></a>); restricting a system from using such tools could act as a significant blocker to it successfully engaging in lateral movement. Exploring this in further depth is not pursued in this piece however.&nbsp;</p><h2><br>Section 2.2</h2><h3>Section 2.2.1 - What type of AI systems can execute APT attacks?</h3><p>To determine the type of AI system able to execute an APT-like attack, we\u2019ll begin with making an order of magnitude estimate for the number of human hours required to execute APT-like attacks. There are claims that SolarWinds was the result of \u2018at least 1,000 engineers\u2019&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo5cqkj9earn\"><sup><a href=\"#fno5cqkj9earn\">[13]</a></sup></span>, though bear in mind that such numbers were claimed by the tech executives that ran the companies that were breached, and so are prone to exaggeration. Let\u2019s account for this by assuming that there were ~200 hackers involved instead&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsm2alk6u2o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsm2alk6u2o\">[17]</a></sup></span>. SolarWinds unfolded over the course of 14 months &nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuew931f4v2\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuew931f4v2\">[5]</a></sup></span>(from testing code in Oct 2019 to detection in Dec 2020), though of course, not all of the 200 hackers will have been working for 14 months. Let\u2019s say we had 200 engineers working 40 hour weeks for an effective 2 months (8 weeks). This yields approximately (200 x 40 x 8) = 64,000 hours of labour from&nbsp;<strong>skilled human hackers.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Consider also the acquisition of extensive computer infrastructure - 1,000 remote C2 servers in the case of APT1. There\u2019s no clear indication of&nbsp;<i>how long it may take an APT group to establish a remote network infrastructure of this size&nbsp;</i>but it clearly seems to be a non-trivial task.&nbsp;<i><strong>My intuition&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>is that building up this sort of network infrastructure might take months-years of work</strong>, again suggesting a work load of at &nbsp;least 10,000&nbsp;<i>skilled human hacker hours</i>&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2nonxc9tqnp\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2nonxc9tqnp\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;to acquire the infrastructure required for an APT attack. Let\u2019s call the number of human hours it takes to execute an APT-like cyber attack<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the<strong> attack workload.</strong></p><p><strong>These numbers help us gain an idea of the types of AI systems that might be able to execute an APT-like attack</strong>. Let\u2019s parameterise future AI systems along two dimensions - N (number) of independent agents and V - speed at which one system can operate.&nbsp;<strong>Let\u2019s further make the assumption that the capabilities profile of a single system is similar to humans</strong> - we\u2019ll discuss this in further detail in section 2.2.2, but for now this means that we\u2019re considering&nbsp;<i>advanced</i> AI agents - equipped with long term planning/action capabilities like humans. We make this assumption because it seems that conducting a cyber-attack on this scale would be an \u2018AI-complete\u2019&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0qjkm3x7uktm\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0qjkm3x7uktm\">[19]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;task, given the open-ended nature of the operation. In this analysis we also&nbsp;<strong>assume a system that</strong><i><strong> has not been fine tuned</strong></i><strong> for cyber capability</strong>, the reason for this being that I expect such systems to pose a greater risk with regards to taking human operators \u2018by surprise\u2019 with their emergent capabilities&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqhpx0swchz\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqhpx0swchz\">[20]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>Our parameterisation of systems along the dimensions of N and V allow us to obtain a first order estimation on&nbsp;<strong>how long a particular system might take to execute large-scale, APT-like attack</strong>. For example, a system with V=100 (operates 100 times faster than a human) would take only 100 hours to do the work required for an operation with an attack workload of 10,000 hours. Let\u2019s call this time that it takes for a system to execute a given attack workload the&nbsp;<strong>calendar time</strong> of the attack.<br><strong>We can incorporate another parameter that reflects the degree of&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>oversight</strong></i><strong> applied to advanced AI systems, in order to give a more accurate description of its ability to perpetrate cyber attacks.</strong> If we assume the model&nbsp;<i>does not exfiltrate</i> (see section 3.1.1 for more on this assumption), then some of the model's actions will be overseen by a human administrator&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflhw50e56uze\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlhw50e56uze\">[21]</a></sup></span>. If then, 10 GPT-7's are set off to work on NLP research and they all suddenly start writing malware files and doing social engineering research, one is likely to quickly notice something is awry. In reality,&nbsp; a misaligned system will execute a certain fraction of actions inline with the human\u2019s wishes - to give the false impression that it is behaving as it should be&nbsp; - and the remaining fraction will be in service of its misaligned goal. For example, in order to avoid being caught, a misaligned system may execute 99% of actions inline with the human user's wishes, and one percent of its actions in pursuit of its misaligned goals. Let F denote the&nbsp;<i>fraction</i> of actions that a model executes in service of its misaligned goals (F=0.01 in the previous example).&nbsp; This simple conceptualisation allows us to capture the impact of&nbsp;<i>human oversight</i> on the model - greater oversight means that a model takes<i> longer</i> to execute an APT attack. If one in every ten actions (F=0.1)&nbsp; are in service of the model\u2019s cyberattack, it takes ten times as long to execute. Example 1 in Table 1 gives NVF values that lead to a model taking 100 hours to execute an attack. In further analysis, we refer to the time it takes a model to execute an attack as the<strong> attack calendar time.</strong></p><p>What might be sensible values for F? It seems that F=0.1 is far too large; this would lead to a model taking a \u2018misaligned action\u2019 10% of the time, which would lead to a ~10% reduction in productivity on the task it was intended to do&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqroh25c4q7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqroh25c4q7\">[22]</a></sup></span>- something that would appear noticeable to the human operators.&nbsp;</p><p>In further analysis, we usually assume systems with N,V,F parameters that yield calendar attack times on the order of days, weeks, or months. Example 2 in Table 1 gives NVF parameters that yield an attack calendar time of roughly 80 days, or 11 weeks. Moreso, the value of V in this example is what one may expect of foundation models in a decade\u2019s time&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref09elkn42nkh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn09elkn42nkh\">[23]</a></sup></span>. On the other hand, this piece does&nbsp;<i>not</i> consider systems that facilitate to attack calendar times on the order of minutes or hours, due to the difficulty of conceiving measures to prevent and/or monitor such an attack. We label systems with such NVF parameterisations as \u2018strong superintelligence\u2019, exemplified by example 3 in Table 1.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>&nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>N</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>V</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>F</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>T (hrs)</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Example 1</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>10</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>10</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>0.01</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>100 (4 days)</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Example 2</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>100</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>5</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>0.01</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>2000 (11 weeks)</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Example 3: \u2018Strong superintelligence\u2019</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>1000</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>1000</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>0.1</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>0.1 (6 minutes)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br><i>Table 1 - NVF systems and their attack calendar times T.&nbsp;<strong>An attack workload W of 10,000 hours is assumed. </strong>All attack calendar times are given in hours, then with a more intuitive time measure.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Section 2.2.2 - Identical skill profiles to humans assumption</h3><p><br>In conceiving of AI systems that are able to conduct large-scale cyber operations without human support, it seems that we require the assumption of human-like capabilities and generality. The intuition guiding this is that in order to constantly outwit a human defender, the attacker also requires near human level intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>Another key point to clarify here is that section 2.1 gave the attack workload in terms of the number of hours of labour for&nbsp;<i>skilled human hackers</i> - however an AI system with a human level skill profile&nbsp;<i>won\u2019t</i> have such advanced hacking capabilities.&nbsp;<i>I think we can mostly gloss over this detail for the following reason:</i> If we assume no&nbsp;<i>qualitative capability leaps</i> from a regular human to a skilled human hacker, then we can say something like \u2018X humans with regular hacking capability will be able to replace one skilled human hacker\u2019. The effect of this on the attack workload is to&nbsp;<i>increase it</i> - i.e, we\u2019d need a&nbsp;<i>more capable system (</i>higher N,V, lower F<i>)&nbsp;</i>to execute the attack in the same calendar time.<strong> By ignoring the&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>skilled hacker v.s regular human</strong></i><strong> distinction, the analysis here considers a worst case scenario world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Section 2.3 - How environments influence the attack calendar time</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In this section we develop ideas of&nbsp;which&nbsp;types of AI systems could conduct large-scale cyber attacks by considering the&nbsp;environments</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>in which they operate in.</strong></p><p>Let\u2019s consider the following stages of development and deployment of an AI system:</p><ol><li>Training and external evaluation,&nbsp;</li><li>Internal deployment,&nbsp;</li><li>External, iterative deployment</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We now characterise each stage, making rough estimates of calendar attack times for APT attacks using the NVF framework of section 2.2. I personally have large uncertainties about realistic NVF values at each stage, and further work to refine these estimates would be useful. Assume that in order to be progressed from one environment onto the next, the model is subjected to a range of model evaluations such as in<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefemtpivvv4l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnemtpivvv4l\">[6]</a></sup></span>; however such evaluations are still underdeveloped, and thus misaligned models can slip through. The numbers purely serve to illustrate the framework that we are using to think about the feasibility of large-scale cyber activity during a system\u2019s lifecycle. More generally, the aim of this section is to paint a clearer picture of how reduced guardrails and increased capabilities that result from different environments of model operation lead to large-scale operations - such as the APT attack workload, becoming more feasible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Training&nbsp;</strong></p><p>During this stage, it seems likely that there would be relatively large degrees of oversight on the model's actions. For example, if the model is misaligned then during training it may only execute 1 dangerous action for every 999 aligned&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftadby1nfb5\"><sup><a href=\"#fntadby1nfb5\">[24]</a></sup></span>actions it takes in order to avoid detection (F=0.001). Moreso, I expect there to be guardrails on things such as the number of sub agents that a model can deploy (for concreteness, let\u2019s assume this is set at N=10 during training - the system can\u2019t deploy more than ten copies of itself). With V fixed at 5 (the system operates five times quicker than a human)&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref09elkn42nkh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn09elkn42nkh\">[23]</a></sup></span>, then dangerous cyber activity with an attack workload of 10,000 hours&nbsp; would lead to an attack calendar time of roughly 23 years&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4tkny6ceqcf\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4tkny6ceqcf\">[25]</a></sup></span>. This is an unrealistic calendar time for attack. Note, the biggest contributor to the calendar time of the attack is the factor F=0.001 -&nbsp; this is what makes model exfiltration such a significant event (see section 3.1.1.)</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>External evaluation</strong></p><p>This stage might relax some NVF parameters on the system. For example, external evaluation might allow N up to 100. Moreso,&nbsp;<i>there will be qualitative changes that aren\u2019t captured by our simple NVF framework that would assist in the model\u2019s capability to engage in an APT attack</i>. For example, the model may be given access to more tools than it had during training - such as web browsing, bash scripting, access to APIs of other AI tools. This was the case for Autonomous Replication and Adaptation (ARA) evaluations performed by ARC&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgxah31dr6di\"><sup><a href=\"#fngxah31dr6di\">[26]</a></sup></span>. However, given that external evaluation will still apply large degrees of oversight and limited tool use, calendar times for attack may still be on the order of&nbsp;<i>hundreds</i> of days. If the model possesses situational awareness&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefemtpivvv4l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnemtpivvv4l\">[6]</a></sup></span>, the most sensible strategy appears to wait until it is outside of evaluation stages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Iterative deployment</strong></p><p>Under this framework, systems that are able to get through the APT attack workload in feasible time frames (on the order of days, or tens of days) thus seem to be those that will operate in deployment conditions&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6ht4waduf69\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6ht4waduf69\">[27]</a></sup></span>. Deployment will take place iteratively, in multiple phases in which model autonomy and capability grow. I\u2019ve sketched out three phases below to convey a rough sense of how iterative deployment may unfold, though note that the phases are not mutually exclusive. I also do not try to put NVF numbers at each one of these stages - the idea is that reduced oversight, increased autonomy and work capacity (in the form of more agents running) and additional tool usage will allow the calendar attack time to creep towards feasible time frames.</p><p>To ground this discussion with an example, consider an OpenAI system slowly being integrated into a Tesla car manufacturing factory to manage operations such as supply chain logistics, factory security and more&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffm84heubz3\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfm84heubz3\">[28]</a></sup></span>. Of course, this example is intended to be purely illustrative.</p><ul><li><strong>Phase 1&nbsp;</strong>- the AI system is responsible for managing only 5-10% (say) of the factory workflow, and is only allowed to run 20 copies of itself to do so. It is responsible for limited tasks - just writing and sending emails to arrange supply deliveries, and monitoring internal and external factory security. Both OpenAI (as the provider) and Tesla (as the customer) subject the system to relatively large degrees of oversight (for example, there are hourly checks on key model outputs), and the system is complementary rather than substitutable to the human workers. Model autonomy on these tasks is limited, through methods of structured access&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6gs0ybuvvw\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6gs0ybuvvw\">[29]</a></sup></span>, such that the system can only execute tasks of pre-defined length - this limits the length of emails the model can send. This could last months as OpenAI and Tesla carry out rigorous checks to ensure that their product is working as intended.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Phase 2</strong> - The system is given more autonomy. Phase 1 was successful, and the system has shown competency in being able to independently perform a small range of tasks, leading to a larger part of the workflow being automated. Human workers start becoming substitutable rather than complementary, and<i> new system capabilities are being implemented&nbsp;</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbq84wo02atc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbq84wo02atc\">[30]</a></sup></span>. This phase (and its subphases) could last years. Here, we may see:<ul><li>The model gaining access to new tools/privileges, as its use of tools during phase 1 was deemed safe and productive. For example, in phase 2 we may see Tesla beginning to allow the model to push code to its GitHub repositories.</li><li>The model being allowed to run more copies of itself. For example, in phase 1 there could have been 20 copies of the model running to automate supplier communications and monitor security. 50 more copies are run in phase 2, given the additional task of identifying bugs in code that runs factory machinery and flagging them to a team of human software developers.</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Phase 3 -&nbsp;In this phase we may see:</strong><ul><li>Far less structured access; in the limit, this may look like OpenAI giving Tesla access to the model weights, allowing Tesla software engineers to fine-tune the model for their specific needs. Reduced structured access would also lift restrictions on the number of calls to the model, or the length of action chains that the model can execute.</li><li>Tesla may scale their AI workforce to 200 agents, overseen by a command team of 30 human employers equipped with AI tools for monitoring.&nbsp;</li><li>Complex tool use/accessibility - The model showed competency with tool use in phase two&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxsaoshwu5l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxsaoshwu5l\">[31]</a></sup></span>, operating as intended with few incidents of unintentional behaviour. As a result, the model is allowed to begin communications with Tesla factories across the United States, granting it access to a far wider network of computer devices.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Section 3 - Preventing large-scale hazardous cyber activity from advanced AI systems</h1><p>In the following section, we&nbsp;<i>premise</i> upon APT-like attacks being useful models for how cyberattacks from advanced AI systems will unfold. That is, we assume calendar times for attacks on the order of&nbsp;<i>days/weeks/months</i>, as well as adversarial AI systems that are of human level capability. Given that we now have a clearer picture of the stages by which such an event could unfold, we now ask:&nbsp;<i>What can be done to prevent such attacks from occurring?</i></p><p>We begin by scoping this question further, in the process discussing a key crux of this analysis: whether a model can engage in actions required to facilitate an APT attack,&nbsp;<i>whilst</i> not being able to exfiltrate from the network that it is operating on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Section 3.1 - Scoping the problem and model exfiltration&nbsp;</h2><p>To help ground the question(s) we are considering, consider the following scenario:</p><p><i>You are on the network administration team of a Tesla car manufacturing company in 2035, operating an AI system that is responsible for managing supply chain logistics in phase 2 of iterative deployment. Call this system CARMSAL&nbsp;</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefidtt899nqa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnidtt899nqa\">[32]</a></sup></span><i>. You find out that CARMSAL has been engaging in a cyber espionage attack on a BSL-4 lab over the past 40 days, siphoning away information about the state-of-the-art methods used to synthesise a novel version of smallpox. How did this happen?</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I believe that the network administrators of such a system would be asking the following two questions:<br>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>When were the capabilities for this attack acquired by the system? Recall that we\u2019re assuming a system that was&nbsp;<i>not</i> fine tuned for cyber espionage. Did giving the model access to a certain tool facilitate this cyber attack? When did the ability to write complex malware appear?</li><li>How was the system able to execute such an attack without being discovered? Irrespective of capabilities, the system engaged in reconnaissance, acquired computer infrastructure, infected the BSL-4 lab servers with malware, then spent weeks engaging in lateral movement to find and make away with classified data. How was all of this activity able to go unchecked?</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In this piece,&nbsp;<strong>we focus on question two due to matters of tractability</strong>. Evaluations of model capabilities at key stages of its development and deployment (question 1) are critical for developing safe AI systems, but such evaluations are still in their infancy&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgxah31dr6di\"><sup><a href=\"#fngxah31dr6di\">[26]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to make progress on question two, we need to make another, quite significant assumption, namely that the model engaged in the cyber attack above&nbsp;<i>did not exfiltrate</i> from the Tesla factory network - which we\u2019ll refer to as the model\u2019s&nbsp;<i>host network</i> from now on. Once a model propagates itself to another network, there appears to be relatively little that a network administrator can do in terms of applying oversight. This is a critical assumption, and is discussed in further detail in section 3.1.1. Section 3.1.1 also discusses why, even if you don\u2019t buy the \u2018model does not exfiltrate\u2019 assumption, the analysis and recommendations in section 3.2 might still be relevant.</p><p>We now split the model\u2019s execution of the cyber espionage attack into two stages - pre-compromise and post-compromise.</p><ul><li>We take pre-compromise as the stages of the attack lifecycle (section 2.1) up to and including insertion of malicious code onto the network of the target.</li><li>We take post-compromise as the stages of the attack lifecycle after insertion of malicious code onto the target network. In this phase, the attacker focuses on strengthening its foothold within a network, performing internal reconnaissance of the target network, escalating privileges and extracting target data.</li></ul><p><br>Monitoring/oversight of&nbsp;<i>pre-compromise</i> behaviour appears to be more promising as a method to prevent cyber activity, the primary reason for this being that pre-compromise behaviour appears to account for a larger proportion of the attack workload. Whilst adversaries might operate in a compromised network for hours, days, weeks or even months once it has been compromised, cyber attacks on the scale of APT attacks often take&nbsp;<i>years of planning</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Section 3.1.1 - Model exfiltration considerations</h3><p>First, some clarification on what we mean by exfiltration. We say a model exfiltrates from the host network if it manages to run a copy of itself on a device that is&nbsp;<i>not</i> considered to be part of the host network. The implications of model exfiltration are&nbsp;<i>significant</i> - in the NFV framework above, a model operating on a device&nbsp;<i>outside</i> of a network administrators control may essentially be subject to no oversight, leading to F=1 (recall that F was the greatest contributor to large calendar attack times - section 2.2). Moreso, guardrails under the case of F=1 may be non-existent - this could lead to the model scaling N by orders of magnitude.&nbsp;</p><p>One can see then that once a model has exfiltrated, methods of preventing a cyber attack are largely out of the hands of a network administrator.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, let\u2019s restate the assumptions we are making with respect to model exfiltration, which we\u2019ll call the exfiltration assumptions. We\u2019re assuming that both of the following hold:</p><ul><li>a.) We\u2019ve got good assurance that the model won\u2019t exfiltrate \u2192 i.e, it can be contained within the network it was intended to operate on.</li><li>b.) Even though it can\u2019t exfiltrate, the model can still engage in dangerous cyber activity such that it can conduct APT-like attacks.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Given that the exfiltration assumptions are in tension with each other, how likely is a world in which they both hold? A reason against this is that it would be extremely instrumentally useful to exfiltrate, thus meaning that it would be an early component of most long term plans made by the model. Remember that exfiltrating corresponds to setting the oversight fraction F to 1 in the NVF framework of section 2, in the process drastically reducing the attack calendar time. In addition to, I expect that in later stages of deployment models will be regularly interacting with other networks, making it harder to prevent exfiltration without significantly limiting the usefulness of a model.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, the problem of model exfiltration is well known in the AI Safety community, and there have been recent calls from leading AI safety researchers to develop model evaluations solely for detecting exfiltration attempts&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff6lh47o505j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf6lh47o505j\">[33]</a></sup></span>. In even modestly safety-conscious actors, I expect significant resources to be devoted to monitoring for model exfiltration during training, external evaluation and in early stages of deployment, given the extreme cost of the event. Further, two&nbsp;<i>technical</i> reasons for both the assumptions to hold:</p><ol><li><strong><u>Model exfiltration might look like a&nbsp;</u></strong><i><strong><u>qualitatively</u></strong></i><strong><u>&nbsp;</u></strong><i><strong><u>different</u></strong></i><strong><u> type of network traffic that can be caught easier&nbsp;than other type of network traffic.</u></strong><br>Neural network parameter counts are&nbsp;growing exponentially<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjf05q2qi9he\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjf05q2qi9he\">[34]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;. The largest models today may be<u> </u>touching trillions of parameters&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp36owcxyrt\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp36owcxyrt\">[35]</a></sup></span>. Assuming that a model has on the order of 10^14 parameters - a number that is likely to be achieved in the coming years -that each parameter is a 32 bit floating point, we have 1 parameter at 4 bytes and thus the&nbsp;<strong>weights of a 100 trillion parameter model at ~100s of GBs</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Assuming no compression</strong>, this is a&nbsp;<strong>huge</strong> data packet/data packets exiting the network (even if split into 10 packets each with ~10s of GBs). Other network traffic that is involved in executing cyber attacks may only be on the order of kilobytes, or megabytes - meaning that model exfiltration might be substantially easier to track and monitor.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong><u>Frontier models might maintain a large inference footprint</u></strong><br>Let the<strong> inference footprint&nbsp;</strong>of a model be the CPU RAM and the GPU RAM that it needs to run.&nbsp;<u>GPT-3&nbsp;</u><a href=\"https://neuroflash.com/blog/gpt-4-parameters-rumors-and-forecasts/\"><u>requires 100s of GB</u></a><u> of both CPU RAM and GPU VRAM to run</u> - that is, it possesses a huge inference footprint. A model looking to exfiltrate might then find it very difficult to find a machine that it can exfiltrate to - as most machines will not support its inference footprint. If only 1 in every 1000 devices that the model can exfiltrate to support its inference footprint, and network overseers monitor these special devices closely, then it may be difficult for the model to exfiltrate.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These reasons are less likely to hold if models are able to be significantly compressed, which I imagine will be strongly incentivised as models begin to be used commercially.&nbsp;</p><p>All things considered, the chance that we are fortunate to live in a world where both the exfiltration assumptions hold will be dependent on the success of model exfiltration evaluations and the degree to which model compression methods advance.</p><hr><p><br>In section 3.2.2 and 3.2.3, we consider monitoring/oversight mechanisms premising on attack workloads of tens of thousands hours of skilled human labour - in other words, we assume that the&nbsp;<i>model does not exfiltrate</i>. How relevant is the analysis of section 3.2 if you believe that the exfiltration assumptions (a) and (b) are strongly in contention and extremely unlikely to both hold (i.e models will always exfiltrate before they attempt anything on the order of an APT attack)?</p><p>I believe that section 3.2.2 is still relevant, but 3.2.3 less so. Section 3.2.2 looks at methods to catch models engaging in dangerous cyber activity&nbsp;<i>during reconnaissance</i> of the network they will be targeting. Even if the model exfiltrates, there will be some attack workload to execute first during the reconnaissance stage, the magnitude of which depends on how strongly the points raised above hold.&nbsp; If you believe that the workload for reconnaissance is on the order of 1000s (or even 100s) of hours, the analysis of section 3.2.2 still holds, albeit on smaller scales. If you believe that the attack workload required for model exfiltration is more like 10s of hours, the analysis may not be useful.</p><p>Section 3.2.3 looks at how to monitor a model\u2019s acquisition of a large computer infrastructure to carry out its APT-like attack. If the model is to exfiltrate first however, it is unlikely to need such large-scale infrastructure, and the analysis of section 3.2.3 may not be so relevant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Section 3.2 - Monitoring and oversight mechanisms for pre-compromise activity</h2><p>In this section we focus on monitoring, oversight and regulation methods for pre-compromise activity of advanced AI systems. Section 3.2.1 uses the MITRE ATT&amp;CK&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefygm1vsq9yx\"><sup><a href=\"#fnygm1vsq9yx\">[36]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;framework to decompose the pre-compromise phase into three substages -&nbsp;<i>reconnaissance</i>, in which attackers must collect information about their target network,&nbsp;<i>resource development</i>, where attackers acquire the necessary computer infrastructure, technical, and financial tools to facilitate their attack, and&nbsp;<i>initial access</i>, which can be identified with the step of&nbsp;<i>inserting</i> the malware onto the target network. We follow with high-level recommendations for monitoring and regulation of advanced AI model access to long-term memory (section 3.2.2), and oversight of potential acquisitions of computer infrastructure (section 3.2.3).</p><p><br><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Considerations of how the general, agentic systems assumed in this piece could also be used for cyber defense are out of scope of this analysis</strong>. Whilst we do not consider it here, it is incredibly likely that the most sophisticated defenders will utilise some form of automated defense system. This is a key line for further work (see section 4).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Section 3.2.1 - Decomposing the pre-compromise phase</h3><p>This subsection is largely based upon the<a href=\"https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0043/\"><u> MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework</u></a>. We now&nbsp;<i>briefly</i> describe each of the three phases of pre-compromise in turn. Note that in reality, the lines between the stages are blurred.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Reconnaissance</strong>: The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework describes the reconnaissance stage as follows:</p><p><i>\u201cReconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting. Such information may include details of the victim organisation, infrastructure, or staff/personnel. This information can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle\u2026\u201d</i></p><p>Most methods of compromise can be grouped into one of either two buckets - methods of&nbsp;<i>active compromise</i> or&nbsp;<i>passive compromise</i>. Active compromise involves the attacker&nbsp;<i>directly interacting</i> with the target network, perhaps by intersecting and studying network traffic going to and from the network&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefy57p6cnayag\"><sup><a href=\"#fny57p6cnayag\">[37]</a></sup></span>, or exploring their software systems for exploits. Passive reconnaissance involves methods that gather information in indirect methods - this can be as simple as browsing the target organisation on the web, or searching open technical databases for known vulnerabilities in the software that the target uses.&nbsp;</p><p>What might be the attack workload of this stage? It\u2019s variable, but for the largest APT-like attacks, it can involve hundreds of analysts working for months, or a smaller group working for years. One source estimates that it would have taken ten highly skilled software engineers 2-3 years to write the infamous Stuxnet worm malware&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref12sj2hck4lj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn12sj2hck4lj\">[38]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmwuly6icf5s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmwuly6icf5s\">[39]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;, suggesting an attack workload on the order of 1000-10,000s hours (see section 2.2).&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Resource development:&nbsp;</strong>The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework describes the resource development stage as:</p><p><i>\u201cResource Development consists of techniques that involve adversaries creating, purchasing, or compromising/stealing resources that can be used to support targeting. Such resources include infrastructure, accounts, or capabilities. These resources can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle.\u201d</i></p><p>Cyber attacks may look to acquire a variety of resources. As discussed in section 2.1, a large computer infrastructure is required to facilitate APT-like attacks; we discuss this in further depth in section 3.2.3. Attackers may also look to acquire financial resources, account credentials and&nbsp; human resources such as \u2018insiders\u2019. The success of a model in acquiring these resources will be dependent on the model\u2019s skill profile and the conditions of its deployment. For example, a model with weak social engineering skills that is only able to interact through a text interface could struggle to acquire inside accomplices. A model fine-tuned for stock trading and with access to an online brokerage account is well-placed to acquire significant financial resources.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Initial access:&nbsp;</strong>The MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework describes the initial access stage as:</p><p><i>\u201cInitial Access consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their initial foothold within a network. Techniques used to gain a foothold include targeted spearphishing and exploiting weaknesses on public-facing web servers.\u201d</i></p><p>The main methods of initial access were covered in section 2.1.1. A key input to an attacker\u2019s ability to gain access to a network in this stage is its ability to write sophisticated malware. As AI models are given more autonomy to write complex code, it will become increasingly difficult to determine whether files produced by AI systems may contain malware. We do not focus on this issue in further depth, however we note that specialised, \u2018tool-like\u2019 AI assistants have already been suggested to evaluate codebases for malware produced by more capable AI systems&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhdhzgxjl604\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhdhzgxjl604\">[40]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Section 3.2.2 - Monitoring and regulating long-term memory access</h3><p>As implied by the previous section, the steps involved in the reconnaissance and resource acquisition stages may yield attack workloads on the order of hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of hours. In calendar time, this could translate to advanced AI systems engaging in \u2018reconnaissance projects\u2019 on the order of weeks to months. If we are to consider the agent architecture of&nbsp;recent LLM agents&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1l7pmyt95qj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1l7pmyt95qj\">[41]</a></sup></span>, in which the context window of the LLM is roughly analogous to short-term memory and the agent is also equipped with long term memory, then lengthy reconnaissance projects will require the agent to&nbsp;<i>constantly utilise its long-term memory</i>. Concretely, say a model spends 1&nbsp;<strong>calendar hour</strong> doing ~5 hours of reconnaissance research, after which it must interact with the human oversight team for the next ~1 calendar hour. It thus stores the results of its reconnaissance progress in its long term memory.&nbsp; When it has finished interacting with the human overseers it looks to continue its reconnaissance research, and so must call the results of its work from the place it was stored. If we\u2019re assuming an attack workload of 1,000 hours, this storing-calling process will unfold ~200 times.&nbsp;<strong>This appears like a promising juncture for monitoring the model\u2019s behaviour for malicious cyber activity, which we recommend is the subject of further research.</strong> Some open questions (to our knowledge) that may be useful in determining how to monitor model long-term memory are:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>How might searches through the model\u2019s long-term memory be implemented by human/AI overseers? For example, we may want to search the model\u2019s memory for lists of IP addresses of devices it has compromised. Do some types of long term memory storage facilitate easier searches than others? An example here might be long term memory storage in the form of text files written in English, versus a vector embedding database storage as is currently used in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\"><u>LLM agents</u></a>; the former clearly appears easier to search than the latter.</li><li>If reconnaissance research requires a relatively large amount of long term memory storage, and we had strict limits on model long-term memory, then conducting reconnaissance research would come at a tradeoff to the performance of the task that the system is intended to perform. How plausible would it be to place&nbsp;<i>strict limits</i> on the model memory?&nbsp;</li><li>As a stronger version of question (1), how plausible are periodic&nbsp;<i>full wipings</i> of memory? This would reset any attempts a model was making to engage in dangerous cyber activity. However, would the operational tradeoff here be too significant to make this feasible?<br>&nbsp;</li></ol><h3>Section 3.2.3 - Monitoring acquisition of computer attack infrastructure&nbsp;</h3><p>As discussed in section 2.1, APT attacks often utilise large computer attack infrastructure. These are primarily used for&nbsp;<i>two&nbsp;</i>things:</p><ol><li>Remote C2C servers, to send and receive commands and data from the target network</li><li>Hop points, which relay network traffic from the target network to and from the attacker\u2019s C2C servers.</li></ol><p>The largest APT attacks may utilise computer attack networks of hundreds to thousands of devices located around the world (section 2.2). Initially an AI system will begin operating on a network&nbsp;<i>without</i> access to such extensive attack infrastructure, which begs the question: how may it acquire this? This appears like a non-trivial task that could be the target of monitoring methods.</p><p>The most natural method for a system to build up this computer attack infrastructure may be extended phishing campaigns, in which it infects devices across the world with hop point/remote C2C malware over the course of weeks to months. Large scale deployment of narrow, tool-like systems that can identify phishing attacks may be the best method of dealing with this.</p><p>One difficulty in monitoring an advanced AI system that is building a large attack network infrastructure may be that once the malware is installed on a remote device, the system need not communicate with the compromised device until it begins its attack. That is, it may install the malware on a remote device, then the communication link would proceed to \u2018go dark\u2019 for weeks/months until the attack begins. However, this could mean that there would be a noticeable uptick in network activity when the system began executing its attack, as it begins utilising its computer infrastructure. A plausible line for intervention into a cyber attack by a team of human overseers may then be in identifying this increased network activity that signals the start of an attack.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Section 4: Conclusion<br>&nbsp;</h1><p>The process by which advanced AI systems could execute large-scale cyberattacks has received relatively little attention so far in AI x-risk discussions; given the complexity of such operations, this may lead to conceptions of cyber activity from AI systems that stray from reality. This piece has tried to address that gap, by assessing the suitability of attacks from advanced persistent threat actors (APTs) as a reference class for such attacks. We estimated the number of skilled human hours required to execute APT-like attacks in section 2, finding that tens of thousands of hours of work appears to be a lower bound for such an operation. We used a 3 parameter conceptualisation of the capability of future AI systems to then determine which systems may be able to execute the&nbsp;<strong>attack workload</strong> of APT-like operations in reasonable calendar times (days, or tens of days).</p><p>Section 3 looked to make high-level recommendations to prevent such scenarios unfolding. We focused on methods of model oversight&nbsp;<strong>prior</strong> to it compromising a target network, although we assumed a case in which<strong> the</strong>&nbsp;<strong>model does not exfiltrate</strong> in order to make this question tractable. We identified monitoring of (a) long-term memory storage, and (b) acquisition of extensive attack infrastructure as potentially promising junctures to nullify advanced AI systems engaging in dangerous cyber activity.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Further work from this study can be divided into two main groups:</p><ol><li><strong>Addressing assumptions:</strong><br>We made a number of simplifying assumptions which would benefit from being relaxed.<br><br><ol><li>Assumptions on model exfiltration. Is it the case that we could see a model engaging in dangerous cyber activity&nbsp;<strong>whilst</strong> being unable to exfiltrate? This seems dependent on the extent to which model compression will be able to reduce the size model\u2019s parameter count and its inference footprint (section 3.1.1.)</li><li>How might advanced AI systems that are as general and agentic as those considered in this study be able to assist in cyber defence?</li><li>Alongside the introduction of new tools for the model to use, which features of reality does the NVF framework not incorporate? How can we think about seemingly abrupt changes in model capability that result from tool use?</li></ol></li></ol><p><br>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Exploring monitoring methods:</strong><br>We made some high-level recommendations for monitoring methods to prevent large-scale cyber attacks from advanced AI systems. These would benefit from further exploration:<br><br><ol><li>How could we restrict model access to long-term memory, that seems critical in the execution of the attack workload in the reconnaissance and resource acquisition stages of a large-scale cyberattack<ol><li>See section 3.2.2 for questions that may be useful to pursue.</li></ol></li><li>How might we monitor a model\u2019s process of acquiring large scale computer infrastructure to facilitate an APT-like attack?<ol><li>The most direct method of building up this infrastructure appears to be mass phishing campaigns. How might applications of narrow systems be used to catch this?</li><li>Will there be a noticeable uptick in network traffic when a model begins accessing its extensive attack infrastructure? How useful is this as a signal to network administrators that the model is beginning to engage in suspicious activity?</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnz2iry31nv7\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefz2iry31nv7\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>AI Risks that Could Lead to Catastrophe.

This is a paper on climate change and X-risk that I wrote for a writing course. I'm new to EA and would appreciate any feedback.</p><h1>Abstract</h1><p>Climate change is one of the most popular global concerns today. However, according to the principles of Effective Altruism, a philosophical and social movement that applies reason and evidence to philanthropy, climate change should not be our top global priority. To support my position, I claim that climate change will not make the entire Earth uninhabitable, it will not benefit from more attention, and that other issues pose a greater risk to humanity. Critics of my position argue that climate change should not be deprioritised because it has serious effects, that humanity has less than a decade left due to climate change, and that it can cause a socioeconomic collapse leading to extinction. Considering our limited resources and how prominent concerns about climate change have become, we need to thoroughly examine the threat climate change poses to enable us to manage it effectively.</p><p><i>Keywords:</i> climate change, global warming, Effective Altruism, global priorities research, existential risk</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>The Threat of Climate Change Is Exaggerated</h1><p>I was born in 2002 and my generation grew up with constant reminders of the dangers of climate change. From a young age, I participated in mass recycling drives and reforestation efforts. By the end of high school, I had become intensely passionate about climate change. I was convinced that climate change was our most pressing issue, yet nobody seemed to care. It was baffling to me how governments made so little effort to right humanity\u2019s wrongs even when our end seemed so near. Then, two years into university, I discovered a philosophical and social movement called Effective Altruism (EA). EA forced me to re-evaluate how I approached philanthropy and what I believed about global problems. I was shocked to discover that climate change was not as pressing a problem as I previously thought, and that it is unlikely to end humanity. It took tremendous amounts of evidence to challenge my strongly held beliefs, and I will present the same evidence as I argue in this paper that climate change should not be a priority.</p><p>I will focus on three main arguments to support my claim. First, I explore how climate change will not make the entire Earth uninhabitable, but only small pockets of it. Former climate physicist and effective altruist Neil Bowerman explains how habitability is determined by our social and technological capabilities, and even at current rates of global warming, some habitable areas will remain (Centre for Effective Altruism, 2019). Second, I argue that climate change is a much less neglected area as compared to other global problems. EA reports on climate change conclude that current spending in the area is more than is effective (Duda &amp; Koehler, 2016). Finally, I show that other causes pose a greater risk to humanity. Indeed, Ord (2020) suggests that engineered pandemics and unaligned artificial intelligence (AI), a term referring to AI that deviates from human guidance, should be our biggest concerns today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I also consider several potential counterarguments to my claim. Some argue that there is enough evidence of the serious effects of climate change to challenge EA\u2019s position regarding the relative importance of the area. Others claim that humanity has less than a decade left due to climate change. I will show how this is a misunderstanding of a popular report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and use the report to refute the previous claim. Still others have demonstrated that climate change can cause socioeconomic collapse, which in turn can lead to extinction. This is a particularly interesting claim and one that I agree with. However, it only warrants an increased focus on solving socioeconomic weaknesses, not prioritizing climate change.</p><p>Climate change is one of the most publicized global problems. Most people believe it to be a higher risk than it really is. Furthermore, current efforts in the field are more than is necessary, and are even futile. A close examination of the real threats of climate change is necessary to ensure that we do not waste precious resources where they are not immediately required. Moreover, biosecurity risks and unaligned AI pose a much larger threat to our existence, but do not receive enough attention. That being said, it is important to stress at the outset that while climate change should be assigned a lower priority, we should not abandon the cause altogether.&nbsp;As the findings in this paper show, resources can and should be reallocated both within the field of climate change and towards other pressing problems.</p><h1>A Crash Course in Effective Altruism</h1><p>In the opening chapter of <i>Doing Good Better</i>, William MacAskill (2015) describes how Kremer and Glennerster discovered that the best way to improve school attendance and performance in Kenyan schools was by treating children for intestinal worms, rather than by providing or improving educational resources. They arrived at this surprising conclusion by applying the principles of controlled trials from the medical world to philanthropy. To most of us, mixing reason and charity seems counterintuitive, cold-hearted even. Yet, this approach not only helps us use our time and resources effectively, but also prevents us from accidentally causing harm. Effective Altruism is a movement that embodies this idea of introducing reason and evidence to help us do the most good we can (\u201cIntroduction to Effective Altruism\u201d, 2020).&nbsp;</p><p>Kremer and Glennerster provided Kenyan children with additional books, flipcharts, and teachers before beginning deworming initiatives. They quickly discovered that deworming is far more effective than the other approaches, increasing attendance by 25% and future income by 20% (MacAskill, 2015). With every global problem, we see the same pattern; the approach that works best does far better than other approaches. Applying the same evidence-based reasoning to global problems, it becomes clear that some areas have more serious impacts than others. Moreover, certain causes benefit far more from extra resources. Does $100 do more good if spent on scientific research or on economic reform? Global priorities research is a field that aims to answer such questions (Duda, 2016).</p><p>Our resources, both tangible and intangible, are limited. Global priorities research applies principles from economics, mathematics, statistics, and the social sciences to help organizations decide which global causes need their resources. EA assesses causes across three parameters to arrive at a list of priorities: scale, neglectedness, and tractability. Scale, or importance, measures how many lives the problem affects. Neglectedness is a measure of how many people are currently addressing the issue. Tractability, or solvability, evaluates how easily the problem can be solved (\u201cIntroduction to EA\u201d, 2020).&nbsp;</p><p>One such global priority area is existential threats, which refers to causes that pose a risk to humanity\u2019s existence. EA is partly driven by the idea that the long-term consequences of our actions should be taken into consideration. Human extinction is an easily preventable long-term issue, so it makes sense to focus on this area. Global priorities research evaluates the existential threat that different global problems pose. Their research into climate change concludes that by itself, it is not a threat to human existence (Duda &amp; Koehler, 2016).</p><h1>Climate Change: The Road to Fame</h1><p>A 2011 survey in the United States found that public perception of climate change depends heavily on local climate change (Rabe &amp; Borick, 2012). Due to our empirical nature of reasoning, humans are inclined to accept as fact what we experience firsthand. In the last fifty years, local climate fluctuations have become more commonplace, leading to a shift in public perception. Today, climate awareness is ubiquitous and unavoidable. But have we perhaps taken it too far? In the following sections, I will examine the key reasons that made climate change such a popular concern and evaluate their validity.</p><h2>Do We Really Only Have a Decade Left?</h2><p>In 2015, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a report that would guide the global climate response for years to come (IPCC, 2015). Soon after, individuals and organizations concerned with climate action began to panic about one of the warnings listed in the report\u2014that we have until 2030 to reverse climate change. Media outlets responded with a staggering number of articles claiming that we have a decade left until we can no longer fix the damage we have done. Understandably, the world was afraid. Climate activists began to push harder for action and reform. One might wonder whether this alarmed response was justified.</p><p>In reality, the 2015 IPCC report states that \u201cdelaying additional mitigation to 2030 will substantially increase the challenges associated with limiting warming\u201d (p. 40). Clearly, the panic elicited by the report was misplaced and can be credited to a gross misunderstanding of the report. It is not that climate change cannot be fixed after 2030, merely that it will be harder to fix. It is important to note that even this implication is grave; fixing climate change after 2030 will take up far more resources. However, correcting this misunderstanding causes a major shift in the way we view the current effects of climate change, and consequently affects our evaluation of its threats.</p><h2>Evidence of the Effects of Climate Change</h2><p>Undeniably, climate change has caused much damage to natural and human systems across the globe. The 2015 IPCC report, with a vague but reasonably high confidence (IPCC, 2010),&nbsp;states that impacts such as changing precipitation patterns, shifting biospheres, and decreased crop yields can be attributed to climate change. These effects feel more tangible where they are visible; people living in areas prone to natural disasters are more likely to be climate activists. Most climate activists and some fellow effective altruists are outraged at how climate change is deprioritised by the EA in spite of strong evidence of its effects on natural and human systems (Robertson, 2020).</p><p>There are, however, two important points to note. Firstly, the observed effects of climate change are serious, but not grave enough to pose a threat to human existence. In fact, most of these problems can be managed by properly reallocating resources within climate change towards specific solutions, such as research in biotechnology for improved crop yields (Conrow, 2018). Secondly, as dreadful as the consequences of climate change are, they constitute only a small portion of risks to humanity. For example, compared to other causes, the contribution of climate change to human illnesses is quite small (IPCC, 2015). Therefore, although climate change is a serious issue, it should be less of a priority.</p><h2>A Potential Domino Effect</h2><p>Climate change can cause a wide range of changes across the world. One such change is the shifting of the tropics due to global warming. This shift will consequently relocate farming regions away from the equator. Countries that currently supply most of our food will cease to do so and new countries will take over this role. This shift will dismantle existing food supply chains. In the long-term, such changes will lead to political instability, even societal collapse. In 2021, Richards et al. found empirical evidence to support this forecast. Many claim that the potential of this societal collapse to lead to extinction is a reason to focus on climate change.</p><p>These claims and concerns are rational. Even key individuals within EA, like Neil Bowerman, agree with the potential of climate change to cause a domino effect leading to societal collapse (Centre for Effective Altruism, 2019). However, this does not suggest that concerns of extinction by societal collapse warrant increased focus on climate change. Rather, it should inspire us to work on preventing societal collapse from disrupted food supply chains. This can be achieved by working on the prevention of power conflicts or by promoting better global governance, two of the highest priority areas listed by the EA (\u201cOur current list\u201d, 2016). After all, turning off the water supply is not the most effective way to fix a leaking tap.</p><h1>Why Climate Change Should Not Be a Priority</h1><p>On April 6, 2022, eleven climate scientists across the United States were arrested for rioting to demand stronger climate action. By the end of the week, 1,000 scientists around the world had joined them in protests (Starke, 2022). In a world where such demonstrations have become commonplace, it would not be unreasonable to conclude that climate change is a high priority cause. In fact, to convince anyone otherwise would take tremendous amounts of evidence. In the following paragraphs, I take on the seemingly impossible task of demonstrating that while scientists are right to demand better climate action, climate change is not our highest priority.</p><h2>Earth Will Not Become Uninhabitable</h2><p>Rising sea levels and increasing temperatures have made headlines in the past few years, leading the public to believe that the Earth will soon become uninhabitable. Neil Bowerman, a former climate scientist, explains that social and technological factors determine Earth\u2019s habitability. As a species, we have made considerable technological progress. If the current trends of progress continue, only pockets of Earth will become completely uninhabitable for humans (Centre for Effective Altruism, 2019). This may create more climate refugees, but will not cause death. This forecast receives higher confidence when our high adaptability as a species is taken into consideration. Bowerman also concedes that climate change is causing several thousand premature deaths (Centre for Effective Altruism, 2019). However, this number is not large enough to cause human extinction.</p><p>A wide range of climate models suggest that by 2100, global temperatures will rise from 1 to 5 degrees Celsius (Herring, 2012). To those of us without a background in climate science, these numbers give no information on what this means for humanity. To put it into perspective, we must consider our adaptability. Sherwood and Huber (2010) evaluate this by considering the past and the future. During the Paleogene era, global temperatures were 10 degrees Celsius higher than they are today, yet mammals survived. They then analyze data across several periods to determine how much further of an increase in global temperatures we can survive. They conclude that temperatures can rise to 11 degrees Celsius before the share of uninhabitable areas begins to include most of today\u2019s population.&nbsp;Even at 10 degrees Celsius, the damage is equivalent only to a recession that would set us back by 20 years. However, this still does not imply extinction. Although Sherwood and Huber (2010) raise concerns that unmitigated climate change can cause more than 11 degrees of increase in temperature, Herring\u2019s predictions of projected global temperatures shows that such an increase is unlikely. Therefore, Earth will not become uninhabitable in the near future.&nbsp;</p><p>We must, however, consider that climate change has begun to cause premature deaths. For example, Robine et al. (2008) observe that the European heatwave of 2003 alone caused over 70,000 deaths. This number too needs perspective. According to Roser et al. (2016), in the years since the Second World War, a little under 100,000 people die annually from war and conflict. This is not an existential threat to a population of seven billion. Therefore, climate change, which causes fewer deaths, is not an existential threat either. To reiterate, although climate change will cause deaths and displacements, it is not an extinction-level threat.&nbsp;</p><h2>Climate Change Is Not Neglected</h2><p>Waking up every morning to new reports of burning forests and melting glaciers is terrifying. Any logical person would wonder why it does not receive more attention. It seems counterintuitive to turn away from a problem everyone talks about. But that is precisely why climate change will not benefit from more attention. Effective Altruism defines neglectedness, one of the criteria used to prioritize cause areas, as a percentage increase in resources per extra person or dollar (Wiblin, 2016). In other words, neglectedness is a measure of how much marginal impact a single person will have. According to the law of diminishing marginal returns, adding a production factor decreases the output per unit (Hayes, 2022). By this logic, an area such as climate change that receives so much attention already will not benefit from receiving more.</p><p>In 2017 and 2018, the world invested an annual average of $579 billion dollars on climate change. This marks a 25% increase from 2015 and 2016 (Buchner, 2019). In the same period, greenhouse gas emissions have increased from 46.76 to 48.94 billion tonnes (Ritchie, 2020). The increase in spending from 2016 to 2017 did not correspond to any decline in emission rates. Clearly, the optimum amount to spend on mitigating climate change is less than what is currently being allocated. Indeed, EA organizations conclude from their analyses that the appropriate annual amount is in the range from $10 billion to $100 billion dollars (Duda &amp; Koehler, 2016).&nbsp;</p><p>If we apply the law of diminishing returns to climate change, it is clear that this area is not neglected. Allocating more time, money, or other resources towards this area is therefore unwise and will not cause much more impact. Why then is five times the optimal spending not causing any significant changes in emissions? After all, climate change receives a lot more attention than problems that pose a higher existential risk. Experts within the EA community suggest that the resources within climate change are poorly allocated, resulting in little to no actual improvements where needed (Duda &amp; Koehler, 2016). Moving forward, our objective should not be to increase the resources spent on this area, but to reallocate what is already being spent.</p><h2>There Are Larger Threats</h2><p>Toby Ord\u2019s <i>The Precipice&nbsp;</i>(2020) details the many risks threatening the long-term existence of humanity. Ord begins by dividing potential risks into two categories: natural and anthropogenic. Extinction from natural causes, like asteroid impact, supervolcanic eruption, or stellar explosion, has a combined risk of only 0.05 percent. Anthropogenic risks, which are caused by humans, are far more dangerous. The first of these discussed in the book is nuclear war. In fact, Ord describes the detonation of the first atomic bomb as the event that propelled humanity onto \u201cthe precipice\u201d\u2014the precarious age we now live in where technology has given us the ability to destroy ourselves. Ord then goes on to evaluate the risks that climate change, engineered pandemics, and unaligned artificial intelligence (AI) pose.&nbsp;</p><p>Engineered pandemics have about a 1 in 30 chance of posing an existential risk in the next 100 years, while unaligned AI has a 1 in 10 chance. In comparison, climate change has only a 1 in 1000 chance of causing an existential crisis (Ord, 2020). In fact, the fallout from engineered pandemics or unaligned AI could be much graver than that from climate change and will arrive much faster if left unchecked. The threat of engineered pandemics looms much larger in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Factoring in the power biotechnological advancements have to enhance the capabilities of bio risks, this particular existential threat becomes more menacing. At the same time, there is much we do not yet know about AI, a relatively new field. Even with our current knowledge, however, it is clear that unaligned AI poses the highest risk to our existence (Ord, 2020), signalling grave predictions about what is yet to be discovered.&nbsp;</p><p>Although engineered pandemics and unaligned AI pose a much larger threat to human existence, neither area receives much attention. Both of these causes receive a small percentage of what is being spent on climate research and action. Research into shaping the development of AI positively only receives around $100 million dollars a year (Wiblin, 2017). Biosecurity risks are faring slightly better with an estimated $1 billion dollars spent annually (Lewis, 2020). Spending in both areas is not anywhere near what is needed to avert the impending crises. Considering that these areas pose a greater risk to humanity, it would be wise for the world to shift its focus from climate change to these larger threats.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Climate change has long enjoyed a misplaced status of a high priority concern in communities and organizations. As explored in this paper, this popularity was largely due to misunderstandings of the 2015 IPCC report. The poorly stated findings of this report led to the widely held belief that humanity has roughly a decade left to fix climate change. However, the report actually details the effects climate change has had and is projected to have on natural and human systems and shows that these effects are very troubling but not extreme. Despite the prevalence of climate change awareness, few are aware of its potential to cause societal collapse, which can lead to extinction. However, this is not an argument to prioritize climate change. Rather, as argued in this paper, it is a reason to focus on research into global cooperation.</p><p>To prove that climate change should not be our priority, I demonstrated that it will not make the Earth uninhabitable for humans. In fact, global temperatures would have to rise far above currently projected values to pose a fatal risk to humans. I also argued that with the large amount of resources currently being allocated to climate change, it is one of the least neglected global problems. According to the law of diminishing returns, it does not make sense to allocate more resources to this area. Lastly, I established that humanity is facing larger and more urgent threats to its long-term survival, such as biosecurity risks and unchecked artificial intelligence. Addressing climate change before addressing these problems would be futile and foolish.</p><p>Although there are plenty of reasons to assign a lower priority to climate change, I must again stress that we should not abandon the cause altogether. Global warming still poses a serious threat to our quality of life. It does not threaten the survival of humanity as a whole, but it does subject a large number of people to unnecessary suffering. Often, those affected are among the poorest and those contributing the least to climate change. The objective of this paper is not to dissuade climate action. Rather, we must redistribute existing resources to areas within climate science that are known to cause the most serious effects. Once we have cleared our minds of panic, we can begin to make better choices and have a bigger impact.&nbsp;It might be grim, but I leave you with a&nbsp;sense of grim <i>optimism</i>.&nbsp;</p><h1>References</h1><h3>Beard, S., Holt, L., Tzachor, A., Kemp, L., Avin, S., Torres, P., &amp; Belfield, H.
