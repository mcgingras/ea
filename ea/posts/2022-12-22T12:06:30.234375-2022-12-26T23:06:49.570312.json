Per estensione, \u201ceffettuare un triage\u201d pu\u00f2 anche indicare decidere come razionare risorse che non sono sufficienti. L\u2019episodio parla del triage come di un fenomeno raro \u2013 l\u2019episodio fa quasi credere che prima dell\u2019uragano Katrina negli Stati Uniti i protocolli di triage non venissero presi molto sul serio \u2013 ma il triage non lo \u00e8 affatto. Effettuiamo un triage ogni volta che prendiamo una decisione.</p><hr><p>Le storie in \u201cPlaying God\u201d [\u201cgiocare a fare Dio\u201d] sono intense, soprattutto quella dell\u2019ospedale di New Orleans che piomba nel caos dopo qualche giorno senza elettricit\u00e0 durante l\u2019uragano Katrina. Nel suo libro <a href=\"https://www.amazon.it/Five-Days-Memorial-Storm-Ravaged-Hospital/dp/0307718972/\"><i><u>Five Days At Memorial</u></i></a>, Sheri Fink del New York Times racconta di quegli eventi e i dettagli fanno chiudere lo stomaco. Dopo aver evacuato le unit\u00e0 di terapia intensiva, il personale dell\u2019ospedale \u00e8 costretto a fare una graduatoria dei pazienti rimasti. Con gli ascensori fuori uso spostare i pazienti \u00e8 sfiancante e gli elicotteri e le barche passano di rado. Le fogne si stanno riversando nell\u2019ospedale e il caldo estremo sta provocando convulsioni in alcuni pazienti.</p><p>Nel frattempo, in televisione, il personale ascolta resoconti esagerati di saccheggi e caos in citt\u00e0. Pensando di non avere altra scelta, alcuni cominciano a pensare che l\u2019eutanasia sia la scelta pi\u00f9 caritatevole per i pazienti pi\u00f9 gravi (e per quelli pi\u00f9 difficili da evacuare). Viene suggerito che alcuni pazienti abbiano in effetti ricevuto l\u2019eutanasia, anche se nessuno \u00e8 mai stato accusato formalmente. Al danno si aggiunge la beffa, perch\u00e9 questa presunta eutanasia sarebbe avvenuta lo stesso giorno in cui i mezzi di soccorso sarebbero poi tornati.</p><p>Il punto centrale di questa storia \u00e8 che arrendersi alla logica del triage ha portato il personale dell\u2019ospedale su una strada pericolosa culminata nel \u201cplaying God\u201d (\u201cgiocare a fare Dio\u201d). L\u2019episodio poi illustra diversi modi di formalizzare protocolli di triage, in modo da evitare che le persone debbano affidarsi esclusivamente al loro giudizio in momenti critici. (Viene discusso anche il triage utilitaristico e non \u00e8 difficile immaginare gli autori che ne parlano turandosi il naso.) Spesso sono gli scrupoli nei confronti della coscienza del personale sanitario a ricevere pi\u00f9 attenzione, anche se nessuno ammette quanto questo sia egoista. In generale, il triage viene presentato in modo molto sgradevole, come se le persone costrette a prendere queste decisioni fossero colpevoli di essere finite in quella situazione.</p><p>Ma \u00e8 l\u2019ultima storia dell\u2019episodio che mi ha spinta a scrivere questo articolo. Sheri Fink, la giornalista ospite del programma, parla di Natalie, una donna che aveva incontrato in un ospedale americano di emergenza ad Haiti. Natalie era un\u2019affascinante donna di mezza et\u00e0 che era scampata per un soffio alla morte. Quando venne il terremoto, lei si trovava in ospedale per difficolt\u00e0 respiratorie, ma tutta la sua famiglia era a casa quando questa croll\u00f2 e li uccise tutti. Nathalie cercava di farsi coraggio, era contenta di essere ancora viva ed era raggiante di gratitudine per le cure che aveva ricevuto. Ma c\u2019era un problema. Nathalie aveva bisogno di ossigeno e l\u2019ospedale (anzi, l\u2019intero paese) non ne aveva abbastanza da distribuire. Poich\u00e9 soffriva di insufficienza cardiaca, il personale addetto al triage aveva deciso che non avrebbe ricevuto altro ossigeno e che sarebbe dovuta tornare in un ospedale di Haiti, dove probabilmente sarebbe morta. Fink fa notare mestamente che l\u2019infermiera che aveva preso la decisione non aveva mai conosciuto Nathalie, come se questo facesse una qualche differenza.</p><p>Fink \u00e8 con lei sull\u2019ambulanza che la porta al nuovo ospedale, dove Nathalie tossisce, sputa e non riceve l\u2019ossigeno di cui avrebbe bisogno. Il cuore di Fink \u00e8 a pezzi, ma quando Nathalie arriva all\u2019ospedale di Haiti, un dottore molto in gamba fa il possibile per aspirarle il liquido nei polmoni e riesce a scongiurare la crisi senza bisogno di altro ossigeno.</p><p>Questa storia rafforza per Fink la fantasia che non si \u00e8 mai obbligati a scegliere, che accettare di dover scegliere \u00e8 gi\u00e0 andare troppo oltre. Fink fu cos\u00ec colpita dalla storia di Nathalie che la aiut\u00f2 a ottenere un visto umanitario per venire negli Stati Uniti. Si scopr\u00ec che Nathalie aveva bisogno di un trapianto cardiaco e mor\u00ec prima che fosse possibile trovarle un cuore. Ma, dice Fink, Nathalie era stata una gioia per chiunque l\u2019avesse conosciuta in ospedale, e aveva anche organizzato una colletta per i pazienti che erano rimasti ad Haiti. Quindi, chi erano i medici per affermare che non meritava tutto l\u2019aiuto possibile?</p><p>Questa, ovviamente, \u00e8 la domanda sbagliata. \u00c8 ovvio che Nathalie meritava ogni aiuto possibile. Cos\u00ec come nessuno merita di soffrire di un\u2019insufficienza cardiaca. Ma meritava l\u2019ossigeno pi\u00f9 di tutti gli altri pazienti dell\u2019ospedale che ne avevano bisogno? No. Il tempo che Nathalie aveva passato in vita valeva di pi\u00f9 del tempo, di gran lunga maggiore, che i medici avevano dedicato ad altri pazienti somministrando con attenzione l\u2019ossigeno? Assolutamente no.</p><p>L\u2019episodio non prende nemmeno in considerazione i pazienti che hanno beneficiato del triage. Gli autori non ci provano neanche a determinare quanti pazienti si sono salvati grazie alle decisioni difficili, e fondamentali, prese dal personale. Non si parla nemmeno di chi <i>avrebbe dovuto morire </i>al posto di Nathalie in quella situazione: qualcuno con ancora molti anni di vita davanti? Due persone che si sarebbero potute salvare con la stessa quantit\u00e0 di ossigeno? L\u2019unica cosa che \u00e8 presente \u00e8 la negazione del fatto che qualcuno sarebbe dovuto morire in ogni caso. Non c\u2019\u00e8 gratitudine per le vite salvate, solo <a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoria_del_prospetto#:~:text=L'avversione%20alle%20perdite%3A%20per,motivazione%20a%20realizzare%20un%20guadagno.\"><u>avversione alla perdita</u></a>. Fink non parla del fatto che probabilmente, se avesse conosciuto gli altri pazienti, avrebbe voluto che anche loro non morissero. N\u00e9, ovviamente, del fatto che le persone sono importanti, che tu le conosca o meno.</p><p>Prendere decisioni migliori in un processo di triage consapevole non \u00e8 \u201cgiocare a fare Dio\u201d pi\u00f9 di quanto lo sia ignorare allegramente la responsabilit\u00e0 delle conseguenze delle nostre azioni. Entrambe queste scelte sono <i>scelte </i>che portano alla sopravvivenza o alla morte di qualcuno. L\u2019unica differenza \u00e8 che la persona che usa il triage ha una possibilit\u00e0 di riflettere su come migliorare il risultato finale. Una persona che soffre perch\u00e9 non riceve risorse necessarie non \u00e8 meno importante solo perch\u00e9 tu, personalmente, non la vedi. Quando Fink vide Nathalie soffrire, avrebbe dovuto prendere coscienza della gravit\u00e0 della situazione \u2013 sia per Nathalie che per quelli che hanno ricevuto l\u2019ossigeno.</p><p>Mi rendo conto che \u00e8 difficile, e che d\u2019istinto ci preoccuperemo sempre di pi\u00f9 per le persone che vediamo che per quelle che non vediamo. Non c\u2019\u00e8 nulla di male nei sentimenti che Fink prova per Nathalie, anzi, sono una componente essenziale della compassione. Ma dovremmo provare molta vergogna nel lasciar soffrire e morire molte pi\u00f9 persone perch\u00e9 non riusciamo a guardare oltre ai nostri sentimenti. \u00c8 il genere di <a href=\"https://www.amazon.it/Contro-lempatia-Paul-Bloom/dp/8898094507\"><u>empatia superficiale criticata da Paul Bloom</u></a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54340#.V7_XV7V8bWQ\"><u>Milioni di persone nel mondo muoiono per cause che si potrebbero facilmente prevenire.</u></a> Perch\u00e9 dovrebbe fare differenza il fatto che non sono davanti a noi?

Ma quando tutti noi altri parliamo di razionalit\u00e0, ne parliamo principalmente in termini astratti.</p><p>Ad esempio,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGCoVF3YvM\">questo</a> video \u00e8 stato apprezzato da molti per essere accessibile rispetto ad altri. E in effetti azzecca molte cose: ripete e pone l\u2019accento sul fatto che l\u2019evidenza scientifica da sola non genera probabilit\u00e0, ma dovrebbe essere usata solo per aggiornare stime precedenti. Del resto passa anche met\u00e0 del tempo a mostrare annotazioni matematiche comprensibili a non pi\u00f9 del 3% della popolazione. Con ogni probabilit\u00e0, alla maggior parte della gente rimarr\u00e0 \u201cimpresso\u201d solo quell\u2019unico esempio che usa. Eppure questo video usa questo esempio come nient\u2019altro che un modo per rendere comprensibile la spiegazione in astratto.</p><p>Per me \u00e8 un errore. Sono convinto che un video con quattro o cinque esempi concreti, meglio se divertenti o attraenti, di come applicare il teorema di Bayes lascerebbe un\u2019impressione molto pi\u00f9 duratura sulla maggior parte delle persone.&nbsp;</p><p>Uno stile di comunicazione esigente come il nostro prevede correttamente che, in media, i membri della comunit\u00e0 di LessWrong sono pi\u00f9 intelligenti, pi\u00f9 istruiti nelle materie scientifiche e pi\u00f9 giovani rispetto al resto della popolazione. Dobbiamo esserlo per poter anche solo far parte della setta! Questo ci rende omogenei ed \u00e8 probabilmente il motivo principale per cui far parte di LessWrong \u00e8 un po\u2019 come far parte di una trib\u00f9. Soddisfacente a livello emotivo, ma il risultato \u00e8 che il resto del mondo \u00e8 lasciato in balia di pessime decisioni.

In realt\u00e0 non ricordo l\u2019ultima volta in cui \u00e8 successo davvero (anche se sono sicuro che sia successo, l\u2019anno scorso o gi\u00f9 di l\u00ec). Ma nell\u2019ultimo mese, diciamo, stavo facendo una passeggiata e ho visto una station wagon parcheggiata nel vialetto di una villetta con il bagagliaio spalancato e l\u2019interno della macchina accessibile a chiunque. Ho controllato per vedere se stessero portando fuori dei pacchi, ma non era cos\u00ec. Mi sono guardato attorno per vedere se qualcuno stesse facendo qualcosa con la macchina. E alla fine sono andato alla porta d\u2019ingresso, ho bussato e ho suonato il campanello. E s\u00ec, il bagagliaio era rimasto aperto per sbaglio.</p><p>In altre circostanze questo sarebbe stato un semplice gesto altruista, segno di autentica preoccupazione per il benessere del prossimo o di senso di colpa per non avere, in caso, fatto nulla, o anche il desiderio di mostrarsi affidabile agli altri o a se stessi, oppure segno del piacere che si ricava dall\u2019altruismo. Mi sembrano tra l\u2019altro tutti motivi perfettamente leciti. Forse premierei di pi\u00f9 il primo, ma di sicuro non penalizzerei gli altri; l\u2019importante \u00e8 che le persone si aiutino a vicenda.&nbsp;</p><p>Nel mio caso, per\u00f2, dal momento che lavoro nel settore non-profit, mi viene da chiedermi se non avrei potuto usare meglio quei sessanta secondi in modo pi\u00f9&nbsp;<i>specializzato</i> per portare maggiori benefici al prossimo. Ovvero: considerate tutte le cose che sostengo di credere, posso davvero sostenere che questo sia il&nbsp;<i>miglior&nbsp;</i>uso del mio tempo?</p><p>La risposta pi\u00f9 ovvia \u2013 o forse la razionalizzazione pi\u00f9 ovvia \u2013 \u00e8 che un gesto di altruismo come questo aiuta a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion\"><u>ricaricare la mia forza di volont\u00e0</u></a> in modo molto pi\u00f9 efficace rispetto ad ascoltare la musica, ad esempio. Io dubito anche della mia capacit\u00e0 di essere altruista&nbsp;<i>solo&nbsp;</i>in teoria. Ho il sospetto che se cominciassi a ignorare i problemi intorno a me il mio altruismo comincerebbe a svanire. Non mi sono mai spinto al punto di metterlo alla prova, non mi sembra che ne valga la pena. Ma se questa \u00e8 la migliore giustificazione che sono in grado di trovare, allora non sto davvero giustificando una buona azione, no? Quelli che ho elencato sono tutti benefici per me.&nbsp;</p><p>Del resto, chi ha detto che&nbsp;<i>stavo&nbsp;</i>giustificando quell\u2019azione come buona azione altruista? \u00c8 una buona azione&nbsp;<i>egoista</i>. Se mi aiuta a ricaricare la mia forza di volont\u00e0, o a rimanere altruista, allora ci sono benefici indiretti per gli altri (almeno credo). Ovviamente potreste dirmi che non vi fidate di azioni egoiste che come \u201csecondo fine\u201d hanno quello di giovare al prossimo; ma a quel punto io potrei ribattere che, seguendo la stessa linea di pensiero, bisognerebbe analizzare direttamente la buona azione originaria piuttosto che il&nbsp;<i>suo&nbsp;</i>presunto secondo fine.</p><p>Posso sfangarmela cos\u00ec? Nel senso, posso davvero farla franca chiamandola \u201cbuona azione egoista\u201d e derivarne una ricarica di forza di volont\u00e0 invece che un senso di colpa per il mio egoismo? A quanto pare posso. Sono sorpreso anch\u2019io che funzioni, eppure \u00e8 cos\u00ec. Fintanto che busso alla porta per dire al proprietario dell\u2019auto che ha il bagagliaio aperto, e fintanto che lui mi dice \u201cgrazie!\u201d, il mio cervello sente di aver fatto la sua bellissima buona azione quotidiana.&nbsp;</p><p>Ovviamente per voi potrebbe essere diverso. Il problema dell\u2019elaborare strategie per recuperare forza di volont\u00e0 \u00e8 che non tutte sono efficaci per chiunque.

Se l\u2019importante per voi \u00e8 lo status sociale, tenete separato anche quello!</p><p>Se dovessi dare consigli a un nuovo ricco che si approccia alla beneficenza, sarebbero all\u2019incirca questi:</p><ul><li>Per ottenere una calda sensazione di aver fatto del bene nel petto, trovate una donna che lavora sodo ma \u00e8 comunque sulla soglia di povert\u00e0, e che sta per lasciare l\u2019universit\u00e0 perch\u00e9 al marito hanno ridotto le ore di lavoro. A quel punto inviatele personalmente (ma anonimamente) un assegno di 10.000\u20ac. Ripetere a piacere.</li><li>Per ottenere prestigio tra i vostri amici, donate 100.000\u20ac all\u2019X Prize pi\u00f9 figo del momento o a qualunque organizzazione benefica che offra il massimo del prestigio al prezzo pi\u00f9 vantaggioso. Dategli una grande importanza, partecipate ai loro eventi stampa e vantatevene per i prossimi cinque anni.</li><li>Poi, freddi e calcolatori, liberi da&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/05/scope_insensiti.html\"><u>insensibilit\u00e0 quantitativa</u></a> o&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambiguity_aversion\"><u>avversione per l\u2019ambiguit\u00e0</u></a>, senza preoccuparvi di status sociale o buoni sentimenti, con davanti un programma per convertire i risultati in utilon e che esprima l\u2019incertezza in probabilit\u00e0 percentuali, trovate l\u2019organizzazione benefica che vi possa dare il maggior numero possibile di utilon per dollari. Donatele la cifra che volevate dare in beneficenza fino a quando l\u2019efficienza marginale non scende sotto il valore di quella della prossima organizzazione.</li></ul><p>Consiglierei anche a questo ipotetico miliardario di fare in modo che ci\u00f2 che spender\u00e0 in utilon sia almeno, diciamo, 20 volte ci\u00f2 che spender\u00e0 in sensazioni che scaldano il cuore. Un costo di struttura del 5% per rimanere altruisti mi pare pi\u00f9 che ragionevole e, in quanto vostro giudice imparziale, non avrei alcun problema a&nbsp;<i>difendere&nbsp;</i>quella calda sensazione di fronte a un moltiplicatore cos\u00ec grande. A condizione che il primo gesto caldo e coccoloso sia utile e non nocivo.</p><p>(Ottenere&nbsp;<i>prestigio sociale&nbsp;</i>mi sembra del tutto scollegato dall\u2019altruismo. Se ricevete maggiore ammirazione dai vostri amici donando a un X Prize piuttosto che comprando un motoscafo per lo stesso prezzo, allora non avete motivo di comprare quel motoscafo. Basta che inseriate quella somma sotto la voce \u201cfare colpo sugli amici\u201d e che vi ricordiate che non \u00e8 la voce \u201caltruismo\u201d.)</p><p>Ma il succo del discorso \u00e8 che comprare queste tre cose \u2013 calda sensazione di piacere, prestigio sociale e utilon \u2013 pu\u00f2 essere fatto in modo molto pi\u00f9 efficiente se le comprate&nbsp;<i>separatamente,&nbsp;</i>in modo da ottimizzare una cosa alla volta. Firmare un assegno da 10 milioni di dollari per un\u2019organizzazione che combatte il cancro al seno, per quanto sia di gran lunga pi\u00f9 lodevole che spendere quei 10 milioni in, boh, feste o qualcos\u2019altro, non vi dar\u00e0&nbsp;<i>nemmeno lontanamente&nbsp;</i>quella sensazione di euforia concentrata che vi darebbe l\u2019essere presenti di persona quando cambiate la vita di una sola persona. Non \u00e8 nemmeno un grande argomento di conversazione alle feste nel modo in cui lo sarebbe donare a qualcosa di figo come un X Prize \u2013 forse guadagnereste un cenno di approvazione da parte degli altri ricchi presenti. Se poi avete deciso di fare a meno di prestigio sociale e calde sensazioni di felicit\u00e0, allora avete a disposizione almeno&nbsp;<i>un migliaio&nbsp;</i>di non-profit al momento trascurate che con 10 milioni di dollari vi frutterebbero&nbsp;<i>ordini di grandezza in pi\u00f9&nbsp;</i>di utilon. Se cercate di ottimizzare i vostri sforzi per soddisfare tutti e tre questi criteri in una volta sola, finirete per far s\u00ec che non ce ne sar\u00e0 nessuno ottimizzato a dovere, solo vaghi tentativi in tutte e tre le direzioni.</p><p>Ovviamente, se non siete milionari o miliardari, allora non potrete essere cos\u00ec tanto&nbsp;<i>efficienti</i>, non potete cos\u00ec facilmente comprare cose all\u2019ingrosso. Ma il mio consiglio in ogni caso \u00e8: se siete alla ricerca di qualcosa che vi scaldi il cuore, trovate una non-profit relativamente&nbsp;<i>economica</i> che vi permetta di donare in modo appariscente, meglio se direttamente e di persona. Fate volontariato alla mensa dei poveri. In alternativa potete ottenere quella sensazione di calore mantenendo aperta la porta alle vecchiette. Sar\u00e0 quello a essere&nbsp;<i>legittimato&nbsp;</i>dall\u2019impegno che metterete nel comprare utilon, ma non&nbsp;<i>confondetelo&nbsp;</i>con il comprare utilon. Quanto al prestigio, probabilmente spenderete meno per ottenerlo comprandovi dei bei vestiti.</p><p>E per quanto riguarda il comprare utilon in valore atteso?

Prendendo per buono che l\u2019intenzione dei partecipanti fosse davvero quella di salvare quanti pi\u00f9 uccelli possibile, avrebbero dovuto valutare allo stesso modo ognuna di quelle vite.

L\u2019euristica della rappresentativit\u00e0 descrive la tendenza degli esseri umani a immaginare un esempio comune e semplice del problema che viene presentato loro piuttosto che una rappresentazione che includa tutti i dettagli del problema in questione, cosa spesso molto complessa. Come tutte le euristiche, pu\u00f2 essere una scorciatoia mentale molto comoda, dal momento che restringe i problemi a una dimensione pi\u00f9 comoda da gestire, semplificando in questo modo gli sforzi necessari per prendere decisioni ed elaborare le informazioni.&nbsp;</p><p>Tuttavia, in molte situazioni questo meccanismo pu\u00f2 non essere adeguato, come ci dimostra l\u2019esempio dello studio che abbiamo appena visto. Durante lo studio la tendenza dei partecipanti \u00e8 stata di immaginare o visualizzare grosso modo la stessa cosa, il che ha fatto s\u00ec che la loro empatia innata fosse stimolata allo stesso modo da tutti e tre i casi, nonostante questi presentassero differenze significative nel numero di uccelli coinvolti.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3d90kxuqfrp\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3d90kxuqfrp\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>Se l\u2019obiettivo di una persona \u00e8 di sfruttare un comportamento altruistico (come ad esempio una donazione in beneficenza) per sentirsi bene, o evitare di sentirsi male, non \u00e8 incentivata a controllare se effettivamente sta facendo del bene o se le sembra soltanto \u2013 perch\u00e9 l\u2019unica cosa che importa \u00e8 che si senta bene in entrambi i casi.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4isl5p9bxs7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4isl5p9bxs7\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Non finisce qui: avere a che fare con troppa sofferenza pu\u00f2 portare alla cosiddetta&nbsp;<i>perdita di compassione</i>, un meccanismo di difesa che riduce o azzera la nostra sensibilit\u00e0 alle sofferenze del prossimo quando queste sofferenze raggiungono livelli troppo alti.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffqd4ke2qq2n\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfqd4ke2qq2n\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Il risultato \u00e8 che tenderemo a non mettere in funzione i processi cognitivi necessari per compensare l\u2019insensibilit\u00e0 quantitativa.</p><p>Detto questo, \u00e8 anche possibile che una parte del problema risieda nel fatto che le persone semplicemente non sono consapevoli di questo bias e che quindi modificherebbero le loro decisioni se venissero informate della sua esistenza.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5xhmm2lbjdh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5xhmm2lbjdh\">[8]</a></sup></span></p><p>Non solo: per via del ruolo fondamentale che le emozioni giocano nelle intuizioni morali e nei processi decisionali,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcuxzjv7kzrh\"><sup><a href=\"#fncuxzjv7kzrh\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;\u00e8 stato dimostrato che aumentare a livello emotivo la preoccupazione per le singole vittime di problemi su larga scala aumenta il livello generale di preoccupazione. Si \u00e8 anche visto che la condivisione di storie personali e di immagini attiva una risposta altruistica pi\u00f9 di quanto non facciano statistiche e cifre astratte. Queste descrizioni intense delle difficolt\u00e0 dei singoli individui possono tornare utili per mantenere vive le emozioni quando \u00e8 coinvolto un gran numero di individui.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0u4bkii5ei9o\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0u4bkii5ei9o\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Si tratta di un modo per calibrare meglio l\u2019altruismo compensando per l\u2019esistenza dei bias cognitivi. Non \u00e8 perfetto, perch\u00e9 non \u00e8 possibile applicarlo in tutte le situazioni. Ad esempio, potrebbe non essere possibile raccontare storie di questo tipo quando il tema del discorso sono le nuove forme di sofferenza che potrebbero emergere in futuro.</p><h2><strong>L\u2019insensibilit\u00e0 quantitativa e la nostra incapacit\u00e0 di aiutare gli animali selvatici in pericolo</strong></h2><p>l\u2019insensibilit\u00e0 quantitativa si rivela un problema serio quando ci impedisce di aiutare gli animali selvatici. In natura la sofferenza \u00e8 a livelli astronomici. Ad esempio, la stima migliore per il numero di insetti presenti in natura \u00e8 di 10<sup>18</sup><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrwxaucnke5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrwxaucnke5\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;e la maggior parte di questi animali muore in maniera dolorosa pochi giorni dopo essere nata. La sofferenza con cui abbiamo a che fare o a cui pensiamo di solito impallidiscono di fronte a questo livello di sofferenza.&nbsp;</p><p>Per reagire correttamente di fronte a queste grandezze, dovremmo essere pronti a modificare la nostra reazione emotiva iniziale sulla base di una comprensione pi\u00f9 astratta della quantit\u00e0. Ad esempio, prendendo il numero di insetti pi\u00f9 grande che riusciamo a immaginare possiamo poi provare a ricordare che il problema che rappresenta \u00e8 molto pi\u00f9 grande di quanto siamo in grado di immaginare.</p><h2><strong>Trattare ognuno con la stessa considerazione</strong></h2><p>In teoria, dovremmo dare alla sofferenza di tutti la medesima considerazione. Sfortunatamente, la valutazione delle singole vite e sofferenze si basa spesso su intuizioni morali che sono enormemente influenzate da emozioni e meccanismi non razionali che possono portare a giudizi di parte. Come abbiamo visto in questo articolo, l\u2019insensibilit\u00e0 quantitativa \u00e8 uno di questi meccanismi.</p><p>Ne consegue che quando esprimiamo giudizi morali che riguardano un gran numero di individui non possiamo affidarci esclusivamente ai nostri processi decisionali pi\u00f9 rapidi. \u00c8 necessario tenerlo a mente e cercare di compensare tutti quegli errori che, per via di questo bias, i nostri processi decisionali finiranno per commettere.</p><hr><h2><strong>Bibliografia (in inglese)</strong></h2><p>Baron, J. &amp; Greene, J.

Se invece mi diceste che dentro Sirio c\u2019\u00e8 spazio per un&nbsp;<i>miliardo&nbsp;</i>di pianeti Terra\u2026 la sensazione sarebbe sempre quella di un sacco di pianeti.</p><p>Non c\u2019\u00e8 quasi differenza.&nbsp;<i>Calato nel contesto</i>, il mio cervello ammetterebbe con riluttanza che un miliardo \u00e8 molto pi\u00f9 grande di un milione e farebbe quello sforzo minimo necessario a pensare che una stella grande quanto un miliardo di pianeti Terra \u00e8 pi\u00f9 grande di una grande quanto un milione di pianeti. Ma senza contesto \u2013 se non avessi sentito \u201cun milione\u201d prima di sentire \u201cun miliardo\u201d \u2013 questi due numeri sarebbero solo grandi e indefiniti.</p><p>Se prendeste numeri molto, molto grandi proverei allora un<i> modicum</i> di rispetto per la loro grandezza. Se mi diceste, \u201cuno seguito da 100 zeri\u201d, allora capirei che si tratta di qualcosa&nbsp;<i>di molto&nbsp;</i>pi\u00f9 grande di un miliardo, ma di sicuro il mio istinto non mi suggerirebbe che si tratta di qualcosa 10 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 volte pi\u00f9 grande di un miliardo, non nel modo in cui quattro mele suonano come il doppio di due mele. Il mio cervello non \u00e8 in grado nemmeno di ipotizzare una differenza di grandezza tale.</p><p>Questo fenomeno \u00e8 collegato al concetto di&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hw/scope_insensitivity/\">insensibilit\u00e0 quantitativa (dall\u2019inglese \u201cscope insensitivity\u201d)</a>&nbsp;e mi \u00e8 molto caro perch\u00e9 vivo in un mondo in cui a volte le cose a cui tengo sono molto, molto numerose.</p><p>Ad esempio,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview\">miliardi di persone vivono in povert\u00e0 estrema</a> e, tra questi, centinaia di milioni non hanno accesso a servizi di base e/o muoiono di malattia. Anche se la maggior parte di loro non la vedo, \u00e8 comunque un problema a cui tengo.&nbsp;</p><p>La perdita di una vita umana, con tutte le sue gioie e i suoi dolori, \u00e8 una tragedia, non importa quale ne sia la causa. Non solo, l\u2019immensit\u00e0 di questa tragedia non diminuisce solo perch\u00e9 \u00e8 distante da me o perch\u00e9 non ne so nulla o perch\u00e9 non sono io il responsabile.</p><p>Sapendo questo, ho a cuore ogni singolo individuo sul pianeta. L\u2019unico problema \u00e8 che il mio cervello&nbsp;<i>non \u00e8 semplicemente in grado&nbsp;</i>di sostenere il livello di compassione che provo per le singole persone e moltiplicarlo per un miliardo. Mi mancano le capacit\u00e0 necessarie per provare una tale quantit\u00e0 di sentimenti. Il programma deputato alla compassione che ho installato non ha una tale potenza di calcolo.</p><p>E questo \u00e8 un problema.</p><h1><strong>2</strong></h1><p>Si sente spesso dire che il coraggio non \u00e8 non avere paura, ma avere paura e&nbsp;<i>fare comunque la cosa giusta</i>. Allo stesso modo preoccuparsi del mondo non significa avere una sensazione che corrisponde con precisione alla sofferenza presente nel mondo, ma&nbsp;<i>fare comunque la cosa giusta</i>. Anche se non sentiamo nulla.</p><p>Il programma deputato alla compassione che ho installato \u00e8 stato progettato per avere a che fare con&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number\">circa</a> 150 persone e non \u00e8 assolutamente in grado di esprimere tutta la compassione che provo per miliardi di persone che soffrono. Non ha una tale potenza di calcolo.</p><p>Attualmente la posta in gioco per l\u2019umanit\u00e0 \u00e8 assurdamente alta. Nel migliore dei casi, ci sono miliardi di persone che in questo momento stanno soffrendo. Nel peggiore, milioni di miliardi (o pi\u00f9) di possibili esseri umani, transumani e post-umani la cui esistenza dipende da quello che facciamo qui e ora. Ogni singola civilt\u00e0 complessa che potrebbe emergere in futuro, tutta l\u2019arte e la bellezza che potrebbe nascere, dipende dal presente.</p><p>Quando ci confrontiamo con pensieri del genere, le nostre euristiche deputate alla compassione \u2013 programmate per gestire cifre attorno alle 10 o 20, con un limite massimo attorno alle 150 \u2013 falliscono nel tentativo di comprendere la gravit\u00e0 della situazione.</p><p>Salvare la vita di una persona \u00e8 una sensazione&nbsp;<i>bellissima</i> e&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hx/one_life_against_the_world/\">probabilmente</a> la sensazione di salvare il pianeta sarebbe pi\u00f9 o meno la stessa.

Ma anche se l\u2019euforia altruistica data dal salvare la vita di qualcuno sarebbe sorprendentemente simile a quella data dal salvare il mondo, \u00e8 bene ricordare che&nbsp;<i>dietro&nbsp;</i>queste sensazioni simili c\u2019\u00e8 un mondo di differenza.</p><p>Quando si tratta di decidere su come agire sui grandi problemi del mondo, le nostre sensazioni sono un indicatore tragicamente inadeguato.</p><h1><strong>3</strong></h1><p>Quando ho cominciato a interiorizzare questa insensibilit\u00e0 quantitativa, \u00e8 cambiato qualcosa a livello mentale. \u00c8 difficile esprimerlo a parole, quindi comincer\u00f2 con qualche storia.</p><p>Prendete Alice, un ingegnere informatico per Amazon a Seattle. Circa una volta al mese vede per strada studenti universitari muniti di cartelline che cercano, con sempre meno convinzione, di convincere la gente a donare a Medici Senza Frontiere. Di solito Alice fa finta di non vederli e va dritta per la sua strada, ma questa volta sono finalmente riusciti a bloccarla. Le spiegano che cos\u2019\u00e8 Medici Senza Frontiere e anche lei deve riconoscere che sembra una causa degna di essere sostenuta. Alla fine lascia loro $20, un po\u2019 per senso di colpa, un po\u2019 per pressione sociale e un po\u2019 per altruismo, poi si affretta ad andare al lavoro. (Il mese dopo, quando sono di nuovo l\u00ec, Alice fa finta di non vederli.)</p><p>Ora prendete Bob, che \u00e8 stato sfidato all\u2019Ice Bucket Challenge da un amico su Facebook. Pensa di essere troppo impegnato per poter partecipare alla sfida, quindi dona $100 ad&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.alsa.org/\">ALSA</a> e basta.</p><p>Prendete Christine, che fa parte della confraternita \u0391\u0394\u03a0. \u0391\u0394\u03a0 \u00e8 coinvolta in una sfida con \u03a0\u0392\u03a6 (un\u2019altra confraternita) per vedere chi riuscir\u00e0 a raccogliere pi\u00f9 fondi per la National Breast Cancer Foundation in una settimana. Christine \u00e8 molto competitiva e si impegna nel raccogliere fondi. Lei stessa dona qualche centinaio di dollari durante la settimana (soprattutto quando \u0391\u0394\u03a0 \u00e8 molto lontana dal traguardo).</p><p>Queste tre persone hanno donato denaro in beneficenza. Ottimo. Ma avete notato che hanno anche qualcos\u2019altro in comune? Queste donazioni sono in buona parte il risultato del&nbsp;<i>contesto sociale</i>. Alice sente la pressione sociale e il senso del dovere. Bob sente la pressione sociale e forse un po\u2019 di spirito di squadra. Christine \u00e8 spinta dallo spirito di squadra e dalla voglia di competere. Sono tutti buoni motivi, ma sono motivi legati al&nbsp;<i>contesto sociale</i> e solo marginalmente alla&nbsp;<i>destinazione&nbsp;</i>della donazione.</p><p>Se prendeste da parte Alice, Bob o Christine e chiedeste loro perch\u00e9 non investono tutto il loro tempo e il loro denaro in queste cause, visto che a quanto pare le ritengono meritevoli, probabilmente vi guarderebbero strano e penserebbero che siete dei maleducati (e avrebbero ragione!). Se insisteste, forse vi direbbero che in questo momento non hanno molti soldi da parte o che donerebbero di pi\u00f9 se fossero persone migliori.</p><p>Ma c\u2019\u00e8 comunque qualcosa di sbagliato nella domanda. Donare tutto il denaro a disposizione non \u00e8 qualcosa che si fa. Possiamo anche&nbsp;<i>proclamare ad alta voce&nbsp;</i>che le persone che si liberano di tutti i loro averi sono fantastiche, ma dentro di noi sappiamo tutti che quelle persone sono matte. (Forse matte in senso positivo, ma comunque matte.)</p><p>\u00c8 un tipo di mentalit\u00e0 che ho avuto per un po\u2019. Ma ne esiste un\u2019altra, alternativa, che pu\u00f2 piombarvi addosso come un treno in corsa non appena cominciate a interiorizzare l\u2019insensibilit\u00e0 quantitativa.</p><h1><strong>4</strong></h1><p>Prendete Daniel, uno studente universitario. Poco dopo il disastro della Deepwater Horizon, incontra per strada una di quelle persone munite di cartelline che cerca di raccogliere donazioni per il WWF. Stanno cercando di salvare dalla fuoriuscita di petrolio quanti pi\u00f9 uccelli possibile. Di norma Daniel catalogherebbe l\u2019organizzazione come Non La Cosa Pi\u00f9 Importante o Adesso Non Posso Occuparmene, o anche Qualcosa Che Capita Agli Altri, ma questa volta Daniel ha pensato al fatto che il suo cervello non \u00e8 granch\u00e9 con le cifre e decide di fare un rapido test di sicurezza.</p><p>Si vede a camminare sulla spiaggia subito dopo la fuoriuscita di petrolio. L\u00ec incontra un gruppo di persone che puliscono gli uccelli il pi\u00f9 velocemente possibile, ma \u00e8 chiaro che non hanno abbastanza risorse per ripulirli tutti. Un uccellino dall\u2019aria miserevole si avvicina ai suoi piedi, coperto di petrolio, gli occhi che a malapena si aprono. Daniel si inginocchia per raccoglierlo e lo porta a un tavolo. Una persona del gruppo gli dice che loro non faranno in tempo a pulire quell\u2019uccellino, ma che, se si infila un paio di guanti, gli basterebbero tre minuti per pulirlo e quindi salvarlo.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MJTLq2dfCTpTdcifa/g8jwu2ratxj2d2wd9ag6\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MJTLq2dfCTpTdcifa/j4jg126u22qbyedrk3d3 80w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MJTLq2dfCTpTdcifa/mpytwvfohyvbmwteqvt3 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MJTLq2dfCTpTdcifa/p9wyxd6pm9xjlxhhj3hx 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MJTLq2dfCTpTdcifa/n8behaivc9cqoa7cb1ws 320w\"></p><p>Daniel decide che userebbe&nbsp;<i>volentieri&nbsp;</i>tre minuti del suo tempo per salvare l\u2019uccello e che sarebbe&nbsp;<i>anche&nbsp;</i>felice di pagare almeno $3 perch\u00e9 qualcuno investa qualche minuto del suo per pulire l\u2019uccello. Daniel esamina questo pensiero e si rende conto che non \u00e8 solo perch\u00e9 ha immaginato un uccello davanti a lui: sente che vale la pena impiegare almeno tre minuti del suo tempo (o $3) per salvare un uccello incatramato in senso astratto.</p><p>E dal momento che \u00e8 da un po\u2019 che pensa all\u2019insensibilit\u00e0 quantitativa,&nbsp;<i>si aspetta&nbsp;</i>che il suo cervello non riporti correttamente quanto davvero tiene a salvare una grande numero di uccelli; non si pu\u00f2 pensare che i propri sentimenti coincidano con la vera importanza della situazione. Per cui, invece di&nbsp;<i>affidarsi all\u2019istinto</i> per capire quanto davvero tiene a ripulire un sacco di uccelli, si mette a fare calcoli.</p><p>Soltanto il petrolio fuoriuscito dalla Deepwater Horizon ha ricoperto&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dailydeadbirds.com/\"><u>migliaia e migliaia</u></a> di uccelli. Dopo aver cominciato a calcolare, Daniel si rende conto (sempre pi\u00f9 terrorizzato) che l\u2019interesse che&nbsp;<i>davvero&nbsp;</i>ha nei confronti di uccelli coperti di petrolio \u00e8 limitato a due mesi di duro lavoro e/o $50.000. Questo senza nemmeno prendere in considerazione gli animali minacciati da&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oil_spills\"><u>altre fuoriuscite di petrolio</u></a>.</p><p>Se gli sta cos\u00ec a cuore&nbsp;<i>ripulire gli uccelli dal petrolio</i>, allora quanto davvero gli interessa il problema degli allevamenti intensivi, senza nemmeno considerare la fame o la povert\u00e0 o le malattie? Quanto davvero gli interessa il problema delle guerre che sconvolgono i paesi del mondo? E i bambini abbandonati e privi di sostentamento? E il futuro dell\u2019umanit\u00e0? Tutte queste cose gli interessano&nbsp;<i>cos\u00ec tanto&nbsp;</i>che investirebbe molti pi\u00f9 soldi e denaro di quelli che attualmente ha a disposizione.</p><p>Per la prima volta, Daniel riesce a scorgere quanto davvero gli stanno a cuore i problemi del mondo e quanto sono diffusi questi problemi.</p><p>Tutto questo ha uno strano effetto su Daniel. Il suo ragionamento torna al punto di partenza e lui si rende conto che in fondo&nbsp;<i>non pu\u00f2 permettersi&nbsp;</i>di preoccuparsi degli uccelli incatramati per 3 minuti o $3. Non perch\u00e9&nbsp;<i>non valga la pena&nbsp;</i>investire il suo tempo e denaro per quegli uccelli (al contrario, ritiene che nell\u2019attuale sistema economico si producano cose vendute per $3 che valgono molto meno della vita di un uccello), ma perch\u00e9 non pu\u00f2 investire il&nbsp;<i>suo</i> tempo e il&nbsp;<i>suo&nbsp;</i>denaro per salvare gli uccelli. All\u2019improvviso il costo di una tale opportunit\u00e0 sembra davvero troppo alto: ci sono&nbsp;<i>cos\u00ec tante altre cose da fare</i>! C\u2019\u00e8 gente che sta male, che non ha da mangiare, che muore! \u00c8 in gioco il futuro stesso della nostra civilt\u00e0!</p><p>Alla fine Daniel non dona $50.000 al WWF, e non dona nemmeno all\u2019ALS Association o alla National Breast Cancer Foundation. Ma se chiedeste&nbsp;<i>a Daniel&nbsp;</i>perch\u00e9 non dona tutto il suo denaro, non vi guarderebbe strano n\u00e9 penserebbe che siete dei maleducati. Non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 il Daniel a cui non importava nulla e si \u00e8 reso conto che&nbsp;<i>per tutto questo tempo la sua mente gli ha mentito&nbsp;</i>sulla gravit\u00e0 dei problemi reali.</p><p>Ora si rende conto che&nbsp;<i>non pu\u00f2 sperare di poter fare abbastanza</i>. Ora che \u00e8 consapevole dell\u2019insensibilit\u00e0 quantitativa (e il fatto che il suo cervello gli mente quando si parla di grandi numeri), all\u2019improvviso gli sembra che valga la pena dedicare la propria vita anche a cause \u201cmeno importanti\u201d come il WWF. La distruzione dell\u2019ambiente e la SLA e il cancro al seno all\u2019improvviso sono tutti problemi per i quali attraverserebbe mari e monti, solo che adesso ha capito che ci sono troppi mari e troppi monti e la SLA non \u00e8 che l\u2019inizio e AAAAH DA DOVE ARRIVA QUESTO OCEANO?</p><p>Quando aveva ancora la vecchia mentalit\u00e0, il motivo per cui non aveva lasciato perdere tutto il resto per occuparsi della SLA era perch\u00e9 non gli sembrava\u2026 abbastanza urgente. O abbastanza risolvibile. O abbastanza importante. Beh, pi\u00f9 o meno. Questi sono all\u2019incirca i motivi, ma il vero motivo \u00e8 che l\u2019idea di \u201clasciar perdere ogni cosa per occuparsi della SLA\u201d non gli era nemmeno mai&nbsp;<i>passata per la testa</i> come possibilit\u00e0 concreta. Era un\u2019idea troppo lontana dalla sua vita quotidiana. Non era un suo problema.</p><p>Ma con questa nuova mentalit\u00e0,&nbsp;<i>ogni cosa&nbsp;</i>\u00e8 un suo problema. L\u2019unico motivo per cui non ha ancora lasciato perdere tutto quanto per occuparsi della SLA \u00e8 perch\u00e9 ci troppe cose da fare prima.</p><p>Alice, Bob e Christine di solito non passano il loro tempo a cercare di risolvere i problemi del mondo perch\u00e9 si dimenticano che ci sono. Se glielo ricordate \u2013 ovvero li inserite in un contesto sociale in cui si ricordano quanto tengono a certi problemi (si spera senza sensi di colpa o pressione sociale) \u2013 allora doneranno qualcosina.</p><p>Daniel e altre persone che hanno vissuto questo cambiamento mentale, al contrario, non passano il loro tempo a cercare di risolvere tutti i problemi del mondo perch\u00e9 ci sono&nbsp;<i>troppi problemi</i>. (La speranza \u00e8 che Daniel scopra movimenti come l\u2019altruismo efficace e inizi a contribuire a risolvere i problemi pi\u00f9 urgenti al mondo).</p><h1><strong>5</strong></h1><p>Non sto cercando di insegnare a nessuno come essere una brava persona. Per esserlo (ovviamente) non dovete per forza condividere il mio punto di vista.</p><p>Quello che sto cercando di fare invece \u00e8 far notare un cambio di punto di vista. Molti di noi vivono sapendo che&nbsp;<i>dovremmo&nbsp;</i>occuparci della sofferenza di persone lontane da noi, ma non ci riusciamo. Penso che, almeno in parte, questo comportamento sia legato al fatto che la maggior parte di noi istintivamente si fida del proprio programma deputato alla compassione.</p><p>Questa \u201csensazione di compassione\u201d di solito non \u00e8 forte abbastanza da spingerci a precipitarci a salvare qualcuno che sta morendo. Per questo anche se riconosciamo che fare di pi\u00f9 per il mondo sarebbe la cosa giusta da fare, pensiamo di non&nbsp;<i>esserne in grado</i>, perch\u00e9 non siamo stati dotati di quel senso di virtuosa compassione in pi\u00f9 che devono per forza avere gli altruisti famosi.</p><p>Ma \u00e8 un ragionamento sbagliato: quei famosi altruisti non sono persone con un programma deputato alla compassione pi\u00f9 avanzato di altri. Sono persone che hanno&nbsp;<i>imparato a non fidarsi di quel programma</i>.</p><p>I nostri programmi della compassione non sono rotti. Semplicemente non funzionano con i grandi numeri. Nessuno di noi ne ha uno in grado di rappresentare con precisione le dimensioni dei problemi del mondo. Ma il fatto che non possiamo&nbsp;<i>sentire</i> questa preoccupazione non significa che non possiamo&nbsp;<i>fare&nbsp;</i>nulla al riguardo.</p><p>Non potete sentire il giusto livello di \u201ccompassione\u201d nel vostro corpo. Mi spiace, i problemi del mondo sono troppo grandi e il vostro corpo non \u00e8 progettato per rispondere in maniera adeguata a problemi di queste dimensioni. Ma potete sempre scegliere di&nbsp;<i>agire&nbsp;</i>come se i problemi del mondo avessero quelle dimensioni. Potete smettere di affidarvi alle vostre sensazioni come se fossero un pilota automatico e passare ai comandi manuali.</p><h1><strong>6</strong></h1><p>Questo ovviamente ci porta a chiederci \u201ce allora tu cosa diavolo fai?\u201d</p><p>La risposta \u00e8 che non lo so ancora. (Ma penso che valga la pena cominciare da&nbsp;<a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/\"><u>Giving What We Can</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://givewell.org/\"><u>GiveWell</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://intelligence.org/\"><u>MIRI</u></a> e il&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\"><u>Future of Humanity Institute</u></a>. )</p><p>Penso che almeno in parte l\u2019origine di questa situazione sia un punto di vista pi\u00f9 o meno disperato. Pensare che&nbsp;<i>dovremmo&nbsp;</i>cambiare il mondo non \u00e8 sufficiente: abbiamo anche bisogno di quel tipo di disperazione che sorge quando ci rendiamo conto che dedicheremmo la nostra intera vita a risolvere il 100\u00b0 problema pi\u00f9 importante del mondo se potessimo, ma non possiamo, perch\u00e9 ce ne sono altri 99 che sono pi\u00f9 importanti e di cui dobbiamo occuparci prima.</p><p>Non sto cercando di farvi sentire in colpa in modo da farvi donare pi\u00f9 soldi. Diventare filantropi \u00e8&nbsp;<i>molto, molto difficile</i>. (Se invece siete&nbsp;<i>gi\u00e0&nbsp;</i>dei filantropi, avete tutto il mio rispetto e il mio affetto). Tanto per cominciare, uno dei requisiti \u00e8 avere del denaro a disposizione, cosa non scontata, e un altro \u00e8&nbsp;<i>essere disposti a spedire quel denaro verso problemi lontani e invisibili</i>, altra cosa che \u00e8 difficile far piacere al nostro cervello. L\u2019<a href=\"https://www.filosofare.it/scritti-filosofia/acrasia\"><u>acrasia</u></a> pu\u00f2 essere un avversario formidabile. Cosa ancora pi\u00f9 importante, sul lungo periodo il senso di colpa non sembra essere la migliore delle motivazioni: se siete intenzionati a unirvi a tutte quelle persone che cercano di salvare il mondo, preferirei che lo faceste con orgoglio. La strada \u00e8 lunga e difficile ed \u00e8 meglio incamminarvisi a testa alta.</p><h1><strong>7</strong></h1><p>Essere coraggiosi non vuol dire non avere paura, vuol dire avere paura ed essere comunque in grado di fare la cosa giusta.</p><p>Allo stesso modo occuparsi dei grandi problemi della nostra epoca non significa sentire una forte spinta a farlo. Significa cercare di occuparsene anche quando quella spinta interiore non riesce in nessun modo a comprendere le dimensioni dei problemi che affronteremo.</p><p>\u00c8 facile leggere di persone particolarmente virtuose come Gandhi, Madre Teresa e Nelson Mandela e pensare che devono aver avuto una compassione smisurata rispetto alla nostra. Ma non \u00e8 cos\u00ec che funziona.</p><p>Nessuno pu\u00f2 comprendere davvero le effettive dimensioni di questi problemi. Il meglio che possiamo fare \u00e8 fare qualche calcolo: troviamo qualcosa che ci sta a cuore, gli assegniamo un numero e lo moltiplichiamo. Dopodich\u00e9 vediamo di fidarci di quei numeri pi\u00f9 di quanto ci fidiamo dei nostri sentimenti.</p><p>Perch\u00e9 i nostri sentimenti ci mentono.</p><p>Quando moltiplichiamo questi numeri, ci rendiamo conto che risolvere il problema della povert\u00e0 nel mondo e costruire un futuro migliore merita molte pi\u00f9 risorse di quante ce ne siano a disposizione. Non ci sono abbastanza soldi, tempo o energie al mondo per fare ci\u00f2 che va fatto.</p><p>Ci siamo solo io e voi, e tutti quelli che ci provano comunque.</p><h1><strong>8</strong></h1><p>Non possiamo sentire davvero il peso del mondo.

La barra blu rappresenta il numero concreto di morti infantili annuali al momento. Dei 141 milioni di bambini che nascono ogni anno, il 3,9% muore prima di aver compiuto cinque anni.

Oggi le condizioni di vita nei paesi pi\u00f9 poveri del mondo per molti aspetti sono di gran lunga migliori di com\u2019erano in passato anche nei paesi pi\u00f9 ricchi: la mortalit\u00e0 infantile nei paesi in condizioni peggiori \u00e8 stimata tra il 10% e il 13%; fino a qualche generazione fa, era tre volte maggiore [30-50%] in ogni parte del mondo. Si calcola che all\u2019inizio del XIX secolo nel mondo il 43% dei bambini moriva entro i cinque anni. Se le nostre condizioni di salute fossero ancora quelle dei nostri antenati, ogni anno morirebbero pi\u00f9 di 60 milioni di bambini \u2013 166.000 al giorno.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmis76erq6in\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmis76erq6in\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>Nel grafico questo dato \u00e8 rappresentato dalla barra rossa.</p><p>Per sapere in che modo la mortalit\u00e0 infantile \u00e8 cambiata nel tempo, puoi leggere il post di Hannah Ritchie:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/child-mortality-global-overview\">From commonplace to rarer tragedy \u2014 declining child mortality across the world</a>.</p><p>Miglioramenti cos\u00ec grandi non si limitano alla salute; osserviamo gli stessi cambiamenti in altri ambiti della vita (come mostrato in questo mio breve articolo sulla storia delle condizioni di vita).

Questi aspetti includono l\u2019istruzione, la libert\u00e0 politica, la violenza, la povert\u00e0, la nutrizione e alcuni aspetti del cambiamento ambientale.</p><p>Da questi cambiamenti abbiamo imparato che \u00e8 possibile cambiare il mondo.

Ma cosa sappiamo di ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 possibile fare per il futuro? Siamo nati in un periodo sfortunato della storia moderna in cui i progressi a livello globale si sono interrotti?</p><p>Lo studio dei dati globali lascia intendere che la risposta \u00e8 no. Un modo di approcciarsi alla questione \u00e8 osservare i luoghi nel mondo che hanno le migliori condizioni di vita. Le attuali&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/child-mortality-1990-vs-2017-slope\">disuguaglianze</a> nelle condizioni di vita nel mondo dimostrano che c\u2019\u00e8 ancora molto da fare. Se le condizioni di salute in tutti i paesi del mondo fossero uguali, non sarebbe possibile sapere davvero se fossero possibili ulteriori progressi o come raggiungerli. Ma dal momento che in alcuni luoghi la salute dei bambini \u00e8 di gran lunga migliore, allora non ci sono dubbi: rendere i bambini pi\u00f9 in salute rispetto alla media globale non solo \u00e8 possibile, ma \u00e8 gi\u00e0 una realt\u00e0.</p><p>Quindi, quale sarebbe la mortalit\u00e0 infantile se i bambini in tutto il mondo fossero in salute quanto lo sono quelli nei paesi pi\u00f9 ricchi?</p><p>La risposta \u00e8 nella barra verde che vedete nel grafico. La regione con il tasso di mortalit\u00e0 infantile pi\u00f9 basso \u00e8 l\u2019Unione Europea.

Se il mondo intero raggiungesse quel livello di salute sarebbe un grande risultato, ma anche nei luoghi con le condizioni sanitarie migliori dovremmo comunque cercare di superare i limiti di miglioramenti che, come abbiamo visto, sono possibili.</p><p>Ovviamente non dobbiamo commettere l\u2019errore di credere che ridurre il tasso di mortalit\u00e0 infantile globale a quello dell\u2019Unione Europea sia cos\u00ec facile.

A volte pensiamo che sia addirittura un dovere morale: molti pensano che i milionari dovrebbero restituire qualcosa alla comunit\u00e0. Potrebbe per\u00f2 sorprenderti sapere che le persone con stipendio uguale o superiore alla media in un paese ricco fanno <a href=\"https://howrichami.givingwhatwecan.org/how-rich-am-i?income=20000&amp;countryCode=ITA&amp;household%5Badults%5D=1&amp;household%5Bchildren%5D=0\"><u>di solito parte del 2% pi\u00f9 ricco del mondo</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrsrjl7q0q0t\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrsrjl7q0q0t\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;\u2014 forse anche noi possiamo restituire qualcosa.</li><li><strong>Tutte le persone</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw8q6znb83xt\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw8q6znb83xt\">[2]</a></sup></span><strong>&nbsp;hanno lo stesso valore </strong>\u2014 tutti hanno diritto a essere felici, in salute, appagati e <a href=\"http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/23536922667/sonder\"><u>liberi</u></a>, a prescindere dalle circostanze. Ogni persona \u00e8 importante, a prescindere da dove viva, dal suo patrimonio o dalla sua etnia, et\u00e0, genere, abilit\u00e0, credenze religiose, ecc.</li><li><strong>Aiutare di pi\u00f9 \u00e8 meglio che aiutare di meno</strong> \u2014 a parit\u00e0 di condizioni, dovremmo salvare pi\u00f9 vite, aiutare le persone a vivere pi\u00f9 a lungo, renderle pi\u00f9 felici. Immagina venti malati in un reparto d\u2019ospedale che moriranno se non gli somministri un farmaco. Ci sono abbastanza dosi per tutti e non ci sono ragioni per conservarne per dopo: davvero qualcuno sceglierebbe di salvare solo <i>alcune</i> di queste persone se salvarle <i>tutte</i> fosse ugualmente semplice?</li><li><strong>Le nostre risorse sono limitate</strong> \u2014 persino un milionario ha una quantit\u00e0 limitata di denaro a disposizione. Questo vale anche per il nostro tempo: non ci sono mai abbastanza ore in una giornata. Scegliere di investire denaro o tempo in una certa opzione sottintende una scelta, quella di <a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costo_opportunit%C3%A0\"><u>non spenderli per altre opzioni</u></a> (a prescindere dal fatto di avere in mente queste opzioni o meno).</li></ol><p>Non penso che ci sia nulla di controverso in queste quattro idee. Mi sembra che siano tutte piuttosto logiche: dovremmo aiutare le persone in difficolt\u00e0 quando possiamo; non dovremmo dare preferenze a un gruppo a scapito di altri; se ne abbiamo la possibilit\u00e0, dovremmo scegliere di aiutare pi\u00f9 persone; non abbiamo tempo o denaro infiniti.</p><p>Non solo. Penso che ci sentiremmo piuttosto a disagio a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversal_test\"><u>difendere le posizioni opposte</u></a>:</p><ol><li>Aiutare gli altri non \u00e8 un dovere morale, non \u00e8 importante e nemmeno un\u2019azione cos\u00ec buona.</li><li>Non c\u2019\u00e8 nulla di male nel trattare diversamente le persone in base a differenze arbitrarie come etnia, abilit\u00e0, genere, ecc.</li><li>Non \u00e8 un problema se alcune persone muoiono, anche se non ci costerebbe nulla salvarle.</li><li>Abbiamo infinite risorse.</li></ol><p>Chiaro cosa intendo?</p><p>Proprio perch\u00e9 i nostri soldi non sono infiniti, dobbiamo sempre scegliere quale causa meritevole sostenere.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1670605956/mirroredImages/wYjMsKsEkDPgHeAbS/zoovrr0mqbyr065wmdok.jpg\"></figure><p>Per cui, se siamo d\u2019accordo che queste quattro idee esprimono valori importanti, e secondo me \u00e8 cos\u00ec, allora non possiamo ignorarne le conseguenze sul modo in cui ci approcciamo al fare del bene. Al contrario, vuol dire che il modo in cui di solito ci approcciamo al fare del bene \u00e8 sbagliato.</p><p>Se vogliamo rimanere fedeli a questi valori, dobbiamo pensare al modo in cui possiamo aiutare pi\u00f9 persone possibile con le nostre risorse limitate.</p><p>\u00c8 una questione importante, perch\u00e9 ci sono <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/cause-areas\"><u>alcune cause</u></a> dove possiamo avere un grande impatto senza spendere molti soldi. In effetti, le opzioni migliori <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/effective-or-not/\"><u>sono molto, molto meglio della media</u></a>, potenzialmente centinaia di volte. Questo pu\u00f2 significare aiutare una persona o aiutarne centinaia con la stessa identica quantit\u00e0 di tempo o denaro.</p><p>Questo poich\u00e9 un\u2019organizzazione benefica scelta a caso quasi sicuramente non avr\u00e0 un impatto grande quanto quello delle&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/best-charities-to-donate-to-2022\"><i>organizzazioni pi\u00f9 efficaci</i></a> (e va detto, spesso le cause che sosteniamo sono il risultato o di una scelta casuale oppure di fattori sistemici che fanno s\u00ec che vediamo solo certe cause).</p><p>\u00c8 da tenere a mente, perch\u00e9, se non scegliamo con attenzione, o finiremo per non dare la stessa considerazione a tutti (di fatto discriminando alcuni gruppi di persone) oppure non aiuteremo tutte le persone che potremmo aiutare (vale a dire che permetteremo che pi\u00f9 persone soffrano o muoiano anche quando potremmo aiutarle).</p><p>Inizialmente tutte le cause degne di nota \u2014 dalla ricerca sul cancro alla lotta al cambiamento climatico, dalle aree protette per animali fino alla prevenzione di malattie <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/unlimit-health\"><u>dal nome impronunciabile ma facili da curare</u></a> in posti dove probabilmente non andremo mai \u2014 dovrebbero essere prese in considerazione\u2026 <i>se non fosse </i>per il fatto che pensiamo che \u00e8 meglio aiutare pi\u00f9 persone e sappiamo che non abbiamo le risorse per aiutare tutti. Per questo all\u2019inizio dovremmo concentrarci sulle cause che ci permettono di aiutare il maggior numero possibile di persone con denaro e tempo limitati, <strong>non solo quelle di cui, per qualche motivo, abbiamo gi\u00e0 sentito parlare</strong>.</p><p><strong>Mantenersi neutrali quando si sceglie una causa pu\u00f2 essere molto difficile.</strong> La maggior parte delle persone ha esperienze personali con il dolore e le perdite: io ho perso due parenti a causa della leucemia, ho visto i loro corpi consumati dalla malattia e le loro menti offuscate dagli antidolorifici, e ho sentito con altri il lutto per la loro scomparsa. \u00c8 del tutto logico che questo ci spinga a voler donare a organizzazioni che lottano per risolvere problemi specifici o curare quella malattia particolare che ci ha portato via una persona cara. Siamo animali empatici e non vogliamo che altri soffrano allo stesso modo o che i loro cari provino il nostro stesso lutto.</p><p>Ma se vogliamo trattare tutte le persone allo stesso modo, dobbiamo anche pensare a trattare allo stesso modo le loro esperienze. Non c\u2019\u00e8 un motivo valido per cui dovrei concentrarmi di pi\u00f9 sul prevenire le morti, le disabilit\u00e0 e la sofferenza causate da una malattia in particolare (come la leucemia) piuttosto che sulla sofferenza causata dalla malaria, dalla tubercolosi, dagli incidenti stradali o qualsiasi altra cosa. Ci\u00f2 che importa \u00e8 che ci sono vite che si spengono troppo presto, genitori privati dei loro bambini e persone che soffrono. Se ci sta a cuore l\u2019uguaglianza, allora dobbiamo considerare tragedie <i>tutte </i>le morti e <i>tutti </i>i dolori, non solo quelli causati da malattie particolari che conosciamo solo perch\u00e9 un crudele scherzo del destino le ha portate alla nostra attenzione.</p><p>Prendere decisioni simili pu\u00f2 essere molto, molto difficile, ma c\u2019\u00e8 un insieme di strumenti per pensare che pu\u00f2 esserci d\u2019aiuto. Questo modo di pensare si chiama altruismo efficace.</p><p>\u00c8 grosso modo come l\u2019altruismo normale, perch\u00e9 pone l\u2019accento sull\u2019importanza di aiutare il prossimo. Il termine \u2018efficace\u2019 fa semplicemente riferimento al pensare con attenzione al modo in cui le nostre azioni possono aiutare <i>il maggior numero di persone possibile</i>, o avere il <i>massimo impatto positivo possibile</i>.</p><p>Per come la vedo io, l\u2019altruismo efficace \u00e8 un modo per essere all\u2019altezza di <strong>quei valori che sono gi\u00e0 parte di noi</strong>.</p><p>Questo modo di pensare si applica a ogni ambito in cui vogliamo fare del bene, dall\u2019attivismo politico allo scegliere a chi donare i nostri soldi, o al come avere un grande impatto attraverso le nostre carriere lavorative.</p><p>In un mondo in cui ci sono cos\u00ec tante cause meritevoli su cui potremmo lavorare, l\u2019altruismo efficace ci permette di cercare in modo sistematico i modi per massimizzare il nostro impatto positivo con tempo e denaro limitati ed evitare quindi di paralizzarci quando si tratta di prendere decisioni.</p><p>Certo, ci pone davanti a scelte difficili, ma \u00e8 importante tenere a mente che prendiamo comunque certe decisioni, che ci pensiamo o meno. Per questo, anche se pu\u00f2 essere difficile non donare a qualcosa che ci sembra molto importante \u2014 che sia per motivi personali o perch\u00e9 siamo stati convinti dalla campagna pubblicitaria di un\u2019organizzazione \u2014 dobbiamo sempre ricordarci che in ogni caso sceglieremo a scapito di altre cause degne di attenzione.</p><p>Ecco un esempio pratico. Nel Regno Unito le persone donano in media \u00a36700 (\u20ac7500)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref67xablylxgc\"><sup><a href=\"#fn67xablylxgc\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;lungo tutto l\u2019arco della loro carriera lavorativa.

L\u2019altruismo efficace \u00e8 definito da valori che sostengono la sua ricerca dei metodi migliori per aiutare il prossimo:</p><p><strong>Assegnazione delle priorit\u00e0:</strong> Le nostre intuizioni su come fare del bene spesso non tengono conto della portata delle conseguenze. Aiutare 100 persone spesso ci soddisfa quanto aiutarne 1000. Dal momento che alcuni modi di fare del bene raggiungono risultati di gran lunga migliori di altri, \u00e8 per\u00f2 necessario cercare di usare i numeri per calcolare, per quanto possibile, quanto aiutano le diverse azioni. Piuttosto che adoperarsi per avere un impatto qualsiasi, si tratta di trovare i modi&nbsp;<i>migliori</i> per aiutare il prossimo.</p><p><strong>Altruismo imparziale:</strong> Tutte le persone sono uguali. \u00c8 del tutto logico preoccuparsi in modo particolare della propria famiglia, dei propri amici e della propria vita, ma quando si tratta di massimizzare il bene che facciamo, l\u2019obiettivo \u00e8 di dare lo stesso peso agli interessi di tutti, a prescindere dal luogo o dall\u2019epoca in cui vivono. Questo significa concentrarsi sui gruppi pi\u00f9 ignorati, il che di solito significa concentrarsi su coloro che non hanno abbastanza potere per proteggere i propri interessi.</p><p><strong>Ricerca della verit\u00e0:</strong> Piuttosto che impegnarsi esclusivamente in una certa causa, comunit\u00e0 o approccio, \u00e8 importante tenere in considerazione i molti metodi diversi con cui si pu\u00f2 aiutare il prossimo e cercare di trovare i migliori. Questo vuol dire investire parecchio tempo nel riflettere e considerare le proprie credenze, essere sempre curiosi e aperti a nuovi argomenti ed evidenze scientifiche ed essere pronti a cambiare i propri punti di vista in maniera piuttosto radicale.</p><p><strong>Spirito di collaborazione:</strong> \u00c8 possibile raggiungere risultati migliori lavorando assieme e per farlo in maniera efficiente sono necessari standard elevati di onest\u00e0, cordialit\u00e0 e un punto di vista comunitario. L\u2019altruismo efficace non si basa su un ragionamento per il quale \u201cil fine giustifica i mezzi\u201d. Si tratta invece di essere buoni cittadini e allo stesso tempo lavorare con ambizione per costruire un mondo migliore.</p><p>Tutti coloro che condividono questi valori e cercano di trovare modi migliori per aiutare il prossimo stanno prendendo parte all\u2019altruismo efficace. Questo a prescindere da quanto tempo o denaro intendono investire o su quali problemi scelgono di concentrarsi.</p><p>L\u2019altruismo efficace pu\u00f2 essere paragonato al metodo scientifico. La scienza usa i dati e la ragione nella ricerca della verit\u00e0, anche se i risultati sono controintuitivi e sono in contrasto con la tradizione. L\u2019altruismo efficace usa l\u2019evidenza scientifica e la ragione nella ricerca dei modi migliori per fare del bene.</p><p>Il metodo scientifico si basa su idee semplici, ad esempio che dovremmo sottoporre a esperimenti le nostre convinzioni, ma porta ad avere una visione del mondo radicalmente diversa (ad es., la meccanica quantistica). Allo stesso modo, l\u2019altruismo efficace si basa su idee semplici, come ad esempio che dovremmo trattare tutte le persone allo stesso modo e che \u00e8 meglio aiutarne di pi\u00f9 che di meno, ma porta ad avere una visione non convenzionale e in costante evoluzione del fare del bene.</p><h2><strong>Come posso contribuire?</strong></h2><p>Le persone interessate all\u2019altruismo efficace spesso cercano di mettere in pratica queste idee nella propria vita.

In secondo luogo, realizzare tutto questo senza sacrificare nulla che abbia la medesima importanza sul piano morale.</p><p>L\u2019altruismo efficace si \u00e8 posto questa missione perch\u00e9 aumentare il benessere \u00e8 un obiettivo che molte persone sono in grado di appoggiare. Questo non significa che aumentare il benessere \u00e8 l\u2019unica cosa che conta. All\u2019atto pratico persone nella comunit\u00e0 di altruismo efficace hanno molti altri valori.</p><p>Da un punto di vista morale, ci\u00f2 che importa \u00e8 cos\u00ec incerto che le persone coinvolte nell\u2019altruismo efficace cercano di rispettare altri valori largamente condivisi mentre cercano di massimizzare il benessere. L\u2019altruismo efficace non si basa su una mentalit\u00e0 per la quale \u201cil fine giustifica i mezzi\u201d. Si tratta invece di essere buoni cittadini e allo stesso tempo lavorare con ambizione per costruire un mondo migliore.</p><p>Scopri di pi\u00f9 sulla definizione che 80.000 Ore -

Effective Altruism, ma si \u00e8 diffuso come termine per descrivere il movimento in senso pi\u00f9 ampio.</p><p>Alcune delle fonti di ispirazione intellettuale dell\u2019altruismo efficace sono la medicina o le politiche basate sull\u2019evidenza, l\u2019utilitarismo applicato e la ricerca nel campo delle euristiche e dei bias nel pensiero umano.</p><p>Qui potete trovare la&nbsp;<a

pratica.</p><p>Inoltre, questo risultato pu\u00f2 essere raggiunto anche se la quantit\u00e0 di risorse impiegate per fare del bene non aumenta.&nbsp;<a

persone interessate all\u2019altruismo efficace?</strong></p><p>Le persone interessate all\u2019altruismo efficace lavorano su una grande variet\u00e0 di problemi e progetti.</p><p>Ad esempio,&nbsp;<a

mirano ad affrontare i problemi pi\u00f9 urgenti. Questi lavori spaziano tra tutti i settori, incluse organizzazioni non-profit e for-profit che cercano di affrontare questi problemi, la ricerca accademica o posizioni governative e amministrative.</p><p>Tramite Giving What We Can, oltre 9000 persone si impegnano a donare pi\u00f9 del 10% dei propri guadagni alle organizzazioni benefiche che ritengono essere le pi\u00f9 efficaci, e pi\u00f9 di 100.000 persone hanno fatto almeno una donazione basandosi sui consigli di GiveWell .</p><p>Spesso si pensa che l\u2019altruismo efficace si basi esclusivamente sul donare denaro a non-profit che si occupano di salute globale o \u2018guadagnare per donare\u2019 (dall\u2019inglese \u2018Earn to Give\u2019). In realt\u00e0 meno della met\u00e0 delle donazioni va a queste non-profit, solo una piccola parte della comunit\u00e0 guadagna per donare e nell\u2019altruismo efficace usare in modo efficace il proprio tempo \u00e8 importante quanto usare il proprio denaro. Al contrario,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/make-a-difference-with-your-career/\">secondo 80.000 Ore</a> per molte persone decidere quale carriera lavorativa intraprendere \u00e8 molto pi\u00f9 importante che decidere a chi donare.

Allo stesso modo, anche se alcuni donano in beneficenza pi\u00f9 del 50% dei loro guadagni, altri donano solo l\u20191%.</p><p>Le tue stesse decisioni si baseranno in parte sulle tue convinzioni morali e in parte sulle tue condizioni di vita. Per molte persone semplicemente non \u00e8 possibile avere come obiettivo principale nella vita l\u2019aiutare il prossimo.</p><p>E anche se vuoi renderlo un obiettivo importante, farlo diventare l\u2019unico obiettivo spesso \u00e8 controproducente. In primo luogo, perch\u00e9 ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 importante da un punto di vista morale \u00e8 molto dubbio ed \u00e8 facile provocare danni concentrandosi su un unico obiettivo morale mal definito a scapito di tutti gli altri. In secondo luogo, avere un unico obiettivo non \u00e8 in linea con la psicologia della maggior parte delle persone e tende a mandare in burnout, portando a un minore impatto sul lungo periodo.</p><p><strong>Perch\u00e9 la comunit\u00e0 di altruismo efficace non si concentra su problemi pi\u00f9 convenzionali come X o Y?</strong></p><p>Un fattore chiave da tenere in considerazione per decidere su quale problema concentrarsi \u00e8 comprendere il modo in cui la societ\u00e0 attuale distribuisce le risorse. Se un problema importante \u00e8 gi\u00e0 noto a molte persone, allora \u00e8 probabile che molte persone stiano gi\u00e0 cercando di trovarvi una soluzione. Questo vuol dire che di solito poche persone in pi\u00f9 che decidono di lavorare su quel problema faranno pi\u00f9 fatica ad avere un impatto molto grande. A parit\u00e0 di condizioni, \u00e8 possibile fare molto di pi\u00f9 in un campo che non riceve l\u2019attenzione che meriterebbe. Ci si pu\u00f2 avvicinare alla questione pensandola come un \u201cdossier mondiale\u201d: qual \u00e8 il modo migliore per distribuire risorse tra tutti i problemi sociali?

Se pi\u00f9 persone si interessano all\u2019altruismo efficace, i problemi su cui ci si concentra oggi smetteranno di essere i pi\u00f9 trascurati e la comunit\u00e0 amplier\u00e0 le sue vedute o porter\u00e0 la sua attenzione su problemi nuovi.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/faqs-criticism-objections\">Le domande pi\u00f9 frequenti sull\u2019altruismo efficace</a>.</p><p><strong>Quali sono le principali critiche all\u2019altruismo efficace?</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/faqs-criticism-objections#what-if-i-dont-think-effective-altruisms-practical-suggestions-are-effective\">E se non fossi d\u2019accordo sull\u2019efficacia dei progetti citati in questo articolo?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/faqs-criticism-objections#is-effective-altruism-only-about-making-money-and-donating-it-to-charity\">L\u2019altruismo efficace si basa solo sul guadagnare denaro e donarlo in beneficenza?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/faqs-criticism-objections#is-effective-altruism-the-same-as-utilitarianism-what-if-im-not-a-utilitarian\">Altruismo efficace e utilitarismo sono la stessa cosa?

Non c\u2019\u00e8 nulla di male in questo, ma pensiamo che almeno qualche volta dovremmo chiederci:</p><ul><li>\u201cCome posso capire se questa idea \u00e8 vera?\u201d</li><li>\u201cQuali prove sarebbero necessarie per convincermi che mi sbagliavo su un\u2019idea?\u201d</li><li>\u201cSe \u00e8 vera, significa che dovrei cambiare il modo in cui faccio certe cose e quali?

Dovremmo anche incoraggiare attivamente le persone a parlare quando sono in disaccordo e indagare da dove vengono queste divergenze. Per esempio, se la comunit\u00e0 medica \u00e8 in dubbio se sia migliore il trattamento A o il B per curare una malattia, dovrebbe analizzare a fondo le ragioni di quelle divergenze, perch\u00e9 la risposta giusta \u00e8 importante: ci sono delle vite a rischio. Se inizialmente eri in disaccordo con qualcuno, ma poi cambi idea, ammetterlo pu\u00f2 essere difficile, ma secondo noi dovresti esserne contento.</p><p>Rendere le conversazioni pi\u00f9 chiare cambiando idea di fronte ad argomenti che trovi convincenti aiuter\u00e0 la comunit\u00e0 ad agire per salvare vite in maniera pi\u00f9 efficace. Anche se non pensi che alla fine concorderai con l\u2019altra persona, imparerai di pi\u00f9 se ammetti di essere in disaccordo e cerchi di&nbsp;<i>capire</i> di preciso come e perch\u00e9 la sua visione non combacia con la tua.</p><h2><strong>Essere consapevoli del nostro privilegio e della seriet\u00e0 di questi problemi</strong></h2><p>Non dovremmo mai dimenticare il privilegio che abbiamo quando leggiamo e discutiamo di queste idee, n\u00e9 che stiamo parlando di vite reali. Possiamo ritenerci fortunati nel trovarci nella posizione di poter avere una grande impatto e questa opportunit\u00e0 \u00e8 la conseguenza di un mondo profondamente ingiusto. Sii anche consapevole del fatto che in questo programma le persone si avvicinano a queste discussioni con idee, trascorsi e conoscenze differenti. Ci si pu\u00f2 sentire a disagio nel discutere di alcuni di questi argomenti - che \u00e8 uno dei motivi per cui sono sia cos\u00ec trascurati che cos\u00ec importanti - soprattutto se ci sono legami personali con alcuni di questi ambiti.</p><h2><strong>Continuare ad esplorare</strong></h2><p>Lo scopo di questo corso \u00e8 presentare l\u2019altruismo efficace in modo strutturato.

Of these,&nbsp;<strong>UVGI technology is the most promising</strong> because it can reach considerably higher levels of eACH by directly inactivating pathogens (20+ eACH), it is more energy efficient, and produces no noise pollution<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrbu2vvd9lk8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrbu2vvd9lk8\">[3]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp; <strong>Filtration is a viable option for high levels of eACH up to CDC hospital standards (8-12 eACH), where it is still relatively cost-effective.&nbsp;</strong>It also helps to reduce particulate and chemical pollution, which is relevant for immediate health concerns, such as chronic respiratory health and everyday cognitive functioning.</p><p>Within UVGI, there are two relevant types: upper-room UVC and low-wavelength light (also called far UVC).&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Upper-room UVC</strong> is more cost-effective than other IAQ interventions and, if installed correctly, is safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Low-wavelength light&nbsp;</strong>(also referred to as far UVC)<strong>&nbsp;</strong>can be used to reduce surface and close contact transmission as well as airborne transmission, making it&nbsp;<strong>potentially the most effective intervention</strong> for reducing global catastrophic biorisk, but there is a lack of long-term human safety data, and the price is currently too high for at-scale deployment.</li></ul><p>We estimate that the mass deployment of indoor air quality interventions, like ventilation, filtration, and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), would reduce transmission of a measles-like pathogen by 68%.&nbsp;<strong>This amounts to ~1/3rd of the total effort needed to prevent a pandemic of any similarly transmissible pathogen</strong> and would serve as an important layer of biodefense.</p><p><strong>Overall, we can be confident that these interventions effectively reduce pathogen load in the air, but we cannot precisely estimate their impact on population-level transmission.&nbsp;</strong>Ideally, to achieve that impact estimate, we would need a detailed model with a wide array of varying inputs built using experimental data from observed transmissions.</p><h2>How can we accelerate the deployment of IAQ-related interventions?</h2><p>Despite the existence of promising technologies, several bottlenecks are preventing the mass deployment of IAQ interventions.

They call for varying amounts of ventilation based on occupancy, use, and a constant for area - working out to be approximately 1-2 ACH in residences and offices (though half of studied buildings fall below ASHRAE standards). The standards do not consider airborne pathogens. More stringent requirements can be found for healthcare settings, defined in ASHRAE 170.&nbsp;</li><li><strong><u>Occupational Safety and Health Administration</u>: </strong>OSHA has authority to regulate air in indoor workplace settings. Its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.stpub.com/bid/201820/OSHA-Protecting-Workers-From-Workplace-Air-Contaminants\"><u>regulations tend to be fairly weak</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/publications/3430indoor-air-quality-sm.pdf\"><u>only address particulate and chemical pollutants</u></a>, and are primarily based upon ASHRAE guidelines. In facilities that are not expected to produce large amounts of pollutants, OSHA demands only a self-certification form, and in environments where pollutants might be more common, only some chemicals are regulated, with a generic requirement for employers to protect against known harms.&nbsp;</li><li><strong><u>Environmental Protection Agency:</u></strong> EPA is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/regulatory-information-topic/regulatory-and-guidance-information-topic-air#indoorair\"><u>responsible for outdoor air quality but does not regulate indoor air quality</u></a>; it primarily focuses on greenhouse gasses, radiation, and common hazardous gaseous and particulate pollutants. However, it does&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq\"><u>provide resources</u></a> for people seeking to independently improve their indoor air quality.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Federal efforts have been proposed to increase US air quality: the American Pandemic Preparedness Plan (AP3) proposed allocating $3.1B for \u201cnext-gen PPE and built environment improvements\u201d (with no indication of the split between the two), but AP3 did not pass. Despite this setback, the Biden administration&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2022/12/08/fact-sheet-departments-and-agencies-commit-to-cleaner-indoor-air-across-the-nation/\"><u>released a plan to advance indoor air quality nationwide</u></a> by upgrading the filtration and ventilation of federally owned buildings, funding air quality research and identifying gaps, and providing resources and incentives for upgrades in schools and residential buildings.

Aside from eACH, indoor air standards may also be measured by the clean air delivery rate (CADR) calculated by a filter\u2019s air flow rate in cubic feet per minute, or by parts per million (PPM) in the case of particulate and chemical pollutants. All air cleanliness measurements are imperfect proxies for assessing the safety of a room with respect to disease transmission. First, the relationship between amount of pathogen inhaled and cases of infection is unclear, and probably varies for different pathogens. Second, because some IAQ interventions like ultraviolet and low-wavelength disinfection inactivate pathogens at variable rates, the eACH will vary for different pathogens.</p><h1>What is the Problem?</h1><h2>Pandemic respiratory disease</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant damage worldwide but was by no means unusually destructive. There have been far more lethal historical pandemics, such as the Black Death and the 1918 Spanish Flu, which have killed 20-100 million people (5-10% of the world population at the time). While the burden of endemic infectious disease has trended downward, it is unclear whether the risk of natural catastrophic pandemics is increasing or decreasing<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqs1sjkixlm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqs1sjkixlm\">[6]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>While naturally evolved pathogens could lead to globally catastrophic pandemics (i.e. destabilizing enough to threaten the entire future of humanity) , evolution tends to optimize for reproductive fitness, rather than optimal virulence.&nbsp;<strong>On the other hand, bioengineered pathogens could be developed that are much more dangerous than any with natural origins</strong>. As biotechnology progresses and biotechnological capacity diffuses more widely, the accidental or deliberate release of an engineered pathogen becomes increasingly likely.</p><p>Regardless of whether a pathogen is natural or engineered, deliberately or accidentally released, some attributes are likely to be essential components of x-risk level pathogens.

For most common respiratory pathogens (aside from COVID-19 and to an extent, influenza) the data required to make meaningful quantitative predictions does not currently exist.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IAQ interventions to prevent disease primarily act on aerosolized particles.</strong> The impact of IAQ on disease transmission is&nbsp;<strong>dependent on the fraction of pathogen transmission attributable to airborne transmission</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>While some diseases, most notably&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-021-00535-6#:~:text=Respiratory%20viruses%20can%20be%20transmitted,droplets%20and%20(fine)%20aerosols.\"><u>COVID-19, TB, and chickenpox</u></a>, are widely accepted to be dominantly airborne, most respiratory pathogens have historically been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/disease/spread.htm\"><u>assumed to be primarily driven by large droplet/fomite transmission</u></a>.

Only 5-10% of people infected with the bacteria ever develop symptoms, most can carry the disease for life without ever knowing. TB is transmitted through the air by aerosol droplets from people with active symptoms. It is extremely infectious; fewer than ten bacteria may cause an infection, compared to as many as 40,000 bacteria in a single sneeze. As a result, a quarter of the world\u2019s population has been infected. In a 1961&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/arrd.1962.85.4.511?journalCode=arrd\"><u>study</u></a>, a team from Johns Hopkins exposed two groups of guinea pigs to air from a TB ward, the air going to one group having been irradiated with UV light first, in order to demonstrate airborne transmission. Infections only appeared in the group with untreated air, showing in the process that UV light is effective at killing the pathogen.</p><p><strong><u>Common cold viruses:</u>&nbsp;</strong>From the 1970s to the 1980s, two teams carried out human challenge trials on rhinovirus, where volunteers challenged with rhinovirus interacted with healthy volunteers.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.7326/0003-4819-88-4-463\"><u>The first, in 1978 in Virginia</u></a>, found that&nbsp; hand-to-hand transmission is an efficient way to transfer rhinovirus infection, while attempts to cause large droplet and aerosol spread mostly failed. Then in a three-study series running through 1987, a Wisconsin team&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1093/infdis/150.2.195\"><u>built a challenge model</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/30105370.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A815ba0bfb22c6c893d03f290d4c02ddf&amp;ab_segments=&amp;origin=&amp;acceptTC=1\"><u>found virucidal treated tissues were effective in preventing transmission</u></a> of rhinovirus, and found that inducing<a href=\"https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1093/infdis/156.3.442\"><u> infection via a fomite and large droplet route was ineffective</u></a>, while measures designed to specifically induce aerosol routes of transmission maintained high attack rates.</p><p>The two teams came to two separate determinations of the importance of aerosol transmission. However, the Wisconsin studies were more likely to generate accurate results. For example, efforts (not described in the paper) were made to reduce air leakage in the Wisconsin study<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwlxk76c34jn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwlxk76c34jn\">[8]</a></sup></span>. Despite these controlled natural exposure studies being some of the highest-quality research ever performed on pathogen transmission, the results have not caused significant change.</p><p>Another study&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sci-hub.se/10.1001/jama.1988.03720140028029\"><u>in an Army barracks</u></a> demonstrated a newer building with a lower ventilation rate was associated with an average of 45% higher risk of common cold infection (typically adenovirus), providing strong evidence that aerosol transmission is important for other common cold pathogens.&nbsp;</p><p>In general, despite the more limited range of studies, convincing evidence shows a significantly higher fraction of transmission might be via the aerosol route than historically acknowledged. We think it is reasonable to say that between 20% and 90% of common cold transmission occurs through the aerosol route.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>More research into airborne disease transmission is highly warranted. Given existing pandemic history and pandemic potential stemming from characteristics of the diseases listed above, less dangerous pathogens such as flu strains used in challenge trials or common cold strains might be used to analyze airborne disease transmission in great detail. In performing such analysis, it would be vital to limit the possibility of dual-use research (i.e., research that could be used both maliciously and benevolently) by ensuring that research was focused on limiting the spread of existing or strictly weakened forms of pathogens rather than engineering pathogens to be more transmissible.&nbsp;</p><h2>Limitations</h2><p>The body of work on this topic is of limited size and quality. Simply isolating a mode of transmission (even before attempting to quantify importance) outside of a highly controlled environment is difficult, and many observational studies suffer from confounding variables. Methods exist to retrospectively model the importance of various transmission routes based on previous data, but suffer from significant gaps limiting use.</p><p>Another challenge for both interpretation and usability of data are the development of pervasive errors in the medical literature, significant enough to obviate the results of some studies. Some of the most common are:</p><ul><li><strong>Aerosol size:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ina.12970\"><u>Many studies assume a binary cutoff of 5um</u></a> for aerosolized pathogens, and assume that every other pathogen acts ballistically (following a trajectory towards the ground).

These interventions are valuable because they are relatively pathogen agnostic and can act as a layer of passive biodefense (compared to developing a specific vaccine).</p><p>Ventilation exchanging outdoor air with indoor directly achieves true air turnover, whereas&nbsp;<strong>filtering and UVGI impact is measured in equivalent air changes per hour (eACH)</strong>. The resultant eACH in a room outfitted with filters or UVGI lights depends on several different factors, including the quality of the filter or power of the lights, the number and placement of lights or filters, and air mixing.

Low-wavelength LED technology requires further fundamental research into materials and manufacturing techniques in order to improve efficiency and cost. For an extremely rough estimate, we can say that the requisite research might be part of a PhD program, taking about 5 years (assuming multiple streams of research/multiple PhD programs running in parallel). Then assuming that some of those research pathways are successful, demonstrating that efficient, cost-effective low-wavelength LEDs are feasible, it might take another 5 years to achieve full commercialization.&nbsp;</p><h2>Cost and cost-effectiveness of different mechanical interventions</h2><p>While the potential and expected impact on airborne pathogen transmission matter more for assessing the attractiveness of different mechanical interventions from an x-risk perspective, cost and cost-effectiveness matters to government and corporate adopters since these potential adopters are more likely to adopt these interventions at particular price points.&nbsp;</p><p>As a case study in the cost of upgrading ventilation for a large public space, the Center for Health Security&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/pubs_archive/pubs-pdfs/2021/20210526-school-ventilation.pdf\"><u>report on school ventilation</u></a> (Appendix F) focuses on a direct comparison between the cost-effectiveness of ventilation versus the early CDC surface cleaning guidelines. A more comprehensive analysis was prevented by the knowledge gaps in aerosol transmission discussed below. Based on expert interviews, the report estimates that a school would need $6,000 per classroom for upgrading HVAC systems to provide air quality equivalent to about 5 to 7 air changes per hour (ACH). At an estimate of 2.5 million public school classrooms nationwide, the cost of upgrading all schools would be $15 billion (although students in each upgraded school would benefit before all schools were upgraded, so the total outlay is not needed for intermediate benefits).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.31.20249101v1\"><u>Rothamer et. al.</u></a> show that increasing airflow in a schoolroom from their measured baseline of 1.34 ACH to 5 ACH reduces the probability of infection by about half.</p><p>This report only includes the cost for upgrading systems and running new systems at a basic level, but does not include the costs of post-upgrade energy consumption. If upgrades are done primarily through ventilation, there is substantial added energy consumption, estimated by one expert at a 15-20% overall energy cost increase for 10 eACH throughout a school.</p><p>In order to estimate the cost of upgrading the general stock of public buildings in the US, we\u2019ll use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://constructionphysics.substack.com/p/every-building-in-america-an-analysis\"><u>published estimate that educational space uses 14% of commercial floorspace</u></a> in the US. We\u2019ll additionally estimate that public K-12 buildings are about half of that floorspace, so 7% of commercial floorspace.&nbsp;<strong>Then the total cost of upgrading the air quality systems in all the commercial buildings in the US would come to about $214 billion</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo7hmf90xtn\"><sup><a href=\"#fno7hmf90xtn\">[9]</a></sup></span><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>This figure is prohibitively expensive for rapid implementation. However, it assumes the cost of upgrading systems stays fixed, but this field is getting increased attention and investment so costs might come down considerably over the next decade.&nbsp;<strong>Also, more targeted programs addressing high-priority public spaces as an intermediate step would be less expensive and still reduce pandemic risk and improve everyday health.</strong> For example, building on the estimate of $15 billion to upgrade public primary education facilities, we can produce the following upgrade cost estimates using the percentage breakdown of commercial building stock:</p><ul><li>Healthcare facilities and hospitals, 4.7% of commercial floorspace: $10.1 billion</li><li>Food service, 2.1% of commercial floorspace: $4.3 billion</li><li>Public assembly space, 6.4% of floorspace: $13.7 billion</li><li>Malls, 6.8% of commercial floorspace: $14.6 billion</li><li>Offices, 18.3% of commercial floorspace: $39.2 billion</li><li>Religious institutions, 5.2% of commercial floorspace: $11.1 billion</li></ul><p><strong>If upgrades to public buildings were to be implemented across a decade in the US, $21 billion a year would be spent on a complete air quality upgrade program</strong>. For comparison, in 2021 alone, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pgpf.org/budget-basics/budget-explainer-national-defense\"><u>US Department of Defense spent</u></a> $10 billion on facilities maintenance and construction and $141 billion on weapons and systems procurement. We use the comparison with defense spending because biosecurity is an important component of national security and these figures demonstrate what people are willing to spend on defense, not because we would expect government spending to fully fund this program.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Researchers from the Institute for Progress and the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://progress.institute/weighing-the-cost-of-the-pandemic/\"><strong><u>demonstrate that the COVID pandemic cost the US at least $10 trillion</u></strong></a><strong> in combined economic and health losses</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefimexe2rgghg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnimexe2rgghg\">[10]</a></sup></span><strong>.</strong> Using their lower-bound numbers and lenient assumptions for a future pandemic (half as destructive as COVID), they estimate that it would be worth $50 billion to reduce the risk of a future pandemic by 1%.

As a baseline, the model estimates that mechanical ventilation alone provides about one air change for about $135.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Modeling the efficacy of interventions</h2><p>Currently, models to predict the efficacy of air safety interventions exist. However, a lack of real-world data means that many lack real-world validation, and&nbsp;<strong>most models are unsuitable for predicting the efficacy of airborne interventions for averting pandemics</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because:</p><ul><li>The mathematical models in common use are not experimentally validated for a robust set of infection scenarios.</li><li>For any set of scenarios, we don't yet have a good link between room-scale and population-scale transmission.</li></ul><p>Ideally, to be more confident about estimating the efficacy of any air safety intervention,&nbsp;<strong>we would need a detailed model with a wide array of varying inputs that was built using experimental data from observed transmissions</strong>.</p><h3><strong><u>Room-scale models</u></strong></h3><p>Room scale models predict the efficacy of interventions on a small scale. Specifically, they assess the probability of infection based on the mix of susceptible and infectious people occupying a space, and the rate at which an infectious person is able to infect susceptibles.&nbsp;</p><p>The most common method is based on the Wells-Riley equation, which expresses pathogen emission from infectors in terms of quanta, a single quanta being the average amount of pathogens required to cause an infection. The standard equation assumes a perfectly-well mixed room, meaning that each emitted quantum has a 63% chance to cause infection in a susceptible individual, assuming no removal of pathogens from the air.&nbsp;</p><p>The difficulty with this model is estimating the quantum generation rate, which is calculated backward from epidemiological studies, but involves a significant amount of inherent uncertainty. In general, the rest of the model (assuming a well-mixed environment) follows numerically from this quantum generation rate, meaning most of the uncertainty in the model (such as pathogen emission and infectivity) is included in this number.</p><p>Additionally, assuming a well-mixed environment can cause significant errors. However, there are efforts to improve upon the basic model, by estimating quantum emission rate by what fraction of air is rebreathed, based on real-world examination of CO<sub>2</sub> levels.</p><h3><strong><u>City-scale models</u></strong></h3><p>Most population models use the SEIR model, which stands for \u201csusceptible, exposed, infected, recovered.\u201d This is a set of differential equations that dictates the chance of a susceptible person becoming infected based upon number of exposures to infectors in a simulated population, and adjusts this chance based on the proportion of the population currently infectious.</p><p>However, to model the effect of the deployment of air safety interventions, assuming a homogeneous population is not appropriate. Unlike a universal masking policy, or vaccination, which can be modeled to have more general effects, air safety interventions may have very different impacts on the progression of a pandemic depending on the environment of deployment (e.g. installations in a restaurant may have very different effects to installation in schools).</p><p>To avoid this problem, an SEIR model can be combined with a simulation of a population, where the population is split up into different classes of people (such as children, teachers, workers, stay-at-homes etc), and different environments (such as supermarkets, schools, offices, homes etc). By modeling SEIRs through this population, the effect of reducing spread in particular areas can be estimated. Constraints on computing power are a problem for more complex models that involve modeling of different types of population, such as the variance between large cities in different countries or the difference between a city and a rural environment.</p><h3><strong><u>Integration of room- and city-scale models</u></strong></h3><p>Currently literature using such models is sparse. One simplified model of Hong Kong predicts that increasing ventilation rates by 5 ACH in all public buildings&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5017609/\"><u>reduces attack rate of smallpox by ~80% and total infection by ~97%</u></a> in a medium transmission scenario.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969716313535\"><u>The same model</u></a> showed a similar increase in ventilation rates had significant effects on reducing peak and total infections in simulated influenza outbreaks even with varying proportions of airborne transmission. A later,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132317305188\"><u>more detailed Wells-Riley/human behavior integrated model</u></a> predicted that increasing ventilation in all buildings threefold (to 3-6 ACH depending on building) would suppress a smallpox outbreak. These papers provide specific examples of an end-to-end generated model, but they use pathogen and intervention strategies different enough from a catastrophic outbreak that the results are not particularly generalizable.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1177/1420326X09104141\"><u>Studies using a Wells-Riley equation</u></a> to model the effect of ventilation on population transmission predicted ventilation rates up to 12 ACH brought a hypothetical airborne virus with a quantum emission rate of ~26 from an R<sub>0</sub> of ~10 to &lt;1.

These models, aiming to provide a more general estimation technique, do not simulate a population, instead integrating the Wells-Riley with a standard SEIR model. In addition, unlike many models focused on current endemic pathogens, these do not account for cost-effectiveness.</p><h3><strong><u>How could models be improved?</u></strong></h3><p>Ideally, a model would be able to predict the efficacy of air safety interventions, taking into account:</p><ul><li>Infectivity of a pathogen, including shedding rates of an infected person, infectious dose, and incubation period.</li><li>Effectiveness of air safety interventions (most likely in terms of a general factor such as eACH).</li><li>Effectiveness of air safety interventions taking into account uptake rate and environment.</li><li>Effectiveness of air safety interventions when combined with other interventions (such as masking, lockdowns, medical countermeasures), even when these might be deployed later on in pandemic progression.</li></ul><p>A model should then be able to predict:</p><ul><li>Effect of air safety interventions on reducing R<sub>0</sub> in a certain population, given infectivity of a pathogen.</li><li>Extent of pandemic control of air safety interventions, both alone and with other pandemic control measures (how much more infectious would a pathogen need to become a global catastrophic pandemic after deployment of air safety interventions).</li><li>Ability of air safety interventions to buy time to implement other measures (what range of pathogens will humanity have time to respond to which we would not have absent air safety interventions).</li><li>Effect of air safety interventions on other pandemic control measures (if supermarkets, hospitals e.g. have stringent air safety interventions, could a lockdown have a greater chance of bringing a pandemic under control than you would predict on transmission reduction alone?).</li></ul><p><strong>Existing efficacy studies:&nbsp;</strong>Studies investigating various interventions are largely unhelpful for validating models or understanding the effect of those interventions at a population level. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67211-2\"><u>recent</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08462-z\"><u>studies</u></a> in laboratory chambers clearly demonstrates how low-wavelength light greatly reduces pathogen load in the air, but that reduction in pathogen load cannot be directly connected to precise reduction in transmission. There are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7090536/\"><u>studies that estimate the infectious dose</u></a> of various pathogens, but they provide an imperfect bridge to population-level intervention efficacy models, due to the wide range of estimates and the variation among individuals. On the other hand, several studies intended to directly investigate the effect of interventions have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/336/7635/77\"><u>serious issues with methodology and practicality</u></a> that limit their usefulness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Rough estimate of impact from improvements in built environments</h2><p>While there currently is not a robust model for predicting the efficacy of indoor air safety interventions,&nbsp;<strong>in this section we hope to provide a reasonable sketch of how much air quality improvements in public spaces can reduce disease transmission</strong>. When considering air quality upgrades in built environments, we focus on public spaces where superspreader events are more likely and improvements are easier to confirm.&nbsp;<strong>The following calculation is extremely rough and a more informative, detailed model is sorely needed for a full analysis of possible public health measures</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Say that 95% of transmission occurs indoors, that 80% of transmission occurs in public spaces<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefea2ve0wvtk8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnea2ve0wvtk8\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(including offices, schools, gyms, theaters, eateries, etc.), and that ideal adoption of current pathogen mitigation measures in public environments (including ventilation, filtration, and use of germicidal UV light, especially upper-room UV) can reduce transmission by 90%. Each of these factors is independent of the others<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref26ad1cyod47\"><sup><a href=\"#fn26ad1cyod47\">[23]</a></sup></span>, so<strong> by using the described program of air quality interventions to address transmission in public spaces, overall transmission in the population can be reduced by 68%</strong>.</p><p><strong>The most transmissible pathogen we know of is measles, which is estimated to have an R<sub>0</sub> of around 20. Say that the goal of a pandemic prevention program is to reduce pathogen transmission by 98%, bringing R<sub>0</sub> of measles to 0.4, thereby preventing a pandemic of any similarly transmissible pathogen.&nbsp;</strong>In order to achieve this goal, various types of interventions will need to be used in conjunction, such as combining indoor air cleaning with widespread use of personal protective equipment. In particular, there is room for significant further development of PPE and UV lights, which could make both interventions more effective and easier to adopt at large scales.&nbsp;</p><p>The value of the described program (reducing transmission by 68%) relative to the absolute goal (reducing transmission by 98%) can then be considered as logarithmic progress toward the overall goal, with further investment to be made.<strong> The intervention program is then about 29%</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdadxhaq6p7b\"><sup><a href=\"#fndadxhaq6p7b\">[24]</a></sup></span><strong>&nbsp;of the total effort needed to achieve a transmission reduction of 98%</strong>. In estimating that proportion, we assume that other intervention programs, such as development and distribution of improved personal protective equipment, could be \u201cstacked\u201d with this indoor air intervention program for roughly the same cost.&nbsp;<strong>We prioritize this program not because of obvious cost favorability</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjz32f715o4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjz32f715o4\">[25]</a></sup></span><strong>, but because of its capacity to address superspreader events and international spread (e.g., by greatly reducing transmission in airports), and because it is a program of \u201cpassive\u201d interventions, which do not rely on individuals\u2019 actions to achieve the majority of the gains.</strong> (Contrast this with the \u201cactive\u201d interventions described in Kevin Esvelt\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dam.gcsp.ch/files/doc/gcsp-geneva-paper-29-22\"><u>\u201cDelay, Detect, Defend\u201d Geneva Paper</u></a>, such as equipment, resilient production, and diagnostics.)&nbsp;</p><p>This transmission sketch is extremely rough on many counts. Further technological development of interventions could reduce transmission even further; conversely, we cannot expect ideal adoption of mitigation measures, so changes to public built environments can only be one tool used in fighting pandemics. In addition, this value estimate does not address the value of reducing R<sub>0</sub>, even if R<sub>0</sub> does not fall below 1. An intervention program that fell short of averting a pandemic could still be enormously valuable by buying extra time to develop and distribute medical countermeasures such as vaccines and PPE. Also, in this estimate, we assume there is no self-correcting behavior in the population as a result of IAQ interventions<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1c9v06cz81f\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1c9v06cz81f\">[26]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Overall, we can be confident that these interventions effectively reduce pathogen load in the air, but we cannot precisely estimate their impact on population-level transmission without a detailed model</strong> (see recommendation further down).</p><h1>Bottlenecks and Funding Opportunities</h1><h2>What are the bottlenecks?</h2><ol><li><i><strong>Highly general, imperfect metrics</strong></i>: Existing air quality metrics, such as those set by ASHRAE, are not ideal targets for air quality interventions. Targets should be based on a model that is responsive to changing variables inherent in real-world situations, which would be better able to estimate both ambient pathogen load in a room and the pathogen load that an individual receives.&nbsp;</li><li><i><strong>Difficulty in understanding the relationship between pathogen load and infection cases</strong></i>: The relationship between received pathogen load and infection cases is unclear in general, and will be different for different pathogens. Even given better estimates of pathogen load through a detailed model, the research necessary to experimentally determine the relationship between air quality and infection rates will be complex and costly.</li><li><i><strong>Expense of existing air cleaning systems</strong></i>: Installing upper-room UV lights and more filters in rooms is expensive on a per-unit basis, and upgrading ventilation systems involves not only up-front expense, but the additional increase in energy costs over the lifetime of a building. In many cases, the party responsible for such upgrades/installations may not be the party to benefit from the upgrades, or may consider the benefits uncertain.</li><li><i><strong>Expense of improving air cleaning technology</strong></i>: Improving air cleaning technology will require large investments, particularly when considering that the low-wavelength light systems needed to eliminate pathogens at a conversational distance requires both technological development and safety/efficacy testing.</li><li><i><strong>Difficulty of wide-scale change</strong></i>: Wide-scale air improvements in air quality may require changes to building codes, similar to improvements in fire safety. Policy change can be enormously slow, and building codes are typically the purview of individual municipalities or counties, which would fragment any policy push. An alternative that might be pursued more immediately is campaigning for voluntary corporate adoption, which requires expensive indoor air quality improvements to carry a significant positive reputation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><i><strong>Public distrust of UV light</strong></i>: People primarily associate UV light with cancer risk, and it may be difficult to communicate technical safety details, such as the safety of upper-room installations or the difference between bands in the UV spectrum.</li></ol><p>Each of the recommendations below will be associated by number with the bottlenecks we believe are addressed through that recommendation.&nbsp;</p><h2>What can new funding accomplish?</h2><p>Funding opportunities exist in advocacy, changing costs and manufacturing, and research.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong><u>Advocacy</u></strong>: Some presently attractive advocacy projects include: development of an ASHRAE anti-infection standard; recruiting high-status businesses to conduct pilots; improving air quality in schools; and creating an umbrella advocacy group.</li><li><strong><u>Costs and manufacturing</u></strong>: Advanced market commitments and other forms of investment could drive down the cost of low-wavelength LEDs and other interventions.</li><li><strong><u>Research</u></strong>: Attractive research opportunities include: (a) establishing the safety of low-wavelength light and (b) creating reliable ways to test intervention efficacy, which could include experimental pilot programs or controlled natural exposure challenge studies.&nbsp;</li></ol><h3><strong><u>Advocacy</u></strong></h3><p>IAQ policymaking occurs along an adoption curve that includes implementation by businesses, voluntary certification codes, retrofitting government buildings (like schools), subsidies for private renovations, building code requirements for new construction, and codes requiring implementation in existing buildings. We see three advocacy opportunities as immediately attractive:</p><ul><li><strong><u>Corporate Early Adopters</u>: </strong>Promoting the piloting of air quality measures by pro-science corporate and educational institutions (like Google or Stanford) can generate experimental evidence, define templates for intervention programs, establish interventions as desirable, and build a constituency for further advocacy. To give an example, a rough highest cost estimate for fitting out Google\u2019s primary campus with upper-room UVGI comes to (based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/ventilation/uvgi.html#anchor_1617895048849\">$2500 per 500ft</a> over<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/05/17/see-googles-futuristic-new-1-1-million-square-foot-bay-view-campus/\"> 1.1m ft2</a>) $5.5m.

Generating a voluntary ASHRAE standard on clean air quality will de-risk adoption for government and corporate decision-makers.&nbsp;<i>(Addresses bottlenecks 5 and 6.)</i></li><li><strong><u>School Deployment in Pilot Jurisdictions</u>: </strong>Pandemic-proofing schools to prevent learning loss is a timely political goal, and some state and local governments may have COVID relief funds they will need to return if unspent.&nbsp;<i>(Addresses bottlenecks 2, 5, and 6.)</i></li></ul><p>Other potentially attractive opportunities are:</p><ul><li><strong><u>Attaching IAQ projects to anti-recessionary policies</u>: </strong>A perennial problem for anti-recessionary fiscal policy is a lack of \u201cshovel-ready\u201d projects to fund during an economic downturn. Maintaining a warm base of renovation and construction capacity for IAQ retrofits could then be tied into stabilizer legislation that would automatically purchase tens of billions of dollars worth of IAQ installation in the event of a downturn.<i> (Addresses bottlenecks 3 and 5.)</i></li><li><strong><u>Tax subsidies</u>: </strong>Governments could subsidize installation of basic, known effective interventions in schools, offices, restaurants, and other congregate settings.&nbsp;<i>(Addresses bottlenecks 3, 5, and 6.)</i></li><li><strong><u>Encouraging inspections and data collection on IAQ:</u>&nbsp;</strong>Establishments are already subject to regular health and safety inspections, so mandating that these inspectors carry a carbon dioxide detector will generate baseline data that serves as a proxy measure for eACH.

(<i>Could address all bottlenecks.)</i>&nbsp;</li></ul><h3><strong><u>Cost and manufacturing</u></strong></h3><p>An advanced market commitment (AMC), funded by government, philanthropy, or business, could spur development of a product by committing to a purchase once technology meets certain specifications. AMCs already have a track record, such as Operation Warp Speed, which incentivized COVID vaccine development and acquired COVID vaccines in the US. One likely use-case could be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-6732/8/6/196/htm\"><u>development of LED-style</u></a> low-wavelength lamps&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsphotonics.2c00041\"><u>to replace KrCl lamps</u></a> (currently expensive and produced by only&nbsp; a few manufacturers<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuw6m0og00xf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuw6m0og00xf\">[27]</a></sup></span>). There may also be relatively expensive products in the upper-room UV and filtration arena where cost could be reduced by guaranteeing purchases at greater scale, possibly as a way of subsidizing early pilot experimentation.</p><p><strong>As of right now, it appears that it is possible to create low-wavelength LEDs, but it is unclear whether they can be manufactured in a reliable and cost-effective way</strong>. The blue LED was only developed in the 1990s and was considered a major breakthrough at the time; even lower-wavelength LEDs are likely to require the development of new semiconductors or new manufacturing methods. However, once low-wavelength LED manufacturing can be made reliable at a high quality, the demand is likely to be high (especially if supported by an AMC, as mentioned above). Another option for supporting this LED development is direct investment or funding for fundamental materials and manufacturing research. Such funding could take the form, for example, of support for PhD students or other researchers working in the field, which is well within the normal activities of several philanthropic or governmental organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong><u>Research</u></strong></h3><p><strong><u>Low-wavelength safety testing</u></strong>: Low-wavelength light is a potentially transformative intervention, and&nbsp;<strong>studies to develop a safety record sufficient for wide use in humans should be a high priority.</strong> Studies have already been successfully conducted on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7497027/\"><u>realistic 3D skin models</u></a>, with intense monitoring for damage, and some longer-term studies on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7497027/\"><u>mice made deliberately susceptible to tumors</u></a>. Interventions of a similar risk have been proposed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghdcenter.hms.harvard.edu/files/ghd_dubai/files/cancer_risk_cie187-2010_free_copy_march_2020-1.pdf\"><u>based on the evidence of models</u></a>. In-human longer-term studies could be feasible on a dedicated population (possibly an office block), with monitoring for early signs of damage, combined with an early efficacy study.</p><p><strong><u>Valid efficacy models</u>:&nbsp;</strong>Creating a way to experimentally test the efficacy of various IAQ interventions will be a necessary component of engendering and optimizing implementation over the long-term. One model to do so is the idea described above of randomizing experimental pilots in early adopters.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>CNE studies:</u>&nbsp;</strong>Another approach is to utilize controlled natural exposure (CNE)&nbsp; studies, which are a version of human challenge studies where uninfected \u201crecipient\u201d volunteers are exposed to infected \u201cdonor\u201d volunteers. Despite their ability to provide some of the highest-quality, cleanest quantitative data of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ina.12701\"><u>aerosols</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1093/infdis/156.3.442\"><u>transmission routes</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/30105370.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A815ba0bfb22c6c893d03f290d4c02ddf&amp;ab_segments=&amp;origin=&amp;acceptTC=1\"><u>interventions</u>, they&nbsp;</a>are uncommon,&nbsp; with only two large-scale studies in the last two decades - one in 2010, finishing with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7390452/\"><u>an attack rate too low to be of use</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reporter.nih.gov/search/cK_8orEFTkiFt2Lg8byE6w/project-details/10260845\"><u>one additional study planned over the next five years.</u></a></p><p>We think that exploration of CNE studies stands to be a valuable research contribution&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473309911701426\"><u>requiring a high level of cooperation</u></a> between fields. That said, these studies are still in their infancy; using them to experimentally test intervention efficacy may require significant investment on the order of tens of millions of dollars, which may not be cost-justified from an EA perspective.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong><u>Coordination</u></strong></h3><p>To provide a rough estimate of the impact of a widespread air quality campaign in the US, we made some basic assumptions about the timeline and possible impact of a campaign, and compared the result against a counterfactual baseline. You can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1To8FS6Jbe1Hz7C2NL_Moy72EwcnnrNZ_qZazv3wUTw0/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>see our calculation here</u></a> and input new assumptions to see how they affect a campaign\u2019s impact.</p><p>Many indoor air quality projects could build on each other and create momentum for further efforts, and a dedicated funding pathway could coordinate several complementary projects. For example, a useful long-term path might start by funding a set of scientific studies. As research produces further data on interventions and optimal programs, funding could be used for dedicated advocacy and deployment in partnership with early organizational adopters. This implementation would in turn lead to iterative research and wider deployment.</p><p>Projects in these areas could absorb significant amounts of funding along a wide range. For example:</p><ul><li>$25,000 could fund the development of a detailed infection model.</li><li>$20M could fund a single dedicated clinical project (e.g. something like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reporter.nih.gov/search/cK_8orEFTkiFt2Lg8byE6w/project-details/10260845\"><u>EMIT-2</u></a>).</li><li>$200M could fund a program consisting of several complementary projects (e.g. low-wavelength light safety studies, real-world efficacy studies for IAQ interventions, advocacy for improved pandemic preparedness standards, etc.).</li></ul><h2>Possibilities for immediate action</h2><ul><li><strong>Early adopters will be an important part of any push for improvements in indoor air quality, and organizations could begin to install upper-room UVGI and low-wave light immediately</strong>. Philanthropists or government bodies can be helpful here by providing partial or full funding to corporate partners who might not undertake this effort alone. Early adoption would allow efficacy data to be collected for different offices, providing real-world data to incorporate into detailed models.</li><li><strong>Low-wavelength UV light still needs extensive safety testing</strong>, and there is current interest from multiple groups in&nbsp;<strong>designing and running a safety test</strong>.</li><li><strong>More detailed models are needed to form the basis for improved standards</strong>; we know of at least one researcher, Jacob Bueno de Mesquita of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, who is in the process of developing such a model and is seeking funding to invest more time in it.&nbsp;<strong>A funder could provide funding to complete his model for about $25,000</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9fczonvzmkd\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9fczonvzmkd\">[28]</a></sup></span>.</li><li><strong>More investment is needed in low-wavelength LEDs, including in fundamental research of the type normally done through academic institutions</strong>. There are companies working on improving low-wavelength technology, but funders could add to this effort by supporting academic research in the area. As a basic heuristic, a PhD student costs roughly $70,000 per year, and an applied research project in this field might take about two years to demonstrate promise and another two to come to fruition.&nbsp;<strong>An example philanthropic program to support fundamental research in this area might therefore support five students for two years each and then choose two out of those five to support for another two years, for a total cost under $1 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><h1>Risk Factors</h1><p>There are a few reasons ways&nbsp; IAQ interventions could fail and could end up being harmful:</p><ul><li><strong>IAQ interventions fail to substantially reduce global catastrophic biorisk due to incomplete coverage</strong>, e.g., some studies of UVGI in schools find no effect on measles incidence because&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1623610/pdf/amjphnation01116-0034.pdf\"><u>students end up catching measles in transit to school</u></a>.</li><li>It may turn out that for existential pandemic-class pathogens, IAQ interventions are not as effective as planned because&nbsp;<strong>reducing pathogen levels in the air might not substantially reduce transmission and infection rates</strong>, e.g., it could be the case that it is easy to be infected by very low doses.</li><li><strong>IAQ interventions could reduce population immunity</strong> due to a lack of ordinary virus exposure such that the transmissibility of biothreats is not much reduced. It might even be the case that ordinary airborne pathogens, like the common cold, become more destructive to those who contract them.<ul><li>Typically, this concern does not arise when discussing other pathogen routes.

I try to give concrete, actionable, goal-oriented advice that I think is enough to get decent outcomes - please take this as a starting point and deviate if something feels a better fit to your background and precise goals!</p><p>A core belief I have about learning mechanistic interpretability is that&nbsp;<strong>you should spend at least a third of your time writing code</strong> and playing around with model internals, not just reading papers. MI has&nbsp;<i>great&nbsp;</i>feedback loops, and a large component of the skillset is the practical, empirical skill of being able to write and run experiments easily. Unlike normal machine learning, once you have the basics of MI down, you should be able to run simple experiments on small models within minutes, not hours or days. Further, because the feedback loops are so tight, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a sharp boundary between reading and doing research. If you want to deeply engage with a paper, you should be playing with the model studied, and testing the paper\u2019s basic claims.&nbsp;</p><p>The intended audience is for people new-ish to Mechanistic Interpretability but who know they want<i>&nbsp;</i>to learn about it - if you have no idea what MI is, check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.neelnanda.io/glossary\">this Mech Interp Explainer</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/\">Circuits: Zoom In</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CzZ6Fch4JSpwCpu6C/interpretability\"><u>Chris Olah\u2019s overview post</u></a>.</p><h2>Defining \u201cDecent Baseline\u201d</h2><p>Here\u2019s an outline of what I mean when I say \u201ca decent level of baseline knowledge\u201d</p><ul><li>A good grounding in the key concepts of machine learning and mechanistic interpretability</li><li>An intuition for how a transformer&nbsp;<i>actually</i> works on a mechanical level - what the moving parts are, how it all fits together, and how to reason about the overall system</li><li>Familiarity with tooling, such that you can easily spin up a model and run quick and dirty experiments.</li><li>A rough map of the literature, what\u2019s known in the field, and big categories of open problems - not necessarily a deep knowledge, but hopefully enough to get a sense for techniques used, and where you&nbsp;<i>could&nbsp;</i>go and read a relevant paper if you want to.</li><li>A sense of basic techniques, what compelling evidence about model internals looks like, and how to get started when poking around at a model.</li></ul><h2>Getting the Fundamentals</h2><p><i>A set of goal oriented steps that I think are important for getting the fundamental skills.

Note: A good explicit goal is learning and having fun, rather than doing important research. Doing important original research is just really hard, especially as a first project without significant mentorship!&nbsp;<strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>I expect this to be a less gentle introduction than the other two paths, only do this one first if it feels actively exciting to you!

Concretely, try skimming through the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.neelnanda.io/concrete-open-problems\">200 Concrete Open Problems</a> sequence and choosing a section that excites you, and then reading the problems in that section and choosing a problem that excites you.&nbsp;<ul><li>Coding is&nbsp;<i>much&nbsp;</i>easier if you\u2019re starting from and editing existing code. Try using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.neelnanda.io/exploratory-analysis-demo\">Exploratory Analysis Demo</a> as a base.</li><li>Orient your learning around solving the problem, but still spend time learning things! Read the papers that seem most relevant, learn how to use the relevant infrastructure and techniques, etc.&nbsp;</li><li>If you get consistently stuck, or feel confused and like you\u2019re floundering, go and read around more!&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Problem choice:</strong><ul><li>It\u2019s easy to be overwhelmed by the number of problems. If so, go try the deeply engaging with a paper path</li><li>Ditto, it\u2019s easy to just not be excited by any of the problems. If so, go try the deeply engaging with a paper path! It\u2019s much easier to be excited about a problem when you have more context and can see why<i>&nbsp;</i>it\u2019d be interesting and how you might make progress.</li><li>It\u2019s also easy to be a perfectionist and stress about choosing the&nbsp;<i>best&nbsp;</i>problem. This is not the right thing to optimise for here! Pick a problem you\u2019re excited about, and you can always pivot if it turns out to be too hard or too boring or too easy.</li><li>One angle is to pick your&nbsp;<i>five&nbsp;</i>favourite problems, try each for 1-2 days, and pick your favourite at the end. Aim for hackathon vibes, of being willing to do unprincipled and hacky things, trying to make progress, and seeing whether anything interesting happens.<ul><li>This works best on ones that don\u2019t need major infrastructure set up - but those are a bad fit for your first problem anyway!</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Tips:</strong><ul><li>A common mistake is being too ambitious. I recommend choosing a problem from the sequence that\u2019s rated A or B! In particular, when you\u2019re new to a field, your intuition for \u201cthis should be easy\u201d will be wildly, wildly miscalibrated. Pick a problem that feels like it should be really easy - if it actually is, then move on to a harder one!<ul><li><strong>Key lesson:&nbsp;</strong>Research is&nbsp;<i>always&nbsp;</i>harder than you think (even after accounting for this fact)</li><li>Note that many people need the equal but opposite advice! You&nbsp;<i>can&nbsp;</i>get started on doing research without being really smart, an expert in the field, or having years of experience.</li></ul></li><li>Start by working with smaller models! There\u2019s a lot of interesting things to learn from reverse engineering smaller models (anything from a one layer transformer to 2B parameters), but a common mistake is going for the sexiest (ie largest) models. Infrastructure for models too big to fit in one GPU is a massive, massive pain, and you can iterate much faster on smaller models.<ul><li>GPT-J (6B parameters) or LLaMA 7B is a pain but the largest that is reasonable, anything bigger than that is completely not worth the effort.&nbsp;</li><li>This advice applies 3x for anything that involves fine-tuning (let alone pre-training!) a model of more than 300M parameters (GPT-2 Medium sized)</li></ul></li><li><i>Aggressively</i> red-team your hypotheses. The most common mistake in junior MI researchers is coming up with an elaborate explanation for a seemingly complex behaviour and missing a simple explanation for the behaviour. Or using some high-power techniques (which take a lot of time and effort to set up!) without noticing plausible ways that those techniques could break or be misleading.<ul><li>Familiarise yourself with the results in tiny models in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dynalist.io/d/n2ZWtnoYHrU1s4vnFSAQ519J#z=aGu9fP1EG3hiVdq169cMOJId\">A Mathematical Framework</a> - skip trigrams, bigrams, copying, induction.&nbsp;<i>Always&nbsp;</i>check whether the behaviour could be done with some combination of these.</li><li>Look for evidence to falsify your hypothesis about the model behaviour, not just confirm it. Try a lot of minor edits to the model\u2019s prompt, and see which ones do and do not break the behaviour.</li></ul></li><li>On the flip-side, be willing to&nbsp;<i>use</i> janky and non-rigorous techniques, just don\u2019t&nbsp;<i>rely&nbsp;</i>on them. These can be key inputs into hypothesis formation and exploration, and if a lot of non-rigorous techniques point in the same direction (and aren\u2019t all flawed in the same way) that can be pretty strong evidence! But it\u2019s important to also red-team this and to not blindly trust them.</li><li>Jump in and get your hands dirty! A common mistake is to spend days to weeks setting up epic infrastructure, or writing a perfect, sophisticated project proposal. Jump in with some quick experiments, trying to get some feedback from reality, and iterating, before you heavily invest.&nbsp;<ul><li>Research is all about tight feedback loops! The vibe should be closer to a weekend hackathon, rather than a 2 month internship.&nbsp;</li><li>Building yourself good infrastructure is important, but it\u2019s often done best if you\u2019ve done things the hacky way first, and can identify what features do/do not matter</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h3>Read Around the Field (Ie Do a Lit Review)</h3><p>Go and read around the field. Familiarise yourself with the existing (not that many!) papers in MI, try to understand what\u2019s going on, big categories of open problems, what we do and do not know. Focus on<strong> writing code as you read&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>aim to</strong>&nbsp;<strong>deeply understand a few important papers&nbsp;</strong>rather than skimming many.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Resources</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/favourite-papers\">An Extremely Opinionated Annotated List of my Favourite Interpretability Papers</a><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.neelnanda.io/glossary\">The Mech Interp Explainer</a> is a good reference for terms</li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@neelnanda2469\">Video walkthroughs</a> of A Mathematical Framework, Induction Heads, and Interpretability in the Wild, I recommend watching them before digging too deep into the papers.&nbsp;</li><li>Read the intro to each section in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://neelnanda.io/concrete-open-problems\">Concrete Open Problems</a> sequence, to get a sense of the types of open problem and motivation/background.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Recommendation:&nbsp;</strong>It\u2019s easy to read passively, or without fully understanding. Aim for deep engagement, even at the cost of being slower.&nbsp;<ul><li>Good questions to ask as you read:<ul><li>What are the techniques and evidence used in the paper?

According to the Global Burden of Disease (<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(21)00395-3/fulltext\"><u>Ferrari et al., 2022</u></a>), mental disorders are \u201cthe seventh leading cause\u201d (p. 144) of health burden in the world in 2019. Of the mental health disorders, depression is the one with the highest health burden (<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(21)00395-3/fulltext\"><u>Ferrari et al., 2022</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/e7JgpYdbSukpPyfLT/announcing-vida-plena-the-first-latin-american-organization\">Vida Plena</a> (see this post for a presentation) will address the lack of treatment for depression by empowering local people to deliver a cost-effective model of psychotherapy. Community members are trained to treat depression through Group Interpersonal Therapy (g-IPT), which is recommended by the World Health Organization as a first-line treatment for depression in low-income settings (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-MSD-MER-16.4\"><u>WHO, 2020</u></a>). The aim of Vida Plena is to replicate in Ecuador the success of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://strongminds.org/\"><u>StrongMinds</u></a> (which uses g-IPT in Uganda and Zambia). StrongMinds is recommended by Founders Pledge (<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/mental-health-report-summary#:~:text=Charity%20recommendation%3A%20Strong%20Minds,we%20were%20able%20to%20find.\"><u>Halstead, 2019</u></a>) and is the Happier Lives Institute\u2019s top recommendation (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/2022/11/24/2022-charity-recommendation/\"><u>HLI, 2022</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Potential funders of Vida Plena are interested in how much good it can accomplish. Whilst data collection and a pilot study are planned, Vida Plena has only just started so it does not have its own cost-effectiveness data. However, we can give a predictive value by using previous cost-effectiveness analyses (CEA) of StrongMinds (<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/mental-health-report-summary\"><u>Halstead et al., 2019</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/strongminds-cea.html\"><u>McGuire &amp; Plant, 2021b</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/happiness-for-the-whole-family/\"><u>McGuire et al., 2022a</u></a>) and converting their results to Vida Plena\u2019s context. We use Vida Plena\u2019s predicted costs, the Ecuadorian average household size for spillovers, and we apply two adjustments (one for the counterfactual treatment gap and one for the probability of success). Once data from Vida Plena itself is collected, we will update the CEA.</p><p><strong>We estimate it will cost $17 to improve a recipient\u2019s wellbeing by one wellbeing-adjusted life year (WELLBY).</strong> For a comparison, this is&nbsp;<strong>8 times more cost-effective than GiveDirectly</strong> (a gold standard charity which delivers cash transfers in low- and middle-income countries).&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, to allow for comparisons with other health programs, we also produce a disability-adjusted life year (DALY) prediction. It is, however, our opinion that our WELLBY analysis is more robust because it includes a comprehensive evaluation beyond just physical health as well as the impact of household spillovers. Nevertheless,&nbsp;<strong>we estimate that it will cost Vida Plena $462 to avert one DALY.</strong></p><p>While we are not arguing that Vida Plena will be the most cost-effective endeavour, we do expect that it is potentially a very cost-effective charity that will improve human wellbeing in an neglected region - Ecuador and Latin America. No mental health organisations currently operate at scale in Latin America; hence, an important treatment gap exists (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.26633/RPSP.2018.165\"><u>PAHO, 2018</u></a>). This provides a counterfactual argument for creating a new mental health organisation specifically reaching people in the region.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>What\u2019s the problem and how will Vida Plena address it?</strong></h1><h3><strong>Mental illness results in reduced quality of life</strong></h3><p>Beyond any other metric used to describe it, the core badness of mental health problems, such as depression, is that the actual lived experience is exceptionally bad. Mental health is one of the larger factors affecting one\u2019s life satisfaction (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvd58t1t\"><u>Clark et al., 2018</u></a>). Additionally, poor mental health is associated with a host of other issues: chronic medical conditions, drug abuse, lower educational achievement, lower life expectancy, and exclusion from social and professional arenas (<a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/950821542885406030/pdf/132340-WP-PUBLIC-21-11-2018-12-36-2-WBGMHScalingResponsewebfinal.pdf\"><u>World Bank, 2018</u></a>). As a result, it's not surprising that health problems are related to economic factors such as loss of productivity, absenteeism (both for the patients and caregivers), and financial strain due to the cost of care (<a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/p/gdm/wpaper/8712.html\"><u>Bloom et al., 2011</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215036616300244\"><u>Chisholm et al., 2016</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/950821542885406030/pdf/132340-WP-PUBLIC-21-11-2018-12-36-2-WBGMHScalingResponsewebfinal.pdf\"><u>World Bank, 2018</u></a>).</p><p>Furthermore, the negative effects of depression and mental health spillover to others by affecting household members and close connections of the affected individuals (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/wber/lhn010\"><u>Das et al., 2008</u></a>;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/mp201013\"><u> Rosenquist et al., 2011</u></a>). This is a formal way to say that if your partner or parent or kid is suffering, you suffer with them. The long term impact of poor mental health is also felt on future generations as parents with untreated mental health conditions are often not able to best support the education of their children (<a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/112828/9789241506809_eng.pdf\"><u>WHO, 2014</u></a>).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Mental health rates in Ecuador</strong></h3><p>According to the GBD (<a href=\"https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results?params=gbd-api-2019-permalink/ac2225b2004294faadf5ec70ba150e9d\"><u>2019</u></a>), about 576,078 people in Ecuador suffered from depressive disorders (3.46% of its ~17.6 million population), with a burden of 102,198 DALYs. This is likely to have gotten worse since the COVID-19 pandemic, as a recent meta-analysis of twelve studies estimates that the worldwide prevalence of depression has increased sevenfold from 3.44% in 2017 to 25% in 2021 (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1697260020300545\"><u>Bueno-Notivol, 2021</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Mental disorders are vastly neglected in Ecuador and, despite efforts made by the national government, there are still important treatment gaps (<a href=\"https://www.scielosp.org/pdf/rpsp/2018.v42/e162\"><u>Baena, 2018</u></a>). Mental health makes up less than 2% of the national health budget according to a 2018 estimate by the Pan American Health Organization (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.26633/RPSP.2018.165\"><u>PAHO</u></a>), or only 0.04% according to the Ecuadorian national newspaper Plan V\u2019s (<a href=\"https://www.planv.com.ec/historias/sociedad/ecuador-gasta-120-veces-mas-detencion-personas-relacionadas-con-drogas-que-salud\"><u>2021</u></a>) analysis. As a result, only a small percentage of people in Ecuador suffering from mental disorders will seek and receive treatment. This is in line with a study published by the PAHO (Kohn et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iris.paho.org/bitstream/handle/10665.2/49540/v42e1652018.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\"><u>2018</u></a>), which found that 3 out of 4 of people with mental disorders do not receive treatment in Latin America. Whilst this estimate was not based on surveys in Ecuador, we think it is very likely to generalise to Ecuador.&nbsp;</p><p>For Ecuadorians, like the majority of people in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the problems is made even worse because of a range of factors: lack of government health funding for public clinics, no care in rural areas, not enough free non-profit mental health services, high costs, and months-long wait times (<a href=\"https://www.scielosp.org/pdf/rpsp/2018.v42/e162\"><u>Baena, 2018</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016503272200180X?casa_token=z7eekzlY9FUAAAAA:qTuNCIi2d2mkRXRAg3VUfj4GQ3enzQzV7Kgx5GPi7x0vIS6_3TzHNAt6h02OXEmccHXyZ1ImbA\"><u>Orozco et al., 2022</u></a>). High cost is a particularly big issue in Ecuador as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ecuadorencifras.gob.ec/estadisticas-laborales-septiembre-2021/\"><u>78% of the population</u></a> works informally or earns a salary below the minimum wage, meaning that private mental health care is not affordable for the majority of the population.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Task-shifted g-IPT: A cost-effective solution</strong></h3><p>Thankfully, there exist effective treatments that can be implemented at reasonable costs and are easily scalable (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-019-1028-x\"><u>Raviola et al., 2019;</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5506549/\"><u>Singla et al., 2017</u></a>). One of these, developed and recommended by the WHO, is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-MSD-MER-16.4\"><u>group interpersonal therapy (g-IPT)</u></a>, specifically targeted at treating depression. An important step in making g-IPT affordable and scalable is a strategy known as \u2018<i>task-shifting\u2019</i> (<a href=\"https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/43821/9789241596312_eng.pdf\"><u>WHO, 2008</u></a>), in which certain parts of mental health services are shifted to trained community members.</p><p>The goals of g-IPT are rapid depression symptom reduction and improved relationships within the patient\u2019s family and social networks. It is considered by experts as an effective therapy for depression (see the meta-analysis by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1176%2Fappi.ajp.2010.10101411\"><u>Cuijpers et al., 2011</u></a>).</p><p>Task-shifted g-IPT has been successfully implemented in a variety of LMICs. In Uganda, Bolton et al. (<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/196766\"><u>2003</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/group-interpersonal-psychotherapy-for-depression-in-rural-uganda-6month-outcomes/34A03947B7B1F12CD5E364AD54B45626\"><u>Bass et al., 2006</u></a>) found that it significantly reduced depression compared to a control group, with an absolute reduction of depression symptoms in 75% of participants six months following the conclusion of treatment. A shining example of implementing task-shifted g-IPT is the work by the charity&nbsp;<a href=\"https://strongminds.org/\"><u>StrongMinds</u></a>, which operates in Uganda and Zambia. They have provided treatment to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://strongminds.org/half-a-million-people-in-africa-reached-through-our-innovative-depression-treatment/\"><u>more than 100,000 women</u></a> and successfully&nbsp;<a href=\"https://strongminds.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/StrongMinds-Phase-Two-Impact-Evaluation-Report-July-2015-FINAL.pdf\"><u>reduced depression symptoms</u></a> of the people to whom they provide therapy. For this reason, StrongMinds has been recommended as a high-impact, cost-effective charity to donate to (<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/mental-health-report-summary\"><u>Halstead et al., 2019</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/strongminds-cea.html\"><u>McGuire &amp; Plant, 2021b</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/happiness-for-the-whole-family/\"><u>McGuire et al., 2022a</u></a>).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Cost-effectiveness analysis</strong></h1><p>Vida Plena needs funding in order to implement its program in Latin America. Whilst Vida Plena has only just started its program (thereby there is no data about its outputs yet - the results for a pilot study are not expected until late 2023), funders do want a prediction about how much good Vida Plena might do. Hence, we produce a&nbsp;<i>predictive</i> cost-effectiveness analysis of Vida Plena.</p><p>We predict that the cost-effectiveness of Vida Plena will be similar to that of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://strongminds.org/\"><u>StrongMinds</u></a>, another mental health charity which uses the same therapeutic model and is being trained by the same team of global mental health experts from Columbia University.</p><p>In order to predict the cost-effectiveness of the Vida Plena programme, we have conducted two types of analysis: one in wellbeing adjusted life-years (WELLBYs) based on previous work by HLI (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/happiness-for-the-whole-family/\"><u>McGuire et al., 2022a</u></a>), and one in disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) based on previous work by Founders Pledge (<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/mental-health-report-summary\"><u>Halstead et al., 2019</u></a>). We take the same values from these previous analyses except for:</p><ul><li>Using the predicted costs for Vida Plena instead of the StrongMinds costs.</li><li>Adjusting the effect by for the counterfactual of treating people that could have had treatment otherwise.</li><li>Adjusting the effect based on a probability of Vida Plena\u2019s success.</li><li>Using the average household size in Ecuador (where Vida Plena operates) rather than Uganda and Zambia (where StrongMinds operates) to calculate the household spillovers (for the WELLBY analysis).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Details of our calculations can be found in this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-wNg2JFsDpOsDaE8LezPrY_KUm4kfo9wyloasBlDXlE/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>spreadsheet</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Costs and people treated&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Vida Plena launched with a pilot in Quito during the fall of 2022, and plans to expand its reach nationally throughout 2023. Starting in 2024 and onward, Vida Plena will begin important efforts to offer treatment at scale throughout Ecuador and the region. Based on Via Plena\u2019s estimates, our analysis assumes that 6000 people will receive treatment in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2024, we predict $211,815 of fixed, organisational costs and $42 variable/treatment costs to treat each person. This results in a total of $463,815 (which comes to $77 dollars total to treat each person when including fixed costs). The costs also include a 10% contingency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Adjustments for counterfactuals and success</strong></h3><p>There are potential differences in available treatment in Ecuador and Uganda. From our understanding, without charities like StrongMinds, there would be almost no available mental health services in Uganda. The situation, whilst not good, is likely better in Ecuador. As mentioned before, according to Kohn et al. (<a href=\"https://iris.paho.org/bitstream/handle/10665.2/49540/v42e1652018.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\"><u>2018</u></a>), 75% of people with mental disorders do not receive treatment in Latin America (i.e., 25% do receive treatment). Taking this number at face-value for depression in Ecuador, and assuming that the currently available treatment is as good as Vida Plena\u2019s (it likely isn\u2019t), we adjust our figures for Vida Plena to account for this counterfactual.</p><p>Additionally, it is possible that Vida Plena might not succeed. We use a shallow adjustment for this possibility. Out of 18 charities in the Charity Entrepreneurship incubator program, 15 (83%) are still funded and functioning today. So we adjust our figures for Vida Plena based on this rate of success.</p><h3><strong>Subjective wellbeing analysis</strong></h3><p>Subjective wellbeing is \u201cgood mental states, including all of the various evaluations, positive and negative, that people make of their lives, and the affective reactions of people to their experiences\u201d (<a href=\"https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/oecd-guidelines-on-measuring-subjective-well-being_9789264191655-en\"><u>OECD, 2013</u></a>). In essence, how happy or how satisfied people are with their lives. We base this analysis on previous work from the Happier Lives Institute (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/happiness-for-the-whole-family/\"><u>McGuire et al., 2022a</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/strongminds-cea.html\"><u>McGuire &amp; Plant, 2021b</u></a>). See our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lTCXxuvG8aE4bdAFU0qof86maENzhmAA65ZmKCc1GL8/edit#\"><u>external appendix</u></a> for more details about the methodology.&nbsp;</p><p>We present the results in WELLBYs. One WELLBY is one year with an increase in life satisfaction of one point on a 0-10 scale. Or any appropriate combination of time and increase (e.g., 2 years with a 0.5 point increase). For more on the strengths of WELLBYs for cost-effective analyses see McGuire et al. (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dk48Sn6hpbMWeJo4G/to-wellby-or-not-to-wellby-measuring-non-health-non\"><u>2022b</u></a>). The strengths of using a subjective wellbeing analysis, and why we think this is a better analysis than a DALY analysis, are presented in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EysvkihkL09mC7Tuh46NunXMXpNNW5mrHGqvyGeaX3g/edit#heading=h.roli7auvti2y\"><u>Appendix</u></a> for this CEA.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the meta-analysis by McGuire and colleagues, StrongMinds improves the wellbeing of an individual treated by 3.38 WELLBYs (95% CI: 1.34, 5.66), then 53% of this effect will spillover to the 4.85 other members in the household, resulting in an overall benefit for the household of 12.12 (95% CI: 2.98, 30.9) WELLBYs per person treated.</p><p>We use the same effect on the individual for Vida Plena. However, we use a different household size for the household spillovers. Based on Ecuadorian population data of average household size we find that the average household size (not including the recipient of the psychotherapy) is 2.17 (see our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lTCXxuvG8aE4bdAFU0qof86maENzhmAA65ZmKCc1GL8/edit#\"><u>external appendix</u></a> for our calculation of this number). This is much lower than for StrongMinds and leads to a smaller overall effect for a household of 7.18 (95% CI: 1.37, 43.56) WELLBYs per person treated. Once we adjust it for the counterfactual treatment and the probability of success, we predict that Vida Plena\u2019s overall effect for a household is 7.18*0.75*0.83 = 4.49 (95% CI: 0.77, 31.04) WELLBYs per person treated.</p><p>In McGuire et al.\u2019s (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/happiness-for-the-whole-family/\"><u>2022a</u></a>) analysis, StrongMinds can treat one person for $170 (this number might have gone down since), whereas we predict that Vida Plena can treat one person for $77. This means that the program will produce 33,161 WELLBYs in 2024.&nbsp;<strong>This means the cost per WELLBY produced is $17. This means that a $1000 donation to Vida Plena would produce 58 WELLBYs, which is 8 times more cost-effective than&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\"><strong><u>GiveDirectly</u></strong></a> (a charity that excels in delivering cash transfers - simply giving people money - and a gold standard in effective altruism) but less cost-effective than StrongMinds.</p><p>We summarise the results in the table below:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#cccccc;border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p><strong>Charity</strong></p></td><td style=\"background-color:#cccccc;border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p><strong>Overall benefit in WELLBYs</strong></p></td><td style=\"background-color:#cccccc;border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p><strong>Cost per person treated</strong></p></td><td style=\"background-color:#cccccc;border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p><strong>WELLBYs per $1000</strong></p></td><td style=\"background-color:#cccccc;border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p><strong>x times more cost-effective than GiveDirectly</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#efefef;border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p>Vida Plena (prediction)</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p>4.49</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p>$77</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p>58.0</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p>7.70</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#efefef;border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p>StrongMinds</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p>12.12</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p>$170</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p>71.3</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p>9.46</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#efefef;border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p>GiveDirectly</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p>9.22</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p>$1,221</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p>7.5</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #000000;padding:2pt\"><p>1.00</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>DALY analysis</strong></h3><p>Whilst we believe the wellbeing analysis is the most appropriate one, some funders might want cost-effectiveness numbers in DALYs. We use Founders Pledge\u2019s analysis of the effect of StrongMinds (<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/mental-health-report-summary\"><u>Halstead et al., 2019</u></a>). Specifically,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kPqBeHN3b7tq9gxho-9M7VGCuO-14CCI1YEsywmy66E/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>Founders Pledge calculated</u></a> the effect of StrongMinds\u2019 g-IPT in DALYs by stretching the disability weight for severe depression across the 27-point&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1046/j.1525-1497.2001.016009606.x\"><u>PHQ-9 scale</u></a> (the depression scale which was used by StrongMinds to measure their impact on depression;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qSQuM_BF8H-ufzfsETyq2c8jYZ-KHo4d/view\"><u>StrongMinds, 2015</u></a>). This method represents a 1-point decrease on the PHQ-9 as a 0.024 decrease in DALYs. Founders Pledge estimated that g-IPT reduces the depression of a recipient by 3.13 PHQ-9 scores and that each year 75% this effect is retained, resulting in a total of 0.27 DALYs averted per recipient of StrongMinds\u2019 g-IPT.&nbsp;</p><p>We adjust the effect in DALYs with the counterfactual and success adjustments, which predicts that Vida Plena will prevent 0.27*0.75*0.83 = 0.17 DALYs per recipient. At a cost of $77 per recipient, Vida Plena will prevent 1,236 DALYs in 2024.&nbsp;<strong>This means Vida Plena will avert one DALY for $462 in 2024.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Discussion of CEA</strong></h3><p>We have shown that Vida Plena will likely be a cost-effective charity that will tackle the burden of mental health in Ecuador. We want to discuss some aspects of this analysis.</p><p>First, we want to remind the reader that this is only a&nbsp;<i>prediction</i> of Vida Plena\u2019s potential cost-effectiveness when it will be implemented. It is based on previous data and analyses of StrongMinds (<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/mental-health-report-summary\"><u>Halstead et al., 2019</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/happiness-for-the-whole-family/\"><u>McGuire et al., 2022a</u></a>), not directly on data from Vida Plena. Hence, there is considerable uncertainty about the true cost-effectiveness once Vida Plena is established. Once the pilot is conducted, a new and improved version of this cost-effectiveness analysis will be produced.</p><p>Second, we want to make it clear that the aim is not for Vida Plena to compete with StrongMinds, but to show that such mental health interventions are cost-effective and can be deployed in new areas, like Ecuador, where mental health support is needed. We are not claiming that Vida Plena is a better alternative cost-effective endeavour than StrongMinds. StrongMinds is established and operates in very deprived areas (e.g., rural Uganda). Only that Vida Plena is likely to provide a similarly cost-effective intervention in a different part of the world - Ecuador and Latin America - which also need mental health support.</p><p>Third, we could only compare to cash transfers because this is common practice in effective altruism. Making comparisons to life-saving interventions (e.g., anti-malaria nets) is complicated by philosophical factors (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/the-elephant-in-the-bednet/\"><u>Plant et al. 2022</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Fourth, we are not arguing that Vida Plena is the&nbsp;<i>most</i> cost-effective endeavour, but that it has the potential to be a&nbsp;<i>very</i> cost-effective charity that will improve human wellbeing in an area - Ecuador and Latin America - which needs support. Additionally, Vida Plena will be an extra source of research and information about cost-effectively implementing mental health solutions in LMICs.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we presented a DALY analysis for the interested reader, and we are glad Halstead et al.\u2019s (<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/mental-health-report-summary\"><u>2019</u></a>) analysis exists so we can do so. However, we believe that the DALY analysis is only a lower bound estimate of Vida Plena\u2019s impact. The subjective wellbeing analysis is more accurate for three reasons (see the Appendix below).<br>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Conclusion and Next Steps</strong></h1><p>In summary, Vida Plena is a promising programme that will tackle the burden of mental health disorders in Ecuador.&nbsp;<strong>Furthermore, we predict that it will do so cost-effectively. Our CEA predicts that it will be 8 times more cost-effective than GiveDirectly.</strong></p><p>Depression has important impacts on a person\u2019s wellbeing. These impacts reach beyond just the individual but also extend to their households. These negative effects are magnified in low and middle-income countries, such as Ecuador, which do not have sufficient mental health professionals or the financial resources available to provide treatment to those most in need.</p><p>Vida Plena will apply a multifaceted strategy to not only address the negative impacts of depression, but also to provide participants with the tools for a flourishing life. By using evidence-based treatment methods and a cost-effective delivery model, mental health services can quickly and efficiently be expanded.</p><p>Future steps for Vida Plena will involve a pilot study of its program. This will update us about the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of Vida Plena. Vida Plena will continue to collect data and be an interesting source of data on the cost-effectiveness of this mental health intervention. This will be an important test of whether the model StrongMinds uses in sub-Saharan Africa can be exported to other low and middle-income countries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Appendix: Why the subjective wellbeing analysis is better than the DALY analysis.</strong></h1><p>We believe that the DALY analysis is only a lower bound estimate of Vida Plena\u2019s impact and that the subjective wellbeing analysis is more accurate for four reasons. These points have been made before (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/measuring-happiness.html\"><u>Plant, 2021</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dk48Sn6hpbMWeJo4G/to-wellby-or-not-to-wellby-measuring-non-health-non\"><u>McGuire et al., 2022b</u></a>).</p><p>(1) Subjective wellbeing is what ultimately matters for people (i.e., how good their life is going) and will capture all the bad of depression and the good of psychotherapy. Factors like health (or income) are instrumentally good in what they do for people (i.e., how they improve their wellbeing) rather than intrinsically good. DALYs are an indirect measure of the impact of mental health disorders like depression (and treating depression with psychotherapy) because it is focused on health and doesn\u2019t capture all the ways depression can impact people\u2019s wellbeing. Depression can have health, social, economic, and other impacts, and treating depression likely helps with these. Hence, subjective wellbeing will capture all these effects insomuch as they affect wellbeing whilst DALYs will be limited to health. This also allows us to compare Vida Plena to non-health interventions.</p><p>(2) The disability weights in DALYs are based on - likely biased - estimates that will underestimate how bad depression is. The GBD\u2019s (<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(21)00395-3/fulltext\"><u>2022, p. 140</u></a>) disability weights are based on community-based surveys across the world where participants were asked to make pairwise comparisons: They are given two health states and asked to indicate which one they think is the healthiest. This involves respondents conceptualising \u201chealth\u201d and applying it to an theoretical situation they are not currently experiencing, potentially by predicting how they would feel with the disorder. However, there is evidence that humans make errors when predicting how one would feel (affective forecasting) in the future or a different situation (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/uploads/1/0/9/9/109970865/affective_forecasting_feb_2022.pdf\"><u>Coleman, 2022</u></a>).

However its middle-income status masks a huge section of the population which is living on the edge of financial ruin - meaning spending money on mental health care would mean having to cut back on food or other basic needs. The result is people with depression just struggle on, somehow getting by, but not thriving.&nbsp; This is something I have personally watched happen time and time again as I describe in my post on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eaforchristians.org/blog/joys-story\"><u>EA for Christians forum</u></a>.</p><p>It was these experiences, plus 15 years working with traditional development programs across Latin America and seeing their lack of rigorous commitment to impact and evidence, that convinced me of the need to attempt to replicate the impact-driven successes I had been reading about.&nbsp; I began laying the groundwork for Vida Plena in early 2022, and a few months later, Anita Kaslin, an Ecuadorian psychologist with 10 years of experience, joined me as co-founder.

These limitations could be addressed by neuromorphic hardware (NMH) which is inspired by the human brain. NMH enables physically built-in capabilities of information processing at the hardware level. In other words, brain-like features bias hardware towards intelligence at scale. In Table 1 we compare computing devices by their ability to scale (scaling features) and adaptation of brain-inspired concepts (neuromorphic features).</p><p>We argue NMH may play a significant role in AI deployment. Common modern processors like GPUs are limited in energy efficiency, execution time, and transistor size. Meanwhile, brain-like features of NMH enable lower energy consumption, faster inference times, and a smaller form factor. Therefore, the current shift from centralized computing clusters to distributed edge devices incentivizes NMH development.&nbsp;<br>Neuropmorphic computing paradigms require a novel approach to safe, interpretable AI. In order to effectively engage the risk of misaligned AI, safety research may need to expand its scope to include NMH. This may be best achieved by supporting those currently engaged in NMH capability research to work on safety and related areas. We are not aware of active research focused on the interpretability of AI on the hardware level. In this post we assess whether such an initiative is required.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Table 1: Comparison of computational hardware</strong>. Comparison of the human brain with neuromorphic hardware (atomic switching networks) and a modern GPU (NVIDIA A100 PCIe 80GB).

In section 3 we argue control of plasticity is the main bottleneck of AI applications with nanowires. The systematic optimization of plasticity requires the following advances:</p><p>List 1: Current challenges in controlling plasticity of nanowires<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5w9ap0jtw6n\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5w9ap0jtw6n\">[20]</a></sup></span>.</p><ul><li>Increasing the number of functional input/output ports in nanowire devices</li><li>Designing interfaces (e.g. for translating images to a time-dependent input signal to the network)</li><li>Selecting optimal materials capable of short-term and long-term memory</li><li>Modeling of junction conductivity and switching behavior at scale</li><li>Understanding the impact of scale-invariance and criticality on emerging intelligence</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>1.1 Potential use case: Efficient inference with nanowires networks</h2><p>Nanowires have the potential to become the new standard for inference devices. We first describe an existing training framework suitable for nanowires. Then, we highlight why nanowires potentially outperform common hardware in fabrication cost, energy efficiency, and computation speed.</p><h3>Training framework</h3><p>Backpropagation has been successfully applied to well-understood physical systems. Physics-aware training (PAT) enabled crystals and microphones to solve audio and image classification tasks<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2nsbprbpzeq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2nsbprbpzeq\">[21]</a></sup></span>. Here, an external digital device feeds trainable parameters to the physical system as a separate input. The parameters are optimized with backpropagation. Once optimal parameters have been determined the external digital device is no longer required. The physical system is then able to perform inference on its own. As training execution is outsourced to a separate device, the physical system itself can be optimized for inference. Indeed, physical systems trained with PAT outperform inference with modern GPUs in energy efficiency and execution time<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2nsbprbpzeq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2nsbprbpzeq\">[21]</a></sup></span>.<br>Nanowire networks will become a suitable candidate for PAT once the issues in list 1 are better understood. Nanowires have been proven to outperform static systems in a basic AI task ( benchmark<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflpxv6nqn1d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlpxv6nqn1d\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;on image classification with reservoir computing<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8oebyrjwvly\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8oebyrjwvly\">[22]</a></sup></span>). Therefore, nanowires may become a primary candidate for PAT applications.</p><h3>Fabrication cost</h3><p>Common hardware like GPUs need to take the exact form of crossbar arrays to function properly. This specific design requires high manufacturing standards such as cleanroom facilities and high precision nano-lithography<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp3b75vc2xm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp3b75vc2xm\">[23]</a></sup></span>. In contrast to that, self-assembled hardware such as nanowire networks do not require an explicitly predefined architecture<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhuxwmktw20v\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhuxwmktw20v\">[14]</a></sup></span>. Nanowire networks are created by casting a drop of nanowires in suspension on an insulating surface. This technique creates an unique arrangement of individual wires for each new device. Computational capability can be realized from many different morphologies as a starting point for network training. This indicates robustness to impure manufacturing. Therefore, self-assembly potentially enables cheaper production of hardware compared to common GPUs. This potential for low cost manufacturing also supports the case for use of nanowire technology in PAT applications.</p><h3>Energy efficiency and computation speed</h3><p>Spike-based computing mimics the propagation of time-dependent signals through the human brain<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffeh479db7f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfeh479db7f\">[24]</a></sup></span>. Here, a part of the input is encoded in signal timing. The reduction of the total amount of input signals yields a reduction in energy consumption and faster inference<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsq1vfjzftsd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsq1vfjzftsd\">[25]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref91g9to6yx1r\"><sup><a href=\"#fn91g9to6yx1r\">[26]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx4mudt5vl4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx4mudt5vl4\">[27]</a></sup></span>. Scaled spike-based networks have already been implemented in non-self-assembled NMH. Their application meets the state of the art whilst drastically reducing energy consumption<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw5s3ad1rwdg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw5s3ad1rwdg\">[28]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefle8qy7v9oq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnle8qy7v9oq\">[29]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwgfhciakge\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwgfhciakge\">[30]</a></sup></span>. There is a potentially important connection to the state of safety research here as we are not aware of interpretability research focused on spike-based computing. However, work on this problem could be undertaken by well placed capability researchers and may prove complementary to efforts in spike-based systems as undertaken by researchers focused on algorithms. We are not aware of work currently focused on either of these specific areas.&nbsp;<br>Secondly, in-memory computing is a key feature of NMH. The separation between memory and processing units is a standard in modern hardware design<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg4sb3vwefkm\"><sup><a href=\"#fng4sb3vwefkm\">[31]</a></sup></span>. This architecture requires a data transfer between both units that limits the overall execution speed (also called the von-Neumann-bottleneck). Inspired by the human brain, in-memory computing overcomes this bottleneck. An ideal in-memory processor performs matrix vector multiplication with \ud835\udcaa(1) time complexity by taking advantage of analogue memory units<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefox505corv5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnox505corv5\">[32]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(compared to \ud835\udcaa(N<sup>2</sup>) time complexity in common processors). This paradigm potentially increases the energy efficiency and computation speed by two orders of magnitude<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref14ib4kv9grl\"><sup><a href=\"#fn14ib4kv9grl\">[33]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnshjzd7ryi9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnshjzd7ryi9\">[34]</a></sup></span>. Limited experimental progress has demonstrated the viability and direction of improvement for in-memory processors<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp2x0p68b7xp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp2x0p68b7xp\">[35]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff1yyjj6qqoc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf1yyjj6qqoc\">[36]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>2. Mapping concerns onto the current state of technology</h1><p>Advanced NMH presents a cluster of concerns. Here, we focus primarily on interpretability and capability in the form of human disempowering AI.</p><h3>Interpretability</h3><p>Interpretability can significantly increase the probability that AI systems are beneficial to all stakeholders, particularly in complex applications. Uninterpretable models complicate auditing processes and may lead to unintended and human disempowering decisions.<br><i><strong>Further research on physical dynamics of NMH supports interpretability</strong></i>&nbsp;in our view. Understanding the large-scale dynamics of analog memory units is a necessary step towards model explainability. Nanowire networks are a particularly useful device to study: The self-assembled structure offers insight into scale-governed dynamics \u2013 also observed in mammal brains<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzg4vkgq6e1q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzg4vkgq6e1q\">[37]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;<br>AI research on emergent behavior of large language models explicitly formulate scaling laws<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh1l4klv8w8m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh1l4klv8w8m\">[38]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0dri7hvuq9tl\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0dri7hvuq9tl\">[39]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx2ld6lbxyg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx2ld6lbxyg\">[40]</a></sup></span>. These laws could provide valuable insight for large-scale switching dynamics of NMH. We recommend closer alignment of NMH research to interpretability efforts (such as those led by Anthropic and Redwood Research).</p><h3>Misaligned artificial general intelligence</h3><p>In line with the scaling hypothesis<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1stno19396n\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1stno19396n\">[41]</a></sup></span>, generalization and sophisticated behavior emerges from upscaling basic AI models with narrow capabilities. A growing field of researchers concerned by a potential emergence of artificial general intelligence (AGI)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffxg0074ng3t\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfxg0074ng3t\">[42]</a></sup></span>. An AGI is able to define and execute instrumental sub-tasks to achieve objectives. By default, an AGI could seek power as an instrumental subtask to achieve almost any overall goal set by humans. Such a behavior might lead to disempowerment of humans and could be an existential risk to humanity<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs8kxe74li5\"><sup><a href=\"#fns8kxe74li5\">[43]</a></sup></span>.<br>Current nanowire networks exhibit dominant short-term memory<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflpxv6nqn1d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlpxv6nqn1d\">[12]</a></sup></span>. This decreases the likelihood of long-term self-optimizing capabilities. However, this risk should be tracked by capabilities researchers as advances in hardware are both anticipated and realized. An effective response to emerging risks may require action prior to new technologies being realized, even in a relatively controlled research environment.</p><p>Whether neuromorphic features bias advanced AI towards&nbsp;<strong>consciousness</strong> remains an open question. The generalization capability of conscious systems potentially increases the risk of misaligned AGI. We recognise further exploration of these claims as a valid domain of inquiry but have ruled them out of scope of the current piece.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>3. Potential developments that would increase or decrease safety concern</h1><p>Throughout this section we describe potential developments that would increase concerns discussed in section 2.</p><p>The potential development of&nbsp;<strong>long-term memory</strong> within nanowire networks would support feedback loops during the training process. This may increase the risk of misaligned AI. Further, the ability to&nbsp;<strong>control nanowire plasticity</strong> is central for realizing AI applications. As shown in table 1, the physical scalability of NMH is already comparable to modern GPUs. Once plasticity training is available, nanowire networks could become readily scalable hardware for AI applications. Advances in challenges named in list 1 increase the likelihood of controllable nanowire networks.</p><p>We expect nanowire devices would undergo training with an external digital device (PAT) as discussed in section 1.1. This external training device may serve as a useful reference to further understand nanowire dynamics. The realization of&nbsp;<strong>PAT with nanowires</strong> and the performance and other properties of such systems would therefore provide an additional data source for AGI risk assessment.</p><p>Self-assembling networks could require lower manufacturing standards than classical computer chips<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhuxwmktw20v\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhuxwmktw20v\">[14]</a></sup></span>. The release of benchtop&nbsp;<strong>manufacturing devices or \u2018kits\u2019</strong> for the production of self-assembled NMH by at first researchers, but later hobbyists would increase concern regarding advanced AI. Low-barriers to production would enable a broad audience to take part in the experimental development of self-assembled NMH. Accessible manufacturing potentially increases dual use risk as it accelerates the development of NMH and increases the risk of unilateral action. Additionally, this accessibility could worsen race dynamics towards advanced AI. This situation would complicate the monitoring of AI advances by governmental institutions or third parties. Analogous concerns are currently visible within the field of biosafety and 3D printed weapons.</p><p><strong>Criticality</strong> may be an indicator for intelligence in nanowire networks. \u201cThe concept of criticality refers to a system poised at the point between ordered and disordered states (a 'critical point'), analogous to a phase transition.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzg4vkgq6e1q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzg4vkgq6e1q\">[37]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;Multiple studies suggest critical dynamics may play a role in information processing and task performance in biological systems<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxi2lfnwnrv\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxi2lfnwnrv\">[44]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefik796rpjtzl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnik796rpjtzl\">[45]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuo3xsjhqi7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuo3xsjhqi7\">[46]</a></sup></span>. However, the relation between criticality and intelligence is not yet clear. Criticality applies to the resistance of nanowire networks. For example, if the resistance is too high, an electrical signal will vanish soon after its release. Likewise, if the resistance is too low, a single signal can cause an avalanche of signals propagating through the whole network. The critical state of the network is positioned in the middle of these two extreme cases. The critical resistance of nanowire networks is optimal for information processing<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflpxv6nqn1d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlpxv6nqn1d\">[12]</a></sup></span>. Advanced knowledge in critical systems would help to monitor capabilities of neuromorphic hardware.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>4. Mapping AI alignment work onto neuromorphic hardware</h1><p>The most successful models among recent publications are massively scaled software architectures<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeft9vc1k7g6\"><sup><a href=\"#fneft9vc1k7g6\">[47]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefezvkr48pwi5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnezvkr48pwi5\">[48]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp742ogrios\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp742ogrios\">[49]</a></sup></span>. Naturally, the efforts of AI alignment are focused on large software architectures as well. However, a paradigm shift in computing hardware toward NMH could reshape the AI landscape in unexpected ways. This shift would be accelerated as modern computing hardware encounters physical bottlenecks. Meanwhile, computation with physical systems - like nanowire networks - possibly yields higher efficiency in execution time, energy, and data (as discussed in section 1.1). Such a shift would require AI safety research to widen the software-focused scope to include hardware predictability.</p><p>In a recent review<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsru5ac8gmzh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsru5ac8gmzh\">[2]</a></sup></span>, members of industry and academia present the state-of-the-art in neuromorphic computing. They only dedicate a single paragraph within 97 pages to the emergence of misaligned AI as a concern. This suggests that AI safety is still neglected in neuromorphic computing research.</p><p>We argue investments in NMH are likely due to the prospects of higher energy efficiency, faster computation, and cheaper manufacturing. If industry funding grows, we expect profit maximizing incentives to favor prioritization of capability over safety<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefec8ckbagyfc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnec8ckbagyfc\">[50]</a></sup></span>. Facing concerns mentioned in section 2, we recommend funding existing capability researchers to work on safety as well as collaborating with the existing safety community where beneficial. This would ensure that work in domains such as hardware interpretability is supported by a deep technical knowledge base of the relevant systems, and that current safety researchers make only limited trade offs against urgent work in relatively mature AI software fields.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>5. Counter Arguments</h1><ol><li>NMH is developing too slowly to matter. Other developments will determine the course of AGI prior to NMH becoming practical for real world tasks.<br><br><i>Short response:</i> We welcome work by technological forecasting experts to assess both the likelihood and impact of NMH capability becoming competitive with conventional approaches over relevant timelines for AGI. To our knowledge an assessment of this type has yet to be published.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We will potentially be able to simulate NMH with classical hardware. Thus, safety research of NMH is directly mappable to safety of classical hardware established research. NMH safety does not require explicit focus.<br><br><i>Short response:</i> The simulation of physical systems at scale is often not feasible. Additionally, the training framework PAT is not directly mappable to deep neural networks<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2nsbprbpzeq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2nsbprbpzeq\">[21]</a></sup></span>. Even an ideal simulation of NMH would require novel interpretability methods.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>We mention self-assembly mechanisms that enable network plasticity as a key concern for AGI safety. However, adaptive plasticity is not supported by experimental results yet. Until that is the case, dedicating research effort to NMH is not worth the opportunity cost.<br><br><i>Short response:</i> In line with our response to counter argument 1, we welcome an assessment of the cost-benefit for further work in this domain. We expect that the rate of progress on development of network plasticity as described here is highly uncertain.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>As of today, most neuromorphic networks are exclusively produced in specialized labs. During further research we could find major requirements in manufacturing that complicate the cheap and accessible production of self-assembling neuromorphic computing chips.<br><br><i>Short response:</i> This is likely to be the case where creation of networks strictly requires the use of expensive equipment or techniques such as electron microscopes or lithography. However, in the case of molecular biology there is a trend toward democratization of techniques previously only achievable by the most capable and well resourced labs. This process can start with a goal of facilitating replication of results by other scientists through \u2018productization\u2019 of techniques as realized through relatively easy to use, open source software and wet lab kits. Commercialisation of useful research technology potentially follows, finally making the jump into full accessibility when kits are openly sold to hobbyists. If nanowires prove not to require expensive manufacturing equipment at a useful or interesting stage of development, a similar process may occur.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnad0v81y8lb\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefad0v81y8lb\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Write a message to us by clicking on the author name below the main title.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnsru5ac8gmzh\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefsru5ac8gmzh\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>D.

The piglets are brought to the weaning section after the nursing period of only 3 to 4 weeks (instead of the natural 14 weeks). At the age of about 72 days they go to the fattening farm, where 14 of them are put in a sty of 10 m\u00b2, usually on a grid floor without straw.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://animalfreedom.org/english/information/abuses.html\">More horrors </a>that those of you who eat meat pay for</p><p>Pollan <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/10/magazine/an-animal-s-place.html\">describes</a> the horrors of modern factory farms \u2014 I\u2019ll just quote a few passages.</p><blockquote><p>Beef cattle in America at least still live outdoors, albeit standing ankle deep in their own waste eating a diet that makes them sick.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>And broiler chickens, although they do get their beaks snipped off with a hot knife to keep them from cannibalizing one another under the stress of their confinement, at least don't spend their eight-week lives in cages too small to ever stretch a wing. That fate is reserved for the American laying hen, who passes her brief span piled together with a half-dozen other hens in a wire cage whose floor a single page of this magazine could carpet. Every natural instinct of this animal is thwarted, leading to a range of behavioral ''vices'' that can include cannibalizing her cagemates and rubbing her body against the wire mesh until it is featherless and bleeding. Pain? Suffering? Madness? The operative suspension of disbelief depends on more neutral descriptors, like ''vices'' and ''stress.'' Whatever you want to call what's going on in those cages, the 10 percent or so of hens that can't bear it and simply die is built into the cost of production. And when the output of the others begins to ebb, the hens will be ''force-molted'' -- starved of food and water and light for several days in order to stimulate a final bout of egg laying before their life's work is done.</p></blockquote><p>Later he said</p><blockquote><p>Piglets in confinement operations are weaned from their mothers 10 days after birth (compared with 13 weeks in nature) because they gain weight faster on their hormone- and antibiotic-fortified feed. This premature weaning leaves the pigs with a lifelong craving to suck and chew, a desire they gratify in confinement by biting the tail of the animal in front of them. A normal pig would fight off his molester, but a demoralized pig has stopped caring. ''Learned helplessness'' is the psychological term, and it's not uncommon in confinement operations, where tens of thousands of hogs spend their entire lives ignorant of sunshine or earth or straw, crowded together beneath a metal roof upon metal slats suspended over a manure pit. So it's not surprising that an animal as sensitive and intelligent as a pig would get depressed, and a depressed pig will allow his tail to be chewed on to the point of infection. Sick pigs, being underperforming ''production units,'' are clubbed to death on the spot. The U.S.D.A.'s recommended solution to the problem is called ''tail docking.'' Using a pair of pliers (and no anesthetic), most but not all of the tail is snipped off. Why the little stump? Because the whole point of the exercise is not to remove the object of tail-biting so much as to render it more sensitive. Now, a bite on the tail is so painful that even the most demoralized pig will mount a struggle to avoid it.</p></blockquote><p>One horrifying line came later in the article.</p><blockquote><p>Simply reciting these facts, most of which are drawn from poultry-trade magazines, makes me sound like one of those animal people, doesn't it? I don't mean to, but this is what can happen when . . . you look.</p></blockquote><p>An objective description of what goes on in factory farms sounds like the claims of shrill activists; this is a testament to just how horrible they are.</p><p>Even the supposedly high welfare farms kill the pigs by <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/pigs-farm-animal-cruelty-scotland-b1840471.html\">beating them to death against concrete</a>\u2014totally legal industry practice.</p><p>Matthew Scully started his book \u201cDominion\u201d with the following description.</p><blockquote><p>It began with one pig at a British slaughterhouse. Somewhere along the production line it was observed that the animal had blisters in his mouth and was salivating. The worst suspicions were confirmed, and within days borders had been sealed and a course of action determined. Soon all of England and the world watched as hundreds, and then hundreds of thousands, of pigs, cows, and sheep and their newborn lambs were taken outdoors, shot, thrown into burning pyres, and bulldozed into muddy graves. Reports described terrified cattle being chased by sharpshooters, clambering over one another to escape. Some were still stirring and blinking a day after being shot. The plague meanwhile had slipped into mainland Europe, where the same ritual followed until, when it was all over, more than ten million animals had been disposed of. Completing the story with the requisite happy ending was a calf heard calling from underneath the body of her mother in a mound of carcasses to be set aflame. Christened \u201cPhoenix,\u201d after the bird of myth that rose from the ashes, the calf was spared.</p></blockquote><p>He later said</p><blockquote><p>Here were innocent, living creatures, and they deserved better, and we just can\u2019t treat life that way. We realized, if only for an instant, that it wasn\u2019t even necessary, that we had brought the whole thing upon them and upon ourselves. Foot-and-mouth disease is a form of flu, treatable by proper veterinary care, preventable by vaccination, lethal neither to humans nor to animals. These animals, millions of them not even infected, were all killed only because their market value had been diminished and because trade policies required it\u2014because, in short, under the circumstances it was the quick and convenient thing to do.</p></blockquote><p>One <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB983746832492015872\">report </a>from the WSJ at the time said</p><blockquote><p>The British response to foot-and-mouth disease, shared by most rich countries, is to slaughter and burn all animals showing symptoms, plus those that may have been exposed to the diseased animals.</p></blockquote><p>On top of this, <a href=\"https://mercyforanimals.org/blog/this-is-why-thousands-of-farmed-animals-burn/\">thousands of animals burn alive in barn fires</a>, caused by the ammonia and other gasses released by the farms. However, when animals burn alive, even when 200,000 sentient beings burn to death in a fire, to <a href=\"https://mercyforanimals.org/blog/chickens-fire/\">quote </a>an industry spokesperson, \u201cno one was injured.\u201d Hundreds of thousands or millions of animals burn to death\u2014yet despite that, the industry keeps chugging on.</p><p>Animals are shipped overseas in horrible conditions, in many ways resembling the ships that were used to ship slaves to the Americas. To quote one <a href=\"https://mercyforanimals.org/blog/new-video-live-export/\">report</a></p><blockquote><p>Once on board, animals face miserable, weeks-long journeys. Confined to small areas, they have no choice but to lie in their own feces and urine. Frequently, the ships are not properly ventilated, and some animals die from intense heat or succumb to respiratory diseases. The bodies of dead animals are usually crushed and thrown into the sea.</p></blockquote><p>Scully <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2022/07/a-brief-for-the-pigs-the-case-of-national-pork-producers-council-v-ross/\">describes</a> some more horrific conditions.</p><blockquote><p>As it turns out, such details are at issue in a case now before the Supreme Court of the United States. The dispute, <i>National Pork Producers Council v. Ross</i>, centers on the use of gestation crates for female pigs. These are the iron, fit-to-size cages in which the creatures, about six million of them at any given moment in our country, are kept almost completely immobilized for all of their lives, unable to walk or even turn around.</p><p>This four-sided encasement, at 2 feet x 7 feet, or even slightly smaller, confines animals weighing between 400 and 500 pounds, and it\u2019s one of those details about industrial farming that stay with you once you\u2019ve heard about them. When the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit Court heard a 2020 case involving a pig farm owned by a subsidiarity of Smithfield Foods, Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III remarked during oral argument on \u201cthe inhumanity to the animals and the fatality rate\u201d at the farm, and later noted \u201cthe outrageous conditions,\u201d the \u201calmost suffocating closeness\u201d of the pigs, the \u201canimal suffering\u201d \u2014 and wondered in his written opinion \u201cHow did it come to this?\u201d He was referring to the same confinement methods to be examined in <i>National Pork Producers Council v. Ross</i>.</p></blockquote><p>He notes an important point</p><blockquote><p>It would be reasonable for the justices to ask themselves this question, too: If the use of gestation crates is proper and defensible animal husbandry, why has the NPPC lobbied to make it a crime to photograph that very practice?</p></blockquote><p>Imagine if there were rumors that you were mistreating your dog. Would you ban anyone from every entering your house and seeing how you treat your dog? No, of course not. It is only because the factory farms have everything to fear from consumers knowing about the unimaginable cruelty they dispense that they lobby for laws\u2014in flagrant violation of the first amendment\u2014that make it illegal to photograph the horrors that they administer.</p><p>These beings cannot be reduced to mere statistics. If you lived every life that was ever lived, you\u2019d spend far more time living as a victim of factory farming than as a person consuming meat. If you experienced all the pleasure of meat from factory farms, but also the suffering caused by it, you\u2019d demand that we end these vicious torture chambers immediately. But alas, the victims cannot speak as their infected flesh wastes away, so their cries go unheard.</p><p>Here\u2019s a question that shouldn\u2019t be difficult for anyone with a moral compass: should babies be ground to death in blenders? Should they be suffocated in bags? If your answer is no\u2014as no doubt it should be\u2014you should oppose this <a href=\"https://animalequality.org/news/ban-chick-culling/\">horrific practice</a> done to billions of baby chicks. Are you really in favor of paying for the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziQpkoGEj5c\">blending of babies</a>?</p><p>If you think you\u2019re not opposed to what goes on here, I\u2019d recommend the movie <a href=\"https://watchdominion.org/\">watch dominion</a>. See if, when you look at what actually goes on, when you see the animals not merely as a piece of meat but as actual beings, you can stomach it. If you can, you might be a psychopath, but at least you\u2019re consistent. Yet for those of you who are repulsed by it, you should stop funding it, stop paying for more animals to be viciously tortured to death in these vile, ignoble gulags of despair.</p><p>The things we do to animals in many ways resemble the things done to humans in history\u2019s worst atrocities, including slavery and the holocaust. Sentient beings boiled alive, having their throat cut, living in feces, having their limbs taken off. The cruelty is staggering. Drab descriptions of industry practices don\u2019t resemble what goes on in other industries\u2014they resemble horror stories. One shudders imagining themself having to risk being in a situation like that\u2014before they realize that this is the fate of billions. Actions that we\u2019d never risk in a million years shouldn\u2019t be forced on billions of sentient, helpless animals\u2014animals who scream, shriek, and wail, all to no avail. For the cries of the helpless calf who sobs before their dying mother do not endanger the profits of the industry\u2014they\u2019re thus totally ignored.</p><p>Hopefully, you think that this is bad\u2014that this horrific treatment of billions of beings is one of history\u2019s greatest crimes. However, if you are not yet swayed, here are some ethical arguments for why this grisly maltreatment is bad.</p><p>First is that animal cruelty is on its face immoral. When we see a person kicking a dog, we all have the intuition that the dog kicking shouldn\u2019t be done. And yet the treatment of the vast majority of animals that we eat\u201499% of which <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/4/22/21228158/coronavirus-pandemic-risk-factory-farming-meat#:~:text=That's%20because%20we%20eat%20a,under%20harsh%20and%20unsanitary%20conditions.\">come </a>from factory farms\u2014is far crueler than a person kicking a dog. It\u2019s far crueler than a person who beats a dog to death with a shovel\u2014at least the dog\u2019s suffering is short, while the animals we abuse have their suffering drawn out across weeks.</p><p>Can we really condemn those who abuse animals if we ourselves pay for far greater cruelty? Can we really judge those who brutally kill their pets or those who practice bestiality, when we pay for greater cruelty on a daily basis?</p><p>Second, consider a different case. Imagine someone was paying for pigs to be put in gas chambers because they liked the way their squeals sounded. We would be outraged\u2014animal abuse isn\u2019t worth enjoying particular sounds. What if they were gassed because we liked the way they smelled? A cry of outrage would erupt throughout the public\u2014surely a pleasant smell wouldn\u2019t be worth horrific torture. What about one who enjoyed the way that tortured corpses of animals looked? We\u2019d be outraged\u2014looks don\u2019t justify horrific torture. How about taste. We\u2019d be similarly outraged. Oh wait, that\u2019s literally what we do. We pay for animals to be brutally tortured and killed because we like the taste of their tortured corpse. Surely there\u2019s no morally relevant difference between a pleasant smell and a pleasant taste.</p><p>Maybe you think you\u2019re morally different from those who torture pigs for the smell of their corpse. After all you just want a byproduct of suffering, not the suffering itself. It\u2019s not clear why this matters, but even if it does, there\u2019s still a parallel case. One who enjoys the smell of animals corpses doesn\u2019t gain extra pleasure from them being tortured. Torture is just a means towards and end, the end being cheap animal corpses which can be smelled.</p><p>A third argument is the Name the Trait Argument/The Argument from Marginal cases. Is there anything that justifies treating animals horrifically? If so, what is it? Is it intelligence? Well if it\u2019s intelligence, then that justifies torturing and eating severely mentally disabled people or terminally ill babies. Any trait that justifies the difference in treatment would similarly justify mistreating some humans, for the humans with the least of any trait possess less of it than the animals with the most of it. This is true whether it\u2019s moral agency, intelligence, or anything else.</p><p>Maybe you think that being a human is what intrinsically matters. Aside from being ad hoc, this has an insane conclusion. Imagine we stumbled across an alien civilization that looked like us, talked like us, and acted like us. However, they were not technically humans\u2014they had a different evolutionary lineage. Would it really be okay to brutally torture them to death so we can devour their corpses? Doesn\u2019t seem too plausible.</p><p>More traits can be named, not all of which can be addressed here. They all fail.</p><p>Fourth, a basic principle of empathy is that ethics should be impartial. We should put ourselves in the shoes of the beings affected. That\u2019s why rocks don\u2019t matter\u2014they aren\u2019t sentient, they have no interests. A good way of doing this is imagining one behind a veil of ignorance, where they\u2019re equally likely to be any of the affected parties. Let\u2019s imagine that for animals. If you were just as likely to be the chicken that adorns your plate as you were to be yourself, eating a lovely meal, wouldn\u2019t you rather not eat meat. It\u2019s only gross neglect of the affected sentient beings that causes us to mistreat them these ways.</p><p>Fifth, a very plausible ethical principle is that vast suffering for trivial benefits is <a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/archives/2016/10/huemer_replies.html\">bad</a>. That is what we do to animals. It should thus end.</p><p>This is not just some bad thing. Even if we ignore all sea creatures and value land animals at 1/1000 what we value humans, our treatment of animals is morally equivalent to brutally torturing and killing about 80 million people every year. 80 billion animals being brutally tortured is such a vast number, that even if we devalue animals to a fairly large degree, it still wins out as the worst thing in the world. And this is a gross underestimate of its true immorality.</p><p>Your individual consumption decisions can make a difference. We have <a href=\"https://philarchive.org/archive/MCMAIO\">data </a>that bears this out. This chart provides a rough <a href=\"https://sandhoefner.github.io/animal_suffering_calculator\">estimate</a>, showing that consumption causes weeks of suffering for animal products like chicken. Weeks of torture is not worth a chicken sandwich.</p><p>There\u2019s an obvious reason for this; the reason these animals are bred in such horrific conditions is that people will pay for their flesh. They breed a number of beings proportional to the number that will be consumed. One fewer consumer, one fewer animal produced in expectation. In reality, they group things in terms of thresholds, say every 900 people who consume animals will trigger an increase, resulting in 900 extra animals being bred into existence. But that still means that the expected harm from consuming meat is the same. So if you still eat meat, you really should stop immediately\u2014you\u2019re inflicting unfathomable suffering on enormous numbers of beings.</p><p>Yet even if we ignored the brutal torture of billions of animals we\u2019d still conclude that factory farming must end. The end of it would massively improve health. <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vegan-diet-studies#section2\">Healthline </a>reviewed 16 studies veganism has a positive impact on health causing weight loss, drop in LDL cholesterol, reduced heart disease risk,&nbsp; vegans got more fiber, less fat, blood sugar lowering, etc.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/293329136_Vegetarian_vegan_diets_and_multiple_health_outcomes_A_systematic_review_with_meta-analysis_of_observational_studies\">Casini </a>et al in 2016 wrote in a comprehensive meta analysis</p><blockquote><p>\u201cConclusions: This comprehensive meta-analysis reports a significant protective effect of a vegetarian diet versus the incidence and/or mortality from ischemic heart disease (-25%) and incidence from total cancer (-8%).

So, the tooth is extracted.</p><p>The thing that baffles me is, what is with the lack of curiosity about <i>why</i> the patient\u2019s jaw is too small? We did not evolve in an environment where tooth extraction was easy or risk-free. So why would we evolve wisdom teeth that need to be extracted? It turns out, we didn\u2019t.</p><p>From the article \u201cEvolution of human teeth and jaws: Implications for dentistry and orthodontics\u201d, published in 2012 in the journal Evolutionary Anthropology, the authors say:</p><blockquote><p>Like caries and, probably, periodontal disorders, malocclusion is a \u2018\u2018disease of civilization,\u2019\u2019 being much less common in fossil hominins and traditional foragers. Third-molar impaction for instance, occurs ten times more frequently in industrialized peoples than in hunter-gatherers. Further, fossil hominins and recent foragers tended to have an edge-toedge incisor bite rather than procumbent uppers overjetting lowers. The basic problem is a mismatch between jaw length and tooth size; there is insufficient room for proper implantation of our back teeth, so the front ones are pushed forward or forced out of proper alignment.</p></blockquote><p>Put simply, fossils and traditional foragers don\u2019t seem to have underbites, overbites, or problems with their wisdom teeth nearly as often as people in modern societies. Either our jaws have gotten smaller or our teeth have gotten bigger.</p><p>The standard hypothesis is that our teeth have gotten bigger. People in industrialized societies have less wear on their teeth, compared to foragers and hunter-gatherer fossils. Since wear makes your teeth smaller, that seems to explain the mismatch.</p><p>But the authors then go on to say:</p><blockquote><p>It seems more likely, however, that our jaws are underdeveloped because softened, highly processed foods do not provide the chewing stresses needed to stimulate normal growth of the jaw during childhood. Human jaws have become shorter, on average, since the Paleolithic, a trend that is also seen in recent foragers who have made the transition to an industrial-age way of life.</p></blockquote><p>This is reminiscent to me of trees that are grown indoors. When a sapling is pushed by the wind, it releases a hormone that helps it grow stronger. Trees that are grown indoors, where there\u2019s no wind, will not do this and will break more easily in adulthood.</p><p>The obvious question is: if an underdeveloped jaw causes crowding, does it also cause other problems? I have some personal experience here, because I had my jaw <a href=\"https://chadnauseam.com/random/my-mse-experience/\">surgically expanded when I was 22.</a> (This is done over the course of a few months using something called an MSE appliance.) My opinion is that an underdeveloped upper jaw is a source of many problems.</p><p>The first problem is that it can prevent your tongue from suctioning to the roof of your mouth. That means that when you sleep, your tongue can fall back into your throat, causing snoring and sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is then treated with CPAP machines, which are expensive and inconvenient.</p><p>The second problem is that it results in a smaller nasal airway. Look at the difference in nasal airway size for this woman, who had her upper jaw expanded three times:</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671925318/mirroredImages/7fnMyCXuJftsFNKYJ/iw4wb8djvibrlijedmwz.png\"><a href=\"https://www.pathlms.com/pcso/events/1648/video_presentations/143837\">source</a></p><p>A small nasal airway limits the amount of air that can pass through your nose, encouraging you to breathe through your mouth. As it is impossible to breathe through your mouth while your tongue is suctioned, this also contributes to sleep apnea.</p><p>I suspect a small nasal airway is also&nbsp;easily clogged by mucus. Before I had my jaw expanded, I regularly had to change which side I slept on as one nostril or the other would get clogged. That hasn\u2019t happened once since, even when I\u2019ve gotten sick.</p><p>There is some evidence that the tongue\u2019s pressure on the teeth when in suction also contributes to jaw development. The main evidence is the study <a href=\"https://buteykoclinic.com/docs/Primate-Experiments-on-Oral-Respiration-Harvold.pdf\">Primate Experiments on Oral Respiration</a>, where experimenters forced monkeys in the experimental group to breathe through their mouth by blocking their nasal airway.</p><blockquote><p>All experimental animals gradually acquired a facial appearance and dental occlusion different from those of the control animals.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>The common finding was a narrowing of the mandibular dental arch and a decrease in maxillary arch length</p></blockquote><p>It\u2019s possible that the improvements in nasal airway size are only the result of jaw-expansion surgery, and would not happen as a result of expanding the jaw naturally through chewing chewier foods in adolescence. I doubt it, and I\u2019ll make a bet: $10 says hunter-gatherer fossils and modern-day foragers have larger nasal airways than people in industrialized societies.</p><p>It seems likely that many of these problems could be avoided if parents encouraged children to eat chewier food. Parents whose children breathe through their mouth should get their children examined for tongue-ties, macroglossia, and nasal obstructions. Finally, children experiencing crowding should be treated with expanders rather than extractions whenever possible. These interventions are cheap and mostly bottlenecked on improving awareness.</p>", "user": {"username": "Andre Popovitch"}}, {"_id": "CycFBmdwgCjCsZxQh", "title": "What you prioritise is mostly moral intuition", "postedAt": "2022-12-24T12:06:25.018Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Note: A </i><a href=\"https://jamesozden.substack.com/p/what-you-prioritise-is-mostly-moral?sd=pf\"><i>linkpost</i></a><i> from my blog.

If you want to cop-out, you could <a href=\"https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-i-am-not-an-effective-altruist\">reject any philosophy</a> where you try to rank how bad or good things are, but this seems extremely unappealing. Surely if we\u2019re given the choice between saving ten people from a terrible disease like malaria and ten people from hiccups, we should be able to easily decide that one is worse than the other? Anything else seems very unhelpful to the world around us, where we allow grave suffering to continue as we don\u2019t think comparing \u201cbads\u201d are possible.</p><p>To press on, let\u2019s take one concrete example of a moral dilemma: <strong>How important is extending lives relative to improving lives?</strong> Put more simply, given limited resources, should we focus on averting deaths from easily preventable diseases or increasing people\u2019s quality of life?&nbsp;</p><p>This is not a question that one can easily answer with randomised controlled trials, meta-analyses and other traditional forms of evidence! Despite this, it might strongly affect what you dedicate your life to working on, or the causes you choose to support. <a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/\">Happier Lives Institute</a> have done some <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JgqEqsa6iAtqGLYmw/the-elephant-in-the-bednet-the-importance-of-philosophy-when-1\">great research</a> looking at this exact question and no surprises - your view on this moral question matters a lot.

If this is a question that could affect what classifies as \u201cthe most good\u201d, and I think it\u2019s definitely up there, then how do we proceed? Do we just do some thought experiments, weigh up our intuitions against other beliefs we hold (using <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reflective-equilibrium\">reflective equilibrium</a> potentially), incorporate <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/moral-uncertainty/\">moral uncertainty</a>, and go from there? For a movement based on doing \u201cthe most good\u201d, this seems very unsatisfying! But sadly, I think this problem rears its head in several important places. To <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/seoWmmoaiXTJCiX5h/the-psychology-of-population-ethics?commentId=moLhGoSNNjowH8FoG\">quote</a> Michael Plant (a <a href=\"https://www.ox.ac.uk/research/research-in-conversation/how-live-happy-life/michael-plant\">philosopher</a> from the University of Oxford and director of Happier Lives Institute):</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWell, all disagreements in philosophy ultimately come down to intuitions, not just those in population ethics!\u201d</p></blockquote><p>To note, I think this is very different from empirical disagreements about doing \u201cthe most good\u201d. For example, Effective Altruism (EA) is pretty good at using data and evidence to get to the bottom of how to do a certain kind of good. One great example is <a href=\"https://www.google.com/aclk?sa=l&amp;ai=DChcSEwiR7P2Fztj6AhULnu0KHUEgBjUYABAAGgJkZw&amp;sig=AOD64_0lmTAL_sQEccD5b_Io3H0j9U6CCA&amp;q&amp;adurl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjmkPaFztj6AhXNQUEAHcrSBs4Q0Qx6BAgBEAE\">GiveWell</a>, who have an extensive <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research\">research process</a>, drawing mostly on high-quality randomised control trials (see <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tytvmV_32H8XGGRJlUzRDTKTHrdevPIYmb_uc6aLeas/edit#gid=1364064522\">this spreadsheet</a> for the cost-effectiveness of the Against Malaria Foundation) to find the most effective ways to help people alive today. EA tries to apply this empirical problem solving to most things (e.g. <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>, <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/\">Giving Green</a> for climate donors, etc.) but I think it breaks down for some of the most important questions.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/cause-areas/effective-altruism/effective-altruist-research\">an article</a> I wrote for Giving What We Can a while back, I tried to sketch out some different levels of research (see graphic below).

I think this question is very important, and could be the deciding factor on whether you work on, for example, global poverty or animal welfare. To illustrate this, Vasco Grilo <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nDgCKwjBKwFvcBsts/corporate-campaigns-for-chicken-welfare-are-10-000-times-as\">estimates</a> that under certain assumptions, working on animal welfare could be 10,000 times more effective than giving to <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell top charities</a>, which is probably one of the best ways to help people alive today. However, this estimate is somewhat crazily high as the author uses a moral weight for chickens being twice as important as humans, which is more than most people would say! <strong>However, even valuing a chicken\u2019s life 1000x less than a human\u2019s life, you still get the fact that working on animal welfare might be 10x better than most global development charities in reducing suffering.</strong></p><p>This seems quite wild to me. Personally, I think it\u2019s very plausible that a chicken\u2019s life is over 1/1000th as morally relevant as a human life. Given that we have pretty good evidence that farmed animals have the capacity to feel <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/1/23/14325172/animals-feel-pain-biologist#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20physical%20recognition,they%20can%20get%20away%20quickly.\">pain</a>, <a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/H/bo12233936.html\">sadness</a> and <a href=\"https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.594605\">form complex social bonds</a>, our treatment of animals seems like a grave injustice. In this case, ending factory farming seems <strong>really</strong> important. Animal welfare looks even more pressing if you value the lives of the vast numbers of <a href=\"https://www.ciwf.org.uk/farm-animals/fish/#:~:text=Globally%2C%20between%2040%2D120%20billion,slaughtered%20for%20food%20each%20year.\">fish</a>, <a href=\"http://fishcount.org.uk/fish-count-estimates-2/numbers-of-farmed-decapod-crustaceans\">shrimp</a> or <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/insects-raised-for-food-and-feed\">insects</a> who are suffering. Just looking at fish, there are up to <a href=\"http://fishcount.org.uk/fish-count-estimates-2/numbers-of-fish-caught-from-the-wild-each-year\">2.3 trillion</a> individual fish caught in the wild, excluding the billions of farmed fish.&nbsp;</p><p>Rethink Priorities are doing some incredibly <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw/p/tnSg6o7crcHFLc395\">informative research</a> on this very topic of understanding the cognitive and hedonic (i.e. relevant to their ability to feel pain or pleasure) abilities of different animals, which can be seen below. In short, there is already quite good scientific evidence that animals we farm in huge numbers have very many morally relevant capacities, whether that\u2019s their desire to take actions that reduce pain or exhibit depression-like behaviour. Even <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yPDXXxdeK9cgCfLwj/short-research-summary-can-insects-feel-pain-a-review-of-the\">research on insects</a> shows that there is a high possibility that they can experience pain, despite us giving them almost no moral consideration.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3c0f84e-d024-4554-b160-618783d23f8d_1200x1600.png\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671883586/mirroredImages/CycFBmdwgCjCsZxQh/ltina0wuqwdzidgiy6um.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3c0f84e-d024-4554-b160-618783d23f8d_1200x1600.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3c0f84e-d024-4554-b160-618783d23f8d_1200x1600.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3c0f84e-d024-4554-b160-618783d23f8d_1200x1600.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc3c0f84e-d024-4554-b160-618783d23f8d_1200x1600.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>However, a lot of people might disagree with me (largely based on moral intuitions) on the relative importance of a chicken\u2019s life vs a human life. So, can we get a more empirical answer on the moral value of these different animals?&nbsp;</p><p>We can definitely give it a good go, using <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/brain-cell-counts-in-black-soldier-flies\">neuron counts</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encephalization_quotient\">encephalisation quotients,</a> intensity<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/coGn5m5iRwgX2CGNX/research-summary-the-intensity-of-valenced-experience-across\"> of animal experiences</a> and other components that lead to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw\">moral weights</a> (i.e. the relative moral worthiness of various animals, based on a range of factors).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefivcaklab28\"><sup><a href=\"#fnivcaklab28\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, moral weights might never paint a perfect picture of the relative importance of different animals, and how they compare to humans. <strong>Understanding human consciousness is hard enough, let alone the consciousness of beings we understand much less</strong> (<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/detecting-morally-significant-pain\">see here for more discussion</a>). Overall I think most humans, including some EA do-gooders, may not be convinced by speculative-seeming estimates of the moral value of various animals, or simply not have the time or will to read extensively on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw\">the subject</a>, and just revert to their own intuitions.</p><p>So this is one unresolved moral quandary that might determine whether you should focus on human issues vs animal issues. Another important moral question might be:</p><h3>2. Population ethics (and person-affecting views)</h3><p>Population ethics is the study of the ethical problems arising when our actions affect <i>who</i> is born and <i>how many</i> people are born in the future (thanks <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_ethics#:~:text=Population%20ethics%20is%20the%20philosophical,are%20born%20in%20the%20future.\">Wikipedia</a>). I\u2019m told this is a particularly thorny branch of moral philosophy that most academic philosophers don\u2019t even tackle until PhD-level! Despite this, I\u2019ll attempt to address at least one fundamental open question in this field, around <a href=\"https://dbpedia.org/page/Person-affecting_view\">person-affecting views</a>.</p><p>Person-affectiving views claim that an act can only be bad if it is bad <strong>for</strong> someone. Out of this falls the neutrality principle, which claims (<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/archive/GREPA-6.pdf\">Greaves, 2017</a>):</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cAdding an extra person to the world, if it is done in such a way as to leave the well-being levels of others unaffected, does not make a state of affairs either better or worse\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>What does this actually mean? We can borrow a slogan from <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/mind/article-abstract/LXXVI/301/62/1187592?redirectedFrom=PDF\">Jan Narveson</a>, who says \u201cWe are in favour of making people happy, but neutral about making happy people\u201d. To clarify further, this view prioritises improving the lives of existing people, but places no positive moral value on creating additional humans, even if they go on to have flourishing happy lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Why does this matter? Rejecting person-affecting views, and the principle of neutrality, is required for (strong) <a href=\"https://longtermism.com/\">longtermism</a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9e14cmt699n\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9e14cmt699n\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;For those unfamiliar with longtermism, it's the view that protecting the interests of future generations should be a key moral priority of our time. One of the <a href=\"https://www.williammacaskill.com/longtermism\">key claims</a> of longtermism is that future people matter morally, despite them not yet being born. However, this is incompatible with person-affecting views, which place no moral value on the interests of future generations and by default, creating additional future people. Therefore, this seems like an important moral question to resolve, given the rise of longtermism within <a href=\"https://time.com/6204627/effective-altruism-longtermism-william-macaskill-interview/\">popular culture</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01a0ba08-5e73-48fb-9efa-57e1270632f8_1024x1024.png\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671883586/mirroredImages/CycFBmdwgCjCsZxQh/oo1r1so3pzhnfqelkj1n.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01a0ba08-5e73-48fb-9efa-57e1270632f8_1024x1024.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01a0ba08-5e73-48fb-9efa-57e1270632f8_1024x1024.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01a0ba08-5e73-48fb-9efa-57e1270632f8_1024x1024.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F01a0ba08-5e73-48fb-9efa-57e1270632f8_1024x1024.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>Sadly, there seems to be no definitive answers whether or not one should hold person-affecting views.

Michael Dickens <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/seoWmmoaiXTJCiX5h/the-psychology-of-population-ethics?commentId=mw8xJtPovgGEEtjCK\">puts it much more strongly</a> than I might, saying that:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\u201cMost disagreements between professional philosophers on population ethics come down to disagreements about intuition\u2026But none of them ultimately have any justification beyond their intuition.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>I think (and I\u2019ve been informed!) that there\u2019s a lot more to philosophy debates than just intuitions (e.g. finding edge cases where things break down, interrogating certain intuitions, discounting them if they seem like a bias, etc.) but I still think there\u2019s a grain of truth in here.</p><p>Ultimately, even if you\u2019re sympathetic to person-affecting views, there might be other good reasons to focus on traditionally longtermist issues, such as reducing existential risks to humanity (e.g. so we don\u2019t potentially go extinct in the next century, see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rFpfW2ndHSX7ERWLH/simplify-ea-pitches-to-holy-shit-x-risk\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KDjEogAqWNTdddF9g/long-termism-vs-existential-risk\">here</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>With population ethics done and dusted (wait, did I even mention the <a href=\"https://www.utilitarianism.net/population-ethics#person-affecting-views-and-the-procreative-asymmetry\">Total vs Average</a> debate?), we move onto our next moral quandary..</p><h3>3. Suffering-focused ethics</h3><p>How important is reducing suffering relative to increasing happiness? If given the offer, would you trade one hour of the worst suffering for one hour of the best pleasure? If not, at how many hours of the best pleasure would you make this trade? Many people I\u2019ve spoken to wouldn\u2019t take the initial trade, and only take it when the pay-offs get very large (e.g. 10,000 hours of the best pleasure for one hour of the worst suffering).</p><p>This might be because we find it extremely hard to conceptualise what the best pleasure could feel like. The worst suffering feels easier to extrapolate, usually based on previous physical pain we\u2019ve suffered. Still, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a \u201cright\u201d answer to this question, leading people to diverge quite wildly on very fundamental moral questions.</p><p>In one <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/seoWmmoaiXTJCiX5h/the-psychology-of-population-ethics\">experimental study</a> asking survey participants this very question, the authors find that people weigh suffering more than happiness. Tangibly, survey participants said that more happy than unhappy people were needed for a population to be net positive. The diagram below shows that people, on average, would need a population with approximately 61% of all individuals being happy (and 39% unhappy) for the population to be net positive.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd09e007-806f-4ba7-a158-ff49feb6de73_331x329.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671883586/mirroredImages/CycFBmdwgCjCsZxQh/i59pdrlydhs95vi5oucu.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd09e007-806f-4ba7-a158-ff49feb6de73_331x329.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd09e007-806f-4ba7-a158-ff49feb6de73_331x329.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd09e007-806f-4ba7-a158-ff49feb6de73_331x329.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcd09e007-806f-4ba7-a158-ff49feb6de73_331x329.jpeg 1456w\"></a></p><p>To reiterate how subscribing to <a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/the-case-for-suffering-focused-ethics/\">suffering-focused ethics</a> might influence your moral and career priorities, I think it would lead people to try to reduce risks of astronomical suffering (<a href=\"https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/research/intro/\">s-risks</a>) or ending factory farming (as animals often suffer terribly).</p><h3>4. Decision Theory / Expected value&nbsp;</h3><p>This one is slightly cheating, as it\u2019s not a moral intuition. Instead it refers to an <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/epistemic\">epistemic</a> intuition (i.e. relating to our understanding of knowledge) about how we should deal with tiny probabilities of enormous value. In short, how do we deal with situations that offer huge moral rewards, like hundreds of trillions of beings leading flourishing lives, but only offer at 0.00000001% chance of this being reality?&nbsp;</p><p>This is similar to the wager offered in <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/pascal.pdf\">Pascal\u2019s mugging,</a> a thought experiment where a mugger offers 1,000 quadrillion happy days of life in return for Pascal, who is being mugged, to hand over their wallet. Even though Pascal thinks there is only a 1 in 10 quadrillion chance of the mugger actually following through, this trade looks pretty good <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/using-expected-value-when-donating-to-charity-and-day-to-day\">in expectation</a>: a 1 in 10 quadrillion probability multiplied by 1000 quadrillion days if happy = 100 happy days of life.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5qf0gj3t1e3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5qf0gj3t1e3\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>This is discussed in a <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/nick-beckstead-and-teruji-thomas-a-paradox-for-tiny-probabilities-and-enormous-values/\">great paper</a> by Nick Bickstead and Teruji Thomas, aptly titled \u201cA paradox for tiny probabilities of enormous values\u201d. They make some important claims:</p><ul><li><i>Reckless</i> theories recommend risking arbitrarily great gains at arbitrarily long odds (1 in 10 quadrillion) for the sake of enormous potential (1,000 quadrillion happy days of life).</li><li><i>Timid</i> theories permit passing up arbitrarily great gains to prevent a tiny increase in risk. For example, if we had a 10% chance of winning $100 dollars or a 9% chance of winning $100,000,000, one would hope we pick the latter option! But timid theories are risk-averse, so it wants to maximise the probability of winning <i>something</i>, rather than maximising expected returns.&nbsp;</li><li>The third way to resolve this issue is rejecting <a href=\"https://brilliant.org/wiki/transitive-property/\">transitivity</a>, which means saying that in this case, if A=B and B=C, it is not necessarily true that A=C. This seems quite weird, but Lukas Gloor makes some <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HyeTgKBv7DjZYjcQT/the-problem-with-person-affecting-views?commentId=aXGgiMKToQojn5bqp\">good points</a> about how population ethics might be different to other ethical domains, such that comparing different population states is not very straightforward.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>To greatly condense this issue, I recommend reading <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/s42GKdCb2svwya9Li/paper-summary-a-paradox-for-tiny-probabilities-and-enormous\">this summary</a> of the above paper. The author, Tomi Francis, sums up the three ways to square this paradox and concludes:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cNone of these options looks good. But then nobody said decision theory was going to be easy.\u201d</p></blockquote><h3>Paint me a picture</h3><p>These were just a few examples of moral issues that I think could significantly impact someone\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/choosing-a-cause\">cause prioritisation</a>, or otherwise what issue they think is the most important to work on. The (nonexhaustive) list below highlights some other potential moral quandaries I left out for the sake of brevity:</p><ul><li>To what extent do we prioritise helping the people that are the worst off, also known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prioritarianism\">prioritarianism.</a></li><li>What things do we actually define as good?

This means that a group of dedicated do-gooders, such as Effective Altruists, searching for the single best cause to support, can often end up tackling a wide range of issues. As a very naive example, I demonstrate this in the flowchart below, where even just tackling two of these questions can lead to some pretty big divergence in priorities.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80073a2d-c5e9-41c3-91c0-805976136265_2372x1487.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671883586/mirroredImages/CycFBmdwgCjCsZxQh/hwjjatc3aikzr6tlfda3.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80073a2d-c5e9-41c3-91c0-805976136265_2372x1487.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80073a2d-c5e9-41c3-91c0-805976136265_2372x1487.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80073a2d-c5e9-41c3-91c0-805976136265_2372x1487.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F80073a2d-c5e9-41c3-91c0-805976136265_2372x1487.jpeg 1456w\"></a></p><p>Now this flowchart is massively simplified (it only addresses 2 thorny questions rather than 20!), and ignores any discussion of neglectedness and tractability of these issues, but I think it\u2019s still illustrative.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6ka3xb0tml8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6ka3xb0tml8\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It highlights how one can take different yet reasonable views on various moral and epistemic quandaries, and end up focusing on anything from farm animal welfare to promoting space colonisation.

Summary:&nbsp;</h2><h3>In three sentences:</h3><blockquote><p>\"Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google who <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/28/google-billionaire-joe-biden-science-office-00020712\">has long sought influence over White House science policy</a>, is helping to fund the salaries of more than two dozen officials in the Biden administration under the auspices of an outside group, the Federation of American Scientists.\"</p></blockquote><p>It is worth noting that Schmidt Futures (Schmidt's philanthropic ventures) does not directly fund these officials' salaries: Schmidt Futures provides &lt; 30% to the Federation of American Scientists' \"Day One fund\" which funds these officials' salaries. Eric Schmidt seems to me to have called for the US government to aggressively invest in AI development.</p><h3>Some more context:</h3><p>Eric Schmidt chaired the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence from 2018-2021, in which the commision called on the US government to spend $40 billion on AI development.&nbsp;</p><p>Schmidt Futures (Schmidt's philanthropic ventures) funds &lt; 30% of the contributions to the Day One Project, a project within the Federation of American Scientists (FAS), which (among other things) provides the salaries of \"FAS fellows\" who hold \"more than two dozen officials in the Biden administration\" (from the main Politico article being discussed in this post). This includes 2 staffers in the Office of Science and Technology Policy (<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/28/google-billionaire-joe-biden-science-office-00020712#:~:text=Two%20more%20staffers,2018%20to%202021.\">a different Politico article</a>).</p><p>The FAS is a \"nonprofit global policy think tank with the stated intent of using science and scientific analysis to attempt to make the world more secure\" (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_of_American_Scientists#:~:text=The%20Federation%20of%20American%20Scientists,develop%20the%20first%20atomic%20bombs.\">Wikipedia</a>). The Day One project was started to recruit people to fill \"key science and technology positions in the executive branch\" (from the main Politico article).&nbsp;</p><h2>2. My question: Are Schmidt's projects harmfully advancing AI capabilities research?</h2><p>I've seen discussion among the EA community about how OpenAI and Anthropic may be harmfully advancing AI capabilities research. (The best discussion that comes to mind is <a href=\"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/perhaps-it-is-a-bad-thing-that-the\">this recent Scott Alexander post about ChatGPT</a>; <strong>if anyone knows any other resources discussing this hypothesis - for or against - please comment below).</strong></p><p><strong>I have not seen much discussion about Eric Schmidt's harmful or beneficial contributions to AI development in the US government. What do people think about this? </strong>Is this something that should concern us?</p><h2>3. Some more excerpts from the article about AI</h2><blockquote><p>\u201cSchmidt is clearly trying to influence AI policy to a disproportionate degree of any person I can think of,\u201d said Alex Engler, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who specializes in AI policy. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a dramatic increase in investment toward advancing AI capacity in government and not much in limiting its harmful use.\u201d</p></blockquote><h3>...</h3><blockquote><p>Schmidt\u2019s collaboration with FAS [Federation of American Scientists] is only a part of his broader advocacy for the U.S. government to invest more in technology and particularly in AI, positions he advanced as chair of the federal National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence from 2018 to 2021.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nscai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Full-Report-Digital-1.pdf\">The commission\u2019s final report</a> recommended that the government spend $40 billion to \u201cexpand and democratize federal AI research and development\u201d and suggested more may be needed.</p><p>\u201cIf anything, this report underplays the investments America will need to make,\u201d the report stated.</p></blockquote><p>...</p><blockquote><p>\u201cOther countries have made AI a national project. The United States has not yet, as a nation, systematically explored its scope, studied its implications, or begun the process of reconciling with it,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIf the United States and its allies recoil before the implications of these capabilities and halt progress on them, the result would not be a more peaceful world.\u201d</p></blockquote>", "user": null}, {"_id": "sHmjsaKyGLrn74ayN", "title": "Lessons Learned Organizing an EA x Law Group", "postedAt": "2022-12-24T01:52:03.779Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Epistemological Status</h1><p>Moderately high. This post is a generalization of my personal experience organizing a law reading group this past year. That said, I know that not everything can be generalized to everyone: please read with a grain of salt.</p><h1>Why Organize an EA Law Group</h1><p>Law students, by virtue of their credentials or institutions, are well-connected and well placed to make a difference in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>In the short term, law students who are motivated to do good are often skilled at realizing their goals, especially through written or oral advocacy. They could use these skills to support different cause areas, especially through movement building or essay writing.</p><p>In the long term, folks with law degrees have easier access to influential decision-making positions, especially in the U.S. Their legal knowledge also lets them build and run effective organizations, especially when those organizations reach a critical mass.</p><h1>Challenges Law Reading Groups Face</h1><h2>Law Students\u2019 Stress-road</h2><p>Law students often follow a similar stress-road. This quip summarizes it: in the first year, they make you cry (with readings); in the second year, they make you stress (with applications); and in the third year, they let you coast.</p><p>Because of this tract, organizing a reading group for law students is hard. Curious and open first-year students loathe doing more readings. Skilled and experienced second-year students limit their time to CV-enhancers and soft job hunts (e.g. through networking and cold-calls). Exhausted third-year students just want out.&nbsp;</p><h2>Headhunting Environment</h2><p>Law students are also flooded with corporate bids for their attention. Big legal names will frequently (combined, two to three times a week) host mentorship blitzes, meet-and-greets, and sponsored&nbsp;<i>cinq \u00e0 sept</i>s to scout and attract top students. Career development offices are complicit, offering detailed guides to navigate and thrive within this ecosystem.</p><p>This environment competes with and devalues EA reading groups. Big firms\u2019 career options are detailed, developed, and widely advertised; to paraphrase Robert Frost, they are the road more travelled by. Following corporate career paths is easier, clearer, and so more attractive than self-directed exploration. Plus, in this time-constrained and highly competitive environment, any exploration and reflection feels like it\u2019s taking away from students\u2019 corporate career prospects.</p><h2>Lack of EA Career Supports</h2><p>There are few established and centralized mentorship and career resources for law students (especially outside the U.S.).&nbsp;</p><p>LPP\u2019s Slack has been a fantastic hub for law-oriented folks to gather and share some job opportunities. But, those features are complementary, not central, to LPP\u2019s main mandate: academic legal research.&nbsp;</p><p>While 80K lists jobs lawyers have the skills for, few jobs require a law degree, reducing lawyers\u2019 counterfactual value. Even policy work - lawyer\u2019s most obvious career option - can be done with an MPP instead of a law degree (more true outside the U.S.).</p><p>As such, there are few follow-up options for reading group graduates. Most of the options that are available to undergraduate groups, like picking the right graduate program, are less attractive for law students since their area of study is already a kind of career. The options available to law students could only be acted on later and feature a high risk of value drift. Those options are:</p><ul><li>Book a session with an 80K advisor;</li><li>Connect with other legal professionals through LPP or other reading groups;</li><li>Orient your career towards earning to give;</li><li>Gain experience for 3-5 years in a firm, then return to see what EA orgs need.</li></ul><p>Rarely, a graduate is interested in taking on a group leadership role.</p><h1>Possible Solutions for Group Organizers</h1><p><strong>Reading-less curriculums:</strong> these curriculums can feature only podcasts, videos, or shared readings to lighten the reading load. Alternatively, groups can host regular socials, where group leaders present on the night\u2019s conversation topic briefly at the start of supper.</p><p><strong>Action-oriented activities:</strong> these activities invite students to get involved in, take charge of, or create a high-impact project. These initiatives would be designed so that they introduce students to EA principles and offer them opportunities for connection and growth. They are easier to frame so that they look good on a resume, e.g. by naming it a fellowship.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Invest in Networking:&nbsp;</strong>sharing legal mentors across countries or, in Canada, across provinces is of limited use since job applications differ depending on the region. Local groups would benefit from having their own, small pool of professionals who are willing to help students out.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h1>Further Reading</h1><p>John Bliss\u2019 article discusses why law students\u2019 switch from public-interest careers to corporate firms. Two reasons he highlights are: (1) students enter law schools with but a vague idea of how law school can help them achieve their public interest goals, and (2) firms\u2019 interview processes sway students, uninformed about alternatives, to careers in firms. He recommends policy-makers offer students opportunities to self-reflect and learn about alternative careers.</p><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zotero.org/google-docs/?qsLfQe\">John Bliss, \u201cFrom Idealists to Hired Guns?

The harm must come directly from the victim believing the deepfake, so somebody seeing the deepfake and being upset because the existence of deepfakes makes them sad does not count.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fniylbkt2yej\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefiylbkt2yej\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This will resolve positively if a major news source reports that an AI entered a programming competition with at least two other good participants, and won the top prize.

I've long been confused why this method of discussion is not more widely supported in EA and Rationalist circles, and am considering adapting my GSSR <a href=\"https://georgetownsecuritystudiesreview.org/2022/11/30/complexity-demands-adaptation-two-proposals-for-facilitating-better-debate-in-international-relations-and-conflict-research/\">article</a> to AI policy/safety research (or Longtermism more generally, which various people have criticized for being too speculative/theoretical rather than being based on empirical tests) and posting it here.

(I plan to respond to these points)</p><p>In short, I expect my argument to be fairly similar to what I laid out in my GSSR article: the way we currently present arguments (i.e., predominantly through prose/paragraph text) seems rife with points of failure and inefficiencies, especially given how debates are often not linear but rather branch and have cross-cutting points. In fields like international relations and peace/conflict studies I've repeatedly encountered instances where people fail to (seriously) address existing counterarguments, and more generally it is hard for audiences to determine who has or hasn't addressed counterarguments. In contrast, I think that making one's arguments more explicit and keeping track of the arguments in a more-searchable and more-permanent format than \"memory\" or prose would help to mitigate some of these problems.&nbsp;</p><p>To me, better methods of argumentation seems like a natural extension of norms that promote statistics/experimental methods in science, but thus far I've found the EA/Rationalist communities fairly lukewarm towards the ideas (even if they are more receptive on average than the general public).</p>", "user": {"username": "Harrison D"}}, {"_id": "vwK3v3Mekf6Jjpeep", "title": "Let\u2019s think about slowing down AI", "postedAt": "2022-12-23T19:56:51.211Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Katja_Grace"}}, {"_id": "oEmTbsRov6j3KNv5D", "title": "It's okay to leave", "postedAt": "2022-12-23T18:51:57.744Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Aged 25, I leave the movement that has been most important in my life so far: Christianity.</i></p><h1>Tl;dr</h1><p>Some things I wish I\u2019d said to myself:</p><ul><li>If I leave, what will actually happen?</li><li>It\u2019s probably gonna be okay</li><li>If it\u2019s true, I need not fear examining it</li><li>If I am not happy, that matters</li><li>What can I learn by leaving that current me will be glad to know?</li><li>I will still have my friends and if I don\u2019t then those friendships weren\u2019t gonna survive</li><li>Are decisions reversible?</li><li>I can fear something and do it anyway</li><li>I like me</li></ul><h1>Context</h1><p>I was a conservative evangelical Christian and had been since childhood. I stuck to a relatively literally interpretation of the Bible. I didn\u2019t drink, I hadn\u2019t had sex, I attended church several times a week. I lived in a community of 30 people who supported and critiqued one another about the most intimate details of our lives.

Making it hard to leave is a feature, not a bug and it\u2019s one I\u2019d like not to replicate.&nbsp;</p><p>This post is written about a specific belief system and a specific person. I also give advice to others who might leave communities.</p><h1>Advice</h1><h2>\u201cIf I leave then ______ will happen\u201d</h2><p>I wish I had considered the actual outcomes. What were the things that I was fearing? I guess it was going to Hell, which is a trickier fear than most, a log jam in my brain, that I feared to touch, let alone remove.&nbsp;</p><p>I think it\u2019s worth considering this for all kinds of decisions - jobs, relationships and communities. If your brain doesn\u2019t know what you\u2019ll lose by leaving, why are you there?&nbsp;</p><h2>\u201cIt\u2019s probably gonna be okay\u201d</h2><p>I wish someone had told me this. That it was probably gonna be fine.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of what took me so long was fare. I was scared of finding new friends, having sex, having money without having to beg my parents.</p><p>It was fine. I surprised myself by how capable and adaptable I am. I wish someone had held me and told me that I was going to do better than I\u2019d have expected. Perhaps I\u2019d have left a lot earlier than I did.</p><p>If you are going to leave a community, you are probably gonna do better than it seems. Solve problems 1 at a time. You\u2019ve made it this far.</p><h2>\u201cIf it\u2019s true, you need not fear examining it\u201d</h2><p>I was&nbsp;<i>terrified</i> of actually thinking about my faith and ending up in Hell. Terrified of being disloyal, of having to explain my thoughts.</p><p>But if something is worth believing in, I think there has to be some chance it\u2019s false. The Christianity I believed in was like an abusive partner, harassing and terrifying me about how I would be punished if I left or even considered leaving. I now see that as a clear red flag. If a community makes it hard to leave - get out. If it turns out to be good, you can always rejoin.</p><p>If your community is giving you good things, then you can write them down. And you can write down the bad things too. Because if it\u2019s a thing your future self is gonna want, the good list should contain bigger things.</p><h2>\u201cYou are not happy and that matters\u201d</h2><p>I wasn\u2019t happy. And somehow people didn\u2019t say that to me. And I didn\u2019t say that to myself. Happiness isn\u2019t everything, but it\u2019s a useful internal signal. If I am not happy it is worth listening to my body and wondering why.</p><p>Are you sad? If so, that\u2019s notable. Is your community making you sad? That\u2019s notable too.&nbsp;</p><h2>\u201cTell me what you find\u201d</h2><p>Threats of Hell aside, there are things that I could tell Christian me. These last 4 years have been immensely valuable to me. I have learned:</p><ul><li>I am capable of being more ambitious in my job</li><li>If I am unhappy in relationships, probably my partner is too, so better to breakup sooner rather than later</li><li>Some charities are&nbsp; 10x - 100x more effective than others</li><li>We are taking too high risks with the future of our world and people will suffer</li><li>It is worth investigating why I have such a short attention span</li></ul><p>These were things that, were I to return to Christianity, I would be glad to know. But by making it so difficult to leave, it became all or nothing.&nbsp;</p><p>If you leave a community, go with my blessing. And tell me what you find! I will probably be glad to know.</p><h2>\u201cYour friends will still like you, or if not then the friendships probably would have ended anyway\u201d</h2><p>I lost a couple of friends as a result of leaving, but mostly it has been fine. Those people I wanted to be close to I still am.&nbsp;</p><p>This is hard to hear, but the friendships that you actually lose will be ones that you\u2019d have been happy to lose anyway.&nbsp;</p><h2>\u201cReversible decisions are cheaper than they feel\u201d</h2><p>I am certain that my Christian friends would take me back if I returned to the faith. I don\u2019t know why I couldn\u2019t think that at the time. I guess I was looking for reasons not to think about it. I wish someone had pointed this out to me \u201cThey will take you back, explore what\u2019s out there\u201d</p><p>Humans have a trait called \u201closs aversion\u201d which means we fear loss more than we enjoy gain. If a decision is mostly reversible, you should feel pretty ambivalent about the loss, which can be reversed. But your body doesn\u2019t know that. It fears losing even what can be recouped.</p><p>I think many decisions aren\u2019t even theoretically about your immortal soul, so consider if they are reversible.</p><h2>\u201cYou can fear something.. And do it anyway\u201d</h2><p>Finally, I wish someone had pointed out that when you understand why you fear something, then fear in itself isn\u2019t bad. As I said above, emotions are useful indicators. I should ignore them at my peril. But once I understand my fear, I can push through it.</p><p>If you seek to leave a community and don\u2019t know why</p><h2>\u201cI like you\u201d</h2><p>I think, at the bottom of all this was a fear and hatred of myself. That I didn\u2019t deserve happiness and that I couldn\u2019t bear to see myself in the cold light of day. I wish I had held myself, that brave scared man and said \u201cI like you, I love you, we will get through this\u201d</p><p>I don\u2019t know you, but I\u2019d probably like you. And I\u2019m sure I would love you - I find people very easy to love. So maybe you should too?</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "nathan"}}, {"_id": "QjeruoGQmYZh2ZsCt", "title": "How long till Brussels?: A light investigation into the Brussels Gap", "postedAt": "2022-12-26T07:49:39.628Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This is written quickly; I'm mostly looking to gauge whether this topic is important at all. As such, I'd love to hear your thoughts!</i></p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>This post quickly looks at the 'Brussels Gap', i.e. the time elapsed between enacting a Regulation within the EU and its emulation in other parts of the world (i.e. the Brussels Effect).&nbsp;</p><p>The 'Brussels Gap' could be a relatively important phenomenon that is worth examining, given the development of a new Regulation on Artificial Intelligence proposed by the EU. If the Regulation comes to fruition (and it seems likely that it will), then having a better picture of the timescales at which the Brussels Effect operates seems crucial.&nbsp;</p><p>In this post, I outline a primer on the Brussels Effect and the relationship it could play with AI development. Then I list out different case studies of the Brussels Effect and look at the time differences between the enactment of a Regulation within the EU and its replication in other countries outside Europe.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on your timelines for the development of Transformative AI, understanding the 'Brussels Gap' could be directly useful for weighing up the importance of the Brussels Effect.</p><p>If you're already up to speed with Brussels Effect, I'd suggest skipping to the section titled \"The 'Brussels Gap'\".</p><h1>Background Information:</h1><h2>What is the Brussels Effect?</h2><p>The \"Brussels Effect\" refers to the EU's unilateral ability to regulate the global marketplace<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuriaz1udwt9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuriaz1udwt9\">[1]</a></sup></span>. This ability allows legislation and policy adopted by the EU to diffuse to other jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p><p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a salient example of this. The Regulation was passed by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU in 2016 and came into effect on the 25th of May, 2018.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefedotgzdylw4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnedotgzdylw4\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671970112/mirroredImages/QjeruoGQmYZh2ZsCt/kln1dwvqdw9npdyictyr.png\"></p><p>Introducing the GDPR led to a ripple effect; India, Japan, Brazil and elsewhere began emulating the Regulation.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671970112/mirroredImages/QjeruoGQmYZh2ZsCt/pewjnlyvwpqojzvrt3gb.png\"></p><h2>Types of Brussels Effect</h2><p><strong>De Facto BE</strong>: This is where conduct under a particular area is done under the unilateral EU rules, even when other states continue to maintain their own rules. Anu Bradford<u>&nbsp;</u>describes this as the 'convergence' of a company's global production and conducts towards EU regulations.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref342hu4puvcu\"><sup><a href=\"#fn342hu4puvcu\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>De Jure BE</strong>: Where states adopt EU regulations into their own legal body.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why does the Brussels Effect happen?</h2><p>Why do other countries choose to model after the EU? The two most substantial answers to this are (see Anu Bradford's&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9vzyc75zb9e\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9vzyc75zb9e\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;work for more):</p><h3>1. Institutional Competence</h3><p>The EU's architecture is incredibly complex. Here is an outline of how each body interacts with one another.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671970112/mirroredImages/QjeruoGQmYZh2ZsCt/pvxyg1ylosie8s5owpe6.png\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutions_of_the_European_Union#/media/File:Organs_of_the_European_Union.svg\"><u>Source</u></a></figcaption></figure><p>This complicated architecture has also had a 5.2% growth rate in all its bodies combined, with most of the staff being highly educated (usually possessing a master's degree).&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671970112/mirroredImages/QjeruoGQmYZh2ZsCt/dfsqt9ydvoiozvinipni.png\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317222468_The_Bureaucratic_Growth_of_the_European_Union\"><u>Source</u></a>: Page 1211</figcaption></figure><p>Both of these factors resulted in a signal of competence to other countries in the world, which results in a higher degree of trust in the EU's decisions and policies.&nbsp;</p><h3>2. Economic trade-offs</h3><p>The EU consists of 27 Member States, creating strong economic incentives for companies to operate within the EU so they can trade within these states. Those who want to participate in this internal market must comply with the Union's Regulations. Essentially, no one gets to keep their cake and eat it too. If you're going to get hold of the gains of trading within the EU, you'll have to obey the rules of the EU.&nbsp;</p><p>In creating an EU-compliant product, companies have a choice: do they create separate products for different jurisdictions, or do they standardise their products across the world? The latter is usually more economically feasible, which unlocks the ability for the rules of the EU to spread.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>What does the Brussels Effect have to do with AI?</h2><p>The EU is likely to introduce the 'Artificial Intelligence Act'. You can read through the proposal for the Regulation in full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52021PC0206\"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>This act would be the first of its kind. There has yet to be another regulator that has created laws to govern the production of AI systems. Given this, it seems likely that the Brussels Effect will come into play. If it does, other countries will look at the final Regulation and model their legislation on AI after the EU AI Act.&nbsp;</p><h1>The 'Brussels Gap'</h1><h2>Why does the Brussels Gap matter?</h2><p><i>Suppose</i> previous instances of the Brussels Gap are an indicator of how quickly countries/companies will move to emulate an EU Regulation. In that case, this should help us evaluate the importance of the Brussels Effect in regard to AI or any other area of relevance to the EA community.&nbsp;</p><p>Some instances of the de jure Brussels Effect have taken a while to occur. If one is concerned about the EU AI Act creating a worldwide AI governance regime, it could be a long wait before that materialises. However, if the primary focus of the BE is its occurrences in China, the United Kingdom and the United States, given their lopsided strength in AI capabilities research, then these concerns may be less warranted given their previous track record of relatively shorter Brussels Gaps.&nbsp;</p><p><br>While the United States is unlikely to implement national legislation on AI, specific states, like California with GDPR, could implement legislation that trickles into federal regulation via a de-facto channel.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5tzsswkeuvm\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5tzsswkeuvm\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If the Brussels Gap for California is short, then the Brussels Gap for the entire US could be short too.</p><h2>Case Studies</h2><p>The first two examples here will involve a de jure BE.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>General Data Protection Regulation</strong></h3><p><strong>Introduction of the Regulation</strong>: 2016</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>Country</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>Bill/Legislation (De Jure BE)</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>Year it was introduced</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>Brussels Gap</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>California - USA</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>California Consumer Privacy Act</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>2018</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>United Kingdom</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>Data Protection Act</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>2018</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>India</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>Digital Personal Data Protection Bill</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>2022</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>6</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>China</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>The China Personal Information Protection Law</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>2020</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>Japan</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>Act on the Protection of Personal Information (Amended)</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>2017</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>1</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>Brazil</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>2018</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;text-align:center\"><p>2</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3><strong>Consumer Safety&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) helped create a stark change to the manner in which chemical safety was regulated.

He thinks this approach could be valuable for a number of reasons, namely:</p><ol><li>Chickens don\u2019t have the same welfare protections as cows, which creates advantages for chicken producers over beef producers (and beef producers want to remove this unfair advantage)</li><li>Chicken is a lot cheaper than beef, so beef farmers have an incentive to raise the price of chickens (thereby creating less demand for chicken, whom we kill in much higher numbers than cows)</li><li>The beef industry is composed of certain actors, namely ranchers and feedlot operators, who are only invested in beef products, and no other meat products. As a result, they have very little to lose from welfare improvements or price increases for chicken.</li></ol><p>Robert also believes that a coalition with the beef industry might pave the way towards federal legislation to improve the welfare of chickens, especially important if state level sales-bans, such as Prop 12, are struck down by the Supreme Court. A coalition with the beef industry might be particularly powerful due to their large size (4x the market size of the poultry industry), widespread geographic distribution across the US, and significant political influence. Robert intends to work on this topic further over the next few months and encourages people to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/roberty\"><u>reach out</u></a> if they want to collaborate!&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nf8vsZwXdRvts4KeR/h5fu7skiedgskcaksygg\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vbhoFsyQmrntru6Kw/do-brains-contain-many-conscious-subsystems-if-so-should-we\"><u>Do Brains Contain Many Conscious Subsystems? If So, Should We Act Differently?</u></a> - Bob Fischer, Adam Shriver &amp; Michael St Jules (Rethink Priorities)</h2><p>The fifth post in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw\"><u>Moral Weights Project</u></a> by Rethink Priorities. This piece examines the Conscious Subsystems hypothesis, the theory that brains have multiple subsystems that can experience sensations that are otherwise inaccessible to the \u2018main\u2019 subject. For example, I, James, have one \u2018main\u2019 system that can experience sensations such as pain and pleasure (e.g. my consciousness), but this theory suggests there might be other subsystems that also experience pain and pleasure, but don\u2019t interact with the James that is writing this summary. This might be important for understanding which animals to prioritise, as it\u2019s possible that the number of subsystems scales with neuron count, meaning that humans could have 400x more suffering subsystems relative to chickens (as we have 400x the neuron count).</p><p>The authors conclude that they don\u2019t believe the Conscious Subsystems hypothesis is likely to change \u2018neartermist\u2019 allocation of spending between animal and human wellbeing, as animals are also likely to possess conscious subsystems. If it did, it would likely cause more resources to go towards improving welfare for small invertebrates, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2014/6/11/5799992/these-mites-live-on-your-face-and-come-out-to-have-sex-at-night\"><u>mites</u></a>, as views around consciousness that support Conscious Subsystems generally offer a lower bar for which organisms are conscious. However, overall, the authors note that they think the Conscious Subsystems hypothesis is very unlikely, and don\u2019t support acting as if it were true.</p><p>(As a disclaimer, this post and the one below is fairly technical, largely discussing philosophy of mind or consciousness).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WBWXLZTF5FPzmK8nh/octopuses-probably-don-t-have-nine-minds\"><u>Octopuses (Probably) Don't Have Nine Minds</u></a> - written by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://philpeople.org/profiles/joseph-gottlieb\">Joe Gottlieb</a> (and posted by Bob Fischer)</h2><p>The sixth post in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw\"><u>Moral Weights Project</u></a> by Rethink Priorities - they\u2019re on a role!

The report focuses on this being true for octopuses, the being who have the most evidence for there being multiple conscious subjects per organism.</p><p>The author\u2019s summary finding is that he believes there is a 2.5% likelihood that the default condition for an octopus is to house 9 welfare subjects, that is, subjects that can experience positive and negative emotional states. If this hypothesis were true, averting the suffering of an octopus would produce 9x as much impact in expectation, given 9x more welfare subjects whose lives are improved. This low likelihood is based on limited evidence for the question of whether octopuses house 9 conscious subjects (in this case, the arms of the octopus!), and even lower probability that these conscious subjects have the ability to experience emotions such as sadness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xCuKTeDfmuStcJaxJ/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals\"><u>Does Sentience Legislation help animals?</u></a> - Max Carpendale (Animal Ask)</h2><p>Animal Ask evaluates the impact of campaigning for legislation that recognises the sentience of animals, as a potential strategy for animal campaigning organisations. They find that animal sentience legislation is rarely introduced alongside meaningful change for animals, and often as a symbolic gesture. They also note there are some concerns that this could lead to complacency and humanewashing, however, it\u2019s still unlikely the ask would be overall harmful towards animal welfare progress.&nbsp;</p><p>Animal Ask also describes more successful cases of sentience legislation, such as in the UK where a committee was also established that will ensure government decisions give appropriate consideration to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/lobsters-octopus-and-crabs-recognised-as-sentient-beings\"><u>new animal sentience legislation</u></a>. In addition, this new sentience legislation included decapods and cephalopods, potentially a fairly important stepping stone to improving the lives of these animals. Overall, Animal Ask believes this is a moderately strong campaign for animal organisations, but believes their other recommendations are higher impact options, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards\"><u>banning low welfare imports</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/establish-a-code-of-practice-for-farmed-fish-in-the-uk-trout-and-salmon\"><u>establishing a code of practice for farmed fish</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nf8vsZwXdRvts4KeR/csua3xxbgxwuovdoc6rm\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4SpYcqZvuyZ8JyiCK/neuron-count-based-measures-may-currently-underweight\"><u>Neuron Count-Based Measures May Currently Underweight Suffering in Farmed Fish</u></a><u>&nbsp;</u>- MHR&nbsp;</h2><p>Following on previous posts on why&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Mfq7KxQRvkeLnJvoB/why-neuron-counts-shouldn-t-be-used-as-proxies-for-moral\"><u>neuron-counts aren\u2019t a particularly useful proxy</u></a> for moral importance of various animals, this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4SpYcqZvuyZ8JyiCK/neuron-count-based-measures-may-currently-underweight\"><u>post</u></a> addresses how current neuron counts might underweight the experiences of farmed fish. The key point is that current estimates for neuron counts of farmed fish are from very small fish, under 1g in weight. Despite this, these neuron count estimates are applied to farmed fish, which are often 1000x more massive, without any correction for the differences in body weight.</p><p>As a result, the author believes that calculations, such as those by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foodimpacts.org/\"><u>FoodImpacts.org</u></a>, dramatically underestimate the suffering of farmed fish in their welfare calculations. This is likely true despite the fact that neuron counts don\u2019t scale linearly with weight (e.g. a dog only has 50x the neuron count of a mouse, despite being about 1000x more heavy). MHR recommends that a grant to an animal welfare lab could provide much better estimates of neuron counts for farmed fish, given existing science already has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://foodimpacts.org/\"><u>these capabilities</u></a>, and this would be a useful addition to our understanding of fish welfare.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nf8vsZwXdRvts4KeR/z9v3q5ctuoft6ddjb6by\"></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "JamesOz"}}, {"_id": "YCy7fzXetAXnYgXeu", "title": "Effective Giving Recommendations in India?", "postedAt": "2022-12-23T12:58:17.824Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm trying to convince someone to donate effectively, but they only want to donate to charities in India.

Introduction</h2><p>There\u2019s a thing I call \u201csincerity\u201d that matters a lot to me. In particular, it\u2019s core to how I hope to orient towards the world. And it\u2019s one of the main things I look for in people and communities.</p><p>My hope, in this essay, is to bring what I mean by sincerity into clearer view. But the term has a fairly rich set of associations for me, which I\u2019m not sure will ultimately admit of a cleanly unified analysis. I start by discussing five of these associations. Sincerity seems to me closely related to:</p><ul><li>Something like truth-seeking (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Scout-Mindset-Perils-Defensive-Thinking/dp/0735217556\">scout-mindset</a>\u201d), but for agency as a whole rather than just beliefs</li><li>\u201cNot playing pretend\u201d</li><li>One\u2019s different motivations working in harmony</li><li>\u201cSeriousness\u201d</li><li>(Less confidently) Some stuff about non-ego/altruism/goodness</li></ul><p>I then discuss whether we can unify these five associations under a single principle. I offer two possibilities for doing so. The first is conceptual, and takes scout-mindset-but-for-agency as the core thing. The second is empirical, and takes \u201cnot playing pretend\u201d as the core thing. I\u2019m not sure either is adequate. &nbsp;</p><p>I also discuss a few of the many failure modes nearby to sincerity: self-deception, extremism, over-confidence, \u201cthe-normal-rules-don\u2019t-apply-to-me\u201d-ness, sanctimony, over-concern with sincerity itself (both in others, and in yourself), and that most straightforward and fearsome of failures: just plain picking the wrong actions, even if you did the other stuff right.</p><p><i>Thanks to Katja Grace, Ketan Ramakrishnan, Claire Zabel, Samira Nedungadi, Cate Hall, Bill Zito, Nick Whitaker, and Dwarkesh Patel for discussion.</i></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671907849/mirroredImages/qDT4raXEiaHJqvLE5/s2vqcigke8u5zqeatay0.png\"></figure><p><i>\u201cJeanne d\u2019Arc \u00e9coutant les voix,\u201d by Thirion, image source </i><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jeanne_d%27_Arc_(Eugene_Thirion).jpg\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></p><h2>2. Initial gestures</h2><blockquote><p>There is a true person of no rank who is always coming and going from the portals of your face.</p><p>Who is that true person of no rank?</p><p>- Linji</p></blockquote><p>Before jumping into the five associations above, I want to make a few more general gestures at the thing I have in mind when I say \u201csincerity,\u201d to get us at least somewhat oriented. First, I\u2019ll note and comment on some related words. Then, I\u2019ll describe some related feelings.</p><h3>2.1 Some words</h3><p>The word \u201csincerity,\u201d here, isn\u2019t perfect. In particular, I think it over-evokes something directly social \u2013 e.g. whether you are accurately presenting your beliefs and motivations to others. Google says: \u201cbeing free from pretense, hypocrisy, and deceit.\u201d</p><p>I think something about pretense is important here, and I discuss it below. But sincerity in the main sense I have in mind is compatible with lying (indeed, this is one of the dangers I discuss in the final section).</p><p>Suppose, for example, that per grand thought-experimental tradition, you are living amongst the Nazis.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv2lncu67br\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv2lncu67br\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;You hate Nazism and have total, steely internal clarity about this. When you lie to your boss about your loyalty to Hitler, you are clearly being insincere in one sense \u2013 but it\u2019s not the main sense I have in mind.</p><p>Also, \u201csincerity\u201d tempts you to group candidates for sincerity into only two buckets: \u201csincere\u201d and \u201cinsincere.\u201d But much of life is neither actively sincere (at least in my sense), nor especially insincere \u2013 consider, for example, a casual greeting.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0lhztjj8a1pf\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0lhztjj8a1pf\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>Still, despite these issues, \u201csincerity\u201d is the term I actually use. And I don\u2019t think this is an accident. So I\u2019m going to keep using it.</p><p>Another word is \u201cearnest.\u201d This might be closer \u2013 though it can sound a bit breathless. The idea of being \u201cin good faith\u201d seems related, but also too social. \u201cGenuine\u201d is also too social. \u201cAuthentic\u201d is too interested in the self. I\u2019m tempted by \u201cgood will,\u201d but unsure (more below).</p><p>So we\u2019ll have to do without an ideal word, here \u2013 and without easy reliance on everyday linguistic intuitions. And all this stuff is a mash of hazy cluster-concepts anyway. Still, I\u2019m hoping that with some examples, and some different angles of attack, we can bring something important into clearer focus.&nbsp;</p><h3>2.2 Some feelings</h3><p>Another way of trying to point at what I mean by sincerity would be to talk about related <i>feelings</i>. For example: there\u2019s some experience, in my own life, that I associate with returning to a place of greater sincerity, after having been lost in some fog, some agenda, some background <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/01/24/on-clinging\">clinging</a> I wasn\u2019t seeing. It\u2019s a feeling kind of like <i>relief</i>. Something unhooks and unblocks. Some space re-opens \u2013 one that feels receptive, responsive, and somehow restful, even if the circumstances are difficult and uncertain overall. There\u2019s a feeling of renewed internal clarity and harmony; and also, a renewed sense of self-trust, non-shame, of being \u201con my own side,\u201d of being willing to look myself and others in the eye.</p><p>It\u2019s also a space that feels ready to collaborate, negotiate, figure stuff out, make stuff happen. It feels engaged, and like some sort of energy is flowing smoothly.</p><p>And beyond this, it feels <i>good</i>; like coming home; like something falling into its proper place.</p><p>There are hazier feelings, too. It feels like sincerity is the doorway to real life. It\u2019s the thing that sees the real stakes. It\u2019s the opposite of playing pretend.</p><p>Hopefully some of these words and feelings can serve as initial pointers. Now I want to look at five different and more specific associations in more detail.&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Like truth-seeking, but for agency as a whole</h2><blockquote><p>I am a feather on the breath of God.</p><p>- Saint Hildegard of Bingen</p></blockquote><p>Let\u2019s start with the first association I listed above: namely, sincerity being like truth-seeking, but for agency as a whole. I\u2019ll start with an example, then try for a more abstract characterization.</p><h3>3.1 \u201cShould I do X?\u201d \u2013 fake and real</h3><p>Consider veganism. Whether you\u2019re a vegan or not, try asking yourself: \u201cshould I be vegan?\u201d</p><p>No need to answer. I\u2019m interested in what it\u2019s like to ask. In particular: I think there\u2019s a way of \u201cactually asking\u201d this question, and a way of \u201cfake asking\u201d it.</p><p>The \u201cactually asking\u201d version aspires to actually end up a vegan, if you should be a vegan; and to actually end up not-a-vegan, if you should not be a vegan. That is, it\u2019s an effort to make your behavior genuinely sensitive to something. The \u201cshould\u201d at stake is one your decision-making process is really trying to track, reflect, respond to.&nbsp;</p><p>The fake version does \u2026 something else. It resists opening the question fully.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqjxbk72eopd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqjxbk72eopd\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It\u2019s not willing to end up going either way. Rather, it constricts; tightens. It has a flavor of threat-response. Maybe it says the words, but it says them slant \u2013 in a mental posture contorted, at some level, by something hard and closed. It\u2019s not fully on board with the \u201cshould\u201d at stake; not ready to follow this \u201cshould\u201d wherever it leads.</p><p>Indeed, perhaps it\u2019s so off-board, at some level, that it barely <i>needs</i> to tighten up. Rather, the question it mouths is stillborn. Conversation on the topic would be barely a game. So there\u2019s no force for tightness to counteract; no risk of changing your life.</p><p>Vegans and non-vegans can both go fake, here. The non-vegan fake version is most familiar. Giving up meat and dairy is a direct and visceral cost. So is guilt about not doing so. The question threatens both. So it\u2019s easy to tense up or shut down.</p><p>But vegans can end up tense/dead here, too. Probably, they\u2019ve already paid lots of costs, to be vegan. Maybe they\u2019ve built an identity around it. Maybe they\u2019ve evangelized; announced; been a bit righteous. So the question threatens to deflate and disorient a core narrative; to make their sacrifice unnecessary; their activism, misguided. And the possibility that veganism \u2013 once noble and pure \u2013 is actively <i>wrong</i> is even more jarring to consider.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsd6pn7yjx4i\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsd6pn7yjx4i\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p>And there are other ways to end up in fake-mode for questions like this \u2013 especially if you\u2019re asking them in social contexts. Sometimes, a social context doesn\u2019t <i>allow</i> certain questions to be answered in certain ways \u2013 at least not without punishment.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3e7gu8az013\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3e7gu8az013\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Maybe a part of you wants to say \u201cyes, look, I value my own transitory pleasure and convenience more than I disvalue the severe suffering of these animals.\u201d Or maybe a part of you wants to say more extreme or selfish or disruptive things. Stuff about dogs eating dogs and what lambs say about eagles; about which number one ultimately looks out for; about the sick hypocrisy of our pretenses of purity. \u201c<a href=\"https://woub.org/2019/03/07/falstaffs-honour-speech/\">What is honor?

He that died o\u2019Wednesday</a>.\u201d But perhaps polite company does not permit you.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672230820/mirroredImages/qDT4raXEiaHJqvLE5/iccfvlqbhdkydd1sisdg.jpg\"></figure><p><i>\"Falstaff with big wine jar and cup,\u201d by Grutzner, image source </i><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gr%C3%BCtzner_Falstaff_mit_Kanne.jpg\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>Perhaps, indeed, the polite company is not so polite. Perhaps the polite company is structuring the conversation and concepts in adversarial ways; pressuring you to use a \u201cshould\u201d that is not really yours. Perhaps you cannot see this directly; but a part of you senses coercion, and that part shuts down, clamps up, rebels.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnw40rau9zon\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnw40rau9zon\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p>For this reason, I want to focus on what it\u2019s like to ask this sort of question when you\u2019re alone. To ask it just to yourself. To not be overheard. (Though even so, to be alone is not a simple thing. We are always overhearing ourselves. We have internal company, too \u2014 whether polite or impolite. And just as we can deceive ourselves, so too can we coerce ourselves. Indeed, the two are sometimes closely intertwined.)</p><p>The vegan example has a moral flavor, but you can ask fake \u201cshould\u201d questions in less moralized contexts, too. \u201cShould I quit my job?\u201d \u201cShould I break up with my partner?\u201d (Or, maybe more likely, you can perpetually fail to ask.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1840hbpoapk\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1840hbpoapk\">[7]</a></sup></span>) Even relative to some more purely prudential \u201cshould,\u201d such questions can implicate stuff it\u2019s hard to hold or look at. The stakes can get high and scary. It\u2019s easy to flinch away.</p><p>I don\u2019t have a full story about the difference between actually asking \u201cwhat should I do?\u201d and fake asking. But something about this difference matters a lot to me. And it feels closely related to what I mean by sincerity. Sincerity actually asks its questions. And it risks changing its life in response.</p><h3>3.2 The proper object of agency</h3><blockquote><p>Seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you</p><p>- Matthew 7:7</p></blockquote><p>Suppose we ran with this example. What sort of abstract characterization of sincerity would it suggest? Here\u2019s a first pass.</p><p>Recall \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Scout-Mindset-Perils-Defensive-Thinking/dp/0735217556\">scout-mindset</a>\u201d: the orientation towards belief-formation in which you\u2019re genuinely trying to get to the truth. If you\u2019re in scout-mindset, you\u2019re not <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/34XxbRFe54FycoCDw/the-bottom-line\">writing your conclusion first</a>, then trying to argue for it. You\u2019re not treating the process of belief-formation as a game, or a performance, or a status contest, or a dressing room for a new identity-costume. You\u2019re trying to understand what your situation really is; what\u2019s actually going on.&nbsp;</p><p>Scout-mindset and sincerity seem to me very closely connected \u2013 and they seem especially intertwined in the veganism example above. Scout-mindset is trying to follow the evidence where it really leads. Sincerity is trying to follow something where it really leads, too.</p><p>And they <i>feel </i>similar. Above I mentioned openness, responsiveness, and non-clinging. These are classic scout-mindset flavors. There\u2019s something <i>restful</i> about not needing the conclusion to be one thing or other; something <i>freeing</i> about being able to just really listen for clues about what\u2019s true; to just be trying to get it right, rather than to defend some agenda. Sincerity has a lot of that.</p><p>Indeed, I\u2019m tempted to see scout-mindset as a <i>part</i> of sincerity. Specifically, the belief part. That is, scout-mindset is sincere inquiry.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwnpj44jbgkb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwnpj44jbgkb\">[8]</a></sup></span>And sincerity is like scout-mindset, but for agency as a whole.</p><p>What does that mean? Well: truth is the proper object of belief (or so many scouts assume).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwu0gn9biaf9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwu0gn9biaf9\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;So scout-mindset gives belief its proper object. Thus, if sincerity were to agency as scout-mindset is to belief, then sincerity would give to agency\u2026</p><p>Does agency have a proper object? What\u2019s a \u201cproper object,\u201d anyway? Sounds a bit prim.</p><p>Still, philosophers often talk as though agency aims at something. Something about normativity, value, \u201creasons,\u201d \u201cwhat you should do,\u201d; the thing that the onrushing movement of your mind tries to reflect and respond to; the thing that can make choices into mistakes; the thing the veganism question above was about. So I\u2019m tempted by an abstract characterization of sincerity that appeals to something like this. For example:</p><blockquote><p><strong>First-pass definition</strong>: Sincerity (in the non-standard sense I have in mind) is actually trying to do what you have most reason to do.</p></blockquote><p>That is, just as scout-mindset actually tries to get your beliefs right, sincerity actually tries to get your decisions right.&nbsp;</p><p>We can break this into two parts. The first is epistemic: it\u2019s scout-mindset, applied to the question of what you have most reason to do. The sincere person asks: \u201cwhat, actually, should I do?\u201d And they really try to figure it out.</p><p>The second part is motivational: it\u2019s the readiness \u2013 indeed, the desire \u2013 to act on the answer that the first part supplies. That is, when sincerity asks \u201cwhat should I do?\u201d, the \u201cshould\u201d in question has real pull and force. If you talk with a sincere person about what to do, it feels like a real conversation; like the part of them that will make the decision is \u201cin the room\u201d \u2013 speaking, listening, trying to see.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreferwrczgyuno\"><sup><a href=\"#fnerwrczgyuno\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><p>I\u2019m interested in this definition partly because if, in my own life, I start to feel like I\u2019ve lost touch with sincerity, I find questions like \u201cwhat, actually, should I do?\u201d a helpful prompt. It\u2019s a way of inviting all the considerations, and all the parts of myself, to come to the table and speak openly. It\u2019s a reminder to myself that ultimately, there\u2019s no sense in making mistakes. By choosing the worse option \u2013 the option that I\u2019d ultimately regret choosing, if I really understood \u2014 I\u2019m not \u201cgetting away with something\u201d; I\u2019m not successfully defecting on my values, but winning some other, better prize. I\u2019m just choosing stuff I care about less over stuff I care about more. I\u2019m just fucking up.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9d35kvk36u5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9d35kvk36u5\">[11]</a></sup></span></p><h3>3.3 Is sincerity the opposite of weakness of will? (No.)</h3><blockquote><p>No soul would knowingly choose evil.</p><p><a href=\"https://brill.com/view/journals/jpt/9/1/article-p27_2.xml?language=en\">- Proclus</a></p></blockquote><p>Perhaps one asks: if sincerity is \u201cactually trying to do what you have most reason to do,\u201d why would anyone be anything other than sincere? Why try to do something else?</p><p>Why indeed.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhmyywefrglc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhmyywefrglc\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;And yet. Indeed, perhaps the veganism example is a reminder.</p><p>Socrates, famously, thought that no one errs on purpose.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuk0oveqqzw\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuk0oveqqzw\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Rather, all evil stems from ignorance: a mistake about what\u2019s good.</p><p>But people often claim to be erring even as they err. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have this extra drink.\u201d \u201cI should be working right now rather than doom-scrolling.\u201d \u201cEvil, be thou my good.\u201d And so on. Thus, that inspiring literature on \u201c<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weakness-will/\">weakness of the will</a>,\u201d and the like.&nbsp;</p><p>Is sincerity, then, \u201cstrength of will\u201d? Related, but wrong vibe. Too militaristic, disciplinarian. \u201cHarmony of will\u201d seems closer (though not everything \u2013 more below).</p><p>Indeed, once we\u2019re led into talk about \u201cweakness of the will\u201d as akin to the absence of sincerity, I start to think that the first-pass definition above is missing something.</p><p>For starters, weakness of will and the absence of sincerity just seem like different things. But also (though I feel a bit confused here), some cases of weakness of will seem compatible with sincerity. In particular: some weak-willed agents have genuine guilt/regret about what they\u2019re doing/not doing; and a genuine desire to change. If they could hit a button that would help them change \u2013 help strengthen the relevant will \u2013 they would.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefomhdz04dwx\"><sup><a href=\"#fnomhdz04dwx\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;And this seems like it recovers some dimension of sincerity \u2013 and maybe, most of it.</p><p>The first-pass definition above also raises questions about <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weakness-will/#WeakWillPoteRati\">Huck Finn cases</a> \u2013 another classic from this corner of the philosophical literature. Huck Finn helps free the slave Jim, out of sympathy for him, despite believing that it\u2019s wrong to do \u2013 and philosophers tend to like Huck regardless.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyirbdfx9hv\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyirbdfx9hv\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Naively, this looks like a failure of \u201cscout-mindset, but for agency.\u201d But was Huck sincere in my sense?</p><p>I\u2019m open to \u201cno,\u201d here \u2013 especially once Huck starts going into how \u201cso I reckoned I wouldn\u2019t bother no more about [doing right], but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time.\u201d But the case feels complicated, and it gives me some additional pause about the first-pass definition above. That said, I don\u2019t want to go into it too much, as \u201cscout-mindset, but for agency\u201d isn\u2019t the only angle I\u2019m interested in.</p><h3>3.4 Fake weakness of will</h3><p>I do, though, want to make one other note about cases of weakness of will where someone feels a lot of heartfelt guilt, regret, and so on. In particular: I think people often talk like that\u2019s what\u2019s going on when it\u2019s not \u2013 and this seems sincerity-relevant.</p><p>For example, in response to stuff with \u201cdemandingness\u201d vibes, like veganism or drowning children, one sometimes hears stuff like: \u201cI know that it\u2019s wrong that I keep doing X. But you see: I\u2019m a bad person. I\u2019m selfish. So, I don\u2019t do what I should do.\u201d</p><p>And sometimes, indeed, there is real pain in their voice. But sometimes there isn\u2019t. Rather, something seems suspiciously casual, cheerful, dead.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpreplgiyj6q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpreplgiyj6q\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Perhaps a certain discourse (\u201clet\u2019s systematize bourgeois western morality\u201d) is being placated, in a conversational context that cows quickly to self-criticism (even when costless and perfunctory). But we would not say such things, in such tones, about other wrongs; \u201creal wrongs\u201d; wrongs where there are social punishments, for example. And I do think this sort of case prompts questions about sincerity, in the sense I have in mind.</p><p>(See also Caplan on \u201c<a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/archives/2016/01/the_invisible_t.html\">missing moods</a>\u201d \u2013 a classic red flag about sincerity.)</p><p>(Here I\u2019m not trying to take a strong stand on how to deal with demandingness, though see <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/03/07/care-and-demandingness\">here</a> for some of my thoughts, and <a href=\"https://mindingourway.com/not-yet-gods/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/19/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable/\">here</a> for some other relevant discussions. And I\u2019m especially not saying: that people saying stuff like the above should shape up and do that super-demanding and coercive and totalizing thing that a bunch of themselves really hates. Also: I do think it\u2019s good to be able to be clear about when you don\u2019t endorse your actions, or are failing to live up to your values \u2014 rather than being forced into distortions \u2013 even if you know your behavior isn\u2019t going to change.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe3xtnhq5w2p\"><sup><a href=\"#fne3xtnhq5w2p\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;So the case seems complicated in lots of ways.)</p><p>Note, though, that we should be careful with our \u201cshoulds,\u201d here (and also with our \u201cwrongs,\u201d our \u201cbad persons,\u201d our \u201cmy values\u201d and so on). In particular: in a <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2020/12/20/alienation-and-meta-ethics-or-is-it-possible-you-should-maximize-helium\">previous essay</a>, I distinguished between two kinds: \u201cshoulds\u201d that would necessarily harmonize with your deepest values on reflection (often called \u201cinternalist\u201d), and \u201cshoulds\u201d that might not \u2013 that even after arbitrary reflection could remain fully and forever alien to everything you love and care about, despite their authority (somehow) over your deliberation (these are often called \u201cexternalist\u201d).</p><p>I like the former better, and they\u2019re the ones I\u2019ll typically have in mind when I talk about \u201cthe proper object of agency.\u201d But we might attempt to understand \u201cI shouldn\u2019t be doing what I\u2019m doing, but I\u2019m fine with that\u201d in terms of an externalist \u201cshould\u201d \u2013 i.e., the person is saying \u201cyes, by some external standard that I expect to remain alienated from even on ideal reflection, I shouldn\u2019t be doing this; but I have no loyalty to this standard\u201d (compare a paperclipper, acknowledging that it is \u201cwrong,\u201d in human language, to turn people into paperclips). If that is what they mean, diagnosing an absence of sincerity is more complicated, even on the first-pass definition above. And perhaps conversations about e.g. drowning children have more of this \u2013 or at least, more confusions in this vicinity, and a more mixed set of loyalties \u2013 than we often think.</p><h2><strong>4.

Specifically, in the Nazis case, you are playing pretend towards the Nazis. But you aren\u2019t playing pretend with yourself. So we call your relationship to the Nazis insincere, but your relationship to yourself sincere. And I\u2019m most interested, here, in your relationship to yourself.</p><p>What is it to play pretend with yourself? Perhaps one knows the feeling. We live buoyed and cowed, guided and coerced, by our own stories \u2013 and such stories bleed over into the stories that other people tell, too. So it\u2019s natural to try to tell harder, to ourselves, the stories we like more; or that others will like more; or that the others told us to tell.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7567cmjxakl\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7567cmjxakl\">[18]</a></sup></span></p><p>Maybe, for example, you\u2019re started campaigning to save the whales.

But maybe, actually, you mostly joined the campaign because it\u2019s high status in the world of this example \u2014 though joining for this reason, unfortunately, isn\u2019t. Good thing that\u2019s not your reason.</p><p>Or maybe you go live as a solitary monk in the mountains, telling yourself that you are seeking the face of the Ultimate. In fact, you are fleeing the face of your mother, and the embarrassment of having a hard time finding a job. Or perhaps you are interested, merely, in the <i>role</i> of \u201cmonk\u201d; the aesthetic of the robe and candles; the holier-than-thou. And let\u2019s say that a part of you knows this, but keeps pushing it under the rug.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg15hn1d2ap\"><sup><a href=\"#fng15hn1d2ap\">[19]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;No one else is watching, here. But you\u2019re performing nonetheless.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefem88uoxapfg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnem88uoxapfg\">[20]</a></sup></span></p><p>I\u2019m not trying to get preachy about motivational purity, here. Indeed, in many contexts, anxiety about the purity of one\u2019s motives is counter-productive. Often, it\u2019s the outcome that counts, and your motives matter insofar as they are clues about the likely outcome (more on this below). And anyway, for various virtues \u2013 courage, generosity, integrity \u2013 acting like you have them, especially when the stakes are high, is either a candidate path to the real thing, or close to it already (Lewis: \u201cDo not waste time bothering whether you \u2018love\u2019 your neighbor; act as if you did\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref40m9qh1qp6c\"><sup><a href=\"#fn40m9qh1qp6c\">[21]</a></sup></span>).</p><p>Still, something about \u201cnot playing pretend\u201d with yourself does seem important to sincerity in the sense I have in mind. Sincerity has a non-hollow-ness. It has a core, and not just a surface \u2013 a core that explains and predicts the surface, in some straightforward and \u201chonest\u201d way.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzk5vlvzjwk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzk5vlvzjwk\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;And this holds not just for outer surfaces \u2013 speech, action \u2013 but for inner ones as well \u2013 identities, narratives, mental postures, feelings. In this sense, sincerity makes it possible to look oneself in the eye; see clearly why you are doing what you are doing, without ruining some pretty story you were trying to tell.</p><p>Indeed, falling out of sincerity, for me, is closely associated with a feeling that I can\u2019t quite look myself in the eye; like there\u2019s some fog or fakeness or shame or something twisted up in my motivations and reasoning. And sometimes this is because I\u2019m being driven, in part, by some background agenda that isn\u2019t quite announcing itself and joining the conversation openly, and which doesn\u2019t expect to get endorsed, or made space for, if it does. Clinging (in the sense <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/01/24/on-clinging\">I\u2019ve written about previously</a>) is often a part of this \u2013 clinging, maybe, in relation to something about status or ego, to some fear or greed.</p><p>All that said, \u201cnot playing pretend with yourself\u201d doesn\u2019t seem like it captures all of sincerity, either. Often, for example, I can see the relevant \u201cbackground agenda\u201d pretty clearly: it\u2019s right there, definitely doing its thing. I\u2019m not <i>lying</i> to myself about that \u2013 or even, necessarily, looking away. My internal narrative seems fairly accurate. It\u2019s just that the agenda is too attention-grabby and twisted up in things to get held in perspective, or integrated into a balanced and wholehearted decision. And this feels like it messes with sincerity regardless.</p><p>Sometimes this comes up for me with writing, for example. Why does one write? \u201cSheer egoism\u201d is the first on <a href=\"https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/\">Orwell\u2019s list of motives</a>. \u201cDesire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be remembered after death \u2026 It is humbug to pretend that this is not a motive, and a strong one.\u201d Humbug, indeed. And yet, to perceive clearly egoism in one\u2019s writing, even as one writes, is neither to banish it, nor \u2013 I think \u2013 to render one\u2019s writing sincere. To see fog is not to see through it. Even now, this essay is full of fog (forgive me). So too is my life as a whole. I can feel it, and acknowledge it, and wish it away \u2013 and then get pulled right back in. Introspection \u2013 even when accurate \u2013 is not enough.</p><h2>5. Healthy stapleclippers</h2><blockquote><p>Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?<br>Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,</p><p>\u2026 Who has done his day\u2019s work? who will soonest be through with&nbsp;his supper?<br>Who wishes to walk with me?</p><p>Will you speak before I am gone?</p><p>\u2013 <a href=\"https://poets.org/poem/song-myself-51\">Whitman</a>, Song of Myself</p></blockquote><p>Let\u2019s turn, then, to a different ideal I associate with sincerity: namely, some sort of harmony between different parts of yourself.</p><p>For various people I know, something in this vicinity approaches the highest spiritual ideal. The assumed psychological model has different variants, but generally, your different motives and psychological patterns are \u201cparts\u201d \u2013 little mini agents with their own goals, beliefs, histories, traumas \u2013 and the key aspiration is to get these parts to resolve their misunderstandings/conflicts, and to play nice together: i.e., for their group dynamics to become more cooperative, trusting, gains-from-trade-realizing, and so on.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz5brp4mu6yl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz5brp4mu6yl\">[23]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Thus: maybe before, a part of you wanted staples, and a part of you wanted paperclips, and their relationship was dysfunctional. The clippy part was domineering and protective. The stapler part was scared and ashamed. But then, you moved to the Bay Area, and your parts talked it out, and now you maximize a joint paperclip-staple utility function in a way that\u2019s better for <i>both </i>parts, and your internal government functions smoothly and openly, and everything else is just the execution phase. You\u2019ve become the healthy stapleclipper that was inside you all along.</p><p>(I jest a bit: but I think this sort of multi-agent frame is actually quite useful.)</p><p>Can we map \u201csincerity\u201d to this vision of spiritual health? It\u2019s at least a bit tempting. In particular, various blockers to sincerity do seem like breakdowns of a type of internal harmony/cooperation. Thus, maybe your internal government has a set of \u201cofficial values,\u201d and a way of making decisions that are going to count as \u201cendorsed.\u201d But maybe some part of you is feeling left out, or judged, or coerced. Maybe it\u2019s gone underground, and started operating as a force distinct from the official narrative \u2013 one the official narrative either can\u2019t see, or doesn\u2019t want to see. Or maybe the official narrative <i>can</i> see it, but can\u2019t stop it. Maybe this part just \u201cgrabs the wheel\u201d when it sees its chance, regardless of previous agreements, established policies, and so on. Maybe the other parts surface, and notice, and feel some breakdown of internal order, but they are helpless to stop it, and are soon submerged again.</p><p>On this picture, then, sincerity is the operation of a functional and harmonious internal government \u2013 one that involves not just an accurate internal narrative, but a willingness, on the part of the internal citizens, to play by the rules. Such citizens feel heard and respected by their government, and thus, they accept and support it; they come to the table openly to discuss and share information; to listen and to trade; and to set a joint, mutually-beneficial policy. And then they abide by the results. Indeed, perhaps it is this sort of harmonious internal government that makes \u201cscout-mindset, but for agency\u201d possible. When you convene the council of \u201cwhat should I do,\u201d the relevant stake-holders are actually in the room, and they are able to speak and debate and compromise freely \u2013 without shame, without propaganda, without back rooms. &nbsp;</p><p>Still, I worry that this \u201chealthy stapleclipper\u201d vision of sincerity leaves some important aspects out: some aspects less about <i>process</i> and more about <i>content</i>; less about whether your internal government works, and more about what it\u2019s trying to do. I\u2019m not sure that, ultimately, we should make sure an analysis of sincerity has room for these aspects. But I want to flag them regardless.</p><h2>6. Seriousness</h2><blockquote><p>A serious house on serious earth it is<br>In whose blent air all our compulsions meet<br>Are recognisd and robed as destinies.<br>And that much never can be obsolete<br>Since someone will forever be surprising<br>A hunger in himself to be more serious<br>And gravitating with it to this ground<br>Which he once heard was proper to grow wise in<br>If only that so many dead lie round.</p><p>- Larkin, \u201c<a href=\"http://www.shigeku.com/xlib/lingshidao/waiwen/larkin.htm\">Church Going</a>\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The first aspect I have in mind is something about \u201cseriousness.\u201d</p><p>What is it to be serious? I think the concept probably needs its own essay. But, a few gestures.</p><p>Consider trolling. What\u2019s the thing it\u2019s not?</p><p>Or consider a friend who tells you excitedly that they are planning to start a direct air capture company to address climate change. But then you find out that they haven\u2019t tried to learn anything about direct air capture technology. What quality do you start to think they are lacking?</p><p>Or suppose that someone very smart says something very dumb, about a matter of grave importance. Dumb as in: clearly wrong upon a few moments\u2019 thought. But it was superficially clever, and said with casual confidence. Why did that happen?</p><p>Or consider most of the characters in the movie <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_Look_Up\">Don\u2019t Look Up</a>. What weren\u2019t they? &nbsp;</p><p>In all these cases, some <i>quality of attention</i> is missing. And it\u2019s a quality of attention that I associate strongly with sincerity.</p><p>But at least naively, this quality of attention doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s centrally a matter (or an expression) of your parts playing nice with each other, or of some kind of internal clarity about the office-supplies you personally prefer. Suppose that Nero fiddles while Rome burns. Suppose that the dilettante just likes flitting from thing to thing. Suppose that the socialite just enjoys the gossip. Maybe they\u2019re clear and coherent about their values and decision-process. But some quality of <i>seriousness </i>still seems like it\u2019s lacking, at least in normal circumstances; and so, too, some aspect of the sincerity I\u2019m interested in.</p><p>Relatedly: sincerity, for me, connotes <i>depth,</i> heartfelt-ness, and vulnerability \u2013 but staple-clipping need not. Yudkowsky writes about having \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SGR4GxFK7KmW7ckCB/something-to-protect\">something to protect</a>.\u201d Does that just mean: \u201chaving a utility function\u201d?<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefif1ddfwd69q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnif1ddfwd69q\">[24]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Nero can have that. So too the flippant socialite, the detached ironist, the casual troll. The ontology of utility functions does not, itself, make any immediate room for a \u201cdepth vs. shallowness\u201d dimension on which preferences can vary.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmszr0mgu33\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmszr0mgu33\">[25]</a></sup></span></p><p>And yet it feels like we need such a dimension.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref108c3jxmffv\"><sup><a href=\"#fn108c3jxmffv\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Relative to other ways of arranging your soul, sincerity seems uniquely at odds with \u201cfucking around.\u201d It sees something <i>important</i>, in a way that even coherent preferences and harmonious self-government need not imply. It\u2019s not that sincerity need be grave, or dour. But something is not a joke, or a game. &nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, perhaps something is so much not a joke that it\u2019s hard to speak about. Something, perhaps, too real to hold steadily. Something that could blind like the sun. Something searing.</p><h2>7. Other associations with non-ego/altruism/goodness</h2><blockquote><p>Go, my son, and do something worth doing.</p><p>- George MacDonald, Phantastes</p></blockquote><p>Seriousness is one association with sincerity that healthy staple-clipping doesn\u2019t obviously capture. I want to briefly note a few others \u2013 albeit, ones I\u2019m less confident about.</p><p>Thus: I associate sincerity with some quality in the opposite direction of the ego \u2013 some humility, some openness, some willingness to let go of the self and turn towards the world.</p><p>The koan I quoted above has some of this. Who is that true person of no rank, who is always coming and going from your face?<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdkvyswegmqh\"><sup><a href=\"#fndkvyswegmqh\">[27]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;\u201cTrue person\u201d is one thing, and sounds sincerity-relevant. But \u201cno rank\u201d seems relevant, too. Here I think of a very sincere-seeming man I met once, who was doing something that I thought good, and organizing some other people to help. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get a medal,\u201d he said.</p><p>And \u201cseriousness\u201d alone is suggestive, here. Often, if you\u2019re serious about something, it\u2019s sufficiently important that stuff about \u201crank\u201d falls aside. Suppose, for example, that you and many others are on a ship, and it\u2019s sinking.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9ujjk0qybwt\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9ujjk0qybwt\">[28]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Suppose that someone needs to tie various knots, and you take pride in your knot-tying, and maybe knot-tying is high status for some reason. Who do you want to tie the knots? The one whose knots will hold best \u2013 whoever that is. A sinking ship is not a time for pride and status stuff.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2q9q2f5lrde\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2q9q2f5lrde\">[29]</a></sup></span></p><p>But I also think there\u2019s a deeper connection between non-ego and sincerity, stemming from the scout-mindset-but-for-agency thing. In particular: we generally take \u201cwhat should I do?\u201d to implicate the interests of people other than the self, and to countenance actions that might put the self\u2019s comforts and narratives and social aspirations at risk. Indeed, there\u2019s a grand tradition of thinking that sometimes, what one \u201cshould do\u201d can ask very much of the self indeed (cf \u201c<a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/03/07/care-and-demandingness\">demandingness</a>,\u201d but not just this).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9u9gskeique\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9u9gskeique\">[30]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;And there is question of how much of that sort of thing one is up for \u2013 and thus, of how far one is willing to follow this whole \u201cshould\u201d business, if it leads in demanding directions. If you <i>should</i> do blah hard thing \u2013 and here I mean a real should, not some fake purity virtue thing people want you to nod at, not some \u201c<a href=\"https://mindingourway.com/not-yet-gods/\">in an ideal world of infinite willpower</a>,\u201d but something where you yourself would say \u201cnot doing blah hard thing was such a fuck-up\u201d if you really understood \u2013 do you want to?</p><p>Scout-mindset-but-for-agency is a \u201cyes,\u201d here. And while it can seem an easy question (\u201cshould I do what I should do?\u201d), at least in the seminar room, it\u2019s famously not, when the oh-right-this-is-why-we-called-it-\u201chard\u201d shows up for real \u2013 and especially not, after some initial burst of enthusiasm fades, and you are left with just the warp and weft of the thing itself, the costs and the benefits, the work to be done.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeunyvjygjxe\"><sup><a href=\"#fneunyvjygjxe\">[31]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Indeed, plausibly, struggles with whether or not to do what one thinks one should do account for a good portion of the moral drama of human life (though less, I think, than sometimes supposed) \u2013 and we often think that some temptation or constriction related to the ego is importantly responsible. Here I think of a Kantian professor I had, who thought (he had a variety of unusual views) that human souls exist beyond all space and time, and that they only ever make one choice: between the self, and the moral law \u2013 and that your life is just the shadow of this choice, scattered across time. Some Christians imagine something similar: ultimately, one either chooses God, or self.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4tzz77amfy\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4tzz77amfy\">[32]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If the latter, one finds that in fact, one chose only nothingness, ashes, and finally hell. And yet, somehow, the choice is not easy.</p><p>We might look for other traditions, too, that put pride, ego, self on the one hand, and goodness, love, God, on the other. And such traditions offer other (maybe more challenging) words to contend with, too: words like duty, submission, surrender. \u201c<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4899-7216-3_28\">As if he or she were a feather on the breath of God</a>.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5ou3s2jpkp\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5ou3s2jpkp\">[33]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(See also, from a different tradition: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7ZqGiPHTpiDMwqMN2/twelve-virtues-of-rationality\">Let the winds of evidence blow you about as though you are a leaf, with no direction of your own</a>.\u201d)</p><p>We need not like such traditions. But I see sincerity as closely related to the thing they are seeking (and sometimes, manipulating) \u2013 and closely related, as well, to various religious impulses more broadly. To the extent there is a tension between holding on to something about the self, and following \u201cwhat should I do?\u201d where it leads, sincerity chooses the latter, or aspires to. In this sense, it knows its loyalty \u2013 and it\u2019s this loyalty that makes scout-mindset-but-for-agency possible. But such loyalty does indeed involve some type of surrender, openness, letting go;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref82mp9ozlysh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn82mp9ozlysh\">[34]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;or at least, some ability to hold the ego, and its many fears, as one-thing-amongst-many; to let one voice go quiet, that others may speak.</p><p>I also associate sincerity with a broader variety of moral compliments: compliments, for example, to do with \u201cgood faith,\u201d \u201cgood will,\u201d \u201c<a href=\"https://oll.libertyfund.org/quote/adam-smith-public-spirit\">public spirit</a>.\u201d Often, we invoke such terms when there is some common project with which someone\u2019s narrow interests could be in tension \u2013 and we call \u201cgood\u201d the orientation that resolves this tension in the pro-social direction. So here, again, I find an association between sincerity and some willingness to set the self aside. And indeed, even more broadly, when I think of my own inner picture of what it is to be a \u201cgood person\u201d (yes, yes, it\u2019s a tricky term \u2013 feel free to drop it) some vibe nearby to sincerity comes strongly to the fore.</p><h3>7.1 How close is the connection between sincerity and goodness?</h3><blockquote><p>To bear and not to own;</p><p>to act and not lay claim;</p><p>to do the work and let it go\u2026</p><p>- Tao Te Ching</p></blockquote><p>Notably, though: these sorts of associations seem especially ill-suited to the \u201chealthy staple-clipper\u201d model I discussed above, at least if we wish to extend that model across a sufficiently diverse variety of possible agents. The class of \u201chealthy staple-clippers\u201d \u2013 that is, agents who have resolved conflicts between their different motivations, and formed a well-functioning internal government \u2013 is quite wide: it includes egoists, sadists, status-maximizers, paperclippers, and all the rest. The class of healthy staple-clippers we might want to call \u201cserious,\u201d in a given context, is somewhat narrower, but plausibly, various egoists, sadists, status-maximizers, and paperclippers will still qualify. Here I think, for example, of the world of Game of Thrones \u2013 hardly a scene of Christian virtue, but plausibly, a place with lots of agents who are in the relevant sense \u201cserious\u201d running around (cf <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/House_Lannister\">the Lannisters</a>, <a href=\"https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Petyr_Baelish\">Littlefinger</a>, etc). And various villains in our own world, and our own history, seem unfortunately \u201cserious\u201d as well (though not all: indeed, much of the worst contemporary stuff seems insultingly unserious).</p><p>What\u2019s more, depending on your meta-ethics, such agents need not be diagnosable with any failures of \u201cscout-mindset-but-for-agency.\u201d Anti-realism/subjectivism famously admits that the paperclipper is guilty of no irrationality: when it asks its equivalent of \u201cwhat should I do,\u201d the answer is to max those clips. So too the equivalent for some egoists, sadists, status-maximizers, and the like. Various anti-realists hope that in the real world, the problem with such agents is that they aren\u2019t <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/06/21/on-the-limits-of-idealized-values\">well-enough-informed</a>, or that their parts aren\u2019t playing nice with one another. But the hope rings a bit wishful \u2013 and even if it\u2019s true, it\u2019s contingently so.</p><p>For anti-realists, then, is Cersei Lannister as sincere as Jon Snow, with his doe-eyes? Is the scheming sadist as sincere as the diligent public servant? If we wish to build in some conceptual connection between sincerity and goodness/altruism/non-ego, we might look for ways to say \u201cno,\u201d here \u2013 and in the next section, I\u2019ll discuss some. But I\u2019m not sure we should do that. I feel the temptation, but I\u2019m wary of trying to make all my favorite things one thing \u2013 of trying to shoehorn all virtues into a single core.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefapq8e2skzxr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnapq8e2skzxr\">[35]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;And I do think there\u2019s a sense in which Cerseis and sadists <i>can be</i> sincere \u2013 albeit, sincere about bad stuff.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671907848/mirroredImages/qDT4raXEiaHJqvLE5/kxhxprs3vd5zfkfctorh.jpg\"></figure><p><i>\u201cNero\u2019s Torches,\u201d by Siemiradzki, image source </i><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Siemiradski_Fackeln.jpg\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>Still: in practice, and in the actual world, I have strong associations between sincerity and stuff like goodness/altruism/non-ego. Other things equal, I prefer analyses that vindicate or explain this connection. &nbsp;</p><h2>8. Can we unify all these associations under a single principle?</h2><p>So far, I\u2019ve discussed five associations with sincerity:</p><ol><li>Scout-mindset, but for agency as a whole</li><li>\u201cNot playing pretend\u201d</li><li>Healthy staple-clipping (i.e., your parts playing nice with each other, in the context of a well-functioning internal government)</li><li>\u201cSeriousness\u201d</li><li>Other stuff about non-ego/altruism/goodness</li></ol><p>Five things is a lot. And the discussion, more generally, has been a bit, erm, intricate. Can we cut through the noise, here, to a simpler and more unified characterization?</p><p>I\u2019m not sure. Here I\u2019ll discuss two possible ways one might try: one conceptual, and the other empirical. There are various others \u2013 but this essay is long enough. And anyway, I\u2019m not sure we should be especially attached to unification, or to validating all of these associations in particular.</p><h3>8.1 True paths</h3><blockquote><p>These are the words we dimly hear\u2026</p><p><a href=\"https://onbeing.org/poetry/go-to-the-limits-of-your-longing/\">Rilke</a></p></blockquote><p>To my mind, the biggest problem for unifying 1-5, at a conceptual level, is some of them are about <i>process</i> \u2013 that is, about the \u201cstructure\u201d of your agency \u2014 and some of them are about <i>content</i> \u2013 that is, about, roughly, what you value, and how much. Specifically, I think of 1-3 as process, and 4-5 as content. We saw this, in the last two sections, when we encountered healthy staple-clippers who weren\u2019t \u201cserious\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d in a 4-5-ish way. It\u2019s that classic issue for anti-realism.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj3z1agcyvxc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj3z1agcyvxc\">[36]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;People often want their favorite stuff \u2013 morality, goodness, etc \u2013 to fall out of something structural-to-all-rational-agents.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdjkqudesv35\"><sup><a href=\"#fndjkqudesv35\">[37]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But the anti-realist\u2019s ontology doesn\u2019t cooperate.</p><p>Now, one option here is to go realist. Thus, we might say:</p><blockquote><p>Look, you know that thing where we traditionally think that the \u201cwhat should I do?\u201d at stake in scout-mindset-but-for-agency leads to things like goodness and altruism and morality and stuff? That\u2019s because it, uh, does \u2013 and not just for you, with the contingencies of your brain and evolution etc, but for all agents worthy of the word \u201crational.\u201d Jon Snow is more sincere than Cersei Lannister because Jon is listening harder for the wild and windy call of the true path; whereas Cersei\u2019s soul is closed and hard, and <a href=\"https://quotecatalog.com/quote/d-b-weiss-i-do-things-bec-O1MLXRa\">she has ears only for her own desires</a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefao1b7mja1cn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnao1b7mja1cn\">[38]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Thus: 5.</p><p>And also, with respect to 4, the true path is <i>serious</i>. In fact, it\u2019s basically the least-joke thing there is. Listening for it, what you hear is just: the entire world, in all its glory and beauty and pain. And to hear truly is not compatible with flippancy, or ironic detachment, or living your life as a troll. Too much is at stake.</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, we see instincts in this realist direction even in the therapeutic paradigm most closely associated (among my friends) with healthy staple-clipping: namely, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model\">Internal Family Systems</a> (IFS). Thus, in IFS, the thing that happens when your parts play nice is you return to <a href=\"https://ifs-institute.com/resources/articles/larger-self\">The Self</a> \u2013 a centered, open-hearted, peaceful version of yourself, which is implicitly treated as the \u201ctrue version\u201d (you know: your, um, soul), obscured by the distortions of your parts. The possibility that The Self might be a sadist, or an egoist, or a paperclipper, does not seem to be countenanced by the IFS tradition, at least in my (quite limited) exposure. To the contrary, The Self gets loaded up with specific, \u201ccontent-y\u201d compliments: notably Compassion, but also, Courage, Connectedness, Playfulness, Patience, and various others (see the \u201c8 C\u2019s\u201d and the \u201c5 P\u2019s\u201d <a href=\"https://www.therapywithalessio.com/articles/what-is-self-and-self-energy-in-ifs-internal-family-systems-therapy\">here</a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjwgdzkysd5r\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjwgdzkysd5r\">[39]</a></sup></span></p><p>This is importantly different from the more Humean, mini-agents-with-utility-functions picture that many of my anti-realist friends bring to their staple-clipping aspirations, and which we\u2019ve been working with thus far. On the Humean picture, there is no \u201ctrue self\u201d (and certainly no soul, or capital-letter-thing) that the parts distort; rather, there are just the group dynamics of the different parts interacting, maybe fighting for resources, maybe getting gains from trade, etc (you know, like game theory \u2014 game theory can\u2019t be woo, right?). If the parts are sadists and egoists, then so too is the gains-from-trade, compromise-utility-function agent some sadistic-egoistic mix. Compassion, Courage, Playfulness, and so on don\u2019t bloom out of nothingness.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflu4v8pwwv4e\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlu4v8pwwv4e\">[40]</a></sup></span></p><p>If we reject this Humean picture for a more IFS-ish one, then we might try to bridge the process-content gap via properties of The Self. That is, on this picture (it\u2019s basically moral realism), getting your parts to play nice (3) leads, also, to seriousness (4) and non-ego/altruism/goodness (5) (along with the other C\u2019s and P\u2019s). To the extent this is a prediction about all rational agents (just give the paperclipper therapy!), it looks rough, though. And one wonders, even, about quite-nearby agents, like Cersei.</p><h3>8.1.1 If there were a worthy and to-be-served God, would you want to serve Him?</h3><blockquote><p>Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror.<br>Just keep going. No feeling is final.<br>Don\u2019t let yourself lose me.</p><p>- <a href=\"https://onbeing.org/poetry/go-to-the-limits-of-your-longing/\">Rilke</a></p></blockquote><p>Indeed, the general problem with this realist-ish approach to trying to get 4-5 out of 1-3 is that the relevant forms of realism aren\u2019t very plausible (more on my views about this <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/category/meta-ethics\">here</a>). Still, I wonder whether we might get something like 4-5 out of something else: namely, the question of what a scout-mindset-but-for-agency agent would want to do, <i>if </i>a relevant form of realism turns out true (even granted that it\u2019s probably not). Here\u2019s a related religious example, to give you a flavor of what I mean.</p><p>Consider Bob, an atheist. And let\u2019s suppose that atheism is probably true, and that Bob\u2019s atheism is tracking the evidence that makes it so. Still, we can ask Bob: if somehow, Christianity (or whatever: pick your favorite theism) <i>were </i>true, and there was, actually, a just and perfect and worthy God at the foundation of all being, would you want to love Him, and serve Him, and surrender your will unto His \u2013 assuming, per Christianity, that this is to-be-done? &nbsp;</p><p>Maybe some folks get prissy about this sort of question. One way to do so is to deny that one can condition on such a thing, because it is meaningless or metaphysically impossible or whatever. But in many places in philosophy, one wants to be uncertain about things that, if false, are probably also meaningless/impossible. And are you really ready to e.g. bet anything against those things, or to say that you can\u2019t get evidence for them?</p><p>Beyond this, though, my guess is that some atheists are so invested in rejecting religion that they want to reject it <i>even conditional on it being true and righteous and to-be-accepted.</i> Thus, for example: \u201cAll this talk of service and surrender sounds servile, infantile. What is God, my big boss in the sky? I\u2019m my own man; my will is my own, thanks; I do what I like, and I don\u2019t take orders.\u201d And perhaps, to an atheist\u2019s ear, such talk sounds virtuous. Perhaps (though this is more complicated), <i>conditional on atheism,</i> it is. But <i>conditional on theism</i>, it is foolishness and sin \u2013 a childish desire to subvert the low and the high; to make of oneself some reality independent of Reality.</p><p>So it is important (if challenging), in considering such questions, to really condition on the view-you-don\u2019t-find-plausible. And when I do this, I find that, if there is a just and worthy God at the foundation of all beings \u2013 a God who, by His very nature, is to-be-served \u2013 then I want to serve Him. It\u2019s just that: there probably isn\u2019t.</p><p>(Indeed, many of the most sincere-seeming people I know \u2013 though not all \u2013 seem to me like the kind of people who <i>would be religious</i>, in worlds where religion was, like, true. And many of them were religious growing up.)</p><p>We can play a similar game with moral realism. Thus, consider Cersei, and recall her <a href=\"https://quotecatalog.com/quote/d-b-weiss-i-do-things-bec-O1MLXRa\">description of her ethic</a>, given before she condemns a woman to torture: \u201cI do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good\u2026 \u201c and so on. And let\u2019s suppose that Cersei, who has recently been taking philosophy classes, has almost all of her credence on some kind of anti-realist thing. Still, we can ask: \u201cCersei, if some kind of moral realism <i>were</i> true, and it was objectively wrong to kill your husband even independent of your attitudes (but also, somehow, in a way with <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/03/01/subjectivism-and-moral-authority\">authority</a> over your practical deliberation), would you want, then, to not have killed him?\u201d</p><p>One suspects that Cersei wouldn\u2019t say: \u201cOh, well in that case, of <i>course</i> I wouldn\u2019t want to have killed him \u2013 doing so would be objectively wrong! After all, I\u2019m only max-ing out my feeling-good because I think some kind of anti-realism is probably true, and there\u2019s nothing else to go on.\u201d Rather, one suspects that for Cersei, this whole ethics and meta-ethics business isn\u2019t actually playing much of a role in her deliberation at all. She\u2019s got her thing \u2013 feeling good \u2013 and she\u2019s going for it.</p><p>And even if we hold constant that moral realism is probably false, this attitude seems quite different from an agent who, if moral realism <i>were</i> true, would want to find out the moral law and follow it. It seems more likely that Jon Snow has this property than that Cersei does, even if they have similar credences on anti-realism.</p><p>So I\u2019m tempted to look for sincerity somewhere in this difference. In particular, to the extent Jon would want to act differently if the ethical/meta-ethical facts were different, it seems like he\u2019s exhibiting some kind of scout-mindset-but-for-agency that Cersei isn\u2019t. That is, Cersei doesn\u2019t care whether trying to feel max good is a <i>mistake</i>, or whether it\u2019s objectively <i>wrong</i>, or whether the true and righteous God looks on her as a force of darkness: her thing is feeling max good, just as Clippy\u2019s thing is clips. In this sense, she\u2019s a paperclipper everywhere \u2013 even in a world where the anti-realist ontology of paperclipping is misguided, and there is much more to life, and to morality, than what you care about.</p><p>Whereas the Jon-ish approach, as I\u2019m imagining it, is different.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1iyvmwszzbp\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1iyvmwszzbp\">[41]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The way I think about it is: in a world where there is an objective morality that I should honor and obey, I aspire to do so (just as: in a world where there is a worthy God who is to-be-served, I aspire to serve Him). In a world where what I should do is centrally a matter of what I care about, I aspire to do that, too. And in a world where this talk of \u201cshould\u201d is in some sense broken, I aspire to forge on its absence. Whether I would hold true to those aspirations, given the right sorts of evidence, is a further question (talk is cheap \u2013 and questions about \u201cshould I do what I should do?\u201d always <i>sound</i> easy).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzgb5huhqgkd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzgb5huhqgkd\">[42]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But even the aspiration feels to me like it marks some departure from pure paperclipping.</p><p>(Note that the dynamic at stake with an agent like Cersei, here, is importantly similar to the one <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2022/10/09/against-the-normative-realists-wager#v-speaking-the-nihilist-s-language\">I\u2019ve discussed previously</a>, with respect to the type of realist-inspired agent who burns people in nihilism worlds alive, for the sake of small benefits to people in realism worlds. In both cases, one takes an ontology from one meta-ethics \u2014 for Cersei, anti-realism or nihilism; for the realist wagerer, non-naturalist realism \u2013 and then applies it to a world where we have specifically said that some other meta-ethical ontology holds. And in both cases, I suggest, people should stop trying to make their favorite meta-ethics true even conditional on it being false.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsn0sqomfx7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsn0sqomfx7\">[43]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But I think this topic might need its own essay.)</p><p>If we specify that \u201cscout-mindset-but-for-agency\u201d implies something like what I just sketched, can we bridge the gap between \u201cscout-mindset-but-for-agency\u201d and stuff like \u201cseriousness\u201d and \u201cnon-ego/altruism/goodness,\u201d while still putting low probability on moral realism? It helps a bit, at least.</p><p>Thus, suppose Cersei comes to me and says: \u201cJoe, I know I\u2019ve been going around killing husbands and feeling max good. But that\u2019s because, as far as I can tell, that\u2019s <i>what I have most reason to do</i>, given that anti-realism about meta-ethics is probably true, and that feeling max good is what an ideally-coherent version of me would want. But obviously, if there <i>were</i> an objective morality on which it was often my duty to prioritize helping/not-harming others over my own pleasure, I\u2019d want to abide by it.\u201d And suppose that, when I check some other world with great evidence for an objective, altruistic morality, there\u2019s Cersei in the soup kitchen (read: The Athena-Parfit Long-Term Institute for Raising for Effectively Prioritizing Global Alignment Challenges), working away. It\u2019s a strange pattern of behavior from someone who just killed her husband (indeed, instructively so \u2013 how much does meta-ethics really matter to behavior?). But it does feel like points in favor of sincerity, in my book. And the same holds for the troll or the ironist who says \u201cobviously, I would get serious if anything was actually serious; it\u2019s just that, on my coherent-on-reflection values, very little is.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxn707o3e8y8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxn707o3e8y8\">[44]</a></sup></span></p><p>Still, is it enough? She\u2019s still killing her husband in the actual world. The troll is still trolling. Whatever strains of altruism and seriousness are at stake here are coming from some fairly thin and esoteric source \u2013 one that plausibly isn\u2019t especially present to you when someone seems sincere in the actual world. And does understanding sincerity really require so much talk about meta-ethics?</p><p>And anyway, there would be more work to do to spell out the conceptual story here \u2013 and in particular, to stich 1-3 together; to deal with questions about how to understand weakness of the will<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd8dgwcuzef\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd8dgwcuzef\">[45]</a></sup></span>; and the like.</p><p>For now, though, let\u2019s turn to a different way of trying to unify 1-5: namely, via appeal to empirical stuff.</p><h3>8.2 What type of not-playing-pretend does the social world care about?</h3><p>In some sense, all sorts of empirical hypotheses might serve to unify 1-5. At a high level, given blah conceptually distinct things, one can just hypothesize that in practice, they often come together. Thus, perhaps: \u201cin practice, there is some reasonably joint-in-nature-ish cluster of psychological traits in the vicinity of what Joe is talking about with sincerity, which tend to give rise to 1-5-ish stuff.\u201d Or more narrowly: \u201cin humans, getting your parts to play nice together often leads to seriousness, altruism, less self-deception, and more scout-mindset-for-agency.\u201d (EDIT 12/28: See also Paul Christiano's suggestion <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WDwGqLd2Puedouogq/on-sincerity?commentId=WMAh3ezr6inXauBxp#comments\">here</a> for another possible empirical-ish account.)</p><p>I\u2019m especially interested here, though, in a more specific tack: namely, one that hones in on \u201cnot playing pretend\u201d as the core feature of sincerity, and tries to explain the other associations via the contexts where questions about \u201cpretending\u201d tend to arise.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhvth0t7sg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhvth0t7sg\">[46]</a></sup></span></p><p>I\u2019m drawn to this approach partly because \u201cnot pretending\u201d is what sincerity, like, actually means, according to the dictionary. And the clearest cases of insincerity, even in my non-standard sense, involve some element of pretense. So it seems worth testing how far just this one factor can take us. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thus: how might we get to \u201cseriousness\u201d and \u201cnon-ego/altruism/goodness\u201d from \u201cnot playing pretend\u201d? Well, suppose that we take as a baseline expectation that many people care a lot about certain familiar and \u201cselfish\u201d things: things like their time and energy, their pleasure and pain, their social status, and their ego\u2019s story about themselves. There is a sense in which we expect almost everyone to be \u201csincere\u201d about these things: e.g., if you put someone on a sinking ship, you would expect them to be sincere in their concern for its sinking, and their efforts to not die. But it\u2019s so taken-for-granted that people want these things that we don\u2019t, often, need to really wonder about it.</p><p>Rather, we\u2019re more interested in questions about sincerity when some more pro-social good is at stake, the pursuit of which might in principle come into conflict with more self-regarding incentives. Indeed, often a given social practice comes with some tacit expectation that the pro-social good is what the participants are after, even when everyone knows all sorts of other motivations are likely swirling around.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref82c2bj1r1gt\"><sup><a href=\"#fn82c2bj1r1gt\">[47]</a></sup></span></p><p>Thus, for example: public conversation about some important topic X (say: the minimum wage) often comes with the tacit expectation that participants in the conversation are actually trying to get to the truth about X.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpm7fc80pwei\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpm7fc80pwei\">[48]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;So in a sense, if your participation in this conversation is centrally motivated by e.g. the desire to raise your social status or to signal loyalty to some tribe or something, you are \u201cplaying pretend\u201d relative to the tacit expectation of truth-seeking \u2013 even if this sort of playing pretend is quite common and unsurprising. &nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, if you are participating in some practical altruistic endeavor, like a campaign to save the whales, there is often some tacit expectation that you actually care about saving the whales. If you don\u2019t, and are instead just there for virtue-signaling or something, there is a sense in which you are playing pretend \u2013 and doing so in a way that would ruin the signaling, if revealed.</p><p>Indeed, why is virtue-signaling even a thing? Why care about showing that you have \u201cgood character\u201d? Because it matters, to our pro-social outcomes, who can be trusted with what; who will defect on the group behind its back, or in subtle or unsubtle ways; which sorts of motives and commitments actually predict someone\u2019s behavior, when push comes to shove. So we want to know who actually has blah pro-social goals, commitments, patterns of norm-obedience, etc, and whose motivations are more purely and naively selfish, status-y, and so on.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw8mj0583m3m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw8mj0583m3m\">[49]</a></sup></span></p><p>Thus, questions about sincerity arise, in practice, centrally with respect to more pro-social commitments. We associate sincerity with things like non-ego/altruism/goodness because these are pro-social things. And we associate it with \u201cseriousness\u201d because seriousness, in the relevant sense, is (sort-of) a pro-social thing, too. After all, how do we tell whether someone is serious? Plausibly, because they are visibly expending certain more standardly \u201cselfish\u201d resources \u2013 e.g., time, mental energy, risk, social capital \u2013 for the sake of some goal.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbcenuoj9sy4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbcenuoj9sy4\">[50]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We take for granted that people are \u201cserious\u201d about conserving such selfish resources: the interesting question is whether they are serious about anything else \u2013 whether there is anything in their life that they view as <i>more important</i> than the stuff we expect everyone to treat as important. (We also talk about \u201cseriousness\u201d with respect to selfish things \u2013 e.g., planning a good vacation, setting yourself up for a good retirement \u2013 but we\u2019re still generally judging this via someone\u2019s expenditure of resources like time, energy, money, etc.)</p><p>This sort of analysis of sincerity is centrally social, but it can extend to our inner lives as well. Thus, per <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Elephant-Brain-Hidden-Motives-Everyday/dp/0190495995\">The Elephant in the Brain</a> and similar vibes, the line between our presentation to others and our presentation to ourselves is blurry. In particular: we\u2019ve evolved as translucent creatures, in a context responsive to the fact that our inner motives leak out into the social world in ways we can\u2019t control. So if, in your heart, you\u2019ve got some non-pro-social aim \u2013 some aim where, if the tribe could see it, they\u2019d lose trust in you, or punish you, or stop granting you some kind of status, or whatever \u2013 this creates a kind of inner tension: some shame, some need to hide, some sense of not being fully cooperative and above-board.</p><p>One option, in response to this tension, is to try to push this non-pro-social aim under the rug, outside the awareness of your official narrative. But this creates a lot of frictions for your internal government (cf \u201chealthy staple-clipping\u201d), and it messes with your ability to deliberate, wholeheartedly, via the official conscious channels (cf \u201cscout-mindset-but-for-agency\u201d).</p><p>But another option is to arrange relations between your motives and commitments such that you\u2019re not ashamed of them. And because shame is such a centrally social thing (even if you\u2019re alone), and because the social world is especially invested in the relationship between your pro-social motives/commitments and your more selfish motivations, this is easiest if some substantial portion of your motivational landscape is actually pro-social, and/or if the structure of your commitments is such that the relevant \u201ctribe\u201d would recognize and accept it (though there are other routes to non-shame, too).</p><p>Here, the \u201ctribe\u201d you\u2019re responding to need not be the actual concrete humans surrounding you. Indeed, plausibly, we are often attempting to arrange our motives and commitments in a way that some more idealized set of peers \u2013 maybe the \u201cmoral community,\u201d maybe God, etc \u2013 would view as justified and defensible. And if we feel like we have done so, some part of us relaxes, and we breathe a sigh of relief. Thus, perhaps, that feeling of resolved internal tension that I, at least, associate with returning to greater sincerity. The idealized fantasy tribe is no longer upset. And perhaps, as well, this is where my sense that sincerity requires more than an accurate internal narrative comes from. Maybe you\u2019re not lying to yourself about your motives; but if the idealized fantasy tribe would be upset, some problem persists.</p><p>Of course, all of this is just handwavy, armchair speculation. Still, is it enough to unify 1-5 in a satisfying way? I dunno. It seems like there\u2019s at least something there, even if it\u2019s not especially clean and tidy. Indeed, perhaps the cynics (if they\u2019re still reading) have been thirsting for this sort of explanation all along.</p><p>One thing about this approach is that to the extent we use \u201cnot playing pretend\u201d as the actual core thing for sincerity, and explain the rest of 1-5 via more contingent social and psychological factors, we\u2019ll end up saying that Cerseis and status-maximizers and flippant socialites and the like are actually, at bottom, sincere, provided that they\u2019re suitably free of pretense. Maybe even trolls and ironists, too (though this gets a bit complicated, insofar as some kind of pretense is built into trolling and irony). But maybe this is OK. Maybe sincerity comes pretty cheap, especially once we move beyond the social realm and into someone\u2019s internal world. Or maybe: some kind of self-directed pretense or hiding or looking away is sufficiently common that it can explain the sense in which sincerity seems non-cheap. Saying this will likely require to me to get more specific about the <i>type</i> of sincere people I\u2019m especially excited about (i.e., \u201csincere about blah altruistic thing\u201d) \u2013 but perhaps that\u2019s OK too. And there is something nice about dealing with pretense-free Cerseis and status-maximizers as well (though if we\u2019re focused on internal sincerity, they may not be pretense-free with respect to me).</p><h3>8.3 Living with disunity</h3><p>Overall, while I\u2019ve set up \u201ccan we unify all my hazy and maybe-inconsistent associations with sincerity into something clean and nice\u201d as the driving dialectic of this essay, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually that important. I\u2019m interested if there\u2019s some clean joint-in-nature, here \u2013 some single core trait that my associations are responding to \u2013 and it seems worth checking. But no big surprise if not, and I don\u2019t want to get especially hung up on how we use the word.</p><p>I do think there\u2019s something important in this vicinity, though, even if it isn\u2019t simple or clean \u2013 indeed, something I view as very precious. My hope has been that by looking hard in this broad direction, from a variety of angles, we might become more sensitive to what this thing is \u2013 how it\u2019s structured, what it looks like and feels like, what propels it and constrains it. Perhaps, when we look extra close, we see, instead of one thing, many closely related things, overlapping to different degrees and in different combinations, interacting and supporting and complementing each other. Indeed, when I think of all my friends, with their different forms and flavors of sincerity, it becomes less tempting (though still not entirely <i>un</i>-tempting) to look for some simple, single core.</p><h2>9. Sincerity\u2019s failure modes</h2><blockquote><p>Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise.</p><p>- Ecclesiastes 7:16</p></blockquote><p>I want to close with a brief discussion of some failure modes nearby to sincerity.</p><p>Obviously, there are tons of these. And scary ones, too. I won\u2019t come near to doing them justice (this essay is already long enough). But I feel some obligation to at least mention them \u2013 in part because I expect that to some readers, they will feel quite salient. &nbsp;</p><p>Some failure modes have to do with corruption, rationalization, self-serving biases, self-deception. Failure modes where actually, you\u2019re much more of an asshole, even just in your heart, than you\u2019ve managed to convince yourself you are. One thing about these failure modes is that they\u2019re especially akin to the thing that sincerity is supposed to be guarding against. But to think you\u2019ve triumphed over something is an especially easy way to fall victim. &nbsp;</p><p>Other failure modes have to do with extremism, over-confidence, rigid-ness, ideological-ness, totalizing-ness. Maybe you treat your supposed sincerity about The Thing \u2013 your oh-so-fine feelings, your passionate conviction, your oh-so-crystal internal clarity \u2013 as a signal of some kind of righteousness and purity and definitely-true-ness and justified-in-doing-whatever-ness and the-normal-rules-don\u2019t-apply-ness. Here lies, indeed, too many horrors of history, and many more mundane misdeeds \u2013 including, notably, many more directly social forms of insincerity, where you, in your righteousness, start treating lying to your neighbors like lying to the Nazis. Pairs well with the first category, but they aren\u2019t the same, and importantly, they can come apart: not all noxious ideology is corrupt. Indeed, to look only for corruption is to miss deeper dangers.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671907848/mirroredImages/qDT4raXEiaHJqvLE5/xustuuvqwxq18ccdnvv0.jpg\"></figure><p><i>They called Robespierre \u201cThe Incorruptible.\u201d Image source </i><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Execution_de_Robespierre_full.jpg\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>Another failure mode has to do with being sanctimonious, patronizing, moralizing, holier-than-thou. This may be the failure mode most responsible for the sense in which sincerity, in others, is sometimes (often?) experienced as<i> annoying</i>; and perhaps, for that oh-so-pressing desire to expose the hypocrisy underneath some presentation of sincerity; to cut the moralizer down a peg.</p><p>Indeed, I worry that this essay itself succumbs to various failure modes in the vicinity of moralizing and sanctimony; and of related failure modes, to do with indulging in lofty flights of abstraction, at the cost of something more grounded and gritty and actually-real; of stuff related to loving \u201cyour neighbor,\u201d but not, like, Bob, the dude next door. And existing over-much in some \u201cmorality\u201d mode can be its own myopia. Orwell has some nice comments on this sort of thing, in <a href=\"https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/the-art-of-donald-mcgill/\">an essay</a> on the value of a certain genre of lewd cartoon for puncturing our purities:</p><blockquote><p>\u2026 two principles, noble folly and base wisdom, exist side by side in nearly every human being. If you look into your own mind, which are you, Don Quixote or Sancho Panza? Almost certainly you are both. There is one part of you that wishes to be a hero or a saint, but another part of you is a little fat man who sees very clearly the advantages of staying alive with a whole skin \u2026 I never read the proclamations of generals before battle, the speeches of fuehrers and prime ministers, the solidarity songs of public schools and left-wing political parties, national anthems, Temperance tracts, papal encyclicals and sermons against gambling and contraception, without seeming to hear in the background a chorus of raspberries from all the millions of common men to whom these high sentiments make no appeal. Nevertheless the high sentiments always win in the end, leaders who offer blood, toil, tears and sweat always get more out of their followers than those who offer safety and a good time. When it comes to the pinch, human beings are heroic. Women face childbed and the scrubbing brush, revolutionaries keep their mouths shut in the torture chamber, battleships go down with their guns still firing when their decks are awash. It is only that the other element in man, the lazy, cowardly, debt-bilking adulterer who is inside all of us, can never be suppressed altogether and needs a hearing occasionally. The comic post cards are one expression of his point of view, a humble one, less important than the music halls, but still worthy of attention.</p></blockquote><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671907848/mirroredImages/qDT4raXEiaHJqvLE5/sqerqxvtks8ywx9izmyy.png\"></figure><p><i>Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, by Jules David, image source </i><a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Don_Quixote_and_Sancho_Panza_by_Jules_David.png\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>I don\u2019t share Orwell\u2019s confidence that \u201chigh sentiments always win in the end.\u201d His was a different day; and while ours has much in the way of high-pitched moralizing, \u201chigh-pitched\u201d is distinct from \u201chigh.\u201d Nor am I especially excited about people blowing more raspberries at the gravest issues of our time.</p><p>Indeed, I\u2019m not, generally, a fan of irony, or of \u201ctrolling\u201d \u2013 as perhaps this essay has made clear. And to be ironic \u201call the way down,\u201d into the core of one\u2019s being, seems to me a sad emptiness, a serious deflection of responsibility \u2013 and sometimes, a path to casual evil.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz1aom0tfq7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz1aom0tfq7\">[51]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Indeed, various just-straight-up-bad things, in today\u2019s world, cloak themselves in irony as a cover, a mode of misdirection, a way of not being fully clear, even to yourself, about who you are, and what you are trying to do (various patterns on the alt-right are the obvious example, here).</p><p>Still, the image of Orwell\u2019s lewd cartoons (and the connection to their analogues in modern internet-culture) has stayed with me. It reminds me a bit of the jeers at Robespierre, during his oh-so-high-minded \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_the_Supreme_Being#Festival_of_the_Supreme_Being\">Festival of the Supreme Being</a>\u201d (film version <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Sd-f_anFJUo?t=132\">here</a>). Given the extent to which Robespierre seems to have fallen victim to a variety of failure modes nearby to sincerity, it seems like this sort of thing has a role to play.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671907848/mirroredImages/qDT4raXEiaHJqvLE5/eqpp43g5prbkvx1djhke.png\"></figure><p><i>\u201cThe Festival of the Supreme Being,\u201d by Demarchy.

Thus, with respect to others: it is much easier to debate whether someone is sincere or \u201cin good faith\u201d or whatever, with respect X, than to debate X on the merits; much easier to look for flaws and contradictions and \u201cgotchas!\u201d in a fellow human than to turn towards the world itself, and to shoulder, for yourself, the burden of understanding it, and acting well in response. And there are incentive problems, too: if we require that someone have no flaws, with respect to moral thing X, before they can talk about X or hold others to account for it, our accountability practices with respect to X will suffer.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz5cu8wu7pip\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz5cu8wu7pip\">[52]</a></sup></span></p><p>And we see a similar problem, mirrored, with respect to ourselves. Thus, it is easy to treat the question of whether one is <i>sincere</i> as, somehow, the main thing; to agonize endlessly about possible flaws or biases or rationalizations or contradictions in one\u2019s character; to turn most of one\u2019s moral gaze inwards, rather than outwards towards the world.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdmrpld7vkh\"><sup><a href=\"#fndmrpld7vkh\">[53]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This focus is especially likely if the dominant mode of criticism one expects is directed at one\u2019s sincerity, rather than the object-level merits of what one is trying to do (see previous paragraph). For a certain sort of psychology, though, such an incentive isn\u2019t necessary: anxiety about whether one is a \u201cgood person\u201d has always been a driving force.</p><p>But even just relative to questions about one\u2019s character and corruption, it\u2019s not clear how far your introspection will take you. Indeed, various quarters of philosophy have ceased to route their insults via your inner states \u2013 ceased to wonder, before calling the slaveholders evil, whether e.g. they were \u201ctrying their best\u201d; whether, on the evidence that they had at thetime, they were justified in thinking that slavery was OK. Evil, perhaps, is not a mental state; not some darkness you can always see in your soul. Your therapist can\u2019t always tell you. So too goodness. So too, perhaps, sincerity itself. Perhaps it\u2019s partly the world that makes you who you are.</p><p>But more importantly: who you are is not the point. Being a good person is not the point.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhmfqz2moaz\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhmfqz2moaz\">[54]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The point is the thing that a good person is looking at: the friend in need, the child dying, the beauty and the pain, the great song of the world.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref310jibjk7tw\"><sup><a href=\"#fn310jibjk7tw\">[55]</a></sup></span></p><p>Indeed, here lies the most straightforward failure, and what should be the scariest: just, simply, to pick the wrong actions, whatever your sincerity, whatever else you\u2019ve done right. To think you are doing blah, causing blah; that the world is blah way; that the good and the just point in blah direction; but then, to run headlong into that old thing, that terrible truth most holy and most high: the map is not territory.</p><p>Or even: to have the right map, but just, simply, to not be strong enough, to not be up to the task (as a friend put it to me: \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter whether you were right if you didn\u2019t do anything\u201d).</p><p>Thus, regardless of your sincerity: harm, waste, death, pain \u2013 and sometimes, irreparable. Perhaps, indeed, in seeking sincerity, you were really seeking an option of <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/02/07/killing-the-ants#ii-owning-it\">forgiveness</a>, of \u201cyou tried your best,\u201d of a pat on the back and a better-luck-next-time.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefclj6gbrh5sm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnclj6gbrh5sm\">[56]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But sometimes there are no next-times.

And in Christianity, it can seem like one is expected, always, to know in one\u2019s heart what is right and what is wrong, and the question is only: whether you have the inner strength to choose the right. Indeed, in my opinion, much of today\u2019s moral discourse assumes much too hard that various moral questions are easy, and that the truth of blah position is clear to anyone who isn\u2019t obviously an asshole, and that whether you are an asshole is quite immediately epistemically accessible if you would just, for a moment, stop to check. And perhaps, in many moral contexts, this isn\u2019t too bad a guide.

I would humbly suggest this is worth re-evaluating based on my analysis. As a potential direct existential risk, combined with the indirect impact as a possible catalyst for nuclear war, pandemics or other global catastrophes, climate change poses a dangerous multi-path threat to humanity. Using the Giving What We Can framework (Scale, Neglected, and Tractable), I evaluate climate change against two of the top funding priorities, nuclear war, and global pandemics. My discussion focuses on scale, neglectedness, and assessing future risk. I hope to convince the reader that climate change is worthy of further investigation as a top funding priority.&nbsp;</p><h2><u>Scale</u></h2><p>One justification apparently used to deprioritize climate change funding is scale. Climate change is positioned as not comparable to the <i>potential</i> of either a nuclear war or a global pandemic. We know conclusively however, that climate change is <i>actually&nbsp;</i>killing people today and doing irreversible damage to our planet\u2019s future. That gives it a definitive probabilistic advantage over nuclear war or pandemics. But what about the scale of potential harm done? Consider these numbers: Giving What We Can (GWWC) estimates the possible number of deaths from a nuclear war between the US and Russia would be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KJNrGbt3JWcYeifLk/p/FfxrwBdBDCg9YTh69\">roughly 50 million people</a> (I have excluded the potential impact from a nuclear winter scenario&nbsp;given the likelihood and severity is controversial)<strong><sup>1</sup>.</strong>&nbsp; Today by comparison, annual deaths related to fuel combustion alone (i.e., outside air pollution) are estimated to be 8.7 million<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>,&nbsp;with extreme weather contributing another five million deaths per year<strong><sup>3</sup></strong>. Using only these two numbers, which personally seems conservative, adds to 13.7 million total climate related deaths per year - today. This means in the next 3.7 years (by mid-August 2026) climate change will have already killed the equivalent of the nuclear war estimate. Extrapolating this to 2050 would equate to 384 million more climate related deaths by mid-century. <i>This is the equivalent of killing off the entire current population of the United States and South Korea combined in the next 28 years.&nbsp;</i>This is staggering. And the 13.7 million is likely a conservative estimate for future projections - the W.H.O. estimates that between 2030-2050<strong>&nbsp;</strong>climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress<strong><sup>4</sup></strong>. Most of these deaths will likely be in the global south, exacerbating the colonialist view of that population as disposable. If we also consider the indirect climate related risks which could trigger global conflicts and/or another pandemic, climate change would certainly appear to meet the threshold for scale/importance and therefore seems worthy of being (re)considered as a top funding priority.&nbsp;</p><h2><u>Neglectedness</u></h2><p>Another viewpoint seemingly used for deprioritizing climate change is that it does not meet the \u2018Neglected\u2019 threshold. With annual spending around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2021/\">$640 billion a year</a> it could certainly be said that climate change is more well-funded than other areas of need. The problem is that spending is dominated by a narrow focus on technical solutions, including carbon capture, improving currently existing energy technologies and infrastructure, and the clean energy transition. While technology based solutions will most certainly play a role in combating climate change, the widely marketed message that we can \u2018technology\u2019 our way out of the climate crisis is misleading, and highly improbable. So yes, technology funding related to climate change is certainly not neglected. However, there are other promising alternatives which exist today and are largely being ignored, including across EA fund options. This is good news - it creates an untapped opportunity for funding resources to expand beyond the prevailing belief in \u201ctechnology as one of the biggest levers there is\u201d and explore more deeply other solutions which do not overweight our faith in technology as the panacea. One approach I have not seen addressed in EA fund literature and offers the potential to be a game-changer, is degrowth. The principles of degrowth&nbsp;critique the global capitalist system which pursues growth at all costs, resulting in human exploitation and ecological destruction. There is a wealth of developing information on this emerging response to the climate crisis and I hope to discuss degrowth further in a follow up post. Suffice to say, this would easily meet the criteria for being a \u201cneglected\u201d opportunity within the climate change space.</p><h2><u>Assessing Future Risk</u></h2><p>There will always be an element of uncertainty when trying to quantify or prioritize a future risk. We do know for certain though that climate change <i>today</i> is causing death, destruction, and disease among our populations and to our planet, with no signs of slowing down. This positions climate change uniquely among other future risks like nuclear war or global pandemics which remain only probabilities at this point. Understanding we cannot ignore probabilities in the overall evaluation climate change can be evaluated against nuclear war, and a global pandemic using the <i>Risk = Probability(Harm)</i> equation<strong><sup>5</sup></strong>, where we make the following assumptions:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>A 75% probability that 13.7 million climate related deaths continue until 2100. For simplification I have not included all the possible puts and takes to this number through the end of the century but have rather attempted to discount this uncertainty by using a conservative probability estimate.</li><li>Use GWWC\u2019s probability and impact (harm) estimates for nuclear war and natural pandemics, along with Metaculus\u2019 November 2021 prediction for engineered pandemics<strong><sup>6</sup></strong>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The results indicate that climate change would be by far the greater risk to civilization during this century with the potential for 801.5 million deaths. The closest comparable threat would be an engineered pathogen with a 5% probability of killing 95% of the population resulting in 532 million deaths<strong><sup>7</sup></strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2><p>The scale of current and potential harm resulting from climate change is enormous. It is considerably greater than two of the current top funding priorities, nuclear war, and a global pandemic. And there remain neglected opportunities within the solution set for addressing climate change that could have dramatic impacts in the coming decades. There will always be a subjective element to how an individual or organization evaluates risk and ultimately prioritizes their giving. I am sure others will disagree with my analysis, but I hope to have at least made a thought provoking case for reconsidering the broader priority climate change might have within the various EA organizations.</p><h3>References&nbsp;</h3><ol><li>Giving What We Can \u2013 Improving Nuclear Security.&nbsp;<br><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/cause-areas/long-term-future/nuclear-security\">https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/cause-areas/long-term-future/nuclear-security</a></li><li>Vohra, Karn et. al.

Why farmed animal advocacy in Africa?</h1><p>We believe that farmed animal advocacy in Africa is a highly impactful project to work on for several reasons: &nbsp;</p><ul><li>The human population of Africa is expected to<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/272789/world-population-by-continent/\"><u> nearly triple by 2100</u></a>. Meat production in Africa has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/global-meat-production?time=2000..2020\"><u>nearly doubled since 2000</u></a>, and this rate is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sentientmedia.org/inside-the-dramatic-rise-of-factory-farming-in-africa/\"><u>expected to increase</u></a> to match the growing population and growing wealth of the continent.&nbsp;</li><li>Of all continents, Africa has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/10/3/417\"><u>highest growth rate</u></a> in aquatic farming.</li><li>Farmed animal advocacy is incredibly neglected in Africa \u2014 in 2019, Open Philanthropy estimated that only&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/lewis-bollard-lessons-learned-in-farm-animal-welfare\"><u>$1 million</u></a> went towards farmed animal advocacy work in Africa per year.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnngifruz64j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnngifruz64j\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</li><li>Building the farmed animal advocacy movement in Africa before intensive animal farming is locked-in may improve the lives of millions of animals in the near- and long-term future and potentially prevent millions of animals from being born in factory farming conditions.</li></ul><h1>3.

Joy also shared her findings in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-Z9Kh0XOu4\"><u>webinar with 24 external attendees</u></a> and we discussed this in a group session with organisations in our programme to help them apply these findings in practice. &nbsp;</p><p>In July, we released a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fc0f83868612547ed5e8292/t/62c1781e1cf1dd788912d48b/1656846381720/AAA+-+Asia+Landscape+Study+-+Jun+2022.pdf\"><u>scoping report</u></a> to understand the internal challenges and bottlenecks faced by farmed animal welfare (FAW)/vegan organisations in Asia. The purpose of our research was to:</p><ul><li>Explore what capacity building actions/interventions are most needed to solve the challenges faced by organisations in the region, and&nbsp;</li><li>Assess whether our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/our-programme\"><u>capacity building programme</u></a> should and can be expanded to the region. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>We concluded that our current programme was not the best fit for solving the challenges of Asian animal advocacy organisations; however, we think our findings are still useful to other capacity builders, donors, and advocates who are interested in growing the FAW/vegan movement in Asia.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676400068/mirroredImages/rEiWzbiWkyBSuLuGy/qssnmhslpqvtpb4qtmmc.png\"></p><p>This year, we also conducted wider outreach to develop a more unified animal advocacy movement in Africa. We attended 9 effective altruism and animal advocacy conferences where we gave presentations about the African animal advocacy landscape, highlighted the work that animal advocacy organisations are doing, found like-minded collaborators, and developed plans for increasing the capacity of animal advocates in 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to Joy\u2019s webinar highlighted above, we organised 2 additional webinars to share research on high-impact interventions with a total of 38 external attendees. We further developed our website to include an \u201c<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/our-reach\"><u>Our Reach</u></a>\u201d page to briefly introduce our partners to a wider audience. We worked on improving our communications and social media outreach, growing our LinkedIn followers from 565 to nearly 1400. In addition, we continuously updated our publicly available databases on areas such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/funding\"><u>funding sources</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/mentorship-and-training\"><u>mentorship and training</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/learning-resources\"><u>learning resources</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/research-support\"><u>research support</u></a>.</p><h1>4. Our 2023 Strategy</h1><h2>4.1 Capacity-building programme&nbsp;</h2><p>We intend to continue building&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/our-programme\"><u>the capacities</u></a> of animal advocates and organisations that are working on-the-ground in Africa to reduce animal suffering. We have helped&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/our-reach\"><u>17 organisations across 8 countries</u></a> this year. Our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/our-programme\"><u>programme</u></a> remains focused on helping organisations build the critical components of effective, evidence-based charities and on empowering them to overcome challenges, prepare for growth, and do more work to help animals in relatively neglected geographic regions. But we will be making some changes to it based on internal staff feedback and external feedback from our partner organisations.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than increasing the number of partners we work with, this year we intend to prioritise the most promising and strategically-aligned organisations, that are specifically focusing on farmed animal welfare. We plan to focus on these high-priority organisations, providing personalised and core support to directly improve their strategy and output; while building a wider network of advocates through our general, public work to facilitate connections and develop a coherent regional effort.&nbsp;</p><p>We also aim to host an Animal Advocacy Africa summit, bringing together all our partner organisations and other advocates to build relationships, learn from each other, and align on strategies for the farmed animal welfare movement in Africa. However, this remains lower priority for us and is contingent on meeting our funding gaps.</p><p>As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fc0f83868612547ed5e8292/t/60a525b24157ab11159c1867/1621435842201/AAA_Landscape_Research_Report-Findings_From_AAA.pdf\"><u>a lack of capacity is a key bottleneck</u></a> for animal advocacy organisations in Africa, we continue to believe that our capacity-building programme is a highly impactful way of building the animal movement in Africa. <strong>Our funding gap for this in 2023 is $155,000</strong>.</p><h2>4.2 Regranting programme</h2><p>Next, to address&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fc0f83868612547ed5e8292/t/60a525b24157ab11159c1867/1621435842201/AAA_Landscape_Research_Report-Findings_From_AAA.pdf\"><u>a lack of funding</u></a>, we plan to regrant to highly promising African animal advocates and organisations. We intend for grants to cover both intervention/programmatic-related expenses and expenses to help them learn, network, and professionalise.&nbsp;</p><p>We think regranting will have two important benefits:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>It will encourage effective programming and interventions that we think are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fc0f83868612547ed5e8292/t/6285d8b9b58daf0ba7d7ad16/1652938967969/AAA_Animal_Advocacy_Interventions.pdf\"><u>most likely to help farmed animals in African countries</u></a>.&nbsp;</li><li>It will be a two-pronged approach to pair with our capacity-building programme. As we build an organisation\u2019s capacity, this makes them more attractive to regrant to, further improving their capacity.</li></ol><p>You can read more about our regranting plans&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/17KRRxAe6XtX8-k7Z3948gFS45mlq4vds8DSfpisDygU/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>here</u></a>. Our <strong>funding gap</strong> for this regranting programme is <strong>$100,000</strong>.</p><h2>4.3 Identifying evidence-based strategies to mitigate the rise of factory farming in Africa as much as possible</h2><p>We recognise that factory farming is in its infancy in Africa, but are concerned with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fc0f83868612547ed5e8292/t/60abab01b2f183477c19c8f9/1621863173574/AAA_Landscape_Research_Report-Findings_From_Funders.pdf\"><u>growing signs of more intensive animal agriculture</u></a>. We want to better understand the current status and growth of factory farming across the African continent, as well as what can be done by and for advocates to prevent or slow the growth of this expansion.</p><p>We aim to build an evidence-based overview of the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>extent of factory farming in certain areas of the continent, the levels of meat production/consumption and imports/exports, public attitudes towards meat and animal farming, and the regulations governing animal farming. We are also interested in identifying the key social, cultural, economic, and political drivers of factory farming, as well as the key public and private institutions involved in the development of factory farming.</p><p>Creating a coherent, effective, and adaptable strategy to maximise farmed animal welfare requires planning for various uncertain future outcomes. Since this project is preventative in nature, a strong focus will be placed on making evidence based predictions about possible, probable, and preferred futures in light of various legislative, social, and corporate barriers. By fully understanding the trajectory of factory farming across the continent, we should be better equipped to prevent harmful developments.</p><p>We aim to be intersectional and collaborative in our approach to preventing factory farming in Africa. By drawing on contacts already known to and engaged with AAA, we plan to co-create advocacy strategies with our partner organisations, which will inform our recommendations with cultural knowledge and increase buy-in for executing the strategies. &nbsp;</p><p>Our <strong>funding gap</strong> for this project is <strong>$35,000</strong>.</p><h1>5. Operational Updates</h1><h2>5.1 Budget and financial information</h2><p>In 2022, AAA had a total annual budget of $143,616. Total expenses amounted to $100,300. ~83.5% of this was budgeted for our capacity-building program and research, covering areas like staff salaries and stipends given to our partner organisations. ~6.5% was allocated to operational expenses such as travel, office supplies and software subscriptions. Finally, we allocated ~10% as contingency in the event of emergencies.</p><p>Our funding this year primarily came from philanthropic funds - including the Effective Altruism (EA) Animal Welfare Fund and an Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) Movement Grant - and generous contributions from high net worth individuals such as Peter Singer. We also received an increasing amount of smaller donations from multiple individuals within the Effective Altruism and animal welfare/rights movements.</p><p>We are extremely grateful for the financial contributions made by individuals and organisations to Animal Advocacy Africa and to our partner organisations.</p><h2>5.2 Our staff</h2><p>Our staff are our most valuable resource. Our current team consists of Lynn Tan (Research Lead), Cameron King (Operations Lead), Jenna Hiscock (Communications Lead), Sopani Robert Neba (Programme Manager), Moritz Stumpe (Research Associate) and Sarmad Nasarullah (Part-Time Fundraiser). &nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676400068/mirroredImages/rEiWzbiWkyBSuLuGy/zpgwlhcn51s7j7ccubid.png\"></p><h1>6.

In short:&nbsp;</p><p>Development aid represents one fourth of all charitable giving worldwide and is not known for its immaculate efficiency and clandestine operations. The cost-effectiveness of many aid projects can be vastly improved and we believe there are many opportunities to do so.</p><p>In this post we will go over:</p><ul><li>Our near term plans.</li><li>Speculative plans for the long term.</li><li>How you can help!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We additionally hope sharing our tentative plans can be a step towards greater organizational transparency in the effective altruism community. Some, both inside and outside this community, will disagree that our organization is a good use of resources. Our funding would most likely have gone to highly effective charities counterfactually.</p><p>Being held accountable and scrutinized for our decisions, might hurt us in the short run but benefits everyone in the long run.</p><p>Many parliaments are surrounded by \u2018think-tanks\u2019 who seek to influence policy in directions that just so happen to benefit the industries which are funding them. Decision makers should be free to evaluate our organization\u2019s priorities and decide for themselves if they agree.</p><h1>Interventions we are excited about</h1><p>We are entering a well-established field and stand on the shoulders of giants.</p><p>There are many organizations with decades of experience doing great work to improve aid effectiveness - from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cega.berkeley.edu/\"><u>research institutes doing academic research</u></a>, to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unlockaid.org/\"><u>organizations solely focused on advocacy</u></a>.</p><p>Our work builds upon the collective research of thousands of academics, practitioners, and policy makers who have worked tirelessly for decades to improve the quality of aid.</p><p>As a new organization we have the ability to move fast and break things. Taking risks on one's own behalf is all well and good, but mistakes we make might hurt the efforts of other organizations advocating for cost-effective aid spending.</p><p>When we set out to prioritize between the many possible interventions, we looked for aid policies that experts in development and policymakers alike were excited about when interviewed.</p><p>We have reached three of interventions that we think look especially promising:</p><h2>Interventions we want to address in our first year:</h2><h3>Advocacy for cash-benchmarking of aid projects</h3><p>Cash-benchmarking advocacy was the intervention with the best reception among policymakers and academics we interviewed. Despite this, there is very little information available on cash-benchmarking. It doesn\u2019t even have a wikipedia page! Google\u2019s top result for cash-benchmarking is a one page report by USAID, describing a recent successful experiment they did.</p><p>The discrepancy between the possible impact of improved benchmarking, the excitement of decision-makers, and lack of high quality public material is larger than for any other improvement to aid we reviewed. To change this state of affairs we are producing a comprehensive report, which can serve as a safe point of referral for policymakers and advocates.</p><h3>Advocacy to affect aid cuts</h3><p>A recent trend in western countries is for governments to cut aid spending. In 2020, the UK government made the decision to cut its aid spending from 0.7 to 0.5% of GNI. In 2022 the newly elected Swedish government cut future spending from 1% to 0.7%.</p><p>Governments are also classifying previously non-aid budgetary items as belonging to aid. The UK government, for example, will include its inland spending on refugees as part of its international aid resulting in an additional de facto cut from 0.5 to 0.3%.</p><p>We believe advocacy to prevent these cuts looks promising. It can seem paradoxical that we both believe aid to be ineffective and want there to be more of it, but even if aid is less cost-effective than we desire it is still highly likely to save and improve more lives than what the money will be spent on counterfactually.</p><p>When cuts do happen, there are opportunities to affect how cuts are structured. Cuts which seek to keep the most cost-effective programs are much more desirable than cuts which seek to keep the most politically palatable programs.</p><p>We will be on the lookout for new proposals to cut aid spending, and campaign to preserve the amount and quality of aid.</p><h3>Expanding the talent pool in aid policy</h3><p>A thing that blindsided us, was the amount of incredibly bright students interested in working with us. Our call for student volunteers at Harvard received over 60 applications. We hadn\u2019t even officially launched the organization, before receiving our first unsolicited application!&nbsp;</p><p>International development has many more opportunities for impact, than there are people to pursue them. There are currently few opportunities within the effective altruism community to get a foot in the door and test ones fit for work with development policy. This is a tragedy, as many of the most important problems facing the world, whether it is combating air pollution in India or encouraging economic growth in Rwanda, likely will involve the passing of good policies.</p><p>Our comparative advantage is absolutely not to be running training programs, but we think the opportunity is too promising to pass up on if we can\u2019t find anyone else to take up the mantle.</p><h2>Topics we hope to address in the long run:</h2><p>For now, we are focused on the sections of development aid which can be readily measured and compared. Here we can confidently make claims about cost-effectiveness rank programs against one another.</p><p>We seek to become a credible voice within development policy. Advocating for various policies our team suspects to be beneficial, but which we cannot clearly justify through evidence alone is a quick way to throw away whatever credibility we succeed in building.</p><p>But not everything that matters can be easily measured. In time we want to address aid policies in domains that are more difficult to measure. Some of the more speculative domains, that we find exciting include:</p><h3>Increased spending on pandemic prevention in developing countries</h3><p>Covid-19 taught us many lessons. One of those lessons is that pandemic prevention requires a global outlook. Developing countries, already overseeing a host of other pressing health problems, can\u2019t afford to spend as much on pandemics than they would ideally like.</p><p>Development aid played a key role in mitigating the aids pandemic, it can play a key role in preventing future pandemics too. We believe there is promise in advocating for increased spending by wealthy governments on pandemic prevention in low-middle income countries.</p><h3>Advocacy for interventions which increase growth</h3><p>Systemic growth is a holy grail of development aid. Many of the top growth-increasing interventions have also proven to be some of the most intractable. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.endpoverty.org/blog/why-the-doha-rounds-failed\"><u>full doha agreement</u></a> would have encouraged growth, but proved too difficult to pass. We want to search specifically for the subset of interventions which increase growth and additionally are tractable to implement.</p><h1>How you can help</h1><p>If you\u2019re excited about our work, there are many ways you can contribute.</p><h2>Follow our work</h2><h3>On social media:</h3><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/aid_policy\"><u>Twitter</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100087203064101\"><u>Facebook</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/89354891/admin/\"><u>linkedin</u></a></p><h3>Subscribe to our newsletter:</h3><p><a href=\"https://aidpolicy.substack.com/\"><u>Newsletter</u></a></p><h2>Spread the word</h2><p>Many of our most promising opportunities have come through spontaneous connections, help increase our luck-surface by sharing the news of our existence with the world.</p><h2>Collaborate with us</h2><h3>If you work in a relevant governing body</h3><p>If you interface with aid policy, don't hesitate to reach out - we would love to meet you.</p><h3>If you work in a relevant NGO</h3><p>We are excited to partner with other organizations with similar values.

For each event, we\u2019re expecting around 1500 people to come together for a weekend of talks, workshops, and other opportunities. We put a special emphasis on networking and 1:1 meetings, and attendees frequently meet future collaborators, find new jobs, or make new friends.</p><p>You can check out content from previous conferences&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@EffectiveAltruismVideos/playlists?view=50&amp;sort=dd&amp;shelf_id=5\"><u>here</u></a>, and reflections from past attendees&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/effective-altruism-global\"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><h1>Is EA Global the right conference for me?</h1><p>EA Global is mostly aimed at people who have a solid understanding of the core ideas of effective altruism and who are already taking significant actions based on those ideas. This often looks like professionally working on effective-altruism-inspired projects or working out how best to work on such projects.&nbsp;</p><p>EAGx\u2019s are community-run conferences and tend to have broader admissions criteria. They are primarily for people familiar with the core ideas of effective altruism, who want to learn more about what they can do, and want to meet the community, especially in their region. You can see an up to date list of confirmed conferences and their dates&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/ea-global/events\"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to attend but are unsure about whether to apply, please err on the side of applying.

Though please note that for each event you will have to apply before the application deadline, and we will not be reviewing applications submitted in the window between this deadline and the upcoming conference. Additionally,&nbsp;<strong>please note that EAGx applications are separate</strong> as these are community run events with different admissions criteria.

Previously we\u2019ve been able to fund people to travel to any EA conference they\u2019ve been accepted to, but we will likely be significantly more conservative in the coming year. For example, we can still provide visa support letters, but we likely won\u2019t be able to fund visa expenses.

One seemingly common theme is claims being both strongly believed to be true based on intuitions, and logically impossible together. For example, Amanda Askell\u2019s PhD <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XDlo-8zexjYDvP8ryJ4v3OquW4KdDlDk/view\"><u>thesis</u></a>&nbsp;shows that we cannot jointly accept the following 5 axioms<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxhdwzeoxvk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxhdwzeoxvk\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(see p. 180):</p><blockquote><ul><li>Transitivity of \u227d. If w1 \u227d w2 and w2 \u227d w3 then w1 \u227d w3 [w1 is better than or as good as w3].</li><li>Permutation Principle. For any world pair \u27e8w1, w2\u27e9 and any <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection\"><u>bijection</u></a>&nbsp;g from the population of \u27e8w1, w2\u27e9 onto any population, there exists a world pair \u27e8w3, w4\u27e9 that is a qualitative duplicate of \u27e8w1, w2\u27e9 under bijection g.</li><li>Qualitativeness&nbsp;of \u227d. If the pair \u27e8w3, w4\u27e9 is a qualitative duplicate<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref06s8op6m98s9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn06s8op6m98s9\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;of the pair \u27e8w1, w2\u27e9, then w3 \u227d w4 if and only if w1 \u227d w2.</li><li>Pareto Principle. If w1 and w2 have identical populations and for all agents x in w1 and w2, uw1(x) \u2265 uw2(x) [utility of w1 greater or equal than that of w2], then w1 \u227d w2. If there is also some agent x in w1 and w2 such that uw1(x) &gt; uw2(x), then w1 \u227b w2.</li><li>Minimal Completeness of \u227d. Comparability between infinite worlds (w1 \u227d w2 or w2 \u227d w1) is not incredibly rare.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Moreover, if any action has a non-null chance of leading to both positive and negative utility, expected value calculations will always result in an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminate_form\"><u>indeterminate form</u></a>&nbsp;of the type inf - inf. Not ideal in case we want to compare anything at all!</p><h1>The implicit acceptance of the possibility of infinite worlds</h1><p>Axioms cannot be proved to be true or false. Rather, they provide a framework for assessing what is true or false. That being said, one can add/drop/update axioms so that the truthfulness of some claims matches our strongest intuitions.</p><p>Somewhat obviously but crucially, all problems in infinite ethics arise from the implicit acceptance of the possibility (i.e. non-null chance) of infinite worlds. Rejecting such worlds, one can, for instance, hold as true the aforementioned 5 axioms studied in Amanda\u2019s thesis.</p><h1>Rejecting the possibility of infinite worlds</h1><p>You may be thinking that rejecting the possibility of infinite worlds is not reasonable because we have non-null evidence of their existence. You would be in good company. According to <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/infinite.pdf\"><u>Bostrom 2011</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>We do not know for sure that we live in a canonically infinite world. Contemporary cosmology is in considerable flux, so its conclusions should be regarded as tentative. But it is definitely not reasonable, in light of the evidence we currently possess, to assume that we do not live in a canonically infinite world.</p></blockquote><p>However, I actually believe we have zero evidence about the existence of infinite worlds:</p><ul><li>In maths, infinity is one of the <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/set-theory/%23AxiZFC\"><u>axioms</u></a>&nbsp;of ZMC set theory<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefapp5wxmga6f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnapp5wxmga6f\">[3]</a></sup></span>. So it is assumed true by definition, and accepting/rejecting it is not supported by any evidence.</li><li>In physics, all measurements have a finite sensitivity (smallest detectable variation) and range (minimum and maximum detectable value). So neither zero nor infinity are measurable. In other words, their existence is not falsifiable.</li></ul><p>One can produce infinities in physical laws by setting some variables to zero (1/0 = inf, and ln(0) = -inf), but that does not mean we have evidence for them. As explained in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-018-0238-1\"><u>Ellis 2018</u></a>, zeros and infinities are placeholders for very small and large quantities. We could explain reality just as well by replacing all zeros we have in physical laws by the very small number VS = 10^-10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10^10. Of course, I do not think there is a need for that. 0 is more concise and aesthetically appealing.</p><p>I can try to illustrate the point above. Suppose I hypothesise that all current human adults have a mass between 0.01 kg and 100 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonne\"><u>t</u></a>. I am pretty confident all data we have corroborates this hypothesis<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe97ilpsx65w\"><sup><a href=\"#fne97ilpsx65w\">[4]</a></sup></span>, and therefore the probability of it being true is essentially 1. Widening the mass interval of the hypothesis would make it more likely to be true, but this would not continue forever. We have a finite amount of evidence. For example, expanding the interval beyond VS kg to 1/VS kg would arguably not cover any additional evidence<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsy9rhutewx\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsy9rhutewx\">[5]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>Furthermore, infinities are compatible with the size of the whole being equal to that of each of its parts (e.g. inf = inf/2), and I find that quite unintuitive. Some types of infinity allow for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%25E2%2580%2593Tarski_paradox\"><u>Banach\u2013Tarski paradox</u></a>.</p><blockquote><p>This is often stated informally as \u201ca pea can be chopped up and reassembled into the Sun\u201d</p></blockquote><p>All in all, I prefer rejecting the existence of infinite worlds because I believe:</p><ul><li>They imply intuitively nonsensical claims to be true. For instance, I cannot see how one of Amanda\u2019s 5 axioms would be false.</li><li>There is no evidence for them.</li><li>They are not intuitively appealing. My senses, as physical instruments, are only able to perceive finite quantities.</li></ul><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnxhdwzeoxvk\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefxhdwzeoxvk\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;I liked listening to <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/amanda-askell-moral-empathy/\"><u>this</u></a>&nbsp;episode of Amanda on The 80,000 Hours Podcast.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn06s8op6m98s9\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref06s8op6m98s9\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><blockquote><p>&nbsp;One world pair is a \u2018qualitative duplicate\u2019 of the other if and only if it has all of the same qualitative properties and relations as the original world pair.</p></blockquote></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnapp5wxmga6f\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefapp5wxmga6f\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;The most common axiomatic set theory according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory%23Formalized_set_theory\"><u>Wikipedia</u></a>.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fne97ilpsx65w\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefe97ilpsx65w\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;According to Guinness World Records: the lightest person with an age over 16, <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/67485-lightest-person\"><u>Lucia Xarate</u></a>,&nbsp;weighed 2.13 kg at 17; the heaviest human ever, <a href=\"https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/heaviest-man\"><u>Jon Minnoch</u></a>,&nbsp;weighed 635 kg.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnsy9rhutewx\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefsy9rhutewx\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;The mass of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe\"><u>observable universe</u></a>&nbsp;is 1.5*10^53 kg, which is only 10^10^1.73 kg &lt;&lt; 1/VS kg.

That is, people generally trust other people to behave well and in accordance with the values of the community.&nbsp;</p><p>Being high-trust is great! It means that you can spend more time getting on with stuff and less time carefully checking each other for bad behaviour. It's also just <i>nicer</i>: It feels good and motivating to be trusted, and it is reassuring to support people you trust to do work.</p><p>I feel like a lot of posts I've seen recently have been arguing for the community to move to a <i>low-trust</i> regime, particularly with respect to EA organizations. That includes calls for:</p><ul><li>More transparency (\"we need to rigorously scrutinise even your small actions in case you're trying to sneak bad behaviour past us\")</li><li>More elaborate governance (\"there is a risk of governance capture and we need to seriously guard against it\", \"we don't trust the people currently doing governance\")</li></ul><p>Sometimes you have to move to low-trust regimes. It's common that organizations tend to move from high-trust to low-trust as they grow, due to the larger number of actors involved who can't all be assumed to be trustworthy. But I do not think that the EA community <i>actually</i> has the problems that require low-trust, and I think it would be very costly.</p><p>Specifically, I want to argue:</p><ol><li>Low-trust regimes are expensive, both in terms of resources and morale</li><li>The people working in current EA orgs are in fact very trustworthy</li><li>The EA community should remain high-trust (with checking)</li></ol><h2>Low-trust is costly</h2><p>Low-trust regimes impose costs in at least three ways:</p><ol><li>Costlier cooperation</li><li>Costlier delegation</li><li>General efficiency taxes</li></ol><p>The post <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/o6LNeNoHBA7Bv9kGE/bad-omens-in-current-ea-governance\">Bad Omens in current EA Governance</a> argues that due to the possibility of conflicts of interest we should break up the organisations which currently share ops support through EVF. This is a clear example of 1: if we can't trust people then we can't just <i>share</i> our resources, we have to keep everyone at arm's length. You can read in the comments various people explaining why this would be quite expensive.</p><p>Similarly, you can't just <i>delegate</i> power to people in a low-trust regime. What if they abuse it? Better to require explicit approval up the chain before they do anything serious like spend some money. But if you can't spend money you often can't <i>do</i> things, and activity ends up being blocked on approval, politics, and perception.</p><p>When you actually try to get anything done, low-trust regimes typically require lots of paper trails and approvals. Anyone who's worked in a larger organization can testify to how demoralizing and slow this can be. Since <i>any</i> decision can be questioned after the fact, there is no limit to how much \"transparency\" can be demanded, and how many pointless forms, proposals, reports, or forum posts can end up being produced. I think it is very easy to underestimate how destructive this can be to productivity.</p><p>Finally, it is plain demoralizing to be in a low-trust regime. High-trust says \"Yes, we are on the same team, go and attack the problem with my blessing!\". Low-trust says \"I guess I have to work with you but I'm expecting you to try and steal from me as soon as you have the opportunity, so I'm keeping an eye on you\". Where would you rather work?</p><h2>Current people in EA organisations are trustworthy</h2><p>(Disclaimer: I know quite a lot of people who work in EA organisations, so I'm definitely personally biased towards them.)</p><p>The FTX debacle has led to a lot of finger-pointing in recent months. A particular &nbsp;pattern has been posts listing large numbers of questions about the behaviour of particular organizations or individuals over the last few years. These often feel accusatory all by themselves: look at this big list of suspicious behaviour, surely something shady is going on! But it seems to me that in every instance that I've seen there has either been a good explanation <i>or</i> the failing has been at worst a) bad decisions made for good reasons, b) lapses in personal judgement, or c) genuine disagreements about which actions are worth doing.</p><p>Crucially, none of a), b) or c) are in my opinion things that justify a switch to low-trust. They suggest that we have normal, fallible people who are acting in good faith and doing their best. That's really the best that we can hope for! Low-trust measures won't help with any of this.</p><p>If anything, this argues that we could be <i>higher</i>-trust. Expending a lot of energy hunting for bad behaviour and not finding much is evidence that people are <i>more</i> trustworthy, not less!</p><p>Here are some examples.

Also, what if the charity turns out to be ineffective? Then you just wasted all your money and did no good. Don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s a simple solution. Just give to multiple charities and spread risk!</p><p>Thinking along these lines is natural. Whether it\u2019s risk aversion, or just an inherent desire to support multiple charities or causes, most of us diversify our philanthropic giving. If your goal is to do the most good however, you should fight this urge with all you\u2019ve got.</p><p>Diversification does make some sense, some of the time. If you\u2019re going to fill a charity\u2019s budget with your giving then any further giving should probably go elsewhere.</p><p>But most of us are small donors. Our giving usually won't fill a budget, or hit diminishing returns. It certainly won\u2019t hit diminishing returns at the level of an entire cause area, unless perhaps you\u2019re a billionaire philanthropist, in which case well done you.</p><p>When you\u2019re deciding where to give you likely have <i>some</i> idea of what the best option is. Maybe you want to help animals and are quite uncertain about how best to do so, but you lean towards thinking that giving to The Humane League (THL) to support their corporate campaigns is <i>slightly</i> better on the margin than giving to Faunalytics to support their research, even though you think there\u2019s a possibility either option is ineffective. In this case, <strong>you should give your full philanthropic budget to THL. </strong>Fight that urge to give to both charities to cover your back if you make the wrong choice.</p><p>Giving to both charities reduces the risk of you doing no good. But, because you subjectively think that THL is slightly better than Faunalytics, it also reduces the amount of good you will actually do in expectation. If you think THL is the best, then why give to anything else? Giving to both means trading away expected good done to get more certainty that you yourself will have done some good. It\u2019s putting your own satisfaction ahead of the expected good of the world. Don\u2019t be that person.</p><p>At this point you might push back and say that I haven\u2019t convincingly shown that there\u2019s anything wrong with being risk averse in this way. That is, risk averse with respect to the amount of good a particular individual does. Fair enough, so let me try something a bit more formal.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/on-the-desire-to-make-a-difference-hilary-greaves-william-macaskill-andreas-mogensen-and-teruji-thomas-global-priorities-institute-university-of-oxford/\">recent academic paper</a> by Hilary Greaves, William MacAskill, Andreas Mogenson and Teruji Thomas explores the tension between \u201cdifference-making risk aversion\u201d and benevolence. Consider the below.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:1000px\"><strong>Outcome goodness</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">Heads</td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">Tails</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:1000px\">Do nothing</td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">10</td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">0</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:1000px\">Give to Charity A</td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">20</td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">10</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:1000px\">Give to Charity B</td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">10+x</td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">20+x</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>A fair coin is to be flipped which determines the payoffs if we do nothing, give to Charity A, or give to Charity B. The coin essentially represents our current uncertainty.</p><p>We do have a hunch that giving to Charity B is better. Charity B differs from Charity A in that, instead of a \u00bd probability of getting 20, Charity B involves a \u00bd probability of getting 20+x, and instead of a \u00bd probability of getting 10, Charity B involves a \u00bd probability of getting 10+x. Given this, <strong>it\u2019s clearly better to give to Charity B.</strong> In technical language we say that giving to Charity B stochastically dominates giving to Charity A.</p><p>Now instead of \u2018outcome goodness\u2019 let\u2019s consider the \u2018difference made\u2019 of giving to either charity, relative to doing nothing (this is just some simple subtraction using the table above).</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:1000px\"><strong>Difference made</strong></td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">Heads</td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">Tails</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:1000px\">Do nothing</td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">0</td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">0</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:1000px\">Give to Charity A</td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">10</td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">10</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:1000px\">Give to Charity B</td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">x</td><td style=\"text-align:center;width:1000px\">20+x</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>A key thing to notice is that an individual with \u2018difference-making risk aversion\u2019 might prefer to give to Charity A. Giving to Charity A means you will do 10 units of good for sure. But if x is small, giving to Charity B would mean doing little good if the coin lands heads. A risk averse individual will have a tendency to want to avoid this bad outcome.</p><p>So being risk averse in this case might mean wanting to give to Charity A. But we already concluded above that giving to Charity A is silly, because giving to Charity B stochastically dominates giving to Charity A!</p><p>What we see here is that \u2018difference-making risk aversion\u2019 can lead one to go astray. In one\u2019s effort to avoid doing little good, one makes a very poor decision under uncertainty. The key takeaway is that we shouldn\u2019t respect our \u2018difference-making risk aversion\u2019. If we truly care about ensuring the most good is done, we should avoid tendencies to diversify whether it be across charities or cause areas.</p><p>To you reader I say this.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671715706/mirroredImages/TnsJdJ9HpMaLcS7qn/ihe9ro3npvjxmm6qmn7p.jpg\"></figure>", "user": {"username": "jackmalde"}}, {"_id": "2S3CHPwaJBE5h8umW", "title": "Read The Sequences", "postedAt": "2022-12-23T11:54:14.947Z", "htmlBody": "<p>There is heavy overlap among the effective altruism and rationality communities but they are not the same thing.

Sometimes, the participants in this fellowship would have criticisms or questions that I hadn't thought of. Even so, my mind would quickly come up with a convincing-sounding response and I would feel very rational. That's rationalisation. This also happens when I'm alone, in the privacy of my own mind: the urge to find a convincing argument against something I don't want to believe and quickly move on, and the urge to put a lot of effort into gathering evidence for something I want to believe. Scary! But I notice it more now.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/Cached-Thoughts\"><u>Cached Thoughts</u></a> was useful for recognising when I am simply accepting and repeating ideas without actually evaluating or understanding them.

However, when the contract was tweaked so that some of the payment was made upfront, the financial rewards program became a very cost-effective way to reduce burning, <strong>saving a life for &lt;$5000.</strong> [author's emphasis]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I recommend reading her full summary, but here is a self-contained overview. The study took place in Punjab, India, where crop burning is an especially harmful practice. A breathtaking 10 out of the 11 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most-polluted_cities_by_particulate_matter_concentration\">most polluted cities</a> <em>in the world</em> are in northern India, and much of their pollution comes from crop burning from Punjab and other northern states.</p>\n<p>The study intervention is a form of <em>payment for ecosystem services</em> (PES) contract. PES contracts have been used and evaluated for other environmental goals (e.g. reducing deforestation by paying landowners and community members for forest land preserved), but are quite new as an intervention to reduce crop burning. In this context, a <em>standard PES</em> contract is made with a farmer at the beginning of the growing season and pays them a certain amount ($12 per acre) at the end if they do not burn their crop residue. In contrast, an <em>upfront PES</em> contract pays some fraction of this (either 25% or 50%) as an explicitly unconditional transfer up front, and the remainder at the end if the farmer does not burn their crop residue. The authors randomized farmers into three experimental groups:<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-2\" id=\"fnref-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-2\">[2]</a></sup> a standard PES group, an upfront PES group, and a control group which got no contract.</p>\n<p>To measure the impact of these two contracts, the authors train a machine learning model on satellite images of fields to classify whether the field has been burnt. They use this model to detect crop burning in each group. They find that standard PES has no effect, while upfront PES makes a farmer 12 percentage points less likely to burn any field. For comparison, 90% of control farmers burnt a field and 78% of upfront PES farmers burnt a field, so the vast majority of farmers are still engaged in crop burning but the change is meaningful.</p>\n<p>The authors explore a few potential explanations for why paying some money upfront makes such a difference. They have no conclusive evidence for any story, but two explanations have some support in their data:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Cash constraints</strong> - 70% of farmers said that cash constraints were important in their decisions of how to manage crop residue, so it's plausible that paying people upfront allowed them to pursue more expensive ways of disposing of crop residue. However, this didn't differ by treatment group.</li>\n<li><strong>Trust</strong> - upfront PES farmers were 7 percentage points more likely to trust that they would get paid. However, the control mean was 85% of farmers trusting they would be paid, so this can't explain that much of the effect.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Finally, some farmers argue that crop burning is necessary to prevent delays to winter cropping. However, the authors detect no significant effect of each contract on either winter yields or winter crop times.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-3\" id=\"fnref-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-3\">[3]</a></sup> This is likely because farmers adopt other ways of removing crop residue; upfront PES farmers were more likely to buy a baler, which is used to remove residue from the field.</p>\n<h1>Cost-effectiveness</h1>\n<p>One unique feature of this paper is that it explicitly considers the cost-effectiveness of its proposed intervention, with a simple approach:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The authors use the treatment effect of upfront PES, and the cost of farmer payments, to calculate the cost per reduced acre of burning as being $37 per acre with the upfront PES contracts.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-4\" id=\"fnref-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-4\">[4]</a></sup></li>\n<li>They assume 50% of rice acreage in three Indian states (Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh) is burned, based on <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590162120300319\">this paper</a>, translating to 8.8 million acres of burning.</li>\n<li>They take the Global Burden of Disease estimate that crop burning caused 66,000 premature deaths in India in 2015, and thus each acre of burning averted reduces death by <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"66000/8800000 = 0.0075\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em;

For comparison, GiveWell calculates that the Against Malaria Foundation saves a life for <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tytvmV_32H8XGGRJlUzRDTKTHrdevPIYmb_uc6aLeas\">$3,800 to $8,500</a> across countries.

The <em>mortality</em> burden of air pollution is <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20180279\">largely experienced</a> by elderly people. One way to solve this issue is with the DALY framework (disability-adjusted life years, which count the years of life lost to both death and disability). This post previously included a cost-effectiveness analysis based on the DALY framework, but I've removed it.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-6\" id=\"fnref-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-6\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Furthermore, two other caveats would increase the cost per life saved:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The authors have two methods of estimating reduced crop burning from satellite data<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-7\" id=\"fnref-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-7\">[7]</a></sup> and the estimate of $37 per acre comes from their preferred method. The other method gives a smaller effect and a 1.5x higher cost per acre burned, i.e. $55 per acre of reduced burning. This adjustment increases the cost per life saved to $7,333 using the authors' specification or $2,260 by my specification.</li>\n<li>This cost-effectiveness calculation only uses the cost of payments as an input, rather than any other costs of delivery (e.g. surveyors to verify non-burning, fees associated with writing and enforcing contracts). The authors do not report the costs of delivery which would definitely raise the cost per life saved.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-8\" id=\"fnref-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-8\">[8]</a></sup></li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Climate co-benefits</h1>\n<p>While air pollution is likely the biggest source of harms from crop burning, crop burning also has a clear carbon footprint that the upfront PES contract helps reduce. <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenrg.2020.614212/full\">One study</a> estimates that crop burning in India is responsible for 9.1 million tons of CO2-equivalent GHGs<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-9\" id=\"fnref-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-9\">[9]</a></sup> annually. With 8.8 millions of acres burned, this means each acre unburned was responsible for 1.034 tons of GHGs averted. At a cost of $37 per unburned acre, <strong>upfront PES contracts offset 1 ton of GHGs for $36.</strong> This is a lower cost than all reasonable estimates of the social cost of carbon (the damage to society from 1 additional ton of GHGs). Thus, <strong>even if we ignore the air pollution benefits, the social benefits from PES contracts likely exceed their costs.</strong></p>\n<p>However, they are not the cheapest way to offset GHGs, and this estimate is still within an order of magnitude of reasonable social cost of carbon estimates, so it's <em>possible</em> that the pure climate benefits are less than the intervention's costs. As a result, the climate motivation for PES contracts on crop burning is weaker than the air pollution motivation.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, even with these caveats, the climate impacts are a clear co-benefit; they might not be enough to make PES contracts for crop burning a cost-effective intervention, but they make PES contracts look even better than the already-impressive picture from air pollution benefits.</p>\n<p><em>Warning: wild speculation.</em> These co-benefits could provide an appealing on-ramp for organizations to use the huge pool of carbon offset money to fund PES contracts for crop burning. Carbon offsets have faced <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/27/20994118/carbon-offset-climate-change-net-zero-neutral-emissions\">serious scrutiny</a> about their impact. If there is a lot of \"dumb money\" that organizations want to move towards more effective solutions, then PES contracts for crop burning could offer one such solution.</p>\n<h1>How would this scale?</h1>\n<p>Programs that work in an RCT need not succeed when scaled up by a government or charity. The policy implications of this study depend on how well its results would scale. The study can't answer this scaling question, but my best guess is that <strong>scaling would <em>increase</em> the efficacy of upfront PES</strong>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Legal enforcement capacity</strong>: currently, crop burning is illegal, but this ban is unenforceable because of how widespread the practice is. However, if PES contracts were scaled up and more farmers adopted them, it would become much more feasible to punish farmers who do burn crops. This in turn increases the deterrent effects of the ban, creating a virtuous cycle that reduces crop burning.</li>\n<li><strong>Demonstration of feasible alternatives</strong>: farmers are <a href=\"https://scroll.in/article/1035740/why-punjabs-farmers-have-rejected-solutions-to-curb-stubble-burning\">aware</a> of the harms of crop burning, but do it because they see no other way to preserve their winter crop. However, the study results suggest that some upfront PES farmers adopted alternative crop residue management methods without reducing winter crop yields. This implies farmers could learn more about these methods from implementing PES at scale, and that learning could reduce their crop burning organically.</li>\n<li><strong>Increased trust</strong>: the authors have suggestive evidence that an important failure mode for standard PES contracts is that farmers don't trust they will actually get paid at the end of the contract period. This is a natural concern for a new policy, but if an organization built an established reputation for abiding by its contracts, that could make farmers trust them more and thus be more willing to enter and stick to PES contracts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However, one countervailing force reduces the likely cost-effectiveness of this policy at scale: <strong>the study districts were selected to have more crop burning than average</strong>. The study districts were chosen explicitly for their high rates of crop burning and low rates of alternative crop residue management methods. Thus, implementing PES contracts beyond their 300 study villages might have smaller effects if crop burning is less of a problem elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I don't think this selection issue is critical. Millions of acres of farmland are burned each year, and the farmers in this study collectively own a measly 8,000 acres. I think a PES program would have to be huge before it reached a scale that would seriously diminish the study's effects.</p>\n<h1>What do we do with this?</h1>\n<p>Let's say you accept this study's results for now. What can we do with this information?</p>\n<p>The first takeaway is that <strong>PES is uniquely feasible for nonprofits to implement</strong> since it involves no regulation but rather a voluntary contract. Compare this to air pollution interventions that are only implementable by governments, e.g. vehicular efficiency standards - a nonprofit can only make progress by lobbying the government to enact standards, and success in that lobbying is uncertain. Thus, PES contracts are not just an academic proposal but a feasible and shovel-ready intervention that charities could scale up.</p>\n<p>Second, <strong>we should do more groundwork to test this study's results</strong>. We shouldn't make important policy or allocate large sums of money based one study. Results can be p-hacked, false positives by random chance, fail to generalize to other places, or suffer from scaling issues. But the enormous cost-effectiveness of this intervention from a shallow investigation makes it a strong candidate for further research. Some very useful research to follow up on this would be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pure replication.</strong> This would not be in any researcher's incentives, but any organization that might consider implementing upfront PES as an intervention should do a pure replication of this study in their context. A neat feature of this study is that its measurement strategy uses commercially available satellite data, rather than confidential administrative data of any kind, so it can actually be replicated in any new context.</li>\n<li><strong>A replication with more power to detect mechanisms.</strong> The study sample is too small to really dig into <em>why</em> upfront PES works so much better than standard PES, or why standard PES fails. A larger study could show more heterogeneous treatment effects: for example, if farmers with more assets were less responsive to upfront PES than farmers with fewer assets, we could conclude that upfront PES helps by alleviating cash constraints for farmers to invest in non-burning approaches. The authors are unable to detect such an effect, but we can't say if that's because it doesn't exist or because of sample size issues.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Moreover, the climate co-benefits of PES contracts to reduce crop burning are a clear source of additional value. They make the case for PES contracts more robust to multiple priorities or value judgments. I also think they can provide a useful platform to access the large pool of carbon offset money: for climate-oriented funders, PES contracts for crop burning could be a generally effective way to reduce emissions while offering fantastic health co-benefits. From a practical perspective, this is quite important to keep in mind for funding sources if PES contracts for crop burning are found to be worth scaling up.</p>\n<p>In short, PES contracts are an exciting and shovel-ready intervention to reduce air pollution, an area with few demonstrably cost-effective interventions for charities to implement. At first glance, upfront PES contracts for crop burning beat GiveWell's top charities in their cost to save a life. I'm sure that upon further scrutiny, they will lose some of that luster, but they merit a lot of attention. We should fund more research into upfront PES, and a real charity should pilot it, so that we can test one of the most promising air pollution interventions yet.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Oliver Kim and Tejas Subramaniam for helpful feedback.</em></p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Crop burning is most commonly associated with India, and this paper studies crop burning in India, but it is also a serious problem in <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/53856e1ee4b00c6f1fc1f602/t/5b16a07a2b6a28229d7b06e7/1528209534403/Oanh+Crop+residues+AE+18.pdf\">southeast Asia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6068580/\">China</a> and <a href=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/996cfaf0-2fe8-56c1-b56b-b76b49571f32\">Africa</a>. <a href=\"#fnref-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The study actually split the groups further.

If it costs $37 to save 0.017 DALYs, then the cost per DALY saved is $2,200 and the cost for a full life saved (70 DALYs) is $153,000.

This 100x error led me to conclude that a full life could be saved for $1,500 rather than $153,000. This estimate has the advantage of incorporating years of life saved, but it suffers from lack of comparability to other charities. As I investigated further, I discovered that GiveWell used to report cost-effectiveness in terms of DALYs, but stopped because of their lack of confidence in DALY estimates. Thus, I've removed it from the main text and left only the caveat that deaths averted may not reflect the moral value of air pollution interventions. <a href=\"#fnref-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-6\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-7\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The authors detect crop burning by training a random forest model on satellite images of fields. One approach is to equalize the false positive and false negative classifications by the model (<em>balanced accuracy</em>) and the other is to minimize false classifications overall (<em>max accuracy</em>).

This reduces the estimated effect of the PES contract (which is the treatment burning minus the control burning) and thus reduces the cost-effectiveness of the PES contract. The authors prefer to use balanced accuracy, which they argue has only a small loss in accuracy. <a href=\"#fnref-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-7\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-yXxoAKWRqoGRmHyrc-8\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>One threat to cost-effectiveness that I am <em>not</em> concerned about is the sensitivity to agricultural impacts.

The biggest costs are (in rough order): catering, travel grants, venue, organiser salaries, merch. Catering estimates are often given 1-2 months before the event (e.g. we will have 600-700 attendees for X meals), rough food orders are often placed a month before, and final catering numbers are usually due a week before the conference. This is tight timing with when admissions and registration close (which we try to keep open as late as possible to let the most number of people apply and attend, usually about a week - 10 days before the event).&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>For EAGxBerkeley, applications closed on November 21st. Registration formally closed on the 25th, and the conference started just 5 days later on December 1st. Our catering numbers of 600 were planned a month in advance and solidified at 630 a week before the conference due to a flurry of additional applications we we're extremely excited about. About 500-550 people attended the conference. We planned on 630.</p><p><strong>We spent about $35,000 (</strong>lower bound) <strong>on meals for no-shows.</strong> We spent roughly $350-$500 per person on catering for EAGxBerkeley. The full estimates are about 100 extra meals at $67-$100 a meal x 5 meals = $33,500 - $50,000.<strong> </strong>EAGxBerkeley provided less meals than typical (5 instead of 8). With 8 meals, snacks, and drinks (which we didn't provide) that's roughly $60,000 - $100,000<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflideojvej8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlideojvej8\">[2]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The same situation happened at<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aU9v3KFKKpu-81LOeEkV24oPQs8SUDpN/edit#\">&nbsp;<u>EAGxBoston</u></a>, which accepted 100 late applications in the week leading up to the conference. The team didn't know \"the final number of attendees for the event until a few days before the event \u2026 vendors who needed quantities (such as catering, merchandise, security) were given rough estimates which had to be overestimations, further raising costs.\".</p><h3>It impacts the applicants who would be good fits and can come.&nbsp;</h3><p>When events get to capacity and there's still applications left to review - which often happens for EAGx\u2019s - organisers have two decisions: either increase event costs (which happened at EAGxBoston) or reject people (which happened at EAGxBerkeley). Letting in late applicants is often not logistically feasible.&nbsp;</p><p>When we run out of capacity, it\u2019s often first time applicants (new EA\u2019s or people exploring EA) who get rejected. This is because as we have fewer spots available, the bar (of what qualifies you to get in) for admissions often increases and many first time applicants apply close to the deadline (presumably because they are unsure about attending and the application can be overwhelming).&nbsp;</p><p>This is a separate post about why you should apply early to conferences, how you're more likely to get in, but most people apply the night before applications are due. It's not just 1 person, or 10 - it's a good number of applicants.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>This is the application trend for EAGxBerkeley.&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671947834/mirroredImages/CwKwwxRpNWmG2jgPT/zgt0axemtam5r4nizatz.png\"><figcaption>It looks confusing - but that 97 was for Nov 21st.</figcaption></figure><p>On Nov 21st (when applications closed), we had about 100 spots for 150-200 applicants at EAGxBerkeley. About 70 - 100 people who registered, didn't show up (most didn't communicate either).&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i>Those spots could have gone to someone who we wanted to admit, but didn't have the capacity to.&nbsp;</p><h3>It impacts the conference itself</h3><p>We try to plan for a certain ratio of new EA: highly engaged EA, make sure there's diversity and representation and more. Because EAGx's are often younger EAs, geared towards students, and career advising focused - not having enough to balance that does impact the value attendees get out of the conference.&nbsp;</p><h3>It causes organisers time and stress.&nbsp;</h3><p>We spend a lot of time organising the event. There's venue, catering, legal, admissions, marketing, merch, stewardship, communications, volunteer management, AV, production, and more. Most EAGx\u2019s have a team of about 5-10 people, including contractors and CEA support. We put months of planning into this event. We read through all your applications. Much like community builders - organisers control a key entry way to further involvement in EA. That comes with a burden of having to reject people. When we want to admit someone but can\u2019t because we\u2019re at capacity is when it\u2019s hardest.&nbsp;</p><p>The EAGxBoston team estimated an extra 100 applications in the week leading up to the event (the busiest time for organisers) cost them 0.5-1 FTE. The counterargument is to say that organisers shouldn\u2019t have accepted late applications, but that\u2019s not always easy (as we elaborate on below).&nbsp;</p><p>These things add strain and overload to organisers, some of which we discuss in a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rMucQN9EkL8u4xnjd/improving-ea-events-start-early-and-invest-in-content-and\">previous post </a>and will discuss in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/pdPaG5eE3GZe4c4kD\">future posts</a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>It sets an unfair culture and norms &nbsp;</h3><p>I was upset to see many engaged EA's in the Bay ask last minute if they could attend EAGxBerkeley. I think that's unfair to the people we rejected, to attendees who applied on time, and to the organiser. At the same time, it was hard to say no knowing we had the capacity from people not showing up, but I couldn't admit them knowing we rejected other people prior&nbsp; because we were at capacity. This also happened at EAGxSingapore and Boston. The<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aU9v3KFKKpu-81LOeEkV24oPQs8SUDpN/edit#\">&nbsp;<u>EAGxBoston team\u2019s reflection</u></a> on this sums it up best:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Even with the application being open for ~3 months, the deadline being clearly stated in multiple places, and numerous emails sent to [partial complete applications or previous attendees] \u2026 we still received ~100 applications <strong>after</strong> it had closed<strong>.</strong> It is worth noting that the majority of these applications were not from first-time attendees or intro-level EAs.&nbsp;</p><p>...</p><p>This follows a trend in the community where a small subset of regular EA conference attendees has been allowed to get away with applying after the deadline and still been accepted. As a result, there is now an&nbsp;<i>expectation</i> that if you apply after the deadline, or email the organisers (especially if you have a personal connection with them) asking to register when registration is closed, that your request will be granted. We should be striving to be better than this as a community.</p></blockquote><h3>Rejecting people hurts.</h3><p>When we reject based on capacity, it hurts (or at least it hurts me). And I wish we had space for everyone excited about coming, but we just often don\u2019t. Attending an EAG was the most valuable thing for getting me further involved in EA. It\u2019s why I\u2019m doing what I\u2019m doing - including why I organised an EAGx. To deny someone excited about EA the opportunity for what can be a life-changing experience because of conference capacity and then to end up having capacity because of no-shows hurts. Don\u2019t do it.</p><h2><strong>How to update: proposed applicant norms for EAGx applications&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>If you're unsure if you can make it, but want to apply in case you can, here's what we suggest<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefti3v9tvcqya\"><sup><a href=\"#fnti3v9tvcqya\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(especially if you're a more engaged EA and planning helping others): &nbsp;</p><ol><li>Fill out the application properly - not every event organiser knows who you are.

Origin, First Pictures and Data of Imminent, Invisible Water Crises Emerging as the World\u2019s Groundwater \u201cSavings Account\u201d is Drained</p><h2><strong>Abstract</strong></h2><p><strong>(copied from the linked paper)</strong></p><p>Over the last 70 years, the world expanded the source of<br>agricultural, manufacturing, and domestic water from a reliance on surface water (rainfall, rivers,<br>lakes) to routinely include groundwater from rechargeable aquifers (the \u201csavings<br>account\u201d) and fossil water aquifers (a \u201cone time inheritance\u201d) for the dominant<br>share of its grain production, a large percentage of total crop production and over<br>half of its drinking water. Tapping these supplies provided food security during<br>dry years, multiplied agricultural yields during normal or wet years, and provided<br>the foundation for supporting the rise of population from 2B to 7B. We are now<br>dependent on routine use of resources that date from decades to millions of<br>years back. Although there are exceptions, such as the United States Geological<br>Survey\u2019s (USGS) tracking of groundwater depletion in the US, the world at large<br>has been using this resource without measuring consumption rates or how<br>much is left. Globally, we have been withdrawing from a bank account without<br>knowing how much we are pulling out or if the account is almost empty.</p><p><br>For the first time, we know. The picture is surprising and not good. Recently,<br>NASA has released images, analysis and multi-year comparison studies from the<br>GRACE satellites that give the first pictures of the state of groundwater usage<br>and groundwater reserves by measuring changes in gravity. The findings show<br>imminent and developing water crises across the world\u2019s major agricultural areas<br>and population centers due to over withdrawal of groundwater. To put this in<br>perspective, outside of the shrinking of the polar ice caps and glaciers, the<br>biggest single point of contribution to rising ocean levels came from groundwater<br>pumping around New Delhi, India. To put it in the context of how big a surprise<br>the data delivers, the water loss from New Delhi turned out to be 70% larger than<br>the Indian estimates had predicted. The satellite data offers a global, quantified,<br>objective view of the invisible, irreversible overspending of a huge percentage<br>world\u2019s storehouse of water.</p><p><br>News reports from Syria and Iraq about population flight from villages as<br>irrigation wells go dry cease to be isolated data points when placed in the big<br>picture context of the satellite data. The GRACE satellite system makes visible<br>the exhaustion of groundwater in one key region after another, beginning with<br>Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and the rest of the Middle East within the next few<br>years. India, China and the US will follow later.</p><p><br>Analyses of the data ascribe the cause of the depletions to \u201cdecades of bad<br>management and overuse,\u201d which continue unchanged. Even if global<br>conservation methods and plentiful rainfall patterns were to begin tomorrow,<br>crises would be marginally postponed; scarce rainfall or drought will accelerate<br>them. The numbers and trends have mass and momentum: they show that we<br>have been supporting a global population through living beyond our water bank<br>account. The published scientific papers use words such as \u201calarming.\u201d</p><p><br>Update 2022: The groundwater depletion described above has continued and<br>increased. The prediction of imminent trouble deriving from groundwater<br>depletion promptly came true. The news reports of Syrian farmers abandoning<br>their farms and Yemen\u2019s Houthi fleeing as their wells ran dry led first to civil wars<br>in their respective countries, and then to humanitarian disasters, refugee flight<br>and international wars involving ISIS versus the US in Syria, and Iran versus<br>Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in Yemen.</p><p><br>During our 2014 meeting with Secretary Shultz and Secretary Mattis, we made<br>the comment that NASA publishes maps that show you where the next wars will<br>be. This has statement has been borne out. The US Department of State is<br>now interested in deploying water technologies into these water crisis points to<br>stop the next wars.</p><p><br>A range of other consequences of groundwater depletion also occurred. For<br>example, the flight of over 1 million refugees from Africa who crossed the<br>Mediterranean into Europe was also initiated by groundwater depletion.<br>In 2022, the United States is now also deep within the crisis, although most of the<br>populations appears unaware of the problem. Although people who have direct<br>contact with water issues, e.g., farmers forced to fallow half their acreage through<br>lack of water are well aware of the situation, the vast US population remains<br>either unaware or \u2013 as described in an article in The Atlantic - in denial. &nbsp;An Aug.<br>25, 2022 interview with James Famiglietti, who led the GRACE data analysis<br>summarized the situation: \u201cThe Colorado River crisis is urgent, Famiglietti said,<br>but the hidden, underground water crisis is even worse.

It starts a discussion on how to bring the ideas of EA into the classroom.</p>\n<p>I first tell something about myself and how I came to these ideas, secondly I lay out my thinking about the ethics of talking about ideas (like EA) with children, whereupon write about the main question of this thread.</p>\n<p>My background: I am a primary school children at a school for gifted children in the Netherlands. I dare to say I am exelent at my job, as managing my class, conveying the curriculum and doing the necessary teacher-tasks feel not as difficult to me. I have time left to experiment in my class with all kinds of educational ideas.\nFurthermore, I am doing a thesis on teaching children to appreciate the school curriculum.\nSince I encountered EA, doubts of continuing my profession arised. The main EA thought on teaching [<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/teaching/\">https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/teaching/</a>] is that it's not neglected and the influence a teacher can have is limited as you are only able to influence a limeted amount of others. On the other hand, I am good at my job and I am teaching a special target group of gifted children. I think we could also debate if there are no big issues in our education system witch I could tackle as a teacher, but I leave that to another discussion thread.\nWhilst doubting a carreer change, I am working at the moment as a teacher, and will so for at least another year. For this period I ask myself, what can I do now with the ideas of EA in my profession? Specifically on conveying the EA ideas onto my students and collegues.</p>\n<p>Ethical considiration: Firstly, is it ethical to convey EA ideas to my students and collegues?Should education be allowed to convey certain political or philosophical ideas? Should it not be independent? Shouldn't only parents be allowed to influence their childrens ideas?\nIn my opinion I am allowed to influence my students philosophically and politically, mainly because 1. all ecucation is imminently influencing children, 2. because I think students should be influence by a variety of people and 3. because the development of learning to think about different ideas is dependent on coming across these ideas and being supported to think about them.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>All education is based upon choices. Choices of subjects that are taught, choices of content matter within these subject and teaching styles of teachers which are heavily influenced by culture. So we have to think about these choices and continuously improve them, but we cannot say we can't influence children if we want so.</li>\n<li>I think every situation a child is in, it giving children new ideas, bad ones and good ones. Meeting many different ideas and teaching the child to think about these ideas is therefore the only option. Some people will share valueable ideas and help children think, and some will hinder a child's development, this is innevitable. The good (which is almost impossible to define) will compensate for the bad. This all makes it that I believe students should be inspired by the ideas of educators, parents and others, letting meet a variety of voices.</li>\n<li>Of course there is a line: Educators should not force their ideas onto children. We should leave space for discussion, criticism and thought. Thereupon, we should be more careful sharing our ideas with children as they have not yet the abilities and knowledge to be critical and think about the arguments, therefore we should support their thinking. But this is not an argument against talk about our ideas with children, it is actually the oposit, as talking twith them about different ideas develops their ability to think.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Main question:  How can we get the EA ideas into education? To think about this, I am thinking to create a system/framework to catagorize various approaches. It starts of with the smallest steps I think you can take to do this going up to the most radical changes. I am very curious about ideas from the community so I can add these to this framework. (And yes, the love of frameworks has also arised from EA. My love to William MacAskill).</p>\n<p>0.Conveying EA ideas unintentional\nA. Speech: Being involved with EA changes your thinking and your speech therefore it automatically conveys EA ideas to your students and collegues.\nLanguage matters! Educators know this, the way we say things, the order in which we say things and the words we use can completely change all situations (this is of course not only the case for education). To even go further, the way we word things show the solutions we think of. For example, stating we have a climate problem or stating that we have to find solution to live climate-neutral, pave paths for two very different lines of thinking about the same problem. In this way actually, starting whith speech might not be the smallest step, but is an easy step as changing your speach is something which can be done without effort and inmediately.\nSo, by only knowing about EA your thoughts change, and with it your speech as well. So being involved with EA will automatically alter your education and it will influence the way you speak with your collegues. For example, I was teaching arithmetic's and suddenly the word 'effective' came out of my mouth. Then I eleborated what the word effective meant, giving examples, concluding that you could use various methods in arithmetic's but is the best to find the most effective method for each situation. I was aware that this was a result of EA 'indoctrination' on me from the past year. So, your thougts and words will change and you will convey this to some extent to your students.\nOther EA related ideas, like the critical thinking skills learned at universities will have similar effects.</p>\n<p>1.Conveying EA ideas intentional on a small scale without requiring much effort\nA.Deliberate change of speech\nSomething I now want to experiment with, since I started thinking about this topic (this originated when I talked with another educator on EAGxRotterdam), is deliberatly using EA semantics, EA-language while educating my students, during all primarys school subjects. In this way, I convey the EA-philosophy through just being with my students and collegues.</p>\n<p>2.EA-Projects in education\nA. Donating to charity\nSince I have come across the ideas of EA I started donating 10% of my income every year to charity. As a teacher, I thought it would be a valuable learning experience for my students to let them choose to which charity I donated my salary.\nLast year, my group 8 (children aged 11-12 years old) researched charities based upon different sites. They got some instruction and inspiration about EA from me. After this all they had a group discussion, upon which they decided which charity to donate to (a tree planting charity).\nThis year I taught group 6 (children aged 9-10 yearsold). I gave instruction about charities and the importance of effective charities. Then I let them do research on the site <a href=\"http://doneereffectief.nl\">doneereffectief.nl</a> (the Dutch site of EA for donating), upon which they had a group discussion deciding to donate to the climate fund.\nI am still experimenting with this, as I try to find out how I can raise my students awareness as much as possible. I decided to give my students less freedom this year as they are younger and because I think it was better to give them good sources (<a href=\"http://doneereffectief.nl\">doneereffectief.nl</a>) as supposed to also having to teach them about good sources of information, as this would derive the main focuses of learning about what a good charity is and what the current world problems are (following to EA).</p>\n<p>3.Creating an EA-Curriculum\nA. I am in the process of writing an educational module for another project. The idea in the back of my mind is there to write a similar EA module.</p>\n<p>4.Even bigger??</p>\n", "user": {"username": "TimSpreeuwers"}}]
