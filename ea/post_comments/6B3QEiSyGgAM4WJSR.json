There is a mutualistic relationship with the honeybee hives &nbsp;that produce honey and pollinate well, hence their levels are rising during generally declining &nbsp;numbers of other bees. Similarly, we have traded with the genomes of domestic animals, increasing their number, even if the individuals that hold the genes have a worse life because of this trade. There are several stages and timescales to these interactions. The bees trade labor for nectar with the flowers, but the flowers can only establish the deal over evolutionary timescales and rely on bees to have agency in a given lifetime. Similarly we trade our labor and syrup for the bee's honey, but their only alternative is to swarm off/attack and probably the hive will. In my view an exploitative exchange is still a trade.</p>", "parentCommentId": "GaGcjtSXRtDFMtpSu", "user": {"username": "Robin"}}]
