Prospective attendees who are employed usually need to submit an application for leave with 1+ months notice, especially for a trip of ~1 week or longer needed for international travel. Shorter notice can create conflict or ill-feeling between the employee and employer.</li><li><i><u>Flight prices increase as the travel date approaches</u></i>. An Australian report <a href=\"https://www.expedia.com.au/stories/2023-flight-hacks/\">recommended</a> booking international flights 6 months ahead of the date of travel. A Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/travel/how-to-find-the-best-deal-on-your-next-flight/\">report</a> recommended booking international travel (US&lt;&gt;Europe) at least 50-180 days [~2-6 months] ahead of the date of travel. By 30 days out - when my colleagues received notice of acceptance - flights were much more expensive, and some of the most convenient travel dates were unavailable.</li><li><i><u>Fit with other commitments and needs</u></i>. For parents, people with caring responsibilities, or people with disabilities, a slow process can lead to stress and conflict about whether to accept the invitation and how to make arrangements to support attendance at short notice.</li><li><i><u>Visa issues</u></i>. Visa applications can take weeks or months to approve by the destination country.</li></ol><p>Providing travel grant funding can help to \"smooth over\" some of these issues, e.g., by subsidising the increase in flight costs, offsetting the (literal or emotional) costs of navigating / negotiating commitments and needs. It is not a panacea - the application process itself also needs to be reviewed to reduce these issues. If the travel grant funding is significantly reduced but no change is made to the application process, there may be an unintended consequence of fewer international attendees who would otherwise be a good fit for events.</p><p>I support a review of travel grant funding processes.

I don't get why the policy shouldn't be \"always accept people if they are above a certain bar\". Perhaps the bar should change, but it feels to me like the obvious way of deciding who to accept should be something like \"for everyone who wants to attend, estimate how much value it would produce for them to attend, and estimate how costly it would be, and then accept everyone where value exceeds benefits\". It sounds like you're suggesting doing something else--what other policy are you suggesting following?</p></blockquote><p>It sounds like previously the policy was that they have some threshold they had thought of in advance of setting up the conferences - let's say everyone above this threshold is a Qualified Effective Altruist, and their policy is to open the applications for every event and make all the conferences big enough to admit every QEA who applies. But now there is less funding and more QEAs, so individual conferences may have to have higher bars for entry, and they might not admit you even if they think you're qualified according to the previous standard.</p>", "parentCommentId": "opvYftHFvC7LF8ecK", "user": {"username": "robirahman"}}, {"_id": "wkyQJtnAyNLbjH9AF", "postedAt": "2023-08-03T11:30:13.675Z", "postId": "4JF39v548SETuMewp", "htmlBody": "<p>Is there a viable version of non-catering where the organizers promise nothing but also invite a bunch of food trucks to camp by the venue?
