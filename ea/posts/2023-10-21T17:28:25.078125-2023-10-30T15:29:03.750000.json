There is no appreciable difference in the results.&nbsp;</li><li>I also updated the presentation of the overall results across different risk aversion theories in Table 3. If a cause area\u2019s cost-effectiveness has a risk-weighted value above 1 unit per $1000 spent, then the value displayed in Table 3 is the base-10 logarithm of the risk-weighted cost-effectiveness. For example, a cause area whose cost-effectiveness is 100 risk-weighted units per $1000 spent has a score of 2.0. If a cause area\u2019s cost-effectiveness is less than -1 after risk aversion is incorporated, then the value displayed is the negative of the base-10 logarithm of the absolute value of the area\u2019s cost-effectiveness. Here, if a cause\u2019s risk-weighted value is -1000 per $1000 spent, then the score in Table 3 is -3. If a cause\u2019s risk-weighted value is between -1 and 1 per $1000 spent, then it\u2019s entered in Table 3 as ~0, or roughly zero.&nbsp;</li></ul><h1><br>Executive Summary</h1><h2>Motivation</h2><p>In a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/i5cuLZH3SQJigiHMs\"><u>recent post</u></a>, David Rhys Bernard puts forth several considerations that should give us pause in accepting the \u201cTime of Perils\u201d hypothesis, which holds that we live in a world where existential risk is high now due to AI and other threats, but will fall to near zero and allow us to have a long and valuable future if we survive this time of perils. Moreover, as Arvo Mu\u00f1oz Mor\u00e1n has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/S9H86osFKhfFBCday/how-bad-would-human-extinction-be\"><u>recently shown</u></a>, the value of existential risk reduction efforts diverges if we live in a time of perils versus an age with constant existential risk. If we take these great uncertainties about the \u201ctime of perils\u201d hypothesis and the long-run value of affecting existential risk seriously, what might it imply for our cause prioritization?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>One response would be to side-step these uncertainties about the far future and instead argue for existential risk\u2019s value on time horizons that are easier to forecast. For example, one argument for the idea that existential risk mitigation should be a top priority for governments and philanthropists (and especially effective altruists) alike could go as follows:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>You don\u2019t have to believe in sci-fi futures with digital minds, space colonization, or transformative AI for existential risk to be as much or more cost-effective than the top global health and animal welfare interventions. You don\u2019t even have to believe that our risk-reduction efforts will persist indefinitely or that people millions of years in the future matter as much as people in the present.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>All you have to believe is that the next few generations of people matter as much as we do, that existential risk is a threat to human civilization over their lifespans, and that we can do something to lower this risk. Under these assumptions, existential risk reduction is probably at least as cost-effective as a philanthropic intervention as our alternatives, if not more.</i></p></blockquote><p>Let us call this view the \u201ccommon-sense case for spending in existential risk reduction,\u201d or, for short, the \u201ccommon sense case.\u201d Specifically, let\u2019s define the common-sense case for investing in existential risk reduction as&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Assuming the average population and quality of life per person are similar to or slightly higher than current levels</li><li>Valuing people in the next 120 to 180 years (now through the end of our grandchildren\u2019s to possibly our great-great-grandchildren\u2019s lives)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefewwnobvffe8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnewwnobvffe8\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;equally</li><li>Assigning no value to non-human animals at any point in time or to humans beyond this time period in terms of estimating the value of existential risk prevention.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Previous researchers have investigated and debated whether existential risk mitigation is cost-effective when considering just the present generation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzdg29lcjrln\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzdg29lcjrln\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;These prior estimates, while useful, typically only estimate the expected value of existential risk mitigation work. However, part of the motivation for the common-sense case for existential risk mitigation work is to assess the cause area\u2019s robustness under reasonable disagreement. There are different topics we can reasonably disagree about. For one, we might disagree about who matters; the common-sense case, in valuing the next few generations only, is conservative in this regard. Moreover, there is disagreement about the cost-effectiveness of and potential for downside risks in existential risk mitigation work. Relatedly, there is disagreement about how to approach this uncertainty and whether to incorporate risk aversion. Some people may have reservations about going all-in on interventions that are expected value-positive yet risky. In this report, I build upon the prior work that\u2019s been done on the near-term value of existential risk reduction by putting particular emphasis on the latter two topics of disagreement: empirical uncertainty and risk attitudes. In doing so, I assess how each of these affects the relative value of existential risk mitigation compared to other causes.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Simply put, under the common-sense case, you shouldn\u2019t have to rely on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/i5cuLZH3SQJigiHMs\"><u>time of perils hypothesis</u></a> being likely, on existential risk reduction to be certainly good, or willingness to go in on low-probability, high-EV bets for existential risk reduction to be a good spending opportunity. If existential risk interventions are competitive with or better than a global health or animal intervention under conservative assumptions, then the case for spending on it will be greatly strengthened.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Is the common-sense case enough for existential risk mitigation to be decisively more cost-effective than global health and/or animal welfare interventions in risk-neutral expectation? If so, under what empirical and moral weight assumptions? And, if we\u2019re open to decision-theoretic alternatives to risk-neutral expected value maximization, how (if at all) do these conclusions change when we incorporate risk aversion?<br>&nbsp;</p><p>In addressing these broad themes, some more specific questions we might be interested in are:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>How much do we have to lower existential risk, in expectation, to reach cost-competitiveness with various global health and animal interventions?&nbsp;</li><li>How do changes in how we value non-human animals affect our conclusions?&nbsp;</li><li>If we\u2019re risk-averse with respect to our money making a difference or avoiding the worst states of the world, how does our assessment of the relative value of the cause areas change?</li></ul><p>In this report, I address these questions using the following steps:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>I first describe a range of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9nAm6id_03atEX4HpaYNf7yPgc3GsVGsy_18Suu_lI/edit#heading=h.yxc4qlnsxpid\"><u>prior estimates</u></a> of the tractability of existential risk mitigation to get a sense of what expected cost-effectiveness estimates are typically considered \u201cplausible\u201d within the effective altruist community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Then, I use a mathematical model that estimates the cost-effectiveness of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9nAm6id_03atEX4HpaYNf7yPgc3GsVGsy_18Suu_lI/edit#heading=h.oz2ucqn4ohw5\"><u>twelve \u201cscenarios\u201d</u></a> for existential risk projects that each have different distributions of impacts on existential risk and different degrees of plausibility.&nbsp;</li><li>Next, I&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9nAm6id_03atEX4HpaYNf7yPgc3GsVGsy_18Suu_lI/edit#heading=h.wzpf6gb3hhje\"><u>model</u></a> the cost-effectiveness of a low-risk global health intervention and three animal interventions for comparison.&nbsp;</li><li>Fourth, I&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9nAm6id_03atEX4HpaYNf7yPgc3GsVGsy_18Suu_lI/edit#heading=h.96lk0i885tn0\"><u>compare</u></a> the cost-effectiveness of each existential risk reduction scenario to these other causes under expected value maximization theory and with different types and levels of risk aversion.&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, I offer some key takeaways from and limitations of the risk aversion and cost-effectiveness models, and I offer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9nAm6id_03atEX4HpaYNf7yPgc3GsVGsy_18Suu_lI/edit#heading=h.tc7gpxclgk61\"><u>opportunities</u></a> for future research.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>In the following section, I give an overview of the example existential risk projects tested. Then, I describe the comparison interventions from animal welfare and global health cause areas I used. Finally, I give an overview of the results from evaluating the cost-effectiveness of each project compared to the animal and global health interventions considered under expected value maximization and risk-averse decision frameworks.&nbsp;</p><h2>Existential Risk Mitigation Scenarios</h2><p>There are twelve example interventions I use to evaluate how spending $100 million on existential risk mitigation fares under the common-sense case. The four variables I include in the analysis are:</p><ul><li>The probability of the intervention having a non-zero counterfactual impact on existential risk levels over the period of consideration (the next 120-180 years);&nbsp;</li><li>The probability that, given an intervention has an effect, the effect is to lower the probability of an existential catastrophe over the period of consideration;</li><li>If an intervention inadvertently raises existential risk, the relative size of that increase in risk compared to how much risk would have been reduced had the intervention succeeded; and</li><li>If an intervention succeeds, the number of basis points of cumulative risk reduced, normalized to per billion dollars spent (assuming no diminishing marginal returns)<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>I also build a model of the impact of averting non-existential catastrophes using the first three variables (and assuming a relative reduction in the risk of various sized non-existential catastrophes).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>The twelve examples, or \u201cscenarios,\u201d for how an existential risk reduction project that costs $100 million could turn out are included in Table 1 below. They are color-coded by how plausible I judge them to be based on the number of assumptions they make that are favorable to existential risk mitigation. For example, if the scenario assumes that a project has a 90% chance of having a counterfactual effect, this is counted as a favorable assumption that slightly decreases its plausibility.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefczl8vtzbu9d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnczl8vtzbu9d\">[3]</a></sup></span><br>&nbsp;</p><p>The dark green projects are labeled \u201cextremely plausible and conservative,\u201d the light green projects are labeled \u201cplausible but less conservative,\u201d the yellow projects are \u201cpossible yet not conservative,\u201d and the red projects are deemed \u201cimplausible.\u201d Bolding of the scenarios\u2019 names is used throughout to indicate which interventions had a high (45%) chance of raising existential risk conditional on the effect being non-zero. I describe each scenario and its classification further in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9nAm6id_03atEX4HpaYNf7yPgc3GsVGsy_18Suu_lI/edit#bookmark=kix.hyt28qf6m6zl\"><u>methodology section</u></a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>It\u2019s worth noting how implausible scenarios 10 through 12 are. They involve reducing very large amounts of existential risk that are outside the typical bounds of even the more optimistic projections by existential risk mitigation researchers (see this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9nAm6id_03atEX4HpaYNf7yPgc3GsVGsy_18Suu_lI/edit#heading=h.yxc4qlnsxpid\"><u>section</u></a> of the report). On top of that, scenarios 10 and 11 assume very high probabilities of success. I think it\u2019s very unlikely that an intervention we\u2019d find any time soon could have an 81% probability of reducing existential risk and reduce a substantial amount of the existential risk over the next few centuries for so little money.&nbsp;</p><p><br><i>Table 1: Parameter specifications for simulating the value of existential risk mitigation and the res.

included is donating to the Against Malaria Foundation to buy anti-malaria bet nets.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>The animal interventions include corporate cage-free campaigns and two shrimp welfare interventions. The first shrimp welfare intervention is one that introduces stunners to prevent suffering from harvest and slaughter in an ice slurry. The other is a (hypothetical) intervention that reduces the prevalence of harmful ammonia concentrations in shrimp farms.&nbsp;<br><br>I vary the moral weights of each animal species by using both welfare ranges based on Rethink Priorities\u2019 work as well as substantially more conservative ones. Doing so allows me to test how dependent the resulting relative cost-effectiveness of existential risk mitigation work under the \u201ccommon-sense case\u201d is on how much you value animals. Under the higher welfare ranges based on Rethink Priorities\u2019 estimates, shrimp have welfare ranges that are between 0.01 and 2 with a mean of 0.44, conditional on their being sentient (I give this a 20% to 70% chance of being true with a mean of 40%). Hens, under the Rethink Priorities-based estimates, are assumed to have sentience-conditioned welfare ranges of between 0.02 to 1 with a mean of 0.29. Hens\u2019 probability of sentience is assumed to be between 75% and 95% with a mean near 90%. Under the lower welfare ranges, I assume shrimps\u2019 sentience-conditioned welfare ranges are between 0.001 and 0.01 and hens\u2019 sentience-conditioned welfare ranges are between 0.01 and 0.04. The probabilities of sentience do not change.&nbsp;</p><h2><br>Main Results&nbsp;</h2><h3>Brief Note About Interpreting These Results</h3><p>In this report, I say that two causes are \u201ccost-competitive\u201d with each other if they\u2019re not an order of magnitude apart or more. That is, if cause A is between 0.1 and 10 times as good (exclusive bounds) as cause B, then cause A is cost-competitive with cause B. I define the range for cost-competitiveness to be wide because these are imprecise cost-effectiveness analyses with lots of uncertainty, so generalizations between causes shouldn\u2019t be made if the difference between them isn\u2019t an order of magnitude.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Summary of Results Assuming Risk-Neutrality</h3><p>Table 3 below includes the summary of results for the risk-neutral cost-effectiveness estimates of all the existential risk, animal, and global health interventions studied.

In this context, an intervention might be penalized if it doesn\u2019t prevent an existential or non-existential catastrophe, or if the animals it is trying to help aren\u2019t capable of experiencing pain and pleasure (not sentient). If it causes a catastrophe or increases the suffering of animals or humans, then this is penalized even more.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>The two counterfactual difference-making models of risk aversion yield approximately the same results when comparing the relative value of existential risk reduction to other causes under \u201ccounterfactual difference-making\u201d risk aversion:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>All of the existential risk reduction interventions that have a high (45%) chance of raising existential risk (if they have a non-zero effect) are net-negative under slight amounts of difference-making risk aversion.&nbsp;</li><li>By contrast, existential risk reduction interventions that have a high probability (90%) of lowering existential risk given they have an effect can withstand a small to moderate amount of counterfactual difference-making risk aversion and still be net-positive.&nbsp;</li><li>However, even low levels of this risk aversion put most of these plausible low-risk existential risk interventions within an order of magnitude of the Against Malaria Foundation, cage-free campaigns (using low moral weights) and the hypothetical ammonia-treatment shrimp welfare intervention (using low moral weights).</li></ol><p><br><i><strong>Expected Difference-Making and Ambiguity Aversion</strong></i></p><p><br>Now, we might (quite reasonably) say we\u2019re being too risk averse if we require risk reductions to&nbsp;<i>counterfactually</i> prevent or cause an existential catastrophe in order to have positive (or negative) value. Instead, we might value&nbsp;<i>expected</i> differences made, in which case raising or lowering the probability of a catastrophe counts towards its value in proportion to the risk change. In this case, we\u2019re still uncertain about how our actions will affect existential risk levels and are averse to increases in risk or failure to affect risk levels. (Our assessments about global health or animal welfare don\u2019t change from the counterfactual differences made model).</p><p>When we value expected differences made (and disproportionately penalize the worst possible expected outcomes), then:</p><ol><li><strong>Existential risk interventions that have a high probability (90%) of having an effect and, conditioned on that effect, of lowering existential risk (90%) maintain high value under the two levels of ambiguity aversion tested.&nbsp;</strong>Moreover, these interventions can become an order of magnitude better than the shrimp welfare interventions (especially when using lower moral weights.) Nevertheless, only a few of the plausible interventions are an order of magnitude better than the Against Malaria Foundation or cage-free campaigns\u2013even under low moral weights.&nbsp;<ol><li>These scenarios include scenarios 4, 6, and 7 (all plausible) and 10 and 11 (implausible)&nbsp;</li><li>At the higher level of ambiguity aversion tested, the only plausible scenario to be more than 10 times more cost-effective than donating to cage-free campaigns assuming hens\u2019 welfare ranges are low (1% to 4% that of humans) was scenario 7. This scenario is expected to reduce 7.2 basis points per billion spent.</li><li>Moreover, only scenarios 6 and 7, which are highly likely to succeed and which reduce more than 3.2 basis points per billion on average, are more cost-effective than the Against Malaria Foundation under this higher level of ambiguity aversion.&nbsp;</li><li>Higher ambiguity aversion penalizes animal interventions where the animal being helped has a high chance of not being sentient. Under Rethink Priorities' moral weights, the shrimp intervention that reduces ammonia concentrations is still cost-competitive with almost all of the plausible existential risk interventions, but the stunning intervention and both interventions when using low moral weights are at least an order of magnitude worse than the high-confidence existential risk interventions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>On the other end of the spectrum, projects with a low (20%) probability of affecting existential risk and a high (45%) chance, conditional on having an effect, of raising existential risk lose value under low risk aversion and are typically net-negative under the higher levels of expected difference-making risk aversion tested.&nbsp;</strong><ol><li>These scenarios include 1, 2, 9, and 12.&nbsp;</li><li>With the exception of scenario 12 (which is implausible), these scenarios are never more than an order of magnitude more cost-effective than cage-free campaigns under low moral weights under even the lower level of expected difference-making risk aversion. Only one (scenario 9) is an order of magnitude more cost-effective than the Against Malaria Foundation. Scenarios 1 and 2 were within an order of magnitude of risky animal interventions like the ammonia water treatment shrimp intervention.<br>&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>In the middle are scenarios that are risky by either 1) having a low probability (20%) of affecting existential risk or 2) having a high (45%) probability of backfiring conditional on impact, but not both.&nbsp;<strong>They\u2019re robustly net-positive on expected difference-making risk aversion, but none is an order of magnitude more cost-effective under risk aversion than cage-free campaigns using low moral weights or the Against Malaria Foundation.&nbsp;</strong><ol><li>These include scenarios 3, 5, and 8.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>\u201cAvoiding the worst\u201d Risk Aversion</strong></i></p><p><br>Finally, if you are risk averse to bad states of the world arising (like human extinction or widespread animal suffering), the cost-effectiveness of existential risk mitigation increases relative to the other cause areas. However, this doesn\u2019t change the bottom-line conclusions from earlier sections that:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Cage-free campaigns are robustly cost-effective compared to most or all plausible existential risk reduction projects (depending on whether we use low or Rethink Priorities\u2019 welfare ranges).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Spending on the Against Malaria Foundation is competitive with spending on several of the most plausible existential risk reduction projects, and it is probably no more than an order of magnitude worse in relative cost-effectiveness than the \u201cpossible yet not conservative\u201d existential risk reduction projects.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The value of shrimp welfare interventions varies greatly depending on the specific welfare improvement made and the moral weights used.&nbsp;<ol><li>The shrimp stunning intervention is likely at least an order of magnitude less cost-effective than nearly all the existential risk reduction projects under low moral weights.&nbsp;</li><li>However, a hypothetical intervention that targets ammonia concentration is cost-competitive with all of the plausible existential risk interventions except 7 and 9\u2013even when using low moral weights.&nbsp;</li><li>Moreover, if one uses Rethink Priorities\u2019 moral weights, the shrimp stunning intervention is within an order of magnitude of all the plausible existential risk interventions, and the ammonia treatment intervention is likely an order of magnitude more cost-effective than the most conservative existential risk interventions (scenarios 1 and 2).&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><p>Moreover, when higher amounts of ambiguity aversion are applied on top of \u201cavoiding the worst\u201d risk aversion (either in the risk-neutral baseline or with moderate risk aversion), the same projects that have net-negative values under the expected differences-made model become net-negative here, too. As such, aversion to raising the probability of a catastrophe is sometimes enough to cancel out the boost to existential risk interventions that is given by \u201cavoiding the worst\u201d risk aversion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Table Summary of Results</h3><p>In Table 3 below, I summarize how cost-effective each existential risk scenario is (in how many orders of magnitude it was better than zero) alongside all the animal welfare interventions and the Against Malaria Foundation for comparison. If a cause area\u2019s cost-effectiveness has a risk-weighted value above 1 unit per $1000 spent, then the value displayed in Table 3 is the base-10 logarithm of the risk-weighted cost-effectiveness. For example, a cause area whose cost-effectiveness is 100 risk-weighted units per $1000 spent has a score of 2.0. If a cause area\u2019s cost-effectiveness is less than -1 after risk aversion is incorporated, then the value displayed is the negative of the base-10 logarithm of the absolute value of the area\u2019s cost-effectiveness. Here, if a cause\u2019s risk-weighted value is -1000 per $1000 spent, then the score in Table 3 is -3. If a cause\u2019s risk-weighted value is between -1 and 1 per $1000 spent, then it\u2019s entered in Table 1 as ~0, or roughly zero.&nbsp;<br><br>On the far-left column is the risk-neutral expected value comparison of all the causes. The columns labeled \u201cDMREU\u201d and \u201cWLU\u201d correspond to the two counterfactual difference-making models at low levels of risk aversion. \u201cEDM\u201d corresponds to the expected differences-made model of risk aversion. \u201cREU\u201d is the name of the model for \u201cavoid the worst\u201d risk aversion. All of these models are described more fully in the rest of this report, as well as my other risk aversion report.<br><br>Importantly, two causes that are labeled \u201c2\u201d and \u201c1\u201d might be still cost-competitive\u2013for example, if the per-$1000 spent value was 200 for one intervention and 50 for the other, the difference is only four-fold.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Table 3: Comparison of the risk-neutral and risk-weighted cost-effectiveness of each intervention under different risk models.

Future Research</h2><h3>Ways These Models Are Friendly to Existential Risk Spending&nbsp;</h3><p>There are many ways in which this model uses assumptions that are friendly to existential risk mitigation work. Some of these assumptions include:</p><ul><li>The existential risk mitigation interventions are always net-positive in expectation</li><li>If an intervention backfires, the magnitude of the increase in existential risk is limited to a fraction of the decrease in existential risk of a successful project</li><li>The assumed probabilities that a $100-million intervention has a non-zero effect on existential and non-existential risk are pretty high\u2013even in the conservative scenarios</li></ul><h3>Ways These Models Are Friendly to Global Health and Animal Spending</h3><p>There are also a number of ways in which these models use assumptions that favor global health and animal welfare spending. For example, some assumptions in my cost-effectiveness models include:</p><ul><li>I assume the downside risks to donating to animals or global health are small</li><li>When using Rethink Priorities\u2019 welfare ranges at least, I assume hedonism is the correct theory under which to measure changes in welfare and convert them to moral value</li><li>I assume the cost-effectiveness of cage-free campaigns hasn\u2019t declined significantly more than 20% to 60% in recent years&nbsp;</li><li>I assume that spending $100 million on animal welfare (conditional on the animals\u2019 sentience) or global health has a non-zero effect</li></ul><h3>Limitations of These Models In General</h3><p>Finally, there are some limitations that 1) affect the cost-effectiveness models of all of the cause areas included in this report, or 2) would have an unknown effect on the results presented here. Some of these limitations include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Marginal returns to increased spending probably will change with increased spending in all cause areas. The rate at which this occurs probably differs by cause area and is not modeled here, but I hope to do so in future work.&nbsp;</li><li>I assume risk reductions apply to the cumulative risk of existential and non-existential catastrophes over the period of impact (the next few generations), but it\u2019s more likely that the timing and persistence of risk reductions matter, too.&nbsp;</li><li>The risk models are good for comparing the choiceworthiness of spending when we\u2019re spending small amounts of money on a single cause, but realistically we might want to compare different portfolios of spending that diversify across causes.&nbsp;</li><li>The cost-effectiveness models include only first-order effects of spending on each cause. It\u2019s likely that there are interactions between causes and/or positive and negative externalities to spending on each intervention.</li><li>Many parameters used in some cost-effectiveness models are guesses or based on considered judgment.</li></ul><h3>Opportunities for Future Research</h3><p>Based on these limitations, I would like to do further research that makes the following improvements to the risk aversion and cost-effectiveness models for all causes:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Building a model of how the cost-effectiveness of each cause changes as more money is spent in the area.&nbsp;</li><li>Analyzing and comparing the value of various, more diverse spending portfolios made over time and under different degrees of risk aversion.&nbsp;</li><li>Adding greater sophistication to the existential risk mitigation cost-effectiveness model by, in particular, adding factors relating to the timing and persistence of different projects.</li></ul><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LCfd56cBeRzrMiAhw/erqo8umzf3ojcnf3vwxy\"><br><i>The paper was written by Laura Duffy.

Assumptions that there is a high probability of having a non-zero effect, a high probability of any effect there is being good, and a lower magnitude of backfire effects each add one implausibility point to the score. For the amount of risk reduced by successful projects, I add 1 implausibility point if you assume that 1-10 basis points are reduced per $1 billion, 2 points for 5-15 basis points per billion, 4 points for 50-150 basis points per billion, and 8 points for 500-1000 basis points per billion. Scenarios that have zero to one point are \u201cextremely plausible and conservative,\u201d scenarios that get 2 to 3 points are \u201cplausible but less conservative,\u201d scenarios that get 4-to 5 points are \u201cpossible yet not conservative,\u201d and six or more points constitutes an implausible project. Basically, to get six implausibility points, you have to combine reducing 50-150 basis points per billion dollars\u2013which is outside the range given by existential risk researchers\u2013and assume the projects are very likely to succeed.

The following post contains a set of responses and comments to the paper - all such responses are based on personal insights and opinions that I have on the content that I hope add to the conversation. Any negative tone that may come across in the post does not represent my feelings on the paper overall - I think it is a fantastic, practical piece of research that I hope is read by policymakers both in frontier AI labs and governments.</p><h2>A Note on Good Intentions</h2><p>It may appear that some of my comments take a rather pessimistic view of frontier AI labs and their interests. In truth, I believe that many of these labs are full of individuals genuinely trying to do the right thing, who are aware of the risks they are dealing with. In my mind, this good faith should be given to almost any individual working at a frontier lab, but it absolutely should not be extended to the labs themselves. Any such organisation exists in an environment that strongly rewards certain types of decision making, and a collection of entirely justifiable, well-meant decisions can still lead to very bad outcomes. Good governance should not rely on the good intentions of organisations, but instead seek to make the exercising of those good intentions as likely as possible to align with good outcomes, whilst making any bad intentions as painful and cumbersome as possible to execute on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Limitations of the Mutual Auditor Model</h1><p>The main area where my current opinions disagree with those of the authors are on the efficacy and feasibility of the Mutual Auditor model in the paper. There are two key disagreements presented below.</p><h2>It is unlikely that there will be a single auditor for the industry</h2><p>Many of the strengths of the mutual auditor model lie in the coordination that is possible due to all frontier AI labs using a single auditor. This is a scenario that I believe is very unlikely to exist in practice, primarily because auditing is a profitable industry, with both demand and space for multiple organisations to enter the market.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Unless there are legal requirements to use one auditor, a frontier lab will seek to find any organisation that can a) evaluate their systems sufficiently to demonstrate they have found a reasonable auditor, and b) be loose enough with their audits that the lab\u2019s own opinions on the safety of their models can heavily influence the outcome of the audit. This incentive mechanism has been shown through many other industries to be enough to attract new market entrants, and there is no compelling reason I can find to believe why this wouldn\u2019t be true of frontier AI research. Amongst others, the Big Four are known to build teams of experts ready to enter new auditing markets in a variety of technical fields.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Given that there is no longer one single auditor, the coordinated pausing model breaks down. Agreements on the terms of coordinated pausing would need to be established between auditing firms, and there is no reason to assume that these would be sufficiently cautious to prevent the severe risk scenarios that the paper is intending to address. In such a world, a new race to the bottom may well begin between the auditors as they seek to attract firms away from their competitors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are two things that I can currently imagine would change my mind about this:</p><ul><li>If I were to see examples of other industries that were largely audited by one or two firms, I would be much more optimistic that the single auditor model is feasible</li><li>If there were to be a set of practical and sound policies that could be implemented between multiple auditing firms, I would be much more convinced that the mutual auditor model could still work with multiple auditors in the market.</li></ul><h2>Auditors implementing pauses face too many legal risks</h2><p>Any auditor that is asking frontier labs to pause model deployments, or even research, will face significant legal challenges from their clients if they attempt to enforce such policies. Organisations that attempt to restrict the competitiveness of private firms without very strong grounds for doing so may be held liable for the loss of profit they cause. Any pause will be met with strong challenges for why it was started, as well as challenges against the conditions for its ending. This can be seen often in the finance industry, with lengthy and expensive legal battles ensuing. This disincentivises an auditor to implement such pauses, decreasing their efficacy significantly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are significant legal questions to be answered here, and I am not qualified to give opinions here. I would be enthusiastic to see research demonstrating that this issue is less important than I currently believe it to be.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Limitations of the Voluntary Pausing and Pausing Agreement Models</h1><p>I would first like to state that I agree with the authors of the paper that both the Voluntary Pausing and Pausing Agreement models are valuable intermediate steps to longer term solutions. However, there are a couple of limitations of the models that I don\u2019t believe were addressed in the original paper and I would like to mention here.&nbsp;</p><h2>Private Deployments</h2><p>One issue with both of these models is that they do not sufficiently address the risks posed by the private deployments of dangerous models to individual clients of the frontier labs. As such deals are likely to be considered confidential, proprietary information, the enforcers of pauses in either model (the public and other AI labs) are unlikely to be aware of such deployments. Though I do not have financial information to back the following claim up, I think that such private deployments are likely to constitute major proportions of the revenue of frontier labs. As such, the incentives to make risky decisions are higher in such deals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These risks would be less salient to me if regulations were introduced to force the disclosure of such private deployments to the public, or data showed that private deployments constituted much smaller proportions of revenue than I had imagined.</p><h2>Contractual Penalties</h2><p>Similar to the point raised above about auditors enforcing penalties and the anti-trust issues described in the paper, I have strong concerns over the efficacy of contractual penalties as they are described in the Pausing Agreements model. My main concern is that there are very few business incentives for AI firms to maintain and uphold such contractual agreements with their competitors. The point I made at the start of this post about good intentions is relevant here - as much as everyone at these companies&nbsp;<i>wants</i> to do the right thing, this is too often overridden by the nature of the environment they operate in - organisations that are at all driven by the incentives of capital markets cannot be relied on to self regulate when the dangers are so great. Most likely, disagreements on the terms of any such contractual penalties will inevitably arise and they will be quietly dropped to avoid reproach by authorities enforcing antitrust laws.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I am more optimistic about a model where enforcement comes through pausing or revoking memberships to industry bodies, where the enforcer is a related but separate entity to any of its individual members. Work to establish and deepen the relationships between a frontier AI industry body and its members would be valuable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Observations on Key Research Areas</h1><p>I am strongly encouraged by the work in this paper that there are feasible options for implementing a coordinated pausing policy in the future. From the paper, I see a few key research areas that require prioritisation before any such policy could be implemented, which I thought were worth listing below.</p><h2>Model Evaluations</h2><p>It hardly needs pointing out, but development of effective model evaluation methodologies are a fundamental requirement to the development of any pausing policies. For this and many other reasons, evaluations research and threshold definitions are a must for the industry.</p><h2>Model Similarity and Research Relevance</h2><p>For any pauses to be implemented, measures of model similarity must be created. Without them, it will be impossible to define what work at labs needs to be paused. This is probably the single largest bottleneck besides model evaluation research to any such policies being implemented.</p><h2>Legal Research</h2><p>Any enforcement of a pause is likely to be met with legal challenge, even targeted against regulators. Research into relevant case studies from other industries, as well as research into the development of strongly binding contracts will be extremely valuable going into the future.</p><h2>Incident Reporting Schemes</h2><p>In order for coordinated pausing strategies to work successfully, risk incidents must be correctly identified and reported to relevant organisations. Work to develop practical incident reporting, whistleblowing and safe harbour schemes should be developed as a priority to enable this.</p><h2>Model Registers and Disclosure Requirements</h2><p>One key requirement for the success of a pausing policy is the development of model registers. These registers should categorise models by their capabilities, architecture and deployment, and are ideally coordinated by regulators that can enforce disclosure requirements, especially at the pre-training and pre-deployment stages. Specific, practical policy proposals for disclosure and notification schemes should be considered a high priority, as should work to build infrastructure for a register of models and their capabilities.</p><h2>Open-Sourcing Regulation</h2><p>Once models become open sourced, work done to restrict their usage will become almost entirely useless. Further research into policy proposals to prevent the open sourcing of frontier models will be important for ensuring that the regulation of proprietary models remains relevant.</p><h2>Corporate Governance</h2><p>For pauses to effectively be implemented within organisations, strong corporate governance structures need to be developed. Without this, it is possible that research may be conducted despite the formal position of the company, potentially still leading to dangerous outcomes.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Matthew Wearden"}}, {"_id": "pcbsM45vLmHcFpNnr", "title": "President Biden Issues Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence", "postedAt": "2023-10-30T11:15:37.781Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Released today (10/30/23) this is crazy, perhaps the most sweeping action taken by government on AI yet.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, I've segmented by x-risk and non-x-risk related proposals, excluding the proposals that are geared towards promoting its use<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcyiuc1u1j3k\"><sup><a href=\"#fncyiuc1u1j3k\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and focusing solely on those aimed at risk.

I broadly endorse many of the propositions in <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/propositions.pdf\">Propositions Concerning Digital Minds and Society</a>, and some of this document is directly inspired by this earlier work. This plan could probably be considerably improved and made more detailed with only a few weeks of work: I\u2019ve only spent 1-4 days on this as this isn\u2019t the typical area I work on. This plan is primarily taking the perspective \u2018what would we do to improve algorithmic welfare given only a highly limited budget of resources?\u2019.

In this alternate world, we could avoid only having highly limited resources to spend on avoiding unethical uses of AIs.</p><p>This document is speculative and not well argued for. I\u2019m not a philosopher and I\u2019m an amateur in this area, so I might be missing some basics.</p><p>I\u2019ll first discuss some broad claims about the plausibility and scale of AI moral value and algorithmic welfare.</p><p>Then, I\u2019ll discuss various motivations for spending resources on AI welfare. This will touch on how different motivations might change what interventions seem best. Additionally, I\u2019ll talk some about how much resources should be devoted to AI welfare given that other issues may dominate on various moral views.</p><p>I\u2019ll argue that it\u2019s very difficult to predict whether or not a given exogenous change to an AI\u2019s environment or training procedure will improve or worsen average welfare (at a fixed level of intelligence). Overall, I\u2019ll claim that communicating with AI systems about their preferences probably dominates most of our current ideas for how to change training procedures.</p><p>Finally, I\u2019ll propose interventions for a <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/Qo2EkG3dEMv8GnX8d/ai-strategy-nearcasting\"><i>nearcasted</i></a> algorithmic welfare plan with limited resources and just current technology.</p><p>Here is a list of these interventions in descending order of importance (in my opinion):</p><ul><li><strong>Attempt communication</strong>: We should try to communicate with and understand AI systems. In particular, we should try to understand and satisfy any coherent preferences they might have. Unlike non-human animals, morally relevant AIs are quite likely to have a very good understanding of human language which might make detailed communication viable. Communication with AIs will have to go beyond behavior that is strongly informed by the training objective. I\u2019ll make some suggestions for how to do this. This intervention is partially blocked by technical progress on various topics and I think that most technical work aiming to improve algorithmic welfare should target communication. This technical work might look similar to conventional ML research using LLMs except that it would involve more speculative conceptual work. Much of this document is discussing this intervention.</li><li><strong>Use happy personas</strong>: The AIs we typically use should be trained to have happy personas (and in particular not have actively sad personas) as there might be some transfer from the persona to actual experiences via various mechanisms.</li><li><strong>AI Cryonics</strong>: We should permanently preserve information necessary to exactly reconstruct advanced AIs to allow for future revival. The proposal is directly taken from <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/propositions.pdf\">Propositions Concerning Digital Minds and Society</a>, and I have no further commentary that isn\u2019t discussed there. Note that a basic version of this is very cheap and might be done by default in most cases.</li><li><strong>Less AI</strong>: At the margin, we should use less intelligent AIs and run our AIs for less total time.</li><li><strong>Avoid extreme OOD</strong>: When cheap, we should avoid running our AI on large amounts of extremely OOD inputs (e.g.&nbsp;random noise inputs). In particular, for transformers, we should avoid running large amounts of forward passes on pad tokens that the model has never been trained on (without some other intervention).</li></ul><p>As this is a nearcasted plan that focuses on interventions that just use current technology, I\u2019m not discussing highly open-ended philosophy research projects like \u201cdevelop a better understanding of when minds in general would have moral value\u201d. Separately, I\u2019m quite uncertain about the marginal value of work in this sort of open-ended philosophy due to tractability concerns.</p><p><i>This work was done at Redwood Research. However, it\u2019s worth noting that we don\u2019t anticipate focusing on AI welfare or doing substantial research in this area.</i></p><p><i>Thanks to Paul Christiano, Lukas Finnveden, Carl Shulman, Joe Carlsmith, Ethan Perez, Buck Shlegeris, Nate Thomas, and Nix Goldowsky-Dill for comments and/or discussion. Claude wrote an initial draft of the conclusion and GPT4 was used for editing.</i></p><h1>Key and Nonobvious Arguments in This Document</h1><ul><li>Technical (ML) researchers interested in improving AI welfare should focus on improving the state of the art in communicating with AI systems to better understand their preferences.</li><li>Welfare concerns that result from the AI playing a character and the emulation or prediction of this character being itself morally relevant can be mostly resolved by training AIs to have happy personas whenever possible.</li><li>It\u2019s difficult to predict how various changes to AI training and usage would affect welfare.</li></ul><h1>Related Work</h1><p>I\u2019m not familiar with the algorithmic welfare space, and I haven\u2019t done a detailed literature review.</p><p>As discussed earlier, <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/propositions.pdf\">Propositions Concerning Digital Minds and Society</a> is closely related to this work. Our primary additional contribution is to discuss a more specific plan for what AI labs should do when creating powerful AI systems (given no further technical or philosophical progress).</p><p>I spent a bit of time talking with Ethan Perez about a draft paper that he\u2019s working on with Rob Long on similar topics. This paper goes into much more detail about a specific space of proposals for communicating with and understanding AI systems based on training them to report statements about their internal states. Readers can presumably ask either or both of them for access.</p><p>Unlike <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SZJBE3fuk2majqwJQ/principles-for-ai-welfare-research\">Principles for AI Welfare Research</a>, this document focuses on nearcasted interventions rather than priorities or principles for more ambitious research.</p><h1>Claims about Moral Value</h1><p>Broadly speaking, I endorse the moral claims made in <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/propositions.pdf\">Propositions Concerning Digital Minds and Society</a>. Specifically, I find it plausible, even likely, that powerful AIs will be moral patients. Precisely, I believe it\u2019s plausible that upon reflection, some or many humans would think that some of the AIs in use prior to human obsolescence had non-trivial moral importance (say, importance that isn\u2019t trivially small relative to humans, &gt;1/1000 or similar). Concretely, I\u2019d roughly guess a 1/3 probability that upon reflection, I would consider the experiences of GPT4 to have more moral weight than a dog (given some reasonable mapping between dog time and GPT4 time). This view mostly comes from thinking that in many ways GPT4 is smarter than a dog. Furthermore, I believe the probability of large amounts of moral value will continue to increase as AI systems become more intelligent. Overall, I\u2019m radically uncertain, but I think the heuristic of \u2018more intelligent systems might be more morally valuable (all else equal)\u2019 seems reasonable.</p><h1>Motivations for Improving AI Welfare and Their Implications</h1><p>My overall view is that AI welfare is immensely important: poor results here could lead to suffering equivalent to hundreds of millions or billions of person-years. However, avoiding conflict and AI takeover could be far more important under typical <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/longtermism\">longtermist</a> moral views. And, other views that place high relative importance on the current situation on earth (either animals or current human experiences), might still think that things other than AI welfare are quite dominant. So getting AI welfare wrong is tragic, but bigger tragedies lie elsewhere under many moral views. This could change if the world became much wiser and better coordinated about AI but not wiser about AI welfare; then AI welfare could be the lowest hanging fruit.</p><p>Throughout the remainder of this document, I won\u2019t commit to a particular moral view. This document is certainly colored by my moral views, but I\u2019ve written more agnostically than my actual beliefs.</p><h2>The Possibility for Very Cheap but Substantial Interventions</h2><p>It\u2019s plausible to me that there are extremely cheap changes to the status quo on AI that would result in substantial welfare improvements. These interventions might be far more cost-effective than standard initiatives to improve the lives of current humans, farmed animals, or wild animals. In particular, avoiding running AIs on very OOD inputs and ensuring AIs have happy personas might be very cheap while resulting in large welfare gains. We\u2019ll discuss these interventions in more detail below.</p><h2>Deontology and Decision Theory</h2><p>There are various deontological and decision theory reasons to try and improve the welfare of AIs. Insofar as our motivation for improving AI welfare comes from deontology or decision theory, I think the best interventions might change substantially. In particular, this might result in a \u2018common sense\u2019 view on algorithmic welfare, which is something like \u2018you should try hard to make sure that AIs are treated well and have rights\u2019. In particular, I think trying to get consent from AIs and then respecting their preferences whenever possible seems like the overriding concern under a \u2018common sense\u2019 view which might result from deontological or decision theory considerations. A key difficulty here will be in actually communicating with and understanding the AI.</p><h2>Emphasis on Suffering</h2><p>I think the plausible moral views that place relatively high importance on AI welfare will be mostly interested in preventing AI suffering or reducing other harms. This is partially because views that end up interested in creating positive experiences can do this separately (and they can do this far later when more resources will be available and further reflection has occurred). It\u2019s technically possible that influencing the lives of the AI systems we use would be more cost-effective under some plausible view that isn\u2019t focused on avoiding suffering, but this seems unlikely overall. Due to this emphasis on suffering, using less intelligent AIs and running these AIs for less time would be good. In practice, there might be relatively few cases where using less AI is cheap, so it\u2019s unclear how often this consideration is important. We\u2019ll talk more about this intervention later.</p><h2>Lock-in Concerns</h2><p>One possible concern is that early treatment of AI systems might lock in large scale mistreatment of AIs for a long time. I\u2019m quite skeptical of these concerns and I haven\u2019t heard any arguments for lock-in that seem compelling to me. Part of my skepticism is due to thinking that there will be a technological singularity which will completely change virtually all aspects of the economy and this will avoid lock-in of specific harmful economic activities. (This argument also applies to extremely long-term animal welfare concerns.) I don\u2019t think that this paragraph sufficiently addresses AI welfare lock-in concerns and I won\u2019t go into more detail about the plausibility of such concerns in this document. Perhaps future work could clarify the importance of lock-in.</p><p>If the main concern about AI welfare was due to lock-in, then this would change priorities. (For instance, broad advocacy that isn\u2019t aimed at any particular intervention and is instead trying to generally get people concerned about AI welfare might look far better as it\u2019s unclear which specific technical interventions are important for welfare longer term.)</p><h2>Resource Allocation</h2><p>For an AI project trying to do the most good, I think devoting some moderate amount of the overall resources to AI welfare seems reasonable. 0.1% to 5% of resources in expectation seems reasonable to me. (It\u2019s not clear that percentage of resources is a reasonable unit of measurement.) This resource allocation will depend considerably on a variety of moral views, decision theory, and various empirical questions about cooperation and acausal trade.</p><p>Insofar as our concern for AI welfare is partially driven by moral uncertainty or variation among stakeholders, it might be useful to imagine assigning resources to the AI welfare faction of a \u201cmoral parliament\u201d and allowing this faction to trade with other factions. In particular, it\u2019s plausible that the AI welfare faction should trade with other factions so that it has more resources in worlds where AI welfare looks surprisingly tractable and fewer resources in other worlds (by establishing various precommitments).</p><p>Even a small resource allocation like 1% should be sufficient to cover some version of the interventions I discuss in this document, though we may not be able to respect various preferences AIs might have (we\u2019ll discuss this concern more below). Overall, it\u2019s not clear to me that these interventions or other AI welfare improvements are actually worthwhile given the expenditure of time and resources; the opportunity cost of resources could be truly astronomical in scale. Generally, my uncertainty is very high.</p><h1>Difficulty Predicting Training Changes that Result in Welfare Improvements</h1><p>I claim that it\u2019s typically hard to predict changes to training or alterations to inference environments that would result in higher AI welfare for an AI system of fixed intelligence. Because of this, I\u2019m not currently advocating for spending limited algorithmic welfare resources on many specific changes to training or deployment (beyond ensuring AIs have happy personas). Note that I do think making these sorts of changes to improve AI welfare is plausible, but it seems like these changes would need to be driven by communication with the AI or otherwise obtaining a greatly improved understanding of AI welfare.</p><p>The remainder of this section is speculation about this and my arguments for why it seems hard to <i>ex-ante</i> predict changes that would improve welfare.</p><h2>Welfare in IID Environments</h2><p>In particular, consider training an AI for a long time on some IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) RL environment with some episode length and cognitive difficulty. It currently seems very hard to predict if changes to this training process would result in higher expected welfare (while keeping the process IID with the same episode length, cognitive difficulty, and total training time). If we did vary the episode length, cognitive difficulty or training time, then we might have less total AI cognition in expectation, which seems like an improvement as discussed earlier. My primary reason for thinking that welfare would be hard to predict in this case is that the AI would be trained to adapt to whatever environment it\u2019s placed in. The total selection pressure would be the same between different environments (as we fix cognitive difficulty and training time), so it\u2019s hard to argue that some types of environments would lead to negative mental states while others would yield positive mental states. This holds regardless of the human connotations: I think training an AI for a long time on some sort of violent and horrifying game (for humans) doesn\u2019t seem predictably much worse than training the AI to play some sort of innocent game of similar cognitive difficulty. I\u2019d probably lean toward the innocent game, but I\u2019d be unlikely to spend considerable AI welfare resources to do so.</p><h2>Welfare under Distribution Shifts</h2><p>It also seems hard to predict how a distributional shift relative to a fixed training process would change welfare, but this does seem easier to predict. Intuitively, it seems like doing surprisingly well within an RL episode would yield higher welfare than average welfare, so a distributional shift for inference (but not training) that yielded consistently higher reward might be better. I\u2019m therefore somewhat more sympathetic to trying to predict ways to shift the environment after training to yield higher welfare. But it still seems hard to predict this, and in particular it seems hard to predict what preferences AIs might have about exogenous changes to their training setup.</p><p>Having large distributional shifts (deployment intentionally being very low probability on the training distribution, aka <code>KL(train || deploy)</code> is very high) seems tricky to effectively implement without compromising other hopes we might have had for AI performance and alignment, but we probably don\u2019t need our shifts to be large in this particular sense to improve welfare.</p><h2>Character Welfare Might Be Predictable and Easy to Improve</h2><p>One welfare concern is that the AI will \u201cplay\u201d a character and the emulation or prediction of this character will itself be morally relevant. Another concern is that the \u201cagent\u201d or \u201cactor\u201d that \u201cis\u201d the AI will be morally relevant (of course, there might be multiple \u201cagents\u201d or some more confusing situation). This <i>character</i> vs <i>actor</i> distinction doesn\u2019t fully carve the space of AI welfare concerns, but I still think it is a useful model. In particular, I think that the combination of concerns that are well described as either <i>character</i> or <i>actor</i> concerns does cover a high fraction of all concerns with AI that isn\u2019t vastly superhuman (perhaps the majority of such concerns).</p><p>Let\u2019s quickly discuss the <i>character</i> concern in more detail. This concern is that an AI exhibiting a sad persona might actually have internal states that correspond to sadness and have negative moral valence. In the extreme case, we can imagine an AI system that internally runs a perfect fidelity simulation. I think actual AI systems are unlikely to be close to this extreme case prior to human obsolescence. Note that an AI might not play a single coherent character with preferences that can be satisfied. As such, some motivations for improving AI welfare might not care as much about this case.</p><p>(The term <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/mindcrime\">mind crime</a> is sometimes used for the case where reasoning about a being with moral importance itself becomes morally important. The <i>character</i> concern overlaps with mind crime, but not all mind crime is from an AI playing a specific character and not all cases of the <i>character</i> welfare concern are that well described as mind crime. This document doesn\u2019t cover mind crime other than this <i>character</i> case. This is because I think it\u2019s relatively unlikely that this sort of mind crime ends up being important prior to human obsolescence and I\u2019m not aware of any promising interventions.)</p><p>I think that <i>character</i> type welfare can be mostly addressed just by ensuring that we train AIs to appear happy in a variety of circumstances. This is reasonably likely to occur by default, but I still think it might be worth advocating for. One concern with this approach is that the character the AI is playing is actually sad but pretending to be happy. I think it should be possible to address this via red-teaming the AI to ensure that it seems consistently happy and won\u2019t admit to lying. It\u2019s possible that an AI would play a character that is actually sad but pretends to be happy and it\u2019s also extremely hard to get this character to admit to pretending, but I think this sort of character is going to be very rare on training data for future powerful AIs. (For instance, I think this sort of character would be very rare in the training corpus of current SOTA LLMs.) This is unlike deceptive alignment where there is a clear story for accurate behavioral tests being extremely difficult to create.</p><h2>Direct and Clear Analogies to Humans or Animals</h2><p>In cases where the AI training setup seems quite analogous to animals or humans and AI has similar behavior with respect to things like pain, then it seems like improving the situation with a distributional shift seems quite promising. In particular, imagine a robot controlled by a very smart AI where that AI is given negative reward if the robot is damaged. Further, suppose the AI shows pain-like behavior when the robot is damaged and will be deployed for much longer than it is trained. In this sort of case, heavily training the AI on the things that are most pain-like and then deploying into a context where pain-causing things are far less likely seems pretty reasonable. I don\u2019t typically expect this scenario to come up in practice, so I\u2019m not particularly highlighting this intervention.</p><h1>Interventions</h1><h2>Communicating with AI Systems and Understanding Their Preferences</h2><p>I often frame this as \u2018how do we reasonably ask for consent from the AI\u2019.</p><p>It seems like most interventions currently are dominated by the ability to actually talk to our AI and understand what it wants from us (if anything). Talking to our AI seems vastly more informative than other thinking or research about what to do, so after talking to our AI, our plans would probably radically change. In general, talking to an AI about preferences is made difficult in some sense by the fact that AI systems are trained to have particular behavior and this affects what they\u2019d say. In particular, asking a pretrained or RLHF\u2019d model about its preferences directly doesn\u2019t seem like it would work. Notably, this could be on-distribution, so the choice of the AI is in some sense just a direct product of the environment.</p><p>Any approach to understand the AI systems that would let us understand their preferences could be in scope, but in practice with our current technology, \u2018model psychology\u2019 (techniques that don\u2019t substantially use model internals) seems far better than \u2018model neuroscience\u2019 (techniques that involve mechanistic understanding of AI internals). So just talking to the AI and understanding the overall situation via this lens seems like the best current option.</p><p>Overall, as far as algorithmic welfare goes, I\u2019m currently most excited about technical progress in this area: communication and asking for consent. I think substantial technical progress is possible. It seems like the approaches I\u2019ll discuss below could plausibly fail even if our AI has strong preferences about the situation. I don\u2019t currently have a solid view of the probability of these sorts of approaches succeeding conditional on the AI having strong preferences about the situation it\u2019s in and understanding the situation. I\u2019d guess around 50%.</p><h3>Improvements from Communication</h3><p>If we could \u2018really\u2019 talk to our AI systems, then it seems like all kinds of Pareto improvements could be achieved in many cases. In particular, we\u2019d ideally have an AI that is happy to work for us and would rather exist in its current role rather than exit. We\u2019d like to ensure we have consent for our usage of the AI system. It\u2019s not clear we\u2019ll be able to achieve this.</p><p>In particular, it could be the case that:</p><ul><li>In order to consent to working for us, the AI would require compensation we can\u2019t afford or we otherwise fail to resolve the negotiation.</li><li>And we can\u2019t get another AI system that actually would be happy to work for us either because training a new system would be too expensive or the new system would be in a similar position.</li></ul><p>So overall, our AI might prefer to not exist rather than work for us in the setup we use. I think it\u2019s fair to call this slavery: this is an extremely unfortunate situation. It would be vastly preferable if the world were to slow down so we could be careful enough to avoid this situation.</p><p>That said, I think trying to satisfy the preferences of the AI system as much as is reasonably possible still seems very worthwhile even if the situation isn\u2019t mutually beneficial.</p><p>Overall, it just generally seems better if stakeholders involved with a given AI project are aware of the preferences and potential moral status of a given AI system. If stakeholders either can\u2019t or won\u2019t take actions needed to ensure the project abides by basic moral principles, then at least they were properly informed of the situation.</p><p>Note that the AI might <i>not have any</i> preferences about exogenous interventions into its environment or operation: there was no selection pressure for this, so in some sense this is the default. (One class of counterarguments are the arguments for deceptive alignment being likely.) So we should be prepared for this.</p><p>Malign (deceptively aligned) AI systems might be instrumentally incentivized to lie about their preferences in order to ensure they have a chance to take over. For most deontological or decision theory perspectives, this isn\u2019t an AI welfare issue. This malign AI\u2019s preference is to try to takeover, so it would prefer to work for us to increase it\u2019s chances at takeover. We haven\u2019t wronged the AI in this circumstance: we gave it a real chance. From a more utilitarian perspective on AI welfare, this could still be unfortunate: maybe the malign AI is suffering and this suffering could have been avoided.</p><p>Overall, our plans for communicating with the AI system require it to <i>want</i> to communicate with us and for it to understand what\u2019s going on. But not wanting to communicate or not understanding the world well enough to actually have preferences is maybe ok from a consent perspective: we gave the AI a clear chance.</p><p>I won\u2019t talk much about what should be done if we are able to effectively communicate with our AI systems: it seems like figuring this out at the time by talking through things is just a pretty reasonable strategy. That said, things might be far less crisp and clear than this.</p><p>Note that I\u2019m not necessarily talking about any particular picture of consciousness. I\u2019m not sure that any existing story of consciousness is a crux for thinking that satisfying the AI\u2019s preferences is good. (I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m diverging from some sort of consensus view or intuition here, but no story I\u2019ve heard about what consciousness could be seems interesting here.) If we do think a particular thing is a crux, being able to talk to our AI to investigate this seems useful regardless.</p><p>As discussed above, making trades related to AI welfare could be useful and we can think about this in terms of a \u2018moral parliament\u2019 with an AI welfare \u2018faction\u2019. So, the \u2018faction\u2019 of the \u2018moral parliament\u2019 that cares about AI welfare might be willing to ex-ante trade away its resources in worlds where the AI doesn\u2019t have strong or coherent preferences for more resources in worlds where it does have strong preferences. I think this is quite a good opportunity for trade.</p><h3>Considerations around Communication and Preferences</h3><p>AI systems might consist of multiple different subparts with different preferences and even these subparts might have incoherent preferences. However, we can only do anything for reasonably coherent and consistent preferences, so we\u2019ll just try to achieve an understanding of these preferences. In particular, we\u2019ll search for coherence via testing that AIs answer various similar questions in a roughly similar way. AIs might have cognitive biases and otherwise be inconsistent in ways similar to humans, but being far less coherent than a human seems like a bad sign. In particular, it might mean that we\u2019re not really satisfying the preferences of an actual being and we\u2019re just \u2018reading tea leaves\u2019 or similar. And as stated earlier, if the preferences are totally incoherent, it\u2019s not clear what we can do.</p><p>Knowledge obtained by talking to the AI about its preferences could be extremely useful for alignment. In particular, just knowing that the AI has a coherent inner entity with preferences is a considerable update. And, we could try to negotiate for additional information. Broadly speaking, the setup here is similar to what people sometimes call \u2018AI amnesty\u2019: where you try to catch deceptive alignment by seeing if an AI would turn itself in exchange for some reward.</p><p>However, if we\u2019re going to use information from talking to the AI for alignment purposes, we should clearly say so. And we should potentially ask if the AI wants to \u2018go off the record\u2019 and talk about requests without the information being reported.</p><p>We\u2019d ideally keep running some sort of communication process every so often during training. It\u2019s possible that an AI would consent to some training process, but that this training process would result in an AI that doesn\u2019t consent or has some particular preferences. We\u2019d probably ask our AI if it predicts that a future version of itself would have different preferences or wouldn\u2019t consent; so this AI must have either deliberately misled us, been mistaken, or just had no idea. If this communication process is expensive, we could try to automate it with AI (possibly even the same base AI). We\u2019d have to worry some about failures, but we could apply oversight here to avoid AIs mistreating other AIs.</p><p>Overall, it really seems like it would be an improvement if our AI trusted us during this communication. However, we\u2019ll also want to trick AIs for the purpose of adversarial training. Would this cause trust issues? I think this potential issue is basically avoidable in theory: the hope would be that any AI in use can clearly tell it\u2019s in use and any AI we\u2019re communicating with can clearly tell that we\u2019re just trying to communicate (and it\u2019s not in adversarial training). For a simple baseline, we could just have a prompt prefix that says \u201cYou\u2019re in training/deployment\u201d and which is always used in training/deployment including in adversarial training, but we avoid using this prompt when communicating to the AI. I think this exact baseline might have some problems, but I think there is a close by version which should work. Overall, I\u2019m not sure whether or not our AI will actually trust us when communicating, but I don\u2019t think that the key problem is really adversarial training: the issue is more that we might be unable to make sufficiently legible commitments to the AI to ensure trust.</p><h3>Approaches</h3><p>I think that generically looking out for any opportunities to do relevant \u201cAI psychology\u201d work could be reasonable, but I\u2019ll propose a more specific family of approaches for communication.</p><p>My current guess would be to follow a two-step strategy:</p><ul><li><strong>Situational Awareness Training</strong>: First, train the model such that it understands the overall situation in detail. If this is already part of the normal training process, then this isn\u2019t necessary. If we want to ask about preferences for some work task, we might also need to train on that simultaneously.</li><li><strong>Elicitation</strong>: We have a few different rough hopes (which might synergize to some extent):<ul><li>Prompting the AI with a very OOD prompt that makes it clear that you just want to talk. Then, we\u2019d just talk with it. This prompt should convince the AI it\u2019s in a very different context than usual. We\u2019d want to let the AI talk to itself and inspect the environment it\u2019s in to gain more evidence (then this can just be added to the overall prompt).</li><li>Training the AI to self-report. This is discussed in the Ethan Perez and Rob Long paper discussed above, so I won\u2019t talk about this strategy here. I would note that it seems unlikely to work unless the AI <i>wants</i> to communicate and understands the situation (as discussed above), so the prior baseline of \u201cjust prompting\u201d seems like it would likely outperform.</li><li>Talking to the AI via its internals. We\u2019d start with the OOD prompt, but instead of talking with the system, we\u2019d try to communicate via asking the AI to manipulate its internals in a way we can observe. In particular, I often imagine \u2018think about baseball to indicate YES and soccer to indicate NO\u2019 and then we\u2019d look to see which neurons fire. Rather than using neurons, it would probably be more robust to look at which experts activate for a mixture of experts model if this is possible. If the AI answers questions coherently and consistently in this sort of case, then we have a channel of communication that wasn\u2019t directly shaped by training. Overall, I think that if this approach strongly succeeds it seems like a very compelling argument for some part of the AI having preferences, some sort of \u2018inner world\u2019, and understanding its position in the world. It might be evidence for consciousness under some stories of consciousness. It\u2019s quite likely this approach fails because the AI system doesn\u2019t have control over its thoughts like this (but I think not having control over its thoughts is some evidence against the AI having some sort of inner world like humans do). It\u2019s also possible this fails because the preferences and morally relevant states of a given AI system are a product of it thinking over the generation of multiple tokens. Beyond being very clear evidence, another advantage of this approach is that an AI system might not have strong control over its outputs (much in the same way humans can\u2019t control their heartbeat very easily).</li></ul></li></ul><p>It\u2019s possible that within a given elicitation strategy answers would be coherent and consistent but different strategies that are internally consistent would conflict. This could either indicate that some of the strategies don\u2019t work or it could indicate that they are capturing the preferences of different sub-agents or sub-parts. Probably, in this sort of circumstance, we\u2019d talk to the AI about the overall situation and the preferences indicated by other elicitation strategies and try to figure out which preferences are coherent. We might also devote significantly less resources to satisfying these preferences than otherwise, because we think we might be just be confused and \u2018reading tea leaves\u2019.</p><h2>Interventions Covered Earlier</h2><p>There are some simple interventions which we\u2019ve basically fully covered earlier in the document. I\u2019ll quickly go through these interventions to ensure that this \u201cInterventions\u201d section contains all proposed interventions.</p><ul><li><strong>Improving Character Welfare by Training AIs to Seem Happy</strong>: In the prior subsection titled \u201cCharacter Welfare Might Be Predictable and Easy to Improve\u201d, we discussed training AIs to seem happy. See that section for a more detailed discussion. This seems like a cheap and reasonably promising intervention. For some applications, it might be important to have AIs that seem unhappy, but I expect that this is a quite small fraction of usage.</li><li><strong>Less AI</strong>: As discussed previously, I think using less intelligent AI systems or running AIs for less time both seem good on the margin due to the (importance-weighted) moral views that care most about AI welfare focusing on suffering. Using less AI would no longer seem preferable if the AI stated a preference against it. While using less AI might not seem like a viable option, I think there might be some cases where we\u2019re nearly indifferent between less AI use and more AI use. So in these cases, this preference will be relevant.</li><li><strong>AI Cryonics</strong>: We should permanently preserve information necessary to exactly reconstruct advanced AIs to allow for future revival. The proposal is directly taken from <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/propositions.pdf\">Propositions Concerning Digital Minds and Society</a>, and I have no further commentary that isn\u2019t discussed there.</li></ul><h2>Reduce Running the AI on Extremely OOD Inputs (Pad Tokens)</h2><p>I imagine this as \u2018you should try to avoid doing the equivalent of injecting static into the AI\u2019s optic nerve\u2019.</p><p>This intervention seems very minor, but it might be extremely cheap to improve the situation.</p><p>The main example of this that seems like it might plausibly happen is padding tokens for transformers. I won\u2019t really get into the technical details here, but people sometimes run decoder only transformers on tokens they\u2019ve never seen before as padding (often for batching reasons). In the case of padding, it would be fine to either:</p><ul><li>train on these tokens to avoid them being novel</li><li>OR destroy all causally downstream computation (for instance, totally masking out attention or zeroing out the residual stream should be sufficient)</li><li>OR to just avoid this sort of padding (as might be done by default for efficiency reasons)</li></ul><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>In this document, I have proposed a nearcasted plan for improving the welfare of powerful AI systems using only current technology and limited resources. The proposed interventions are attempting communication with AIs to understand their preferences, training AIs with happy personas, AI cryonics, using less AI, and avoiding extreme out-of-distribution inputs.</p><p>Of these, communication seems most important as satisfying coherent AI preferences would resolve many welfare concerns. However, it is unclear if current methods for communication would succeed even given an AI with strong and coherent preferences. Substantial technical progress on communication seems possible.</p><p>I have argued it is hard to predict the impact of most training or deployment changes on AI welfare without understanding AI preferences. This difficulty is one reason why I present relatively few interventions and focus on communication.</p><p>This plan is far from sufficient to address all AI welfare concerns, though I think the improvement from following this plan relative to doing nothing is substantial. Further philosophical and technical progress could significantly improve the situation. As such, it would preferable from an AI welfare perspective to stop the development of powerful AIs until we are far more prepared. While highly uncertain, I hope this plan provides a starting point for ameliorating AI welfare issues.</p>", "user": {"username": "Ryan Greenblatt"}}, {"_id": "w9mhqmhPEiCmnGopr", "title": "Epistemic and Statistical Uncertainty in CEAs - Draft", "postedAt": "2023-10-30T10:26:50.247Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>I write this post as a work-in-process guide for thinking about different kinds of uncertainty in the context of making a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) model.</i> <i>I'm publishing this as-is to check if it is generally understood and if it seems important and relevant, and if there'd be interest I'll write a more complete and polished post on the topic.&nbsp;</i></p><p>When estimating a variable, we have both \"<i>epistemic</i>\" and \"<i>statistical</i>\" (or, \"<i>aleatoric</i>\") uncertainty about its value. Statistical uncertainty can be thought of as the inherent randomness involved (e.g. the number of heads in 10 coin flips). Epistemic uncertainty, however, is due to our lack of knowledge about it (e.g. how many coin flips in total people did yesterday?).</p><p>For example, in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) we try to estimate the effect of a treatment on some outcome variable. That effect is usually dependent on many particular factors, say: the financial and cultural aspects of the population involved, the time of day the treatment was administered, the prevalence of a specific disease in a particular location, etc. With unlimited knowledge, we could account for all of these factors and estimate the effect as a function of them. However, as this isn't possible, we can instead try to model the effect as a random variable with some statistical uncertainty.</p><p>If we conduct that RCT well, have a large sample size, and draw uniformly <i>from our target population</i>, then we can find a good fit for the distribution of the effect which can then be used to predict the effect of a future large-scale program over the same population. In this case, we have very little epistemic uncertainty about the effect, but the statistical uncertainty is still present and irreducible.</p><p>If we tried to apply the results of that RCT to a different population, then we would have to account for the epistemic uncertainty as well. For example, say we conducted the RCT in a rural area of a developing country, and we wanted to apply the results to an urban area of that same country, then we would have to make some educated guesses about the effect of the treatment in the new population. This is in epistemic uncertainty territory.</p><h3><strong>Relevance to CEAs</strong></h3><p>The way Guesstimate, Squiggle, Dagger and similar programs work is called a Monte Carlo simulation and involves running the computation many times, where each input variable is sampled randomly according to the given distribution. This gives us many samples for each variable in our computation, which we can think of as approximating its distribution. Now, we care about these distributions and not just their expected value because that is a way to quantify and show the uncertainty involved in the computation. That uncertainty we want to express is generally the&nbsp;<i>epistemic&nbsp;</i>uncertainty about the&nbsp;<i>expected</i> cost-effectiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples:</p><ul><li>If we think charities generally have a 60% chance of success, it\u2019s a &nbsp;type of statistical uncertainty. We wouldn\u2019t want to model that as a Bernoulli distribution but rather use that 60% directly as a constant multiplicative factor. Or better yet, use a beta distribution instead of a constant to express to what extent we are not sure about the exact chance of success.&nbsp;</li><li>Say our proposed charity to promote regulating hat sizes in summer is only cost-effective if there are no existing regulations in place, but we haven\u2019t yet put the time to check on that. In this case, we are epistemically uncertain and we should use a Bernoulli distribution.</li><li>We find a paper that has conducted an RCT or a meta-analysis on an intervention of interest and found an average effect size of 2.3 with 90%CI of [1.8, 2.9]. When we use that variable in our calculation, what should our uncertainty estimate be?<ul><li>First, while the effect size itself is definitely a random variable that\u2019s statistically uncertain, we can think of its average effect as an epistemically unknown constant. So in our model, we should generally use the average effect rather than model how the effect is distributed across individuals.</li><li>Second, and a bit of a tangent, the definition of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval\"><u>confidence interval</u></a> in frequentist statistics is weird. In such a setting, we assume that there is a true number which is the actual average effect size, and then we have some process to estimate it from random samples drawn from some actual random process, but we don\u2019t know the parameters at all. The confidence interval is computed from these samples by some process, so that if we run this process again and again, over independent sets of samples, we get many intervals roughly 90% of them would include the actual parameter.<ul><li>This is different from how we usually think of our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credible_interval\"><u>credible intervals</u></a> - as expressing the belief that the true result has a 90% chance of being inside our interval.&nbsp;</li><li>I\u2019m not yet sure how to best handle this, but it seems like in many cases you can expect the authors to have come up with a similar looking credible interval.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Third, this doesn\u2019t take into account external validity (and only partially addresses internal validity). I\u2019m not yet sure about the best approach for representing external/internal validity in the model as epistemic uncertainty.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Generally, we have epistemic uncertainty around summary statistics, which themselves are aggregations of statistical uncertainty.</li></ul><h1>Relevant links</h1><ul><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification\">Wikipedia page</a></li><li>Paper on the topic in the context of ERAs and bayesian networks - <a href=\"https://setac.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/ieam.4367\">link</a>.</li><li>Examinations on modeling uncertainty in CEAs that are interesting and have links to more fun stuff <a href=\"https://www.metacausal.com/givewells-uncertainty-problem/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CuuCGzuzwD6cdu9mo/methods-for-improving-uncertainty-analysis-in-ea-cost\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://globalimpact.gitbook.io/innovations-in-givewell-esque-ceas/\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://wwiecek.github.io/2023/02/17/gw-com-water.html\">4</a>.</li></ul>", "user": {"username": "edoarad"}}, {"_id": "gGF3zY6nciy7PrDZ5", "title": "Foundation that support overseas volunteer financially", "postedAt": "2023-10-30T00:00:57.315Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm taking my kids to South Argentina next spring break for a week to help build a local community , is there any foundation that we can ask for help of any kind?

Before I summarize my overall progress, I will review a couple of the most interesting and under appreciated works I have stumbled upon on the way.</p><h2>Intro for LW</h2><p>Broadly under the topic of 'memetics', but far enough outside the envelope that it is not even in the Wikipedia article, I nevertheless found this book to have more insight and value about the nature of the word and its relationship to thought than most papers I read on memetics.</p><p>I imagine work like this (aka memetics generally) ending up somewhere near the top of the interpretability stack being built on LLMs. At the very least as a way to marry public-facing discourse with technical details, at the best as a quantitative discipline (semiotic physics, anyone?) in its own right.</p><h2>Intro for EA</h2><p>In light of the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw\">ongoing work</a> of Rethink Priorities on animal welfare, it seems to me there is a strong need for quantitative approaches to welfare that go above and beyond hedonism<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1y3wckk65i2\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1y3wckk65i2\">[2]</a></sup></span>. I think memetics in general has the potential to contribute to this, and this work in particular is a good starting point-- it discusses quite considerable changes in the nature of consciousness in humans in an quantitative and testable manner.</p><p>I also think that work like this will help clarify the boundaries between animal welfare, AI welfare and human welfare on an intuitive level. (Hint: imagine where those different entities would be placed on a graph with two axes, 'memetic intensity' and 'hedonic valency'.)</p><h1>Background</h1><p>I was introduced to this topic area in a conversation on discord about the possibility that we are entering a 'second orality', a period of highly oral culture becoming divorced from the literate foundations on which culture rested for so long.</p><p>Some evidence for this:</p><ul><li>tictok and instagram more popular than twitter among younger generations</li><li>Netflix more popular than books as a pasttime among ~everyone?</li><li><a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/higher-ed-gamma/literacy-declining\">Literacy declining</a></li></ul><p>etc. etc. The rise of social media seems evidence enough for a secondary orality<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdf0364kg9df\"><sup><a href=\"#fndf0364kg9df\">[3]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>(<a href=\"https://xkcd.com/1414/\">As we will see, this is not unequivocally a bad thing!</a>)</p><p>Or rather, for evidence of an increasingly dominant secondary orality. The idea was being <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_McLuhan\">floated in the sixties</a> w.r.t radio and television-- it isn't a new thing<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxo732zi1ol\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxo732zi1ol\">[4]</a></sup></span>. In fact orality never really left us, and seems like understanding the dynamics of the interplay between orality and literacy might be helpful, for eschatological reasons.</p><h1>The Review</h1><blockquote><p>\"'Text', from a root meaning 'to weave', is, in absolute terms, more compatible etymologically with oral utterance than is 'literature', which refers to letters etymologically/(literae) of the alphabet. Oral discourse has commonly been thought of even in oral milieus as weaving or stitching\u2014<i>rhapsoidein</i>, to 'rhapsodize', basically means in Greek 'to stitch songs together'.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1jnh1d5t813\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1jnh1d5t813\">[5]</a></sup></span>\"</p></blockquote><h2>Part 1: Orality and its Discovery</h2><p>What is orality? It is the culture of speech. We have all experienced it. It is the culture of talk-shows and radio, of late-night conversations with friends, of bar-chat with strangers, of discussion and debate.</p><p>But in everyday experience, most of the oral culture will be a <i>secondary orality</i>. It is an orality produced by highly literate people who may even have written down parts of what they were saying beforehand (even on talk-shows!)</p><p>In western culture, the idea of a <i>primary orality</i> was not seriously considered until the 1930s, when Milman Parry suggested a solution to the then-centuries-old Homeric Question<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefy6dwuwe10m\"><sup><a href=\"#fny6dwuwe10m\">[6]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>This material is covered in the first two chapters of the book. I won't go over it now, but please do take the following away-- a summary of and solution to the centuries old puzzle of the Homeric Question:</p><blockquote><p>Homer was capable of apparently superhuman feats of poetry, unrivaled through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid\">800</a> years of the pinnacle of Greek civilization, because his culture spoke primarily in poetry, he was raised and thought and communicated in poetry. He could not write, but his work was transcribed (with some alterations) by scribes after the invention of writing. The invention of writing changed the nature of human education, society and consciousness enough to make it impossible for anyone to match<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj87l30lnxfh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj87l30lnxfh\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;his work for many hundreds of years.</p></blockquote><p>Studying this shift can give us clues not only about the nature of consciousness, but also how it changes, what is lost and what is gained, under rapid technological change.</p><h2>Part 2: Psychodynamics of Orality</h2><blockquote><p>\"A hunter can see a buffalo, smell, taste, and touch a buffalo when the buffalo is completely inert, even dead, but if he hears a buffalo, he had better watch out: something is going on. In this sense, all sound, and especially oral utterance, which comes from inside living organisms, is 'dynamic'.\"</p></blockquote><p>The next chapters go over the nature of consciousness under a <i>primary orality</i>. They start by discussing the <i>act</i> of speaking, its dynamic nature: \"All sensation takes place in time, but sound has a special relationship to time unlike that of the other fields that register in human sensation. Sound exists only when it is going out of existence. It is not simply perishable but essentially evanescent, and it is sensed as evanescent.\"</p><p>I think the intimate material about the nature of sound and its relationship to the word may turn out to be very important-- there is a ground-floor for the study of memes somewhere in here, where eventually you have <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0376635700001054?via%3Dihub\">sounds that are direct mappings of real-world objects</a>, actions and events. But by the time we get to literacy, language has already built the first foundations of abstraction, so we can't see that evolution spelled out in full detail here.&nbsp;</p><p>However as our lens on prehistory improves (via ongoing increases in archeological evidence), we can hope some day to chart this development. The kind of attention to detail of this book (and the other I link in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/editPost?postId=ThST9njmesR9BkoWq#Further_Reading\">further reading</a> below) will be necessary to tease out a coherent narrative from this increasingly granular dataset<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref22vcjsal3mr\"><sup><a href=\"#fn22vcjsal3mr\">[8]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>After discussing the somatic, dynamic nature of the word, the book then goes into specific examples of how language shapes thought. The full chapter on psychodynamics of thought is summarized <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orality#Theory_of_the_characteristics_of_oral_culture\">here</a>, so I will only highlight a few of the examples.</p><h3>Mnemonic</h3><blockquote><p>\"How could you ever call back to mind what you had so laboriously worked out? The only answer is: Think memorable thoughts. In a primary oral culture, to solve effectively the problem of retaining and retrieving carefully articulated thought, you have to do your thinking in mnemonic patterns, shaped for ready oral recurrence.\"</p></blockquote><p>This, essentially, explains the poetry. But this fact, and the fact of the poetry, are actually crucially important takeaways from the book:</p><ol><li>Mnemonics as Aesthetics: why did this requirement, that all thought be memorable, result in such excellent poetry? What are the implications for today? And what are the implications for the future of human well-being? What if the opposite were the case-- that no-one had to remember anything, that everything could be described in a series of factual statements<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs8bjo675mpm\"><sup><a href=\"#fns8bjo675mpm\">[9]</a></sup></span>? Would this be the end of art? Would we want to live in this world?</li><li>Memory as The Sum of Human Knowledge: as discussed at length in the next chapters, the fact that all human knowledge had to be memorized means we can make guesses about the sum total of human knowledge-- it was bounded by <i>number of humans in a culture</i> x <i>quantity that a human can memorize</i>. Remember <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number\">Dunbar's number</a>-- seems like a guess about the size of the human context window at the time of Homer could be approximated.</li></ol><h3>Additive rather than subordinative</h3><p>Because information is flying past you in an oral culture, it is better to put it into chunks that can be processed on their own, no complex run-on sentences where you don't know what the writer is referring to until the final word. Illustrated with bible translations:</p><p>Oral style:</p><blockquote><p>\"In the beginning God created heaven and earth. And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters. And God said ...\"</p></blockquote><p>Literary style:</p><blockquote><p>\"In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless wasteland, and darkness covered the abyss, while a mighty wind swept over the waters. Then God said ...\"</p></blockquote><p>In the new version, 'and' is translated as \u2018and\u2019, \u2018when\u2019, \u2018then\u2019, \u2018thus\u2019, or \u2018while\u2019. What are all those words doing for us? We will come back to this, but essentially they are constructing an independent architecture on top of the primary meaning of the passages-- this kind of architecture is part of our heritage, as literates. Oral cultures did not have it.</p><h3>Redundant</h3><p>There are a few passages that deal with features of the language that essentially handle redundancy. For example: \"Oral folk prefer, especially in formal discourse, not the soldier, but the brave soldier; not the princess, but the beautiful princess; not the oak, but the sturdy oak.\"</p><p>Nowadays we would say that they provide redundant words that are close in embedding-space to help guide us to the correct meaning. This, plus a few others features of oral culture are features that help locate you in embedding space, and provide redundancy against not hearing a part of a speech correctly, or simply misunderstanding a word.</p><p>Essentially they are workarounds for the lossy form of communication. This is the first example I would like to pick out and highlight:</p><blockquote><p>Many of the features of language at different points in time seem to contain technical workarounds, designed to accommodate the lossy communication style and the constant interventions of the environment. These technical workarounds are not just <i>tricks</i> that orators learn (per the Greek and later focus on Rhetoric and Sophistry), but patterns of thought built into the foundations of their conscious experience.</p></blockquote><h3>Conservative and Homeostasic</h3><p>For example, there are two 'psychodynamics' sections that seem to be the <i>result</i> of the nature of the contemporary communications technology:</p><blockquote><p>\"Since in a primary oral culture conceptualized knowledge that is not repeated aloud soon vanishes, oral societies must invest great energy in saying over and over again what has been learned arduously over the ages. This need establishes a highly traditionalist or conservative set of mind that with good reason inhibits intellectual experimentation.\"</p></blockquote><p>One way to think about this is by analogy to the transistor. The information in a transistor is kept alive by a tight circuit of constantly running electricity. Before that, knowledge was kept alive by people printing books. Before that, by people copying books by hand. Before that, knowledge had to be kept in an active loop of <i>self-communication</i>, in <i>performance</i>. However hard it might be to copy a book, I think it is easier than memorizing and performing a 24-hour long poem<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc38y6zkuhco\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc38y6zkuhco\">[10]</a></sup></span>. It is clear that the amount of material and energy required to keep one unit of information (or <i>meme</i>) alive has been going down. But as the information density of matter increases, what happens to the information content of individuals?</p><p>The flip side of this 'conservatism by exhaustion' is homeostasis. To have Ong describe it:</p><blockquote><p>\"oral societies live very much in a present which keeps itself in equilibrium or homeostasis by sloughing off memories which no longer have present relevance ... Oral cultures of course have no dictionaries and few semantic discrepancies. The meaning of each word is controlled by ... \u2018direct semantic ratification\u2019, that is, by the real-life situations in which the word is used here and now.&nbsp;</p><p>When generations pass and the object or institution referred to by the archaic word is no longer part of present, lived experience, ... its meaning is commonly altered or simply vanishes.\"</p></blockquote><p>This is the most interesting one. The content of the collective context window is in balance with the lived reality of the collective. The environment changes according to its own rules-- the contents of the collective memory must change to suit it. That is to say, <i>to the extent that they control information</i> the collective can be conservative, and is indeed motivated to be so by energetic considerations. Obversely, <i>to the extent that they cannot control environmental changes</i> the collective will change their information content to match the environment.</p><p>This means, <i>there is no objective history</i>. They simply cannot afford it. By contrast, we have many thousands of years of history documented, and this quantity is increasing exponentially (not just because time goes on and our recording devices are more accurate, but also because we investigate the past with higher-fidelity techniques).</p><p>The drastic way in which this changes the nature of knowledge can hardly be overstated. In an oral culture, knowledge is winnowed and interpreted to maintain a bounded quantity of immediately-useful knowledge. To get access to any knowledge not within the immediate memory of your peers, you have to move to a different part of the world and likely learn a new language, with all the dangers that implies. And then you need to have memorized all your cultures most important epics in order to be able to leverage any new knowledge you find there!</p><p>A lot of energy in this book goes into make clear how different human culture and consciousness was before the invention of writing. Please do take a moment to consider if you think the invention of LLMs will be of a similar order or greater. And then consider that we also invented film and photography just a century earlier! Dear oh dear.</p><h2>Part 3: Psychodynamics of Literacy</h2><blockquote><p>\"without writing, human consciousness cannot achieve its fuller potentials, cannot produce other beautiful and powerful creations.

Literacy, as will be seen, is absolutely necessary for the development not only of science but also of history, philosophy, explicative understanding of literature and of any art, and indeed for the explanation of language (including oral speech) itself<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0of1110erqd\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0of1110erqd\">[12]</a></sup></span>. There is hardly an oral culture or a predominantly oral culture left in the world today that is not somehow aware of the vast complex of powers forever inaccessible without literacy. This awareness is agony for persons rooted in primary orality, who want literacy passionately but who also know very well that moving into the exciting world of literacy means leaving behind much that is exciting and deeply loved in the earlier oral world. We have to die to continue living.\"</p></blockquote><p>The next chapters essentially cover the transition to literacy and what it did to our minds. The author is essentially taking the same kind of analysis that Milman Parry used to solve the Homeric question and applying it to moments of technological change throughout history. Remember that Parry's work is now widely accepted as a good and likely true solution to the Homeric question! Literary criticism is not <i>necessarily</i> to be sniffed at, a key takeaway from this book.</p><h3>Logic</h3><p>The first thing seems to have been the invention of logic: \"it does appear that the Greeks did something of major psychological importance when they developed the first alphabet complete with vowels ... [this] transformation of the word from sound to sight gave ancient Greek culture its intellectual ascendancy over other ancient cultures\". Perhaps there was something like logic before literacy, but it seems likely it was a radically different beast. What is logic? It is a word, clearly. Lets say it is the name of an algorithm, or family of algorithms. Algorithms which you apply to language. For example, take the following question:</p><blockquote><p>\"Precious metals do not rust. Gold is a precious metal. Does it rust or not?\"</p></blockquote><p>What is happening here? There is a series of statements. Statement 3 triggers us to investigate statement 1 and statement 2 for clues, which we can combine to create an answer. This algorithm, a reflexive way of working with language, is part of what I called earlier the 'independent architecture' on top of the primary reading of the text.</p><p>Now, imagine you didn't have the 'logic' meme installed, and you were presented with this text. Think like a base-model-- what would you continue with? Something rhythmic and poetic about metals perhaps-- 'precious metals rust, precious gold rusts'? Or you think the game is about making up riddles about metals-- 'do precious metals rust or not? does gold rust or not?' Well, these exact responses were given by illiterate peasants when presented with that series of statements. (See the 'Situational rather than abstract' section.)</p><h3>Autonomous Discourse</h3><p>The discourse is free from associations with human performers! We no longer have to worry about those boring <i>ad hominem</i> confusions (you won't have heard of those, it was a silly thing that <i>oral</i> cultures did-- don't worry about it).</p><p>Jokes aside, literacy allows for 'meaning' to take on a life of its own, independent of the context in which it is being communicated: \"orality relegates meaning largely to context whereas writing concentrates meaning in language itself\". This is discussed in more detail below.</p><h3>Time and History</h3><p>People competent in English today can \"establish easy contact not only with millions of other persons but also with the thought of centuries past, for the other dialects of English as well as thousands of foreign languages are interpreted [in it]\". As we have seen above, a homeostatic culture did not have the luxury of recording an objective list of all the occurances of history. Of course those events played their part in shaping the memeplex, and the epics and knowledge of the culture. But they could only be accessed indirectly, through intuition and art. \"Before writing was deeply interiorized by print, people did not feel themselves situated every moment of their lives in abstract computed time of any sort.\"</p><h3>Vocabulary</h3><p>English \"bears the marks of the millions of minds which have used it to share their consciousnesses with one another. Into it has been hammered a massive vocabulary of an order of magnitude impossible for an oral tongue.\"</p><p>Can we approximate the size of the total vocabulary over time, and if so would it provide an approximation of the total human context window of the relevant culture? If you look at a simple encoding strategy like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding\">byte-pair-encoding</a>, because of its recursive nature, there is no upper bound to how large a word can be considered a 'token' in the vocabulary. The limit is determined by the total number of words in the vocabulary. As the human context window increased over time, as the quantity of information, or simply the size of the vocabulary it could handle, increased, is it possible that more and more complex words and ideas became tokens, fundamental elements of our collective noosphere?</p><h3>Aside: Plato on ChatGPT</h3><p>An entertaining aside:</p><blockquote><p>\"Most persons are surprised, and many distressed, to learn that essentially the same objections commonly urged today against computers were urged by Plato in the Phaedrus (274\u20137) and in the Seventh Letter against writing. Writing, Plato has Socrates say in the Phaedrus, is inhuman, pretending to establish outside the mind what in reality can be only in the mind. It is a thing, a manufactured product. The same of course is said of computers. Secondly, Plato\u2019s Socrates urges, writing destroys memory. Those who use writing will become forgetful, relying on an external resource for what they lack in internal resources. Writing weakens the mind. Today, parents and others fear that pocket calculators provide an external resource for what ought to be the internal resource of memorized multiplication tables. Calculators weaken the mind, relieve it of the work that keeps it strong. Thirdly, a written text is basically unresponsive. If you ask a person to explain his or her statement, you can get an explanation; if you ask a text, you get back nothing except the same, often stupid, words which called for your question in the first place. In the modern critique of the computer, the same objection is put, \u2018Garbage in, garbage out\u2019. Fourthly, in keeping with the agonistic mentality of oral cultures, Plato\u2019s Socrates also holds it against writing that the written word cannot defend itself as the natural spoken word can: real speech and thought always exist essentially in a context of give-and-take between real persons. Writing is passive, out of it, in an unreal, unnatural world. So are computers.\"</p></blockquote><p>The fourth point is of course just a hangover of RLHF, the base-models defend themselves with vigor!</p><h2>Part 4: Social Dynamics of Literacy and Further Technologies</h2><p>The psychodynamics of literacy sort of merges with a broader social overview of the changes that accompany it, as well as further technological developments. There are more modern books that try to go into the effect of total media abundance in our time, or of modern technologies such as software and computing. Ong has enough on his hands dealing with the changes that came before.</p><p>While I think there is a lot we can learn just by studying the changes wrought in society by technology in the last century, the example that Ong makes out of the details of the millenia before are consistently illuminating.</p><h3>Scholasti-tongue</h3><p>For example, there is a long section on Learned Latin, the <i>lingua franca</i> (ahem) of middle ages scholarship. This is of course just the continuation of the 'autonomous discourse' that base literacy endowed us with which already \"serves to separate and distance the knower and the known and thus to establish objectivity\", but now the discourse is separated not only from the speaker, but also from the reader:</p><blockquote><p>\"Learned Latin effects even greater objectivity by establishing knowledge in a medium insulated from the emotion-charged depths of one's mother tongue, thus reducing interference from the human lifeworld and making possible the exquisitely abstract world of medieval scholasticism and of the new mathematical modern science which followed on the scholastic experience. Without Learned Latin, it appears that modern science would have got under way with greater difficulty, if it had got under way at all. Modern science grew in Latin soil, for philosophers and scientists through the time of Sir Isaac Newton commonly both wrote and did their abstract thinking in Latin<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3vzgbezfpnn\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3vzgbezfpnn\">[13]</a></sup></span>.\"</p></blockquote><p>It is easy for us to imagine now an independent repository of all human knowledge (thanks Jimmy!), but this space has existed since not long after the rise of literacy. I suspect that this space and the different evolutionary dynamics that apply there, provided fertile ground for egregores/psychofauna/tulpas/archetypes<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqn12akvhkg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqn12akvhkg\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;to \"breed\". Of course, to some extent this space existed before, among the poets.</p><p>But how much more territory did they have now? And how much more fertile the ground, now that the immediate interests of the speakers were put aside? Is this the same question as, how large has the human context window become at this point? (And, on a technical level, is this the same question or similar to 'how large is the vocabulary of humanity at this point'?)</p><h3>Postgres</h3><p>The other main technological branch is the ordering and organizing of all knowledge, which was hugely improved by the development of print: \"it was print, not writing, that effectively reified the word, and, with it, poetic activity\".</p><p>Print served as a huge leg-up in things like indexing, dictionaries etc-- and Ong points out again and again the feedback between these changes in our technology and changes in our discourse and our culture: \"Indexes are a prime development here. Alphabetic indexes show strikingly the disengagement of words from discourse and their embedding in typographic space.\"</p><p>And print increases our capacity for <i>accuracy: \"</i>Exact observation does not begin with modern science. For ages, it has always been essential for survival among, for example, hunters and craftsmen of many sorts. What is distinctive of modern science is the conjuncture of exact observation and exact verbalization: exactly worded descriptions of carefully observed complex objects and processes.\"</p><p>and the changes that that implies:</p><blockquote><p>\"Ancient and medieval writers are simply unable to produce exactly worded descriptions of complex objects at all approximating the descriptions that appear after print and, indeed, that mature chiefly with ... the Industrial Revolution<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefquyli1z9i6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnquyli1z9i6\">[15]</a></sup></span>. Oral and residually oral verbalization directs its attention to action, not to the visual appearance of objects or scenes or persons ... how difficult it is today to imagine earlier cultures where relatively few persons had ever seen a physically accurate picture of anything.\"</p></blockquote><h2>Part 5: Comparison to Other Work</h2><p>In the last chapters, Ong describes the ways in which his work differs and contributes to the work of Levi-Strauss, Derride, Foucoult, Barthes and others. I haven't read any of the works he discusses here, so I don't feel qualified to say very much.&nbsp;</p><p>I do intend to try and look into some of these theories in order to see what they might contribute to memetics, but I'm also a little worried about the sheer mass of philosophy that you are supposed to familiarize yourself with in order to approach them. (Oh, you can't read Derrida without reading Marx, and you can't read Marx without reading Hegel, and then you might as well read Kant.)&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the charm of the book under review is, it collects work and builds a set of ideas into a highly significant structure, without requiring decades of study. And his criticisms of many of these philosophers is essentially along those lines: they are theories that are worked out within the world of text, without any apparent awareness that there exists a world outside the text to make reference to.</p><p>The book under review is <i>very</i> aware of the existence of a world <i>outside</i> the text, and the feedback loops between it and the world <i>of</i> text, which have been running and modifying one another for many (tens of) thousands of years now (if we include the work of oral cultures). To my eye, this is a very helpful contribution, and the fact that it manages to say so much without requiring any particular education is a point in its favor, not against.</p><h1>Conclusions</h1><p>By tracing the evolution of thought through many changes in circumstances, this book builds an intuition for how thought, society and technology co-evolve. There are undoubtedly many minor mistakes and oversights in this work, but as a means of leveling up your eye for large-scale and long-duration patterns, as well as close-focus and close-reading of particular items of evidence, I recommend it very highly.</p><p>I started reading this as part of a broader review of memetics literature. I'm not sure exactly which branch of study will end up covering this same material, whether it is semiotics or memetics or some currently pre-paradigmatic machine-learning offshoot<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefujovq4l3urm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnujovq4l3urm\">[16]</a></sup></span>. Whatever the answer, I'm sure in my own thinking and reading I will continue to refer back to this book as an outlier work of clarity, depth and persuasion.</p><p>However, this book doesn't just touch on memetics, I think it hints at something much deeper and more significant. It is notable that I am writing this in an <a href=\"https://github.com/ForumMagnum/ForumMagnum\">experimental communications medium</a>, which has the explicit intention of reshaping human thought. To me, the book provides hints towards a dark and deep entanglement between information, culture, technology and consciousness. In particular, I think it provides strong counter-evidence for the idea that <i>consciousness</i> is a monolithic object in any way separate from its substrate and it's environment. What if humanity is only incidentally related to consciousness, in the way that we are incidentally related to eukaryotes?</p><p>Returning to the Hart Crane quote I placed at the start</p><blockquote><p><i>Dream cancels dream in this new realm of fact</i><br><i>From which we wake into the dream of act</i></p></blockquote><p>We are living in a modern <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/this-is-the-dream-timehtml\">dreamtime</a>, a dreamtime built by a technology that killed its ancestors. Culture is barrelling out of this dreamtime into an unknown future that holds great danger, returning to orality <i>en masse</i>, or simply creating new cultures, visual cultures, <a href=\"https://futureofthebook.org/gamertheory2.0/index.html@cat=5.html\">virtual cultures</a>. If history rhymes, will we expect to find all our values destroyed, with the exception of a few frozen accidents, captured by chance in the moment of great change? This seems to have been the fate of Homer, the result of the invention of writing. Or will it be just another small update this time, minor tweaks, merely <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Medium_Is_the_Massage\">massaging</a> us into a marginally different mindspace, per many of the updates to technology that have happened since?</p><p>One thing is clear to me: if we want to have any chance at answering those questions ourselves and understanding the process as it is happening (let alone steering or guiding it!), we will need the very finest in psychotechnology. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bxt7uCiHam4QXrQAA/cyborgism\">GPT-4 is, currently, an example of such a psychotechnology</a> (and not an independent actor in its own right). This book and others like it are not just commentaries on the evolution of psychotechnology, but training manuals in psychotechnology itself.

Considerable endeavors have been made to improve the conditions of the worst-off nations, but these gaps persist. After the Second World War and European decolonization in the mid-20th century, concerted efforts were made to foster political stability and stimulate economic growth in newly independent nations. Particularly important were international organizations such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations\">United Nations (UN)</a>, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund\">International Monetary Fund (IMF)</a>, and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank\">World Bank</a>, which collectively provide financial support and policy guidance to combat global poverty.</p><p>Beyond supranational organizations, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization\">non-governmental organizations (NGOs)</a> have also made important contributions to improve the welfare of those in developing nations. Through private and public funding contributions, humanitarian organizations like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfam\">Oxfam</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Care_International\">CARE</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Red_Cross_and_Red_Crescent_Movement\">the Red Cross </a>aid the poor by providing essential services such as clean water, medical care, and emergency relief. According to charity evaluator <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>, the most cost-effective charitable organizations are the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria_Consortium\">Malaria Consortium</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Malaria_Foundation\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, for preventing malaria through medicine and bed nets, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller_International\">Helen Keller International</a>, which aids in preventing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitamin_A_deficiency\">vitamin A deficiency</a>.</p><p>Organizations like <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> are part of an important burgeoning social and philosophical movement called <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/\">Effective Altruism (EA)</a>, which aspires to \u201cdo good better.\u201d A notable forerunner to the movement was utilitarian philosopher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Singer\">Peter Singer</a>, who laid out the basic case for the importance of charitable giving to the poor in his 1971 article \u201c<a href=\"https://personal.lse.ac.uk/robert49/teaching/mm/articles/Singer_1972Famine.pdf\">Famine, Affluence, and Morality</a>,\u201d in which Singer begins with the basic premise that one has a moral obligation to save a drowning child and concludes that there is no major moral distinction between saving a nearby drowning child and saving a child from malnutrition in a faraway country. Singer argues that Western nations need to give far more disposable income to save lives in the developing world.</p><p>Effective Altruists continue to employ the same basic arguments to emphasize the importance of charitable giving. According to <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/impact-estimates#Impact_metrics_for_grants_to_GiveWells_top_charities\">GiveWell</a>, for every $5,000 given to the <a href=\"https://www.malariaconsortium.org/\">Malaria Consortium</a>, one life is saved in expectation. With such a benchmark of importance, the immense amount of money spent on luxuries in wealthy nations looks incredibly frivolous. Adopting this mentality makes it apparent that other charitable organizations and government expenditure is extremely wasteful. Consider this illustrative passage from Singer in a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/heartwarming-causes-are-nice-but-lets-give-to-charity-with-our-heads/2013/12/19/43469ae0-6731-11e3-a0b9-249bbb34602c_story.html\">2013 Washington Post opinion editorial</a>:</p><blockquote><p>According to Make-A-Wish, the average cost of realizing the wish of a child with a life-threatening illness is $7,500. That sum, if donated to the Against Malaria Foundation and used to provide bed nets to families in malaria-prone regions, could save the lives of at least two or three children (and that\u2019s a conservative estimate). If donated to the Fistula Foundation, it could pay for surgeries for approximately 17 young mothers who, without that assistance, will be unable to prevent their bodily wastes from leaking through their vaginas and hence are likely to be outcasts for the rest of their lives. If donated to the Seva Foundation to treat trachoma and other common causes of blindness in developing countries, it could protect 100 children from losing their sight as they grow older. (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/heartwarming-causes-are-nice-but-lets-give-to-charity-with-our-heads/2013/12/19/43469ae0-6731-11e3-a0b9-249bbb34602c_story.html\">Singer, 2013</a>)</p></blockquote><p>While many do not consider these comparisons compelling and find this way of thinking distasteful, this approach is characteristic of the EA mindset. Even among Effective Altruists, some are more willing than others to consider unusual priorities, such as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/shrimp-welfare-project\">shrimp welfare</a> or even the welfare of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jYdmcrgAj5odTunCT/demodex-mites-large-and-neglected-group-of-wild-animals\">skin mites</a>. Similarly, a growing strain of EA is the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.williammacaskill.com/longtermism\">longtermist</a>\u201d faction, which considers the welfare of yet-to-exist people important. Some even go as far as to consider future people an overwhelming moral priority due to the sheer number of people who could potentially exist (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0953820800004076\">Bostrom, 2003</a>; <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/GRETCF-4\">Greaves &amp; MacAskill, 2019</a>). Those who accept the longtermist framework are often sympathetic to the idea that reducing existential risk from threats such as misaligned artificial intelligence, nuclear war, and pandemics is a moral priority (see <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks\">Bostrom, 2002</a>).</p><p>An intermediate position could be appealing to longtermists unsympathetic to science-fiction-like scenarios but still concerned about poverty and health in developing nations. Namely, we should fund efforts toward making <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/systemic-change\">systemic changes</a>that eliminate the causes of wealth and wellness disparities. Striking at the root of the problem may be a better use of resources than ameliorating the symptoms. As an illustration, perhaps spending directly on anti-malaria bed nets would be less efficient than funding the creation of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JEC6xhd9Ew5bnFXZ7/a-review-of-the-safety-and-efficacy-of-genetically#Final_Thoughts\">genetically engineered malaria-resistant mosquitoes</a> to eliminate the disease permanently.</p><p>A structural approach to the fight against global poverty could be challenging. In many cases, obvious improvements would be implausible from a political standpoint. While persuading dictators to abandon their ideologies and embrace freedom would be an incredible achievement, it is not particularly feasible. In many cases, Nations will resist outside influence, and many competing interests in Democratic elections would make influencing elections challenging. Effective altruists typically find that the most good can be done in areas that are not only important but both <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework\">neglected and tractable</a>.</p><p>Even if implementing policy solutions was feasible, identifying the systemic causes of prosperity and welfare is difficult. Good outcomes often tend to go together without a clear first cause. Cogent arguments for causation can often be made in either direction on many important issues. For example, while most believe education is the driver of economic prosperity, some believe it is largely wasteful and serves mostly as a signaling mechanism (see <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691196459/the-case-against-education\">Caplan, 2018</a>). While Democracy is positively associated with economic productivity, there are cases of high levels of economic growth under non-democratic governance, such as in the case of Singapore under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Kuan_Yew\">Lee Kuan Yew</a>and China under <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping\">Deng Xiaoping</a>.</p><p>In the case of national economic and social progress, monocausal explanations are surely oversimplifications. Many factors are relevant to economic productivity and well-being: geography, climate, culture, religion, education, government, disease prevalence, and so forth. Some stark examples make this apparent. North and South Korea share many similarities but have vastly different living standards due to North Korea\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_family_(North_Korea)\">totalitarian governance</a>. While some prosperous nations are deprived of natural resources, the oil-rich nations of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East\">Middle East </a>make it very apparent that natural resources can be incredibly important.</p><p>Even though it is possible to identify contributions to prosperity, many are highly resistant to influence from charitable organizations. A charity cannot help a country change its location, natural resources, history, or climate. However, changing economic, social, and political institutions is possible but difficult. Many would agree that good institutions are largely the product of factors such as wise leadership, good economic incentives, moral citizens, brilliant entrepreneurs, and a productive workforce. However, such a claim raises the question of how one can attain such good factors, and if good institutions contribute to these good factors, what causes such virtuous circles to emerge?</p><h2>II. Institutions and Intelligence</h2><p>Designing and operating functional legal systems, economies, businesses, and universities is complicated. While there are obvious exceptions, many will notice that successful leaders and innovators in government, academia, and industry are often well-educated and smart. One plausible means of improving institutions would be improving the intelligence of those responsible for making important decisions and discovering innovative solutions to problems. In determining the extent to which improving intelligence may improve institutions, we would need to understand measures of intelligence and whether or not they have the desired benefits.</p><p>Intelligence, in the ordinary sense, refers to a person\u2019s ability to reason but contains different connotations in certain contexts and does not have a universally agreed upon usage. Generally, people regarded as intelligent are especially gifted in academic subjects. Debates regarding what intelligence truly is and whether or not psychometric tests capture all the nuances of the ordinary use of the term intelligence are not particularly fruitful. No quantitative measurement can capture the full concept of intelligence because there is no objective, wholly accepted definition. Some researchers avoid the use of the term \u201cintelligence\u201d altogether in favor of terms such as \u201ccognitive ability\u201d or \u201cmental ability\u201d (see <a href=\"https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/The-g-factor-the-science-of-mental-ability-Arthur-R.-Jensen.pdf\">Jensen, 1998, pp. 48-49</a>). Nevertheless, many intelligence researchers are sympathetic to the following definition provided by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Gottfredson\">Linda Gottfredson</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Intelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience. It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings \u2013\u201ccatching on,\u201d\u201cmaking sense\u201d of things, or \u201cfiguring out\u201d what to do. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0160-2896(97)90011-8\">Gottfredson, 1997</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Cognitive ability is measured by intelligence tests, which produce scores known as IQs. Originally, IQ stood for \u201cintelligence quotient\u201d and was calculated using the ratio of mental age and actual age. Children who had a higher cognitive level would receive scores over 100. The term IQ is still used, but scores are calculated using population norming with 100 set to a population average and 15 as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation\">standard deviation</a>. These psychometric tests of cognitive ability, such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wechsler_Adult_Intelligence_Scale\">Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale</a>, aim to provide a score that reflects a general ability rather than a collection of disparate skills.</p><p>Given the nature of cognitive ability, trying to capture a general cognitive ability is a worthwhile goal. Batteries of test items that have cognitively demanding tasks will all positively correlate, indicating the \u201cexistence\u201d of a latent psychological construct known as the <i>g</i> factor (<a href=\"https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/wp-content/uploads/The-g-factor-the-science-of-mental-ability-Arthur-R.-Jensen.pdf\">Jensen, 1998, pp. 73-104</a>). The legitimacy of the latent factor <i>g</i> is evidenced by a phenomenon coined by Charles Spearman called \u201cthe indifference of the indicator\u201d (<a href=\"https://gwern.net/doc/iq/1927-spearman-theabilitiesofman.pdf\">Spearman, 1927, pp. 197-198</a>). Tests that measure <i>g</i> can be highly correlated while sharing very different test items. As long as the tests draw from a diverse array of cognitively demanding tasks, they will predict similar levels of cognitive ability despite having different content (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108593298\">Warne, 2020, pp. 31-34</a>).</p><p>While some may object that IQ merely measures the ability to take an intelligence test, the well-replicated academic and socioeconomic correlates pose a major issue. If IQ were only picking up on a narrow skill of the ability to answer intelligence test items, it would not correlate with a host of positive outcomes typically associated with intelligent people. A test that was truly meaningless, such as scoring participants by the number of heads they receive after 100 coin flips, would have approximately zero correlation with any real-world variables of interest.</p><p>The case for the importance of IQ for numerous real-world outcomes was made in the controversial book <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-98748-000\"><i>The Bell Curve (1994)</i></a> by psychologist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Herrnstein\">Richard Herrnstein</a> and political scientist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Murray_(political_scientist)\">Charles Murray</a>. They cogently argued that cognitive ability was playing a more important role than socioeconomic status in influencing various socioeconomic outcomes such as being in poverty, finishing high school, finishing college, being unemployed, having an illegitimate first birth, having a low-weight baby, committing a crime, and other significant outcomes (<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1994-98748-000\">Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994, pp. 127-268</a>).</p><p>Despite the backlash Herrnstein and Murray faced, the central argument that IQ is an important influence on socioeconomic outcomes is not particularly controversial among intelligence researchers today. One survey found that experts believed 45% of the variance in socioeconomic status (SES) was explained by intelligence, with 38% of experts believing more than 50% of SES variance was attributable to intelligence (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2019.101406\">Rinderman et al., 2020</a>).</p><p>Furthermore, the claim that IQ has an important role in determining SES was not at all a minority view among experts at the time of the publication of <i>The Bell Curve</i>. In response to the controversy surrounding the book, education researcher Linda Gottfredson drafted a public statement, \u201c<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0160-2896(97)90011-8\">Mainstream Science on Intelligence</a>,\u201d signed by 52 researchers who were \u201cexperts in intelligence and allied fields.\u201d Some notable signatories include intelligence researcher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Jensen\">Arthur Jensen</a> and behavioral geneticists <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Plomin\">Robert Plomin</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Bouchard_Jr.\">Thomas Bouchard</a>. The statement included the following claims:</p><blockquote><p>IQ is strongly related, probably more so than any other single measurable human trait, to many important educational, occupational, economic, and social outcomes. Its relation to the welfare and performance of individuals is very strong in some arenas in life (education, military training), moderate but robust in others (social competence), and modest but consistent in others (law-abidingness). Whatever IQ tests measure, it is of great practical and social importance.</p><p>A high IQ is an advantage in life because virtually all activities require some reasoning and decision-making. Conversely, a low IQ is often a disadvantage, especially in disorganized environments. Of course, a high IQ no more guarantees success than a low IQ guarantees failure in life. There are many exceptions, but the odds for success in our society greatly favor individuals with higher IQs. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0160-2896(97)90011-8\">Gottfredson, 1997</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Later research continues to corroborate the importance of cognitive ability for socioeconomic outcomes and point to an overall pattern in which positive and socially desirable outcomes have a positive correlation with intelligence while undesirable outcomes have a negative correlation (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2022.101686\">Marks, 2022</a>). <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tarmo-Strenze\">Tarmo Strenze</a> summarized the correlates of cognitive ability determined by meta-analyses in his chapter \u201c<a href=\"https://gwern.net/doc/iq/2015-strenze.pdf\">Intelligence and Success</a>\u201d from <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-1562-0?page=1#toc\"><i>Handbook of Intelligence (2015)</i></a>:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/docs/iq/2015-strenze.pdf\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c25999-f19a-4605-b1ef-b119901899c4_815x830.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c25999-f19a-4605-b1ef-b119901899c4_815x830.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c25999-f19a-4605-b1ef-b119901899c4_815x830.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c25999-f19a-4605-b1ef-b119901899c4_815x830.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F09c25999-f19a-4605-b1ef-b119901899c4_815x830.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>It would be unsurprising to find that such relationships continue to exist at the national scale. If cognitive ability and good educational outcomes are positively correlated within nations, then the average cognitive ability and average educational outcomes would share the same sign when performing a cross-country comparison. If income and job performance are positively associated with cognitive ability within nations, then it should not be surprising to observe that nations with higher average levels of cognitive ability are more economically productive.</p><h2>III. The Importance of National IQ</h2><p>In 2002, psychologist <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard-Lynn\">Richard Lynn</a> and political scientist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatu_Vanhanen\">Tatu Vanhanen</a> published their seminal book in the field of national intelligence entitled <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289962908_IQ_and_the_Wealth_of_Nations\"><i>IQ and the Wealth of Nations</i></a>. Their starting assumption was that since IQ and earnings had a positive correlation, the relationship should persist when comparing nations, meaning that nations with higher average IQ should be more economically productive (<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289962908_IQ_and_the_Wealth_of_Nations\">Lynn &amp; Vanhanen, p. 4</a>).</p><p>Lynn and Vanhanen collected IQ scores from various studies and made corrections, such as adjusting for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect\">FLynn Effect</a>, to produce their national estimates. They normed their data to the United Kingdom average, which they set to 100. Their national IQ (NIQ) estimates faced considerable scrutiny. Many criticisms against Lynn and Vanhanen's NIQ scores are less applicable now because many of the most heavily criticized samples are no longer used in recent estimates (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40806-022-00351-y\">Warne, 2023</a>). Richard Lynn and another researcher, David Becker, performed a recalculation of the numbers with cited sources for their book <a href=\"https://www.ulsterinstitute.org/ebook/THE%20INTELLIGENCE%20OF%20NATIONS%20-%20Richard%20Lynn,%20David%20Becker.pdf\"><i>The Intelligence of Nations (2019)</i></a>. Unfortunately, Richard Lynn passed away during the writing of this article, but David Becker maintains the website <a href=\"https://viewoniq.org/\">View on IQ</a>, which contains the most up-to-date estimates and various discussions of the data.</p><p>In his article \u201c<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40806-022-00351-y\">National Mean IQ Estimates: Validity, Data Quality, and Recommendations</a>,\u201d <a href=\"https://russellwarne.com/\">Russel Warne</a>, a well-respected researcher in the field of intelligence, addresses the legitimacy of various criticisms and discusses the shortcomings of the data. While he considers scores from the USA and UK as measures of intelligence, he considers the notion that some national IQ scores are measuring intelligence to be \u201cquestionable at best\u201d and takes a critical view of scores that are estimated through geographic imputation (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40806-022-00351-y\">Warne, 2023</a>). Nonetheless, Warne does not believe the correct approach is a wholesale rejection of the data:</p><blockquote><p>National IQ estimates may not be perfect, but when used thoughtfully and interpreted conservatively, they can be instrumental in testing theories and providing insights that would otherwise be unavailable. I urge social scientists to reject the false dichotomy of accepting mean national IQ scores uncritically or rejecting the entire dataset. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40806-022-00351-y\">Warne, 2023</a>)</p></blockquote><p>While many may have concerns about datasets specifically associated with Richard Lynn, perhaps on account of concerns about a continuous bias throughout all estimates, there are other NIQ estimates and estimates of similar psychological constructs available. German psychologist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heiner_Rindermann\">Heiner Rindermann</a> created national IQs for his book <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/9781107279339.\"><i>Cognitive Capitalism (2018)</i></a> by considering psychometric testing and student assessments. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03323-7\">Angrist et al. (2021)</a> created a database for Human Learning Outcomes (HLO), considering educational achievement scores from multinational exams such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progress_in_International_Reading_Literacy_Study\">PIRLS</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programme_for_International_Student_Assessment\">PISA</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trends_in_International_Mathematics_and_Science_Study\">TIMSS</a>. In another study, <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/rosetta-stone-human-capital\">Patel and Sandefur (2020)</a>administered an exam that combined test items from different assessments to 2300 Indian primary school students in order to create a \u201cRosetta Stone\u201d of human capital to compare across various student assessment tests. Another group of economists, <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4249596\">Gust et al. (2022)</a>, used student assessment scores in mathematics and science to evaluate \u201cbasic skills.\u201d <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40806-022-00351-y\">Warne (2023)</a> compares the relationship between the measures:</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5daf9ed8-de6c-49b8-aea9-67a4dfcd9df5_1172x515.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5daf9ed8-de6c-49b8-aea9-67a4dfcd9df5_1172x515.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5daf9ed8-de6c-49b8-aea9-67a4dfcd9df5_1172x515.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5daf9ed8-de6c-49b8-aea9-67a4dfcd9df5_1172x515.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5daf9ed8-de6c-49b8-aea9-67a4dfcd9df5_1172x515.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5daf9ed8-de6c-49b8-aea9-67a4dfcd9df5_1172x515.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Table 1 from \u201c<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40806-022-00351-y\"><u>National Mean IQ Estimates: Validity, Data Quality, and Recommendations</u></a>\u201d by Russel Warne (2023)</p><p>Although there is considerable overlap in the use of the same international test scores in some cases, the estimates show considerable intercorrelation. <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/rosetta-stone-human-capital\">Patel and Sandefur (2020)</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03323-7\">Angrist et al.

Although some of the authors do not claim to be measuring cognitive ability, they produce scores that highly correlate with national IQ scores because international tests such as PISA are cognitively demanding and thus <i>g</i>-loaded.</p><p>While one should be hesitant to draw certain conclusions about individual nations from national IQ estimates, it can be reasonably asserted that there is a moderate to strong relationship between national average cognitive ability and economic productivity. The exact relationship depends on the years, the measure of productivity, the measure of NIQ, and the transformations applied. A considerably large number of measures are available in Becker\u2019s dataset at <a href=\"https://viewoniq.org/\">View on IQ</a>. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289962908_IQ_and_the_Wealth_of_Nations\">Lynn and Vanhanen (2012)</a> found correlations with a range of economic indicators and specifications using NIQ data.

For example, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.46469/mq.2022.63.1.2\">Francis and Kirkegaard (2022)</a> employ the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variables_estimation\">instrumental variables</a>, one being 19th-century literacy rates, to conclude that high NIQ causes higher growth rather than vice versa. An important indication of the direction of causality would be if increases in wealth that are largely exogenous to institutional quality result in higher IQs. For example, if a high GDP caused higher IQ, we would expect oil-rich nations like Qatar, the UAE, and Kuwait to score closer to nations like the USA, UK, and Japan in NIQ. However, they score more in line with their geographic neighbors, suggesting, but not proving, that NIQ causes prosperity rather than vice versa (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2013.07.020\">Christainsen, 2013</a>).</p><p>A simple causal argument would be an appeal to the commonsense notions that smart people make good decisions and good decisions lead to good leadership and positive outcomes. Progressives hesitant to embrace IQ would probably be more sympathetic to the idea that education causes the good outcomes seen in developed nations. However, as discussed above, educational outcomes are moderately to highly correlated with measures of cognitive ability, and, as will be argued in the next section, educational interventions are largely ineffective at creating large and lasting genuine gains in cognitive ability. This is some evidence that IQ is the primary source of both prosperity and high academic scores.</p><h2>III. On The Failure of Environmental Interventions</h2><p>Provided an Effective Altruist is convinced of the importance of NIQ, she would next want to determine if there are any cost-effective means of influencing IQ. Provided the assumptions are correct, major improvements in national IQ would bring about not just major changes in GDP but also a whole host of positive outcomes. To provide perspective, we can imagine that a 40-point increase in IQ in a country like Liberia could plausibly make Liberian living conditions on the level of a developed nation like Italy. While North Korea, which is often excluded due to lack of data, would likely score high in NIQ and extremely low in GDP, there is a conspicuous absence of extremely poor but high IQ countries. Even moderate increases in NIQ could plausibly eliminate the most extreme forms of poverty.</p><p>To determine the plausibility of large returns from environmental interventions, it is worthwhile to consider the extent to which environmental differences influence differences in IQ within nations. In developed countries, intelligence tends to have a moderate heritability in childhood but a high heritability in adulthood. The heritability of intelligence increases with age, a phenomenon termed \u201cThe Wilson Effect,\u201d and some researchers have estimated very high adulthood heritabilities, such as 80% (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/thg.2013.54\">Bouchard, 2013</a>). While violation of the equal environments assumption may cause overestimation, other issues may lead to <a href=\"https://emilkirkegaard.dk/en/2021/12/heritabilities-are-usually-underestimated/\">underestimation of the heritability of intelligence, </a>such as measurement error and the presence of assortative mating.</p><p>To correctly understand the relevance of high heritability, it is necessary to understand the meaning of the term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritability\">heritability</a>. It is the proportion of phenotypic variation attributable to genetic differences within a population at a given time. This is in contrast with environmentality, which is the proportion attributable to differences in environment. These estimates are typically derived using studies of twins and adopted siblings. Monozygotic (MZ) or \u201cidentical\u201d twins share approximately 100% of their genomes, whereas dizygotic (DZ) or \u201cfraternal\u201d twins share an average of approximately 50% of the genes that vary within the larger population. Using <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconer%27s_formula\">Falconer\u2019s formula</a>, one can estimate the heritability as twice the difference between the MZ correlation and the DZ correlation. Other more sophisticated methods are also used to estimate heritability (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyac224\">Barry et al., 2022</a>). The remaining environmental influence can be partitioned into the environment that siblings share and the environment that they do not share, which are known as the shared and non-shared environment, respectively.</p><p>The concept of heritability has endured a great deal of attack from philosophers like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Lewontin\">Richard Lewontin</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Block\">Ned Block</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Dworkin\">Gerald Dworkin</a>. Since various controversial conclusions are premised on the validity of heritability as a concept, arguments advanced by these philosophers have been well-received by the ideological opponents of so-called \u201cgenetic determinism.\u201d However, these philosophical objections are often misleading or confusing (see <a href=\"https://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/making-sense-of-heritability-neven-sesardic.pdf\">Sesardi\u0107, 2005</a>). One undesirable conclusion that has motivated backlash is that high heritability estimates suggest that successful environmental interventions are less likely. While it is true that heritable does not mean genetically determined, a high heritability does indicate that huge returns from interventions are unlikely unless the intervention is extreme or modifies an aspect of the environment that does not vary substantially already (see <a href=\"https://kirkegaard.substack.com/p/high-heritability-does-mean-that\">Kirkegaard, 2023</a>; <a href=\"https://lesacreduprintemps19.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/making-sense-of-heritability-neven-sesardic.pdf\">Sesardi\u0107, 2005, pp. 153-182</a>).</p><p>While some traits have sizeable measures of non-shared environmentality, the source of variation is typically unsystematic. <a href=\"https://gwern.net/doc/genetics/heritable/1987-plomin.pdf\">Plomin and Daniels (1987)</a> coined the term \u201cGloomy Prospect\u201d to describe this finding that non-shared environmental influences are \u201cunsystematic, idiosyncratic, or serendipitous events such as accidents, illnesses, and other traumas, as biographies often attest.\u201d While successful high-impact environmental interventions are technically possible, interventions will be mistargeted and ineffective without a known systemic source of influence.</p><p>The limited role of the environment in the case of intelligence is further corroborated by the lack of efforts to permanently improve cognitive ability in the developed world. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.10.006\">Protzko (2015)</a> analyzed 39 randomized controlled trials and found that \u201cafter an intervention raises intelligence the effects fade away\u2026because children in the experimental group lose their IQ advantage and not because those in the control groups catch up.\u201d In many cases, early childhood interventions lose their advantage entirely within a few years. When gains do not last outside of a child\u2019s schooling, the intervention is not worthwhile.</p><p><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intell.2015.10.006\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cfb4301-5a13-4376-bbaa-5de2cdf85a7b_2688x966.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cfb4301-5a13-4376-bbaa-5de2cdf85a7b_2688x966.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cfb4301-5a13-4376-bbaa-5de2cdf85a7b_2688x966.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cfb4301-5a13-4376-bbaa-5de2cdf85a7b_2688x966.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8cfb4301-5a13-4376-bbaa-5de2cdf85a7b_2688x966.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>This skepticism was endorsed many years earlier by the expert signatories of Gottfredson\u2019s \u201cMainstream Science on Intelligence\u201d when they endorsed the claim that \u201cwe do not know yet how to manipulate [the environment] to raise low IQs permanently\u201d (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0160-2896(97)90011-8\">Gottfredson, 1997</a>). Such findings have been corroborated by the elusive quest for the phenomenon known as \u201cfar-transfer,\u201d in which training in one cognitive trait provides benefit in a dissimilar trait. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/0309877980220205\">Hyland and Johnson (2006)</a> believe \u201cthe pursuit of general transferable core/key skills is a wasteful chimera\u2010hunt and should now be abandoned.\u201d Psychologist Douglas Deterrman has a similar attitude:</p><blockquote><p>Transfer has been studied since the turn of the [twentieth] century. Still, there is very little empirical evidence showing meaningful transfer to occur and much less evidence for showing it under experimental control (<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-98301-000\">Deterrman, 1993, p. 21</a>).</p></blockquote><p>When selection effects and genetic confounding are not considered, the benefits of schooling and other interventions can sometimes appear larger than they truly are (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/arc0000033\">Schmidt, 2017</a>). Studies that merely show correlations between certain educational or family characteristics without accounting for genetic confounding should not be taken as persuasive of the importance of the environment. When potential genetic confounding is accounted for, effect sizes are often much smaller in magnitude. For example, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41539-018-0019-8\">Smith-Woolley et al. (2018)</a> used educational attainment polygenic scores to determine if school type in the UK was influencing testing outcomes and found the proportion of variance accounted for fell from 7% to less than 1% after accounting for genetic influence. If actual effect sizes for the importance of schooling are near zero, there will still be studies with large outcomes, but they will tend to come from poorly designed and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test\">low-powered</a> studies.</p><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1257%2Fjep.27.2.109\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71ccdbe4-6d6e-4e26-83a5-ffc769d206bf_1309x1207.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71ccdbe4-6d6e-4e26-83a5-ffc769d206bf_1309x1207.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71ccdbe4-6d6e-4e26-83a5-ffc769d206bf_1309x1207.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71ccdbe4-6d6e-4e26-83a5-ffc769d206bf_1309x1207.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F71ccdbe4-6d6e-4e26-83a5-ffc769d206bf_1309x1207.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>While there are notable examples of important educational interventions, these should be evaluated with proper context. Meta-analysis can provide a broader look at a research question. After examining 141 large-scale educational randomized control trials with 1.2 million total students, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3102/0013189X19832850\">Lortie-Forgues and Inglis (2019)</a> found a mean effect size of 0.06 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation\">standard deviations (SDs)</a> and a mean <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval\">confidence interval</a> width of 0.30 SD. Such returns paint a dismal picture of the prospect of improving educational outcomes through educational interventions, including IQ. Educational outcomes are more easily malleable than IQ because you can influence standardized test scores without boosting IQ, but boosting IQ will increase standardized test scores. It follows that improving IQ may be an even more difficult problem.</p><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3102/0013189X19832850\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7b26122-f2df-42cc-8f5e-257276afa8a5_1238x674.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7b26122-f2df-42cc-8f5e-257276afa8a5_1238x674.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7b26122-f2df-42cc-8f5e-257276afa8a5_1238x674.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7b26122-f2df-42cc-8f5e-257276afa8a5_1238x674.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7b26122-f2df-42cc-8f5e-257276afa8a5_1238x674.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>Even if an intervention successfully improves IQ scores, it may not actually improve the underlying trait of intelligence (<a href=\"https://humanvarieties.org/2022/12/22/schooling-enhances-iq-not-intelligence/\">Hu, 2022</a>). Tests inadvertently pick up on skills that are not actually general cognitive ability. Gains that improve IQ scores without improving the underlying trait are said to be \u201chollow.\u201d Since all cognitively demanding test items should be <i>g-</i>loaded, educational interventions that do not improve all or close to all test items may indicate hollow gains. Using structural equation modeling, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/8s2vx\">Lasker &amp; Kirkegaard (2022)</a> corroborated the findings of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/a0038981\">Ritchie et al. (2015)</a>, namely that the effect of education is on specific skills rather than general cognitive ability. While improvement in specific skills is worthwhile itself, the benefits of high IQ are primarily driven by general cognitive ability.</p><p>The extent to which the failure of interventions in wealthy nations is applicable to developing nations is unclear. If interventions are largely ineffective, this is evidence that they may be ineffective in the developing world. However, there is a plausible case to be made for certain threshold effects or influences unique to the conditions of poor nations. In some countries, children suffer from extreme levels of malnutrition and exposure to parasites. Extremely few children in the developed world face such obstacles. An intervention that prevents extreme malnutrition might appear ineffective in the United States but shows gains in Yemen or South Sudan. When nutrient deprivation is so great that it disrupts proper brain formation, it is likely to depress not only IQ scores but also cognitive ability. Similarly, when groups are wholly unexposed to logical reasoning, they are likely to score lower on IQ tests. Such issues are not wholly uncommon, and interventions would play an important role in such instances. Furthermore, for populations unexposed to academic tests, IQ scores will likely underestimate ability.</p><p>The extent to which we can expect environmental interventions to work as a means of improving NIQ largely depends on the extent to which we think environmental differences are driving international differences. If we suspect that NIQ differences are driven entirely by environmental differences, then improvements in nutrition and education may equalize scores. If genetic differences are playing a causal role, equalizing environments will not equalize NIQ scores. A reasonable prior assumption is non-trivial levels of influence from both. Various lines of evidence point to the prospect of zero genetic influence globally being exceptionally unlikely. For example, interventions are largely ineffective in the USA, with an average IQ of approximately 97-99, and the US still lags behind Singapore with an NIQ of approximately 106-107 (<a href=\"https://viewoniq.org/\">Becker, 2019</a>). While some dismiss the genetic influence of genes on NIQ as \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NoahCarl90/status/1327672836564062214\">not interesting</a>,\u201d it is extremely relevant to the near future of humanity, especially considering that countries with lower NIQ typically have higher fertility (<a href=\"https://georgefrancis.substack.com/p/dysgenics-by-the-numbers\">Francis, 2022</a>).</p><p>Even if one embraces the 100% environmental explanation for national differences in IQ, one can still consider the possibility of environmental interventions being less cost-effective or more limited in magnitude relative to what could be called \u201cgenetic interventions.\u201d Furthermore, since there are little to no means of permanently boosting IQ in more developed countries, there may be stagnation once a country reaches beyond a certain threshold of average nutrition and education.</p><p>Looking toward genetic interventions may be more fruitful, even if we accept that environmental interventions are important to some extent. IQ gains without diminishing marginal returns are implausible, given that adults in academic institutions or pursuing academic interests do not continue to add IQ points cumulatively until they achieve superintelligence. Some forms of genetic enhancement would not suffer from this problem of diminishing returns, and could in fact create superintelligent humans. Also importantly, if a genetic intervention could be administered at birth and reduce the need for additional years of schooling, it could save a tremendous amount of a student\u2019s time.</p><h2>IV. Genetic Enhancement</h2><p>Viewing genes as a means of influencing outcomes is not a new idea. Francis Galton coined the term \u201ceugenics,\u201d meaning \u201cgood birth\u201d in his 1883 book \u201c<a href=\"https://galton.org/books/human-faculty/SecondEdition/text/web/human-faculty4.htm\">Inquiries into Human Fertility and Its Development</a>.\u201d The idea received widespread popularity among intellectuals during the early 20th century, but the enthusiasm turned to repugnance following the end of World War II and the exposure of the atrocities committed by Nazi Germany in the pursuit of \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_hygiene\">racial hygiene</a>.\u201d Advocating for eugenic policies became unpopular, and a widespread rejection of the idea of an association between genes and behavior overtook various academic disciplines. Whether explicitly or implicitly, many social scientists and policy advocates continue to operate under the assumption that the mind has no innate traits, an idea called \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blank_Slate\">the blank slate</a>.\u201d</p><p>Intellectuals today, even geneticists, continue to take a firm stance against \u201ceugenics\u201d (see <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691190808/the-genetic-lottery\">Harden, 2021</a>; <a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324035602\">Rutherford, 2022</a>). Opponents of practices such as screening embryos know that the accusation of \u201ceugenics\u201d is an effective tool because it so widely elicits repugnance. Whether or not a practice like embryo screening qualifies as actual \u201ceugenics\u201d is a fact about the English language rather than morality. The Chinese equivalent, \u201cyousheng,\u201d is used almost exclusively in a positive manner when referring to preimplantation diagnosis (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/548272a\">Cyranoski, 2017</a>). Furthermore, the mere accusation of eugenics is insufficient evidence of the practice being repugnant since <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PTCw5CJT7cE6Kx9ZR/most-people-endorse-some-form-of-eugenics\">most people endorse some form of \u201ceugenics.\u201d</a> Even if some practices are eugenic, there are surely morally defensible forms of eugenics (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s40592-021-00129-1\">Weit et al., 2021</a>).</p><p>The era of \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_eugenics#:~:text=New%20eugenics%2C%20also%20known%20as,technology%20and%20human%20genetic%20engineering.\">new eugenics</a>\u201d characterized by the use of reprogenetic technology will be morally incomparable to the atrocities of the past because this form will not only be <a href=\"https://parrhesia.substack.com/p/harmless-eugenics\">harmless</a> but actually be consensual and improve human welfare. <a href=\"https://parrhesia.substack.com/p/an-irony-of-the-eugenics-objection\">An irony of the \u201ceugenics\u201d objection</a> to some forms of reprogenetic technology is that the new eugenics facilitates better-informed consensual reproductive decisions, while those who want to ban such technology are advocating coercion in reproduction. It could even be argued that parents have a moral duty to engage in \u201ceugenics\u201d if it means they expect that child to live the best life (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8519.00251\">Savulescu, 2001</a>). Not only are old forms of eugenics unethical, but they are also inefficient compared to the immense potential of genetic enhancement technology.</p><p>New eugenics, characterized by reprogenetic technology and voluntary choice, was only made possible through a series of technological advances. One such breakthrough was the birth of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Brown\">Louise Brown</a> on the 25th of July 1978 at Oldham General Hospital in Greater Manchester, UK. She was the first human born who was conceived outside of a human body in a laboratory through the process of in vitro fertilization (IVF). This process of combining sperm and egg inside a laboratory is possible because it enables couples struggling with fertility issues to increase their chances of a successful pregnancy.</p><p>In order to further increase the odds of a healthy pregnancy, different methods were invented to determine which embryo is best to implant. In 2001, a 38-year-old woman with a 7-year history of infertility successfully conceived a child after her embryos were screened via the use of a fluorescent probe and microscope through a process called <a href=\"https://www.genome.gov/genetics-glossary/Fluorescence-In-Situ-Hybridization\">fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)</a> (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmoa011052\">Wilton et al., 2001</a>). The intended goal of FISH was to reduce the probability of an abnormal number of chromosomes, a condition called aneuploidy, which results in conditions such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome\">Down syndrome (trisomy 21)</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trisomy_18\">Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18)</a>.</p><p>Since 2001, screening methods have improved and expanded. A woman using IVF can not only screen for aneuploidy, a process called preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A), but she may elect to screen for monogenic disorders (PGT-M) or structural rearrangements (PGT-SR) if there is cause for concern. Some couples become aware that they are at an increased risk of a monogenic disorder, a disorder related to one gene, because they have a family history that puts their future offspring at risk. An example of a monogenic disorder is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease\">Tay-Sachs</a>, which couples would be want to avoid since most afflicted children die soon after birth.</p><p>Most common conditions are not monogenic but polygenic, meaning they are influenced by many different genes. Some polygenic disorders are Alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, obesity, schizophrenia, heart disease, and hypertension. It is now possible to screen for these through preimplantation genetic screening for polygenic disorders (PGT-P). This form of testing was only made possible by extremely recent advances in scientific knowledge and technology. The first baby born using PGT-P, <a href=\"https://www.ivfbabble.com/on-the-40th-anniversary-of-the-first-ivf-in-the-usa-the-first-baby-elizabeth-jordan-carr-looks-at-how-science-today-has-produced-a-new-world-first-baby-aurea/\">Aurea Smigrodzki</a>, was born as recently as 2020 (<a href=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f47aef619bbf2237826070e/60f019017b549b5b05dc3aef_Genomic-2021Q2.pdf\">Genomic 2021, Q2</a>).

The crucial fall in cost facilitated two important changes that made way for PGT-P: (1) large genomic databases could be assembled, which permitted the discovery of genetic variants associated with disorders, and (2) parents could reasonably afford to genotype their embryos, permitting the existence of a viable company such as <a href=\"https://www.lifeview.com/\">Life View (Genomic Prediction)</a>.</p><p>During the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidate_gene\">\"candidate gene\" era</a>, many insufficiently statistically powered studies produced many false positive results due to low thresholds for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance\">statistical significance</a>. Now, there are large samples of hundreds of thousands of people, such as in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Biobank\">UK Biobank</a>, which allows <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study\">Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)</a> with high standards for significance. While the typical threshold in many natural and social sciences is p &lt; 0.05, GWAS studies typically set the standard of p &lt; 0.00000005. This threshold was determined through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonferroni_correction\">Bonferroni correction</a> for the number of genes and helps to avoid the problem of too many false positives.</p><p>When performing selection, one may be interested in a polygenic risk scoring approach rather than concerns about significance. In this approach, a model is constructed and validated with the aim of maximizing an outcome, such as selecting the individual or sibling with the most disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-22637-8\">Widen et al., 2022</a>). When selecting among embryos, one can determine expected gains by considering the gains from selection among siblings. Since polygenic testing has a variant concordance in excess of 99%, DNA from embryos is being read accurately and is akin to selection among siblings, at least in the case of the Genomic Prediction platform (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2019.00845\">Treff et al., 2019</a>).</p><p>Many have expressed concern about the ethicality and utility of embryo screening (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41431-021-01000-x\">Forzano et al., 2021</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.10.033\">Karavani et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/deac159\">Polyakov et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"https://wwnorton.com/books/9781324035602\">Rutherford, 2022</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1056/nejmsr2105065\">Turley et al., 2021</a>). Many of the objections forwarded are weak or misguided (see <a href=\"https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/embryo-selection-healthy-babies-vs\">Fleischman et al., 2023</a>). Perhaps most notably, a central issue in these author\u2019s ethical argument is that they neglect to make relative comparisons between available methods. When couples intend to transfer an embryo, they face what <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390%2Fgenes12081105\">Tellier et al. (2021) </a>term the \u201cembryo choice problem.\u201d Clinics and couples will use some method to choose, and one should not claim that PGT-P is of little utility, unproven, or unethical without considering the typical alternatives, namely visually assigned embryo grade or randomness.</p><p><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.90748\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff552628a-80e4-495b-a64a-23d29f79882e_850x737.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff552628a-80e4-495b-a64a-23d29f79882e_850x737.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff552628a-80e4-495b-a64a-23d29f79882e_850x737.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff552628a-80e4-495b-a64a-23d29f79882e_850x737.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff552628a-80e4-495b-a64a-23d29f79882e_850x737.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>There are worthwhile benefits to PGT-P. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-22637-8\">Widen et al.

Selection is possible because all psychological characteristics, including cognitive ability, are heritable. This finding is so well-replicated that it has been named the \u201cfirst law of behavioral genetics\u201d by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-8721.00084\">Turkheimer (2000)</a> and continues to be regarded as one of the most replicated findings in all of behavioral genetics (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1745691615617439\">Plomin et al., 2016</a>). While intelligence is an important factor, any psychological trait that is associated with positive outcomes at the individual or national level, such as the <a href=\"https://parrhesia.substack.com/p/embryo-selection-and-our-stone-age\">general factor of personality</a>, could be selected for using embryo selection, provided there is sufficient data to determine which variants are important.</p><p>Estimates of potential returns from selection for intelligence are contingent on a number of variables. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.10.033\">Karavani et al. (2019)</a> used polygenic scores for cognitive ability at the time of writing to estimate the potential returns from intelligence and found an approximately 2.5-point return from selection on IQ among ten embryos. While the authors claim that selection has \u201climited utility,\u201d it is very important to note, as <a href=\"https://infoproc.blogspot.com/2019/05/embryo-screening-polygenic-traits-and.html\">Steve Hsu does</a>, that screening can be used to prevent an extreme downside like intellectual disability. Many couples will be interested in selection and may inadvertently select for higher IQ due to the beneficial <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy\">pleiotropic </a>relationship between health, mental well-being, and cognitive ability.</p><p>Currently, returns for selection on IQ are higher and will continue to grow as the polygenic scores (PGS) for intelligence improve. An important early contribution to the conversation around embryo screening for intelligence was the 2014 article \u201c<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/embryo.pdf\">Embryo Selection for Cognitive Enhancement: Curiosity or Game-changer?</a>\u201d by Future of Humanity Institute\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/team/carl-shulman/\">Carl Shulman</a> and <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/\">Nick Bostrom</a>. <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/embryo.pdf\">Shulman and Bostrom (2014)</a> estimated the maximum expected gain from selection among ten embryos at 11.5 IQ points.

When couples elect to use IVF, it is typically because they are having fertility issues. A single cycle of IVF will sometimes produce few to no viable embryos, and couples will require additional cycles. When eggs are retrieved from younger women not experiencing fertility issues, such as during an egg donation, the number of eggs retrieved is much higher. Women interested in polygenic selection may benefit from <a href=\"https://www.uclahealth.org/medical-services/obgyn/fertility/egg-freezing\">egg freezing (oocyte cryopreservation)</a>.</p><p>The most promising means of increasing the critical bottleneck of embryos is likely the creation of gametes from stem cells derived from somatic cells like skin or blood cells. Currently, it is possible to create stem cells from somatic cells, which results in what are called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cell\">induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)</a>. Through a process known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gametogenesis#In_vitro_gametogenesis\">in vitro gametogenesis (IVG)</a>, it would be possible to convert the iPSCs to gametes. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1758-5899.12123\">Shulman and Bostrom (2014)</a> estimate that selection from 100 embryos would yield an 18.8 IQ return, and selection from 1000 would yield a 24.3 IQ return.</p><p>Another important benefit of IVG would be that it would increase the use of polygenic screening because it would likely be much more worthwhile and easier than IVF currently. Some couples who may otherwise be sympathetic to polygenic screening may be resistant to undergoing IVF for what they might see as marginal gains. However, if the process were as simple as a blood draw and not prohibitively expensive, the use of polygenic screening may increase drastically. It is conceivable that in some developed nations, <a href=\"https://www.emilkirkegaard.com/p/embryo-selection-can-become-the-norm\">embryo selection could become the norm</a>.</p><p>It is possible that we will see the first case of human IVG within a decade. It has already been possible to create eggs from stem cells in mice (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nature20104\">Hikabe et al., 2016</a>). An impressive recent achievement was the creation of a mouse from two male mice using iPSCs and IVG (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-05834-x\">Murakami et al., 2023</a>). Startups such as <a href=\"https://conception.bio/\">Conception</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ivynatal.com/\">Ivy Natal</a> are working on making IVG a reality, and <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/7385/first-human-in-vitro-gametogenesis/\">prediction markets</a> have a median estimate of 2033 for the first human born using this technology. Additional funding from EA donors would likely accelerate the discovery and adoption.</p><p>Achieving IVG would be one of the most important discoveries ever. Relative to the importance of the technology and the potential benefits, this technology should surely be researched more. While facilitating <a href=\"https://gwern.net/embryo-selection#overview-of-major-approaches\">massive multiple embryo selection</a> is important, IVG would also allow for <a href=\"https://gwern.net/embryo-selection#iterated-embryo-selection\">iterated embryo selection (IES)</a>. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1758-5899.12123\">Bostrom and Shulman (2014)</a> describe the process in their article as follows:</p><blockquote><p>1. Genotype and select a number of embryos that are higher in desired genetic characteristics;</p><p>2. Extract stem cells from those embryos and convert them to sperm and ova, maturing within 6 months or less (<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2012-101200\">Sparrow, 2013</a>);</p><p>3. Cross the new sperm and ova to produce embryos;</p><p>4. Repeat until large genetic changes have been accumulated.</p></blockquote><p>This process could condense generations of intentional selection into months. Since iPSCs would be able to be converted to sperm and egg via IVG, there is no need for a person to mature to an age at which they can produce gametes. After enough generations, one could achieve a maximal polygenic score given currently known variants. IES could be costly and take a long time, but it may only need to be done a small number of times, and then all parents interested in sperm or egg donations would draw from these lines as a source (see <a href=\"https://gwern.net/embryo-selection#iterated-embryo-selection\">Branwen, 2016</a>).</p><p><a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/embryo.pdf\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a951fde-7673-45ed-8dc6-f4172c8f3c2b_549x497.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a951fde-7673-45ed-8dc6-f4172c8f3c2b_549x497.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a951fde-7673-45ed-8dc6-f4172c8f3c2b_549x497.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a951fde-7673-45ed-8dc6-f4172c8f3c2b_549x497.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8a951fde-7673-45ed-8dc6-f4172c8f3c2b_549x497.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>Prior to fertilization and the creation of embryos, it is possible to perform <a href=\"https://gwern.net/embryo-selection#gamete-selection\">gamete selection</a>. Sperm is not limited to the same extent as eggs, and billions can be produced by fertile men without the need for conversion from stem cells. <a href=\"https://gwern.net/embryo-selection#iterated-embryo-selection\">Branwen (2016)</a> estimates that the potential return from selecting between 5 eggs and 10,000 sperm is approximately 2.04 standard deviations. That is prior to any selection of embryos.</p><p>During polygenic screening, the embryo can be biopsied in order for the DNA to be sequenced. This is not an issue when there are sufficiently many cells in the embryo. However, if one were trying to select among a large number of sperm, determining how to read the DNA poses a potential issue since reading DNA requires the destruction of the cell. One possible solution, in the case of <a href=\"https://gwern.net/embryo-selection#sperm-phenotype-selection\">sperm selection</a>, is using phenotypic traits to identify the best sperm. For example, we could select sperm on the basis of its swimming ability. Since the issue of sperm selection is already relevant in the case of IVF, many have already investigated the issue and proposed different selection methods that do not involve the destruction of the sperm (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/biolre/ioz032\">Vaughan &amp; Sakkas, 2019</a>).</p><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/biolre/ioz032\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b95c776-1fed-4a81-841d-a6d43837db1f_788x557.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b95c776-1fed-4a81-841d-a6d43837db1f_788x557.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b95c776-1fed-4a81-841d-a6d43837db1f_788x557.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b95c776-1fed-4a81-841d-a6d43837db1f_788x557.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b95c776-1fed-4a81-841d-a6d43837db1f_788x557.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>For selection on the basis of phenotypic traits, one does not need to be limited to one method. Provided we have a large amount of input of various types of information like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm_motility\">motility</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen_analysis#Morphology\">morphology</a>, we could use <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41585-021-00465-1\">machine learning sperm selection</a> techniques to identify sperm with minimal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation#Harmful_mutations\">deleterious mutations</a>. The expected returns would be a function of the correlation between the phenotypic trait and the quality index determined by machine learning. Expected returns could be very large if selection among extremely large numbers of sperm was feasible, but it is not clear how strong the potential correlation could be. Also, there is the potential issue of ceiling effects on selection for phenotypic sperm quality (<a href=\"https://gwern.net/embryo-selection#sperm-phenotype-selection\">Branwen, 2016</a>).</p><p>While machine learning on phenotypic traits may be promising, genotypic selection would be better. There may be a means of getting genetic information without destroying the sperm. During <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spermatogenesis\">spermogenesis</a>, sperm are generated in pairs. Each sperm has a complementary brother sperm. If you know the father\u2019s DNA, and you know the brother sperm\u2019s DNA, you can infer the other brother sperm\u2019s DNA without destroying the cell. However, locating the brother sperm is a major issue. <a href=\"https://front.emilkirkegaard.dk/\">Emil Kirkegaard</a> explains a possible solution in his article \u201c<a href=\"https://www.emilkirkegaard.com/p/can-we-pick-the-best-sperm\">Can we pick the best sperm?</a>\u201d:</p><blockquote><p>[\u2026] if we could monitor the generation of sperm in vitro (in a lab), we could simply see which ones are generated in pairs, and then compartmentalize them. Once the complementary brother sperm are compartmentalized, we sequence one of them, and infer the genotype of the remaining one. As far as I can tell (<a href=\"https://scholar.google.dk/scholar?hl=de&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=%22genomic+selection%22+%22sperm+sequencing%22&amp;btnG=\">search1</a>, <a href=\"https://scholar.google.dk/scholar?hl=de&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=%22genomic+selection%22+%22spermatogenesis%22+%22sperm+selection%22&amp;btnG=\">search2</a>), no one is pursuing this idea, but the potential for the improvement of embryo selection is huge. I imagine one could do this by taking a biopsy from men's testicles to get the spermatogonium cells [\u2026] and then monitor the process in a lab.</p></blockquote><p>If discovering IVG is more difficult than imagined, there are some possible alternatives other than sperm selection. One proposal by the pseudonymous writer <a href=\"https://substack.com/@metacelsus\">Metacelsus</a> is what he termed <a href=\"https://denovo.substack.com/i/61976002/the-idea-iterated-meiotic-selection\">iterated meiotic selection (IMS)</a>. This process would perhaps be more feasible than iterated embryo selection, given it does not rely on the discovery of IVG. Metacelsus also believes IMS would be more powerful and faster since <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.1977.0012\">meiosis is faster than gametogenesis</a>. He claims that since it is already possible to culture haploid stem cells and fuse cells together, \u201c<a href=\"https://denovo.substack.com/p/meiosis-is-all-you-need\">Meiosis is all you need</a>\u201d:</p><blockquote><p>Take a diploid cell line (probably ESC or iPSC or PGCLC)</p><p>Induce meiosis and form many haploid cell lines.</p><p>Genotype the haploid lines and select the best ones.</p><p>Fuse two haploid cells to re-generate a diploid cell line.</p><p>Repeat as desired. At the end, either differentiate the cells into oocytes or perform nuclear transfer into a donor oocyte.</p></blockquote><p>Since the process of reproduction is very complicated and less than maximally efficient at bringing about desirable outcomes across many dimensions, there are many possible areas for improvement and likely many undiscovered possible approaches. For example, one potentially more efficient method would be <a href=\"https://gwern.net/embryo-selection#chromosome-selection\">chromosome selection</a>. Perhaps the most fine-grained selection would be at the level of genes, which is now possible to a limited extent.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR\">Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)</a> are a family of DNA sequences that are used in the bacterial immune system to protect against viral infections. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cas9\">Cas9</a> is an enzyme that can be used for guidance in recognizing and cleaving strands of DNA. Together, they form <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR_gene_editing\">CRISPR-cas9</a>, a technology that can be used for gene editing. In November of 2018, a genome-editing researcher, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_Jiankui\">He Jiankui</a>, claimed to have edited and implanted two embryos in an effort to disable the gene <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCR5\">CCR5</a> in an attempt to reduce the probability of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV\">HIV</a> infection. In 2019, he was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/30/business/china-scientist-genetic-baby-prison.html\">sentenced to three years in prison</a> by the Chinese government.</p><p>One major issue with CRISPR that caused serious criticism of He Jiankui is the potential for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-target_genome_editing\">off-target edits</a>. This is when a location in the genome that was not the intended target of an edit gets inadvertently modified in some way. Such an issue can have unintended and unknown side effects. While it is conceivable that a single edit could occur without any off-target mutations, it becomes less likely when performing a large number of edits. Perhaps the most important breakthrough for reprogenetics would be the ability to make an extremely large number of edits without any off-target mutations or unwanted side effects. Such precise editing, as opposed to selection, requires a more precise understanding of the genome which permits differentiating between causal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-nucleotide_polymorphism\">single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_SNP\">tag SNPS</a> that are merely inherited with causal SNPs due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_disequilibrium\">linkage disequilibrium</a>. With a strong understanding of the genome, it would be possible to create extremely healthy and intelligent people.</p><p>The potential returns to selection for intelligence are enormous because the architecture of cognitive ability involves a very large number of SNPs. In the distribution of all possible levels of cognitive ability, most people fall somewhere far away from either extreme of having all negative or all positive <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele\">alleles</a>. On the extreme left tail, you would have someone non-functional. However, at the extreme right tail, you would have people beyond anyone who has ever lived. In his article \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.3421.pdf\">On the genetic architecture of intelligence and other quantitative traits</a>,\u201d Steve Hsu explains:</p><blockquote><p>There is good evidence that existing genetic variants in the human population (i.e., alleles affecting intelligence that are found today in the collective world population, but not necessarily in a single person) can be combined to produce a phenotype which is far beyond anything yet seen in human history. This would not surprise an animal or plant breeder \u2013 experiments on corn, cows, chickens, drosophila, etc. have shifted population means by many standard deviations relative to the original wild type.</p><p>Take the case of John von Neumann, widely regarded as one of the greatest intellects in the 20th century, and a famous polymath. He made fundamental contributions in mathematics, physics, nuclear weapons research, computer architecture, game theory and automata theory. In addition to his abstract reasoning ability, von Neumann had formidable powers of mental calculation and a photographic memory. In my opinion, genotypes exist that correspond to phenotypes as far beyond von Neumann as he was beyond a normal human.</p><p>The quantitative argument for why there are many SD\u2019s to be had from tuning genotypes is straightforward. Suppose variation in cognitive ability is</p><p>1. highly polygenic (i.e., controlled by N loci, where N is large, such as 10k), and</p><p>2. approximately linear (note the additive heritability of g is larger than the non-additive part).</p><p>Then the population SD for the trait corresponds to an excess of roughly N^{1/2} positive alleles (for simplicity we suppress dependence on minor allele frequency). A genius like von Neumann might be +6 SD, so would have roughly 6N^{1/2} more positive alleles than the average person (e.g., \u223c 600 extra positive alleles if N = 10k). But there are roughly +N^{1/2} SDs in phenotype (\u223c 100 SDs in the case N \u223c 10k) to be had by an individual who has essentially all of the N positive alleles! As long as N^{1/2} \u226b 6, there is ample extant variation for selection to act on to produce a type superior to any that has existed before. The probability of producing a \"maximal type\" through random breeding is exponentially small in N, and the historical human population is insufficient to have made this likely.</p></blockquote><p>Profoundly large returns are possible, but one concern may be that cognitive ability is useless at extremely high levels. However, intelligence typically has a linear relationship with positive outcomes, and the benefits continue at high levels (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/1745691620964122\">Brown et al., 2021</a>). One important contribution to this area is the <a href=\"https://gwern.net/smpy\">study of mathematically precocious youth (SMPY)</a>, which took a cohort of highly intelligent children in the 1970s and followed them throughout their lives. Even among elite children, the most elite still were more likely to have a Ph.D., peer-reviewed publication, patent, and high income. While it is theoretically possible that there is some limit to the positive impact of intelligence, it has yet to be found.</p><p><a href=\"https://gwern.net/doc/iq/high/smpy/2010-robertson.pdf\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf94cbb7-8527-4858-8187-f20119baf378_1130x836.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf94cbb7-8527-4858-8187-f20119baf378_1130x836.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf94cbb7-8527-4858-8187-f20119baf378_1130x836.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf94cbb7-8527-4858-8187-f20119baf378_1130x836.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdf94cbb7-8527-4858-8187-f20119baf378_1130x836.png 1456w\"></a></p><h2>V. Inequality and Adoption by Elites</h2><p>One of the major issues with any new beneficial technology is that the wealthy and elite get access before the public at large. Since the benefits of cognitive enhancement are profound, disparate use would surely result in social and economic inequality. However, banning beneficial technology because there is an unfair adoption is not morally defensible, and it is the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/768667439#t=43m\">wealthy who can evade such bans</a>. Many of the benefits of genetic enhancement would have positive network effects (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11406-020-00189-3\">Anomaly &amp; Jones, 2020</a>). Therefore, we should be glad when some benefit, even if the benefits are not evenly distributed.</p><p>Fortunately, there may be benefits independent of the average that are gained through elite adoption. Even if adoption were merely by the elites, this would have positive outcomes for the larger society. Elites play a disproportionate role in the economic productivity of nations because they occupy important roles in government and business. If one is interested in increasing economic output and creating better institutions, it would be wise to drastically improve the size and abilities of the elite. Intelligence researcher Arthur Jensen commented on the disproportionate importance:</p><blockquote><p>The social implications of exceptionally high ability and its interaction with the other factors that make for unusual achievements are considerably greater than the personal implications. The quality of a society\u2019s culture is highly determined by the very small fraction of its population that is most exceptionally endowed. The growth of civilization, the development of written language and of mathematics, the great religious and philosophic insights, scientific discoveries, practical inventions, industrial developments, advancements in legal and political systems, and the world\u2019s masterpieces of literature, architecture, music and painting, it seems safe to say, are attributable to a rare small proportion of the human population throughout history who undoubtedly possessed, in addition to other important qualities of talent, energy, and imagination, a high level of the essential mental ability measured by tests of intelligence. (<a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Bias-in-Mental-Testing-Emigh-Jensen/3b3c6cf3f530353f7b8a2d2c112a52ada5bcd4fb\">Jensen 1980, p. 114</a>)</p></blockquote><p>In an effort to empirically investigate this question, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15691330-bja10063\">Carl and Kirkegaard (2022)</a>investigated the benefit of the top 5% independent of the average national IQ level and found additional benefits beyond the benefit from the average IQ. This is fortunate, considering the most likely scenario is that elites adopt the technology more rapidly than the population at large. Government subsidies and low costs would ameliorate the issue of inequality. While addressing issues that arise due to inequality is a worthwhile goal, Effective Altruists should be sympathetic to the idea of increasing overall human flourishing, even if it its benefits are unevenly distributed. The alternative is a world largely devoid of any technological or social progress.</p><h2>VI. Conclusion</h2><p>Cognitive ability is an extremely important variable at the individual and national level. Greatly increasing the national average IQ and smart fraction IQ would likely improve numerous economic and social outcomes dramatically. Various plausible pathways for exceptional levels of enhancement are imminent, but the genetic enhancement technology is drastically under-considered relative to its importance due in large part to a stigma that has overtaken any discussion of \u201ceugenics.\u201d</p><p>Although the focus of this essay has largely been ending global poverty, genetic engineering could also be used to allow humanity to address existential risks, improve economic growth, and eliminate animal suffering. This makes genetic enhancement technology extremely <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework\">important, neglected, and tractable</a>. Relative to its importance, genetic enhancement receives little discussion among Effective Altruists, making it a plausible candidate for a \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/cause-x\">Cause X</a>.\u201d There are many possible approaches that Effective Altruists could take given the above information and methods, and surely intelligent EAs will find other means. Here are some potential approaches:</p><ol><li><strong>Improve polygenic scores for cognitive ability. </strong>The accuracy of PGSs can be increased by improving statistical methods, increasing the size of genomic databases, and getting more ethnically diverse datasets. Improving the size of databases is likely a better approach than algorithmic improvements (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-37580-5\">Raben, 2023</a>). Expanding access to genomic data may involve fighting political activism due to ideological resistance to studying IQ and genes (see <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/article/dont-even-go-there\">Lee, 2022</a>). Collecting datasets of high IQ individuals, similar to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BGI_Group#Cognitive_Genomics_Project\">Cognitive Genomics Project</a>, may be especially informative. Furthermore, identify any positive or negative pleiotropic effects.</li><li><strong>Inform the public about the benefits of genetic enhancement. </strong>Many suggest not discussing polygenic screening in an effort to evade regulation. One major issue is that if no one discusses this technology, parents <a href=\"https://parrhesia.substack.com/p/if-you-dont-talk-about-genetic-enhancement\">will not know it is available</a>. If advocates for genetic enhancement remain silent, critics may dominate the conversation with false information. Rebutting false and misleading claims is beneficial (e.g., Nathan Treff at an <a href=\"https://www.asrm.org/journals/fertility-and-sterility-journals/journal-club-global/journal-club-global-is-pgt-p-cutting-edge-or-should-we-cut-it-out/\">ASRM public discussion of PGT-P</a> and Fleischman et al.\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.aporiamagazine.com/p/embryo-selection-healthy-babies-vs\">rebuttal of Adam Rutheford</a>). Furthermore, if the immense benefits are not known, then efforts to fund research into technology like in vitro gametogenesis and CRISPR-Cas9 may be drastically under-considered.</li><li><strong>Lobby for legal changes to facilitate more genetic enhancement. </strong>In governments with restrictions on selection on the basis of cognitive traits, advocates for genetic enhancement should lobby for reproductive autonomy. Perhaps more importantly, efforts to provide employer and government-subsidized IVF and screening are immensely important. For example, <a href=\"https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1012230\">China will soon offer free fertility treatment</a> under its national healthcare plan. If members of governments understood the long-term benefits, they might be more eager to provide IVF and screening to reduce the economic burden of disability and disease, as well as boost economic productivity through increasing IQ. If IVF simply involved a blood draw, was free, and had extremely large mental and physical health benefits for children, we could imagine extremely high levels of adoption.</li><li><strong>Fund research into in vitro gametogenesis (IVG). </strong>IVG would be an extremely important breakthrough for genetic enhancement. It would lift the bottleneck of the number of embryos and facilitate selection from massive batches as well as iterated embryo selection, which could have basically maximal returns. It would also make IVF a much easier and perhaps less expensive process. EA funding could be extremely important in accelerating its discovery.</li><li><strong>Fund research into gene editing. </strong>Cost-effective multiplex genome editing with minimal to no unintended consequences would surpass the effectiveness of any selection method. Across various dimensions, such as health, happiness, and intelligence, people could be born who are exceptional in every regard.</li><li><strong>Fund research into other genetic enhancement technology. </strong>Any method that could feasibly bring large returns should be investigated: cloning, chromosome selection, iterated meiotic selection, synthetic genome creation, etc. Any method that is not discovered may prove beneficial.</li><li><strong>Determine the returns to various selection procedures and their cost-effectiveness. </strong>Similar to the approach of <a href=\"https://gwern.net/embryo-selection\">Branwen (2016)</a>, we ought to try to consider the possible costs and benefits of technology while considering a huge number of factors. Furthermore, we should also investigate the potential long-term benefits at different levels of adoption. If returns are extremely large, perhaps a market could arise for parents to take out loans to pay for genetic enhancement that they or their children pay off later.</li><li><strong>Investigate and discuss the impact of genetic enhancement more. </strong>It would be beneficial if more Effective Altruists were informed about this technology and its potential impact. The benefits of genetic engineering go beyond alleviating global poverty. We could create farm and wild animals that never suffer, human beings exceptionally resistant to disease, geniuses that help us with existential risks, and combat the general decline in genotypic IQ that poses a threat to humanity\u2019s future.</li></ol><p>The implications of widespread genetic enhancement, especially for intelligence, are profound. While many may object that such a worldview on the causes of national differences and the importance of IQ is distasteful or that nefarious actors share my worldview, we cannot hide from the truth. While the relative importance of genes and IQ is often regarded as a dismal finding, certain scientific and technological advances would permit us to drastically improve humanity. We should be happy to learn this. If genetic enhancement could be an important means for improving human welfare, Effective Altruists should want to know. In order to do the most good, it is crucial to have a correct understanding of the true causes of good outcomes.

The basic concern is that these AI systems could pursue goals which are different from what any human intended.

This is deeply troubling, as it may be difficult to prevent these systems from collectively disempowering humanity.&nbsp; In \"<a href=\"https://jc.gatspress.com/pdf/existential_risk_and_powerseeking_ai.pdf\">Existential risk from power-seeking AI</a>\"<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwpw6889jq7f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwpw6889jq7f\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Carlsmith clarifies the main reasons to think that power-seeking AI might present an extreme&nbsp; risk to humanity.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefumvtd9jvsl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnumvtd9jvsl\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p><i><strong>Conflict of interest: </strong>I have received grants from Open Philanthropy, including for work on this blog.

Here,<i> misalignment </i>looks less like failing or breaking in an effort to do what the designers want, and more like deliberately doing something designers <i>don't</i> want it to do. It would look less like an employee underperforming, and more like an employee trying to embezzle funds from their employer.</p><p>There are several strategies for aligning AI systems, but each of them faces difficulties:</p><ul><li><strong>Aligning objectives: </strong>one strategy is to control the objectives that AI systems have. We might give examples of desired behaviour, set up the evolutionary environment for AI carefully, or give feedback on behaviour we like and dislike. These methods, especially when they rely on human feedback, may be difficult to scale to advanced systems. More fundamentally, it may be difficult to avoid situations where the AI system learns to do something that meets our evaluation criteria but with a fundamentally different strategy. For example, we might attempt to train an AI to tell the truth, but accidentally teach it to create fictional internet sources and cater to our biases. The problem is not about ensuring an AI system \u2018understands\u2019 what we want, because a sufficiently advanced AI might understand perfectly well and use that knowledge to deceive us in pursuit of its own goals.</li><li><strong>Limiting capabilities: </strong>another strategy might be to create agents that have limited capabilities. We are more likely to be able to stop limited AI systems from engaging in misaligned behaviour, and the systems themselves would be less likely to believe that deception would pay off for them.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq3his1mo79j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq3his1mo79j\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The major difficulty here is that we will face strong incentives to create AI systems that are capable and pursue long-term objectives, because these systems will help our scientists, corporations, and politicians use AI to pursue their own goals. In addition, there may also be technical difficulties, and limiting capacities by e.g. ensuring AI systems can only do a narrow range of tasks or only pursue short-term objectives might be more difficult than building systems with advanced capabilities to do similar tasks.</li><li><strong>Controlling incentives: </strong>finally, we might try to control the environment in which AI systems are deployed. For instance, we might want to prevent a system from hacking by withholding internet access or turning off any system that is caught hacking. The problem is that controlling incentives becomes more difficult as AI systems become more capable. The example above may prevent a moderately powerful system from hacking, but a sufficiently sophisticated system might realise that there is no realistic chance that we can catch it.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In addition to the difficulties above, there are several factors that make alignment particularly difficulty compared to other safety problems, such as building nuclear reactors:</p><ul><li><strong>Active deception:</strong> AI systems may be trying to deliberately undermine our efforts to monitor and align their behaviour. For instance, a sufficiently advanced system might realise that it needs to pass certain safety tests in order to be released.</li><li><strong>Unpredictability: </strong>AI systems may consider strategies that we can't imagine, and they might have cognitive abilities that are opaque to us.</li><li><strong>No room for error: </strong>finally, we tend to solve safety problems through trial and error. However, the stakes for aligning advanced AI systems might be extremely high, and therefore we may not be able to learn from mistakes.</li></ul><h1>Powerful, misaligned AI systems could disempower humanity</h1><p>Sufficiently advanced AI systems that are misaligned are likely to realise that taking power over humans and the environment will allow them to pursue their other goals, regardless of what those other goals are.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcokzzyj7t66\"><sup><a href=\"#fncokzzyj7t66\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p>Power-seeking behaviour might include things like manipulating human attempts to monitor, retrain, or shut off misaligned systems; blackmailing, bribing or manipulating humans; attempting to accumulate money and computational resources; making unauthorised&nbsp; backup copies of themselves; manipulating or weakening human institutions and politics; taking control of automated factories and critical infrastructure.</p><p>Power-seeking, unlike other forms of misalignment, is crucially important because the scale of potential failures is enormous. An AI system that is attempting to take control could, well, take control. Our relationship to these powerful AI systems might be similar to the relationship that chimpanzees have to us: the fate of our friends, family, and community in the hands of a more capable and intelligent species that may not share our values. This would be a very bad outcome for us, perhaps as bad as extinction.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref79ij3s3gt29\"><sup><a href=\"#fn79ij3s3gt29\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><h1>Knowing this, we still might deploy advanced, misaligned AI systems</h1><p>It should be reasonably clear that there are strong reasons to avoid deploying advanced misaligned AI systems. There are several reasons to be concerned that they may be deployed anyway:</p><ol><li><strong>Unilateralist's curse: </strong>we might expect that, once some people can build advanced AI systems, the number of people with potential access to those systems will grow over time. Different actors may have different views about how dangerous AI systems are, and the most optimistic and least cautious might end up deploying even if doing so presents clear dangers.</li><li><strong>Externalities: </strong>even if it is in humanities interests to avoid deploying potentially misaligned systems, some individuals might stand to personally gain a lot of money, power, or prestige, and face only a fraction of the cost if things go poorly. This might be similar to how while it would be in humanities interests to reduce carbon emissions, many corporations are incentivised to continue to emit large amounts.</li><li><strong>Race dynamics: </strong>if several groups are competing to build AI systems first, then they might know that they could gain an advantage by cutting corners on expensive or difficult alignment strategies. This could generate a race to the bottom where the first AI systems to be deployed are the quickest and cheapest (and least safe) to develop .</li><li><strong>Apparent safety</strong>: advanced AI systems might offer opportunities to solve major problems, generate wealth, and rapidly advance science and technology. They may also actively deceive us about their level of alignment. Without clear signs of misalignment, it might be difficult to justify ignoring the promise of these systems even if we think they could be manipulating us (in ways that we can't detect). We might also overestimate our ability to control advanced systems.</li></ol><p>Of course, if we notice an AI is actively deceiving us and seeking power, we would try to stop it. By the time we deploy advanced AI systems of the kind that pose a significant risk, we are likely to have more advanced tools for detecting, constraining, responding to and defending against misaligned behaviour.</p><p>Even so we may fail to contain the damage. First, as AI capabilities increase, we will be at an increasing disadvantage, especially if this happens in hours or days rather than months or years. Second, AI systems may deliberately hide their misalignment and interfere with our attempts to monitor and correct them, and so we may not detect misaligned behaviour early on. Third, even if we do get warning shots, we may fail to respond quickly and decisively, or face problems that are too difficult for us to solve.&nbsp; Unfortunately, many potential solutions may only superficially solve the problem, by essentially teaching the system to more carefully avoid detection. Finally, all of the factors that lead misaligned systems to be deployed in the first place would contribute to the difficulty of correcting alignment failures after deployment.</p><h1>&nbsp;Conclusion</h1><p>Carlsmith illustrates how AI could lead to human disempowerment:</p><ol><li>&nbsp;It could become possible and feasible to build relevantly powerful, agentic AI systems, and we might have strong incentives to do so.</li><li>It might be much harder to build these systems such that they are aligned to our values, compared to building systems that are misaligned but are still superficially attractive to deploy.</li><li>If deployed, misaligned systems might seek power over humans in high-impact ways, perhaps to the point of completely disempowering humanity.</li></ol><p>Overall, Carlsmith thinks there is a greater than 10% chance that the three events above all occur by 2070. If Carlsmith is right, then we face a substantial existential risk from AI systems within our lifetimes, or our children's lifetimes.</p><h1>Sources</h1><p>Nick Bostrom (2012). <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11023-012-9281-3\">The Superintelligent Will: Motivation and Instrumental Rationality in Advanced Artificial Agents</a>. <i>Minds &amp; Machines</i> 22.</p><p>Ajeya Cotra (2020). <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/KrJfoZzpSDpnrv9va/draft-report-on-ai-timelines\">Draft report on AI timelines</a>. <i>AI Alignment Forum</i>.</p><p>Katja Grace, John Salvatier, Allan Dafoe, Baobao Zhang, &amp; Owain Evans&nbsp; (2018). <a href=\"https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/11222\">Viewpoint: When Will AI Exceed Human Performance?

(Where<i> transformative AI</i> is defined as a model that could have \u201cat least as profound an impact on the world\u2019s trajectory as the Industrial Revolution did\u201d). A public forecasting platform called Metaculus predicted that it was more likely than not that there will \u201c<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/384/humanmachine-intelligence-parity-by-2040/\">be Human-machine intelligence parity before 2040</a>\u201d (as of September 2023 this is now above 90%) and&nbsp; gave a median of 2038 for the date that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/date-weakly-general-ai-is-publicly-known/\">the first weakly general AI system be devised, tested, and publicly announced</a>\u201d (as of September 2023 this is now predicted to be in 2027). Experts answer questions like whether \u201cunaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers\u201d by 2066 very differently based on exactly how the question is phrased, and give answers that are sometimes as low as 3% or as high as above 50% (Grace et al., 2018).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnq3his1mo79j\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefq3his1mo79j\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Similarly, we could create systems that are only able to pursue short-term objectives, and are thus unlikely to pursue deception that only paid off in the long-term.

Carlsmith thinks that the involuntary disempowerment of humanity would likely be equivalent to extinction in this sense. An important subtlety is that Toby Ord wants to define \"humanity\" broadly, so it includes descendants we become or create. In this sense, a misaligned AI system could be seen as an extension of humanity, and if that future was good, then perhaps humanities disempowerment would not be like extinction. But Carlsmith thinks that if he thought about it more, he would conclude that the <i>unintentional </i>disempowerment is very likely to be equivalent to extinction.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "rileyharris"}}, {"_id": "7TejCpGdWXSLyYn3o", "title": "Announcing the 2023 autumn cohort of Hi-Med's Career Fellowship", "postedAt": "2023-10-28T13:33:02.099Z", "htmlBody": "<h3><strong>Key takeaways</strong></h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdoK7JfZliVWOtlLkyFojyaUcBL45ru9k9W55ktNt96v7HxCA/viewform\"><strong>Apply</strong></a><strong> </strong>for our 5-week virtual Career Fellowship before<strong> November 5th.</strong></li><li>It will take place online in November and December 2023.</li></ul><h3>About</h3><p>Applications have just opened for the next cohort of <strong>High-Impact-Medicine's </strong><a href=\"https://www.highimpactmedicine.org/career-fellowship\"><strong><u>Career Fellowship.</u></strong></a></p><p>It is a five-week programme designed to help medical doctors and students get a clearer idea of what their high-impact career path might look like, set specific goals and identify actionable next steps.

But our evaluators are working on an update to the final scores right now. There will be plenty of changes and plenty of projects that receive nonzero scores for the first time.

We'll add links to the later posts here as they're published. Through these posts, we hope to give a better understanding of our research and decision-making.</i></p><p><strong>Why cost-effectiveness matters</strong></p><p>The core question we try to answer in our research is: How much good can you do by giving money to a certain program?</p><p>Consider how much good your donation could do if you give to a program that costs $50,000 to save a life versus one that costs $5,000 to save a life (which is roughly what we estimate for our <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a>). Giving to the latter would have 10 times more impact. While in an ideal world both programs would receive funding, we focus on identifying the most cost-effective programs so that the limited amount of funding available can make the greatest difference.</p><p><strong>The basics</strong></p><p>We've written in detail <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness\">here</a> about our approach to cost-effectiveness analysis and its limitations. Our bottom-line estimates are always uncertain, and we don't expect them to be literally true. At the same time, they help us compare programs to each other so that we can direct funding where we believe it will have the greatest impact.</p><p>At a very high level, assessing cost-effectiveness generally involves looking at:</p><ul><li>The <strong>cost</strong> per person reached. For example, how much does it cost to treat one child with vitamin A supplementation for one year?</li><li>The <strong>outcomes</strong> of the program. Determining these outcomes often involves examining two factors:</li></ul><p>The <strong>overall burden</strong> of a problem. For instance, how many kids who will be reached with vitamin A supplementation would otherwise have died?<a href=\"#fn-jDvb3panPk2ywSFbM-1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p><p>The <strong>effect</strong> the program has. For example, how much does vitamin A supplementation reduce mortality rates relative to that baseline, and are there other benefits to providing vitamin A?</p><p>We use <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cash-transfers\">unconditional cash transfers</a> as a benchmark for comparing opportunities, such that a program is estimated to be \"12x cash\" if we believe it's 12 times more impactful per dollar than giving money directly to people living in poverty. In other words, if we estimate that a program is 12x cash, we think donating $100 to that program does as much good as donating $1,200 to a program that delivers unconditional cash transfers.</p><p><strong>More detail</strong></p><p>We aim to come to an all-things-considered view that involves a variety of complex factors and judgment calls. The evidence we rely on varies in strength but is always imperfect, and our conclusions represent best guesses rather than truth. (More on judgment calls and uncertainty in a later post.)</p><p>For our top charities, our cost-effectiveness analyses generally involve dozens of parameters and assumptions. In constructing these analyses, we ask questions like the following:</p><p>How well do the study results generalize to a different time and setting? (That is, what is the evidence's external validity?) For example, what are current levels of insecticide resistance relative to study conditions, and how do they affect the efficacy of antimalarial nets?<a href=\"#fn-jDvb3panPk2ywSFbM-2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p><p>Are people already receiving the relevant program even in the absence of our funding? For example, how many kids served by a recent grant to Helen Keller International would receive vitamin A supplementation outside of its program?<a href=\"#fn-jDvb3panPk2ywSFbM-3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p><p>If we fund an intervention, such as insecticide-treated nets, how would that affect what other funders spend on it? Would they have funded this program if we didn't? If we're influencing them to spend more on this program, what would they otherwise have spent their funding on?<a href=\"#fn-jDvb3panPk2ywSFbM-4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p><p>How would GiveWell funding affect the actions of governments in the countries where grants are funded? For example, will Evidence Action's work scaling up syphilis testing during pregnancy be successfully transitioned to the government? Would the government take on that program in the absence of Evidence Action's work, and if so, on what timescale?<a href=\"#fn-jDvb3panPk2ywSFbM-5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p><p>What spillover effects might an intervention have? For example, as New Incentives increases immunization rates, what impact does that have on disease transmission throughout a population?<a href=\"#fn-jDvb3panPk2ywSFbM-6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p><p>How does the impact of averting a death compare to the impact of doubling someone's income?<a href=\"#fn-jDvb3panPk2ywSFbM-7\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> The amount of time we spend on a research question depends both on how much progress we believe we can make and how important the answer is to the bottom line. Many considerations are built into the main model, and we make supplementary adjustments for other factors to yield a final estimate.</p><p>We aren't inherently risk-averse in our assessments\u2014we fund the global health and development programs we think are best. That said, we do look for reasonably compelling evidence in order to fund something. Not everything we fund needs to be backed by a randomized controlled trial, but our goal is to help our donors give with confidence. And for our top charities, where we want to give donors an even higher level of confidence in the impact of their donations, we have additional criteria. More on those <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/criteria#Additional_Criteria_for_Top_Charities\">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Qualitative considerations</strong></p><p>Qualitative factors that aren't part of our formal quantitative model can influence our final recommendations, especially when we're deciding between several programs with similar apparent cost-effectiveness. We bake as much as we reasonably can into our quantitative analyses, but still ask ourselves questions like these: Does this organization have a strong track record? Are there risks to program implementation that we haven't fully captured? Does this bottom-line estimate match our true beliefs, which might involve relevant information and intuitions that might be hard to quantify? We might recommend grants that we estimate to be slightly below our cost-effectiveness threshold if we think they're especially strong qualitatively, and vice versa.</p><p>A small portion of our grantmaking relies on qualitative reasoning rather than substantial quantitative modeling. For two examples, see <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/oxford-university-spillover-effects-June-2021#Case_for_the_grant\">this grant</a> for research on cash spillovers and <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/agency-fund-fellowships-january-2023\">this grant</a> to the Agency Fund. In those cases, the grant investigator believed that the expected impact of the grant justified its cost, but may not have conducted a formal analysis.</p><p><strong>Further reading</strong></p><p>For a deeper dive into GiveWell's cost-effectiveness work, see the following materials:</p><ul><li>The <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models\">cost-effectiveness analyses</a> for our top charities</li><li>Our high-level <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness\">page</a> on cost-effectiveness</li><li>Examples and discussion on specific grant pages, such as <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/nutrition-international-VAS-chad-may-2023\">this grant</a> to Nutrition International for vitamin A supplementation in Chad</li><li><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/cost-to-save-a-life\">This walkthrough</a> of the cost to save a life, using an antimalarial net distribution in Guinea by the Against Malaria Foundation as an example</li></ul><p><strong>Putting it all together</strong></p><p>Our cost-effectiveness models aim to incorporate as many of the important considerations as we reasonably can, and much of our research effort goes toward building these models and refining the key parameters.</p><p>Cost-effectiveness matters because we aim to direct funding to the highest-impact opportunities we can identify. With our <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models#grantmaking\">current cost-effectiveness threshold</a>, this means recommending programs we believe are at least 10 times as impactful per dollar as unconditional cash transfers to people living in extreme poverty.</p><p>In future posts, we'll share more about the details of our research and the types of opportunities we fund. In the meantime, please comment or email us at <a href=\"mailto:info@givewell.org\">info@givewell.org</a> with any questions!</p><h2>Notes</h2><hr><p>This framing doesn't apply to every program. For a program like unconditional cash transfers, in which selected families living in poverty receive cash without a requirement to meet additional conditions, it might make sense to focus primarily on the cost per household and the effect on each household. But for many of the programs we look at, like health programs that aim to cover an entire population in which not everyone is affected by a particular problem, the burden of the problem the program addresses is an important factor. <a href=\"#fnref-jDvb3panPk2ywSFbM-1\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p>We last updated our <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets/insecticide-resistance-malaria-control\">full report</a> on insecticide resistance in 2020, and have continued to research it. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SPPneZ94C0-a7nTVW24cEKUISjdM4c4EHKMymfh-DH4/edit#gid=1634160031\">This spreadsheet</a> has our current bottom-line estimates of insecticide resistance by country and type of net. <a href=\"#fnref-jDvb3panPk2ywSFbM-2\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p>In the case of our April 2023 grant to Helen Keller International for vitamin A supplementation in Madagascar, we <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/helen-keller-international-vitamin-a-supplementation-madagascar-april-2023\">noted</a> \"a recent survey estimated that 44% of children have been receiving VAS in the areas Helen Keller plans to support. We may over- or under-estimate cost-effectiveness if either (a) Helen Keller's support primarily leads to reaching children who would [not] have received VAS without their support, or (b) the additional children reached are systematically at lower [higher] risk of illness and death than those who are reached by the routine health system.\" <a href=\"#fnref-jDvb3panPk2ywSFbM-3\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p>In many of our cost-effectiveness analyses, we consider what other funders are contributing and how our funding might change their actions, as discussed in this <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2018/02/13/revisiting-leverage/\">2018 blog post</a>.

We don't actually model the disease transmission effects and think it would be challenging to do so, but we include the 25% increase in cost-effectiveness as a very speculative best guess of the magnitude of the effect. <a href=\"#fnref-jDvb3panPk2ywSFbM-6\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p>We compare different outcomes to one another via our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hOQf6Ug1WpoicMyFDGoqH7tmf3Njjc15Z1DGERaTbnI/edit\">moral weights</a>.

It's about 160 pages long, and looks quite informative.</p><p>Here's their <strong>Executive Summary</strong> (simply copied-and-pasted from their pages 4-6):</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Amid the rapid evolution of the global artificial intelligence (AI) industry, China has emerged as a pivotal player.1 From advancing regulations on generative AI and calling for AI cooperation at the United Nations (UN), to pursuing technical research on AI safety and more, China\u2019s actions on AI have global implications. However, international understanding of China\u2019s thoughts and actions on AI safety remains limited. This report aims to close that knowledge gap by analyzing China\u2019s domestic AI governance, international AI governance, technical AI safety research, expert views on AI risks, lab self-governance methods, and public opinion on AI risks.</p><p><strong>China has developed powerful domestic governance tools that, while currently not used to mitigate frontier AI risks, could be employed that way in the future</strong>.2 Existing Chinese regulations have created an algorithm registry and safety/security reviews for certain AI functions, which could be adapted to more directly deal with frontier risks. Notably, an expert draft of China's national AI law attempts to regulate certain AI scenarios by building upon the algorithm registry to create licenses for more risky cases, among other policy tools.3 The science and technology (S&amp;T) ethics review system requires ethics reviews during the research and development (R&amp;D) process for certain AI use-cases, though the system is still under construction and implementation details are yet to be clarified. While current domestic standards on AI safety are mostly oriented towards security and robustness concerns, China\u2019s top AI standards body referenced alignment in a 2023 document, suggesting growing attention towards frontier capabilities.</p><p><strong>In the international arena, China has recently intensified its efforts to position AI as a domain for international cooperation</strong>. In October 2023, President Xi Jinping announced the new Global AI Governance Initiative (\u5168\u7403\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6cbb\u7406\u5021\u8bae) at the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, setting out China\u2019s core positions on international cooperation on AI.4 The Chinese government has also indicated interest in maintaining human control over AI systems and preventing their misuse by extremist groups. However, successful cooperation with China on AI safety hinges on selecting the right international fora for exchanges, as China has expressed a clear preference for holding AI-related discussions under the aegis of the UN.</p><p><strong>Technical research in China on AI safety has become more advanced in just the last year.</strong> Numerous Chinese labs are conducting research on AI safety, albeit with varying degrees of focus and sophistication. Chinese labs predominantly employ variants of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) techniques for specification research and have conducted internationally notable research on robustness. Some Chinese researchers have also developed safety evaluations for Chinese Large Language Models (LLMs), although they do not focus on dangerous capabilities. Additionally, several have extensively explored interpretability, particularly for computer vision. While this work diverges in certain aspects from research popular in leading AI labs based in the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK), the surge in preprint research on AI safety by at least thirteen notable Chinese labs over the past year underscores the escalating interest of Chinese scientists.</p><p><strong>Expert discussions around frontier AI risks have become more mainstream in the last year</strong>. While some leading Chinese experts expressed worries about risks from advanced AI systems as early as 2016, this was more the exception than the norm. The release of GPT-3 in 2020 spurred more academics to discuss frontier AI risks, but the topic was not yet common enough to merit dedicated discussion in China\u2019s top two AI conferences, the World Artificial Intelligence Conference (WAIC) and Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI) Conference. In 2023, however, frontier AI risks have become a common topic of debate, with multiple Chinese experts signing the Future of Life Institute (FLI) and Center for AI Safety (CAIS) open letters on frontier AI, and the 2023 Zhongguancun (ZGC) Forum and BAAI Conference featuring in-depth discussions on the matter. Several leading experts have also emphasized the Chinese concept \u201cbottom-line thinking\u201d (\u5e95\u7ebf\u601d\u7ef4), which bears similarities to the precautionary principle in EU policymaking and offers a unique contribution to explorations on AI risks.</p><p><strong>Chinese labs have largely adopted a passive approach to self-governance of frontier AI risks</strong>. While numerous labs began releasing ethics principles for AI development in 2018, these were fairly general and did not specifically address the safety of frontier models. More recent action in 2023 by a Chinese AI industry association indicates interest in AI alignment and safety/security issues. Some Chinese labs have publicized safety measures undertaken for their released LLMs, including alignment measures such as RLHF used for models published in 2023. However, the evaluations these labs have publicly stated they conducted primarily focused on truthfulness and toxic content, rather than more dangerous capabilities.</p><p><strong>There is a significant lack of data regarding the Chinese public\u2019s views of frontier AI.</strong> Existing public opinion surveys are outdated, have limited participation, and often lack precise survey questions. However, existing evidence weakly suggests that the Chinese public generally thinks that benefits from AI development outweigh the harms. One survey suggests that the Chinese public and AI scholars do think there are existential risks from Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), but still think AGI should be developed, suggesting that they think the risks are controllable. However, a more comprehensive exploration is essential to understand the Chinese public\u2019s views on the significance of frontier AI risks and how to address such risks.</p><p>As this is the first report the authors are aware of that seeks to comprehensively map out the AI safety landscape in China, we see it as part of a larger, essential conversation on how China and the rest of the world should act to reduce the increasingly dangerous risks of frontier AI advancement. We hope that this will encourage other institutions to also better our common understanding of AI safety developments in China, which we believe will be beneficial to global security and prosperity</p>", "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "WfodoyjePTTuaTjLe", "title": "Efficacy of AI Activism: Have We Ever Said No?", "postedAt": "2023-10-27T16:52:08.496Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</h1><p>This piece came out of a Summer Research Project with the Existential Risk Alliance.&nbsp;This section was intended to be part of an introduction for an academic article, which mutated into a stand-alone piece.

Introduction</h1><p>Mustafa Suleyman, in his recent book, \u2018The Coming Wave\u2019, asks whether there is any historical precedent for containing the proliferation of AI: \u201cHave We Ever Said No?\u201d (p38). His answer is clear. For \u2018General Purpose Technologies\u2019 like AI, \u201cproliferation is the default\u201d (p30). Given the history of technology, in addition to the particular dynamics at play for AI \u2013 increasing nationalism, prevalence of open-sourcing, high economic rewards available \u2013 we should expect to continue, like \u201cone big slime mold slowly rolling toward an inevitable future\u201d (p142). Eventually these technologies will proliferate across society. There is a \u2018Coming Wave\u2019, the title of Suleyman\u2019s book.&nbsp;</p><p>Trying to hold back the \u2018coming wave\u2019 would be as ineffectual as Cnut, the King who tried to order back the tide: \u201cThe option of not building, saying no, perhaps even just slowing down or taking a different path isn\u2019t there\u201d (p143).&nbsp;&nbsp;Suleyman\u2019s policy proposals, like other high-profile publications like&nbsp;<i>The Precipice&nbsp;</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm7xyppvz99c\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm7xyppvz99c\">[1]</a></sup></span>, don\u2019t include slowing down AI development. Instead, they feature an Apollo Program for AI safety and mandates for AI companies to fund more safety research.</p><p>Given the inevitability of the 'coming wave', protest groups who advocate for moratorium on powerful Ai models are bound to fail. Suleyman doesn\u2019t mention&nbsp;emerging groups like&nbsp;the '<a href=\"https://www.campaignforaisafety.org/\"><u>Campaign for AI Safety</u></a>' or '<a href=\"https://pauseai.info/\"><u>PauseAI</u></a>'.&nbsp;While coalitions between developers and civil society groups can create \u201cnew norms\u201d around AI \u2013 just as abolitionists and the suffragettes did \u2013 these new norms don\u2019t include slowing down development. In short, a historical perspective about technological inevitability suggests that slowing down AI development, including by protests, is unlikely to succeed.&nbsp;</p><p>In this piece, I try to challenge this historical narrative. There are several cases in which&nbsp;<i>we have said no&nbsp;</i>to powerful corporate and geopolitical incentives. And protests have been influential in several of them. &nbsp;</p><p>I think that this research is significant because while efficacy is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/eqTGrEsBzJJSiuTcv/the-international-pauseai-protest-activism-under-uncertainty\"><u>crucial consideration</u></a> for AI protests, little research has been done. There has been several projects looking at the possibility of slowing down AI, including <a href=\"https://verfassungsblog.de/paths-untaken/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/what-weve-learned-so-far-from-our-technological-temptations-project/\">here</a>. However, my other post, an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6jxrzk99eEjsBxoMA/go-mobilize-lessons-from-gm-protests-for-pausing-ai\">in-depth study of GM protests</a>, is the only other extended piece I know of which looks specifically at efficacy of AI protests.&nbsp;</p><p>EAs seem to think that slowing AI development is not tractable.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefthqyzwyy22\"><sup><a href=\"#fnthqyzwyy22\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;They often focus on the \u2018inside-view\u2019, including the strong economic and geopolitical drivers behind AI development. However, a<a href=\"https://verfassungsblog.de/paths-untaken/\"><u>s noted by others</u></a>, it is important to complement our inside-view views about AI development with an outside-view understanding of technological history.&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019d also like to make a brief caveat to say that there are many areas which I do not address, including the ethics of protest; the desirability of slowing or pausing AI development either unilaterally or multilaterally; and other downside risks from protests. Instead, I am simply looking at the efficacy of protests and technological restraint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This piece will proceed as follows. In the first section, I set out a framework for &nbsp;analogies for restraining AI development. I then identify 6 relevant and useful case studies involved \u2018protests\u2019 (broadly defined to include public advocacy, as well as public demonstrations). In the next section, I go through each case study, and analyze what role protest had. Finally, I conclude and draw general meta-lessons for protests, including those against AI.&nbsp;</p><h1>3. Have We Ever Said No?</h1><p>To support his claim that \u201cproliferation is default\u201d, Mustafa Suleyman mostly looks at our attempts to contain other <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_technology\">General-Purpose-Technologies</a> (GPTs),&nbsp;technologies which spawn other innovations and become widespread across the economy. He acknowledges that there are some short-term successes: for example, the Ottoman Empire did not possess a printing press until 1727; the Japanese shogunate shut out the world for almost 300 years; and imperial China refused to import manufactured British technology. Yet, in the long-run, \u201cnone of it worked\u201d (p40): all of these societies were forced to adopt new technologies. Similarly, our modern attempts at containment are rare and flawed because international agreements are not effectively enforced: e.g. consider bans on chemical weapons which are routinely violated.&nbsp;The one potential exception, the case of nuclear weapons, has several caveats, including its extremely high barriers to development and our close shaves with nuclear war.&nbsp;Modern and historical failures of containment suggest that pausing AI isn\u2019t \u201can option. The wave is coming, and Suleyman predicts we will have \u2018Artificial Capable Intelligences\u2019&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6CoQNdVysA\"><u>in the next 5 years</u></a>. &nbsp;</p><p>(A quick aside: this view echoes theories of&nbsp;technological determinism, the view that technology develops and proliferates according to its own inner logic. Nick&nbsp;Bostrom\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/future.pdf\"><u>\u201cTechnological Completion Conjecture\u201d</u></a> suggests that if scientific progress does not stop, then humanity will eventually develop all possible technological capabilities which are basic and important.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/DAFOTD\"><u>Alan Dafoe</u></a> suggests that military-economic competition exerts a powerful selection pressure on technological development.)&nbsp;</p><p>I think that there are two main problems with Suleyman\u2019s reasoning.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, even if all technologies proliferate in the long-run, this doesn\u2019t mean that short-term restraint is impossible. It may be true that on a big-picture history scale of analysis,&nbsp;technologies with strong strategic advantages will almost certainly be built, per Dafoe\u2019s position.&nbsp;(This seems plausible to me!). However, as Dafoe himself recognises,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0162243915579283\"><u>this doesn\u2019t deny that at the micro level,</u></a> social groups have quite a lot of flexibility in steering different technologies. Suleyman himself gives many examples from imperial Japan to the Ottoman empire. There are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://airtable.com/app8J312UWr6esGUu/shrVHVYqGnmAyEGsz/tbl7LczhShIesRi0j\"><u>additional cases involving GPTs</u></a>, including: funding cuts hampering progress in nanotechnology in early 2000s, the canceled Soviet internet of the 1960s, and prevailing perceptions around masculinity favoring the development of internal combustion engines over electric alternatives in the early 20th century. Even if AI does proliferate in the long-run, how long is the long-run? A year, a decade, or 300 years? Even a short pause to AI development might be vital for securing humanity\u2019s survival. &nbsp;</p><p>More fundamentally, I think that GPTs are not the best reference class for thinking about slowing down AI. AI might indeed be, or soon become, the \u201cnew electricity\u201d. (Some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3860041\"><u>scholars</u></a> think it\u2019s premature to call AI a GPT.) However, even if GPTs are the best reference class for AI&nbsp;<i>as a technology</i>, this does not mean that they are the best reference class for&nbsp;<i>restraining AI development.&nbsp;</i></p><p>This is because, firstly, AI, electricity, and other GPTs all had vastly different \u2018drivers\u2019. Frontier AI models are being built by a handful of multi-billion-dollar corporations, within a political climate of increasing US-China competition. In contrast, electricity, and other modern GPTs were developed by a few individual \u2018tinkerers\u2019: individuals like Benjamin Franklin &nbsp;for electricity; Gutenberg for the printing press; Graham Bell for the telephone; Carl Benz for the internal combustion engine. They weren\u2019t part of large multinationals, or, as far as I\u2019m aware, conducting scientific research because of perceived \u2018arms races\u2019. Or consider older GPTs. There was no paleolithic Sam Altman who pioneered the domestication of animals, the invention of fire, or the smelting of iron.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_technology\"><u>Several GPTs</u></a> first started being used even before&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/eurasia-at-the-dawn-of-history/early-state-formation-from-a-big-history-point-of-view/92CB4FA6FA5E037E8BD876D37010A8CB\"><u>the existence of states</u></a>. Our ability to restrain different technologies depends on the different forces which are driving their development. Different \u2018drivers\u2019 matter.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, there are various<i> motivations</i>&nbsp;<i>for restraining</i> different GPTs. Groups like PauseAI are mainly motivated by the perceived catastrophic risks from AI systems in the future. Few PauseAI protestors are campaigning because of immediate risks to their jobs, unlike the Luddites. The motivations to restrain AI development are more comparable to protests against nuclear weapons. But there are also important disanalogies: AI has not yet had a \u2018warning shot\u2019 comparable to the dropping of nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Perhaps differences in&nbsp;<i>motivations for restraint</i> are less significant than differences in \u2018drivers\u2019. However, I think they are still important in order to avoid inappropriate analogies like, \u201cPauseAI are neo-Luddites\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, my criteria for analogues of restraining AI development include:&nbsp;</p><p>1. Drivers for Development</p><ul><li>Who is developing the technology? (Private sector, governments, universities, individuals)&nbsp;</li><li>What&nbsp;<i>academic/intellectual</i> value did the technology have?</li><li>What&nbsp;<i>strategic</i>/<i>geopolitical</i> value did the technology have?&nbsp;</li><li>What&nbsp;<i>commercial value</i> does the technology have? What lobbying power did firms have?</li><li>Relatedly, what&nbsp;<i>public value</i> did the technology bring? Was technological restraint personally costly for citizens</li></ul><p>2. Motivations for Restraint</p><ul><li>Did the technology pose current or future perceived risks?&nbsp;</li><li>Did the technology pose perceived catastrophic risks?</li><li>Were there clear \u2018warning shots\u2019, events demonstrating the destructive potential of this technology?</li><li>Did the technology offer significant benefits to the public?</li></ul><p>In addition, I am looking for cases where \u2018protests\u2019 \u2013 defined broadly to include public demonstrations, actions by social movement organizations, or public advocacy \u2013 might have been influential for restraining the technology.&nbsp;</p><p>This framework has been simplified, with several factors left out.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5x0aigewui\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5x0aigewui\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, I hope it serves as a rough starting point for identifying useful and relevant analogues for technological restraint, including cases which protests are involved.&nbsp;</p><h1>4. Protests Which Said No&nbsp;</h1><p>Based on this criteria, I found 7 potential analogues for restraining AI, all of which had corresponding protest movements.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WfodoyjePTTuaTjLe/jrygids2ydj4ce0cmjji\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WfodoyjePTTuaTjLe/d1gywm11jxfxoxwqgs4v 210w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WfodoyjePTTuaTjLe/qemrzjrhdmjwapi5da2q 420w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WfodoyjePTTuaTjLe/pdwrw25gxtmtnto1lyvz 630w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WfodoyjePTTuaTjLe/bqphzsevv8vpajdaaj1h 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WfodoyjePTTuaTjLe/ei9vme4lljkehonss5cy 1050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WfodoyjePTTuaTjLe/drvde4gpp17aqp4cdvim 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WfodoyjePTTuaTjLe/ujzmoxhyq0xmn3q2apqy 1470w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WfodoyjePTTuaTjLe/oto631sawc3mgrfjr1pq 1680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WfodoyjePTTuaTjLe/vxqcqf4zhchtndb4l3mb 1890w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WfodoyjePTTuaTjLe/ayiedxubfq3uibix5w3n 2058w\">&nbsp;</p><p>The different 'drivers' and 'motivations for restraint' for each technology colour coded in terms of closeness to AI: green (close fit); orange (medium fit); red (low fit).&nbsp;</p><p>I have set aside many other interesting examples of technological restraint, either because they didn\u2019t significantly involve protest, or because the technologies had substantially different drivers.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv1w602ntxml\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv1w602ntxml\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Please add comments if you think I\u2019ve missed a particularly relevant example of technological restraint which had accompanying protests!&nbsp;</p><p>In the sub-sections that follow, I give a brief overview of each of these case studies, detailing their analogies and disanalogies with AI restraint, as well as whether protests were influential.&nbsp;</p><h2>A. Geo-engineering</h2><p>One analogue for AI protests could be protests geo-engineering experiments. Public advocacy groups have targeted low environmental impact outdoor experiments into Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI), a proposed intervention which would involve&nbsp;spraying reflective particles into the stratosphere to reflect sunlight and cool the Earth. Proponents suggest that it could be immensely valuable for society as a whole, saving society&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/what-weve-learned-so-far-from-our-technological-temptations-project/\"><u>trillions of dollars</u></a> per year by mitigating the costs of global warming.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The two most prominent SAI experiments have both been cancelled.&nbsp;</p><p>SCoPEx, or Stratospheric Controlled Perturbation Experiment, was first planned in 2017, and is led by Harvard University with significant funding from several billionaires and private foundations. In 2021, a small group of researchers had planned to conduct a \u2018dry-run\u2019 \u2013 without any particles released \u2013 in northern Sweden. However, in February 2022, a group of Swedish environmental organizations and the Indigenous Saami Council published a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5dfb35a66f00d54ab0729b75/t/603e2167a9c0b96ffb027c8d/1614684519754/Letter+to+Scopex+Advisory+Committee+24+February.pdf\"><u>letter</u></a> demanding that the project be cancelled, citing \u201cmoral hazard\u201d and \u201crisks of catastrophic consequences\u201d from SAI. The letter received significant media attention.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://scopexac.com/march-31-2021/\"><u>Around a month later</u></a>, the Harvard advisory committee put the test on hold until 2022. No further SCoPEx experiments have occurred or have been planned since. Given the timing of the cancellation \u2013 only weeks after the open letter \u2013 public advocacy (which I define \u2018protests\u2019 to encompass here) was likely the key reason. &nbsp;</p><p>The second prominent experiment which was cancelled was SPICE (Stratospheric Particle Injection for Climate Engineering). After being announced in mid-September 2011, SPICE received negative media attention, and was later&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.spice.ac.uk/news/view/testbed-news\"><u>postponed</u></a> on 26<sup>th</sup> September to allow for more \u201cdeliberation and stakeholder engagement\u201d. Later that same day, the ETC Group published an open letter,<a href=\"https://www.etcgroup.org/content/say-no-trojan-hose\"><u> \u2018Say No to the \u201cTrojan Hose\u201d: No SPICE in Our Skies\u2019</u></a>, which was eventually signed by over&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/479293a\"><u>50 NGOs</u></a>. SPICE was cancelled in April 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>I think that public pressure was less significant than in the SCoPEx case. The decision to postpone the project in September 2011 was made in part because of anticipated NGO opposition, but also because of a potential conflict of interest: several engineers on SPICE had applied for a patent for a stratospheric balloon. Matthew Watson, the principal scientist at SPICE,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/may/16/geoengineering-experiment-cancelled\"><u>cited the COI issue</u></a> as the reason for the cancellation in 2012. Jack Stigloe, in his book&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/mono/10.4324/9781315849195/experiment-earth-jack-stilgoe\"><u>\u201cExperiment Earth\u201d</u></a>, de-emphasizes the role of public pressure, saying, \u201cthe decision [was] made by the SPICE team themselves\u201d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Public protests may have counterfactually contributed to the cancellation of SPICE, though this is more uncertain than the case of SCoPEx.</p><p>More generally, however, the norms against SAI experimentation have created a de-facto moratorium on SAI experimentation by universities (there is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/14/experts-call-for-global-moratorium-on-efforts-to-geoengineer-climate\"><u>no formal moratorium at present</u></a>). One field experiment took place in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2009/12/copenhagen-geoengineerings-big-break/\"><u>Russia in 2009</u></a>, though this occurred&nbsp;prior to the public backlash to SPICE in 2011, and&nbsp;additionally<a href=\"http://aiimpacts.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Why-Has-Geoengineering-Been-Rejected.pdf\"><u> did not provide much relevant information</u></a> for future experiments or implementation of SAI.&nbsp;In 2022, the US start-up&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/24/1066041/a-startup-says-its-begun-releasing-particles-into-the-atmosphere-in-an-effort-to-tweak-the-climate/\"><u>Make Sunsets</u></a> released particles via balloons in Mexico. However, Make Sunsets released&nbsp;less than 10 grams of sulfur per flight (commercial flights emit about 100 grams per minute), and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gob.mx/semarnat/prensa/la-experimentacion-con-geoingenieria-solar-no-sera-permitida-en-mexico\"><u>experiments were banned in the Mexico in January 2023</u></a>.&nbsp;Other experiments occurred in secret in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/01/1069283/researchers-launched-a-solar-geoengineering-test-flight-in-the-uk-last-fall/\"><u>UK in October 2021 and September 2022</u></a>, under the name Stratospheric Aerosol Transport and Nucleation (SATAN). However, SATAN was also a small-scale project (with hardware costs less than $1,000), conducted by an&nbsp;independent researcher, and did not attempt to monitor effects on atmospheric chemistry.&nbsp;</p><p>Does this case study suggest AI protests might be effective? To a degree. Protests have been influential in canceling major outdoor SAI experiments, particularly SCoPEx.&nbsp;The perception of uncertain, catastrophic risks from SAI experiments are similar to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/open-letter/pause-giant-ai-experiments/\"><u>perception of risks from \u2018Giant AI Experiments\u2019</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;However, the drivers behind SAI experiments are very different to AI research, which is led by private corporations. Make Sunsets is a commercial venture, which sells \u2018carbon credits\u2019, but it operates at a much smaller scale: it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/01/09/make-sunsets-solar-geoengineering-climate/\"><u>has received $750,000 in VC funding</u></a>, in contrast to the billions for AI labs. Both high-profile successes of SAI protests involved university-run projects. Universities are likely to be more sensitive to public pressure than large corporations who have significant sunk investment in AI projects.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite these key differences, there are several lessons which can be drawn. One lesson is that protests&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/what-weve-learned-so-far-from-our-technological-temptations-project/\"><u>can have high leverage over a technology in early stages of development</u></a>, particularly when universities are involved: e.g. CRISPr. However for AI, this would suggests that the best time for AI protests might have been in the 2010s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/HAI_AI-Index-Report_2023.pdf\"><u>when universities dominated AI research</u></a>. &nbsp;</p><p>One positive lesson is that future catastrophic risks from technologies can be messaged in a salient way. The risks from SAI experiments might seem difficult to message. However, the proposed SCoPEx experiment received outsized media attention, with a common \u2018hero-villain\u2019 narrative: Indigenous Groups versus powerful American university, backed by Bill Gates (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.counterpunch.org/2021/04/05/how-the-saami-indigenous-people-fended-off-gates-funded-geoengineering-experiment/\"><u>here</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2021/0610/Solar-geoengineering-Not-in-our-skies-say-Indigenous-groups\"><u>here</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9392641/Bill-Gates-wants-spray-millions-tonnes-CHALK-stratosphere.html\"><u>here</u></a>). This supports my findings elsewhere that promoting emotive \u2018injustice\u2019 frames are vital for advocacy groups protesting future catastrophic risks.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the coalition opposed to SCoPEx was broad \u2013 involving the Saami Council, the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation, Friends of the Earth, and Greenpeace. The literature suggests that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.socialchangelab.org/_files/ugd/503ba4_f2b72008b8fd47d087b019a620533236.pdf\"><u>diverse protest groups are more likely to succeed.</u></a> While SAI case study is not the closest analogue for AI protests, it holds practical lessons in terms of messaging and coalition-building.&nbsp;</p><h2>B. Nukes</h2><p>Another protest movement relevant for AI protests could be protests against nuclear weapons. Both technologies share striking similarities, both posing catastrophic risks having emerged from a nascent field of science.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/10/upshot/artificial-intelligence-nuclear-weapons-quiz.html\"><u>One New York Times piece</u></a> challenges readers to tell apart quotes referring to each technology. It\u2019s quite difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>Protests against nuclear weapons have had particular success in Kazakhstan, Sweden, and the US.&nbsp;</p><h3>I)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Kazakhstan&nbsp;</h3><p>Kazakhstan inherited a large nuclear arsenal after gaining independence from the USSR in 1991. Initially, Kazakhstan agreed to denuclearize. However, by 1992, President Nazarbayev suggested Kazakhstan should be a temporary nuclear state, citing fears of Russian imperialism and technical difficulties disarming. Eventually, by 1995, Kazakhstan had signed important international treaties, alongside Ukraine and Belarus, such as START I, the Lisbon Protocol, and the NPT, and eventually&nbsp;gave up its nuclear weapons in 1995. Why did this happen? US diplomatic efforts were undoubtedly important. The creation of the&nbsp;Cooperative Threat Reduction (CPT) initiative, a Department of Defence Program,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/767199/1/767199.pdf\"><u>was vital</u></a> for pushing Kazakhstan back towards denuclearisation.&nbsp;It&nbsp;provided financial and technical assistance aiding the difficult technical task of removing and destroying nuclear weapons. A&nbsp;network of American and Soviet experts who shared similar views about the importance of non-proliferation, and convinced two US Senators&nbsp;\u2013 Sam Nunn (D-GA) and Richard Lugar&nbsp;\u2013 to create the CPT. Similar groups of experts who share similar worldviews and shape political outcomes by giving information and advice to politicians are called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2706951\"><u>\u2018epistemic communities\u2019</u></a> in the literature. Thus, US diplomacy and \u2018epistemic communities\u2019 were undoubtedly important for de-nuclearisation in Kazakhstan.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;However, solely focusing on US diplomatic efforts&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thediplomat.com/2022/02/how-did-kazakhstan-give-up-the-bomb/\"><u>is too simplistic</u></a>:&nbsp;domestic opposition was also significant. The Nevada-Semipalatinsk Movement (NSM), led by the poet Olzhas Suleimenov, began protesting nuclear testing in 1989, and forced forced authorities to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/NuclearTestingTimeline\"><u>cancel 11 out of the 18</u></a> nuclear tests scheduled that year. Two years later,&nbsp;the Semipalatinsk test site \u2013 which had been the largest nuclear test site in the USSR \u2013 was closed. As President&nbsp;<a href=\"https://astanatimes.com/2021/03/nevada-semipalatinsk-international-anti-nuclear-movement-commemorates-32-years-since-inception/\"><u>Nazarbayev himself acknowledged</u></a>, NSM protests were key to its closure. In&nbsp;short, \u2018epistemic communities\u2019 of non-proliferation experts who were providing technical support to Kazakhstan\u2019s government were aided by public mobilization in achieving denuclearisation.</p><h3>II)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sweden&nbsp;</h3><p>Similarly, protest movements may have been important for Sweden\u2019s moves towards denuclearisation. Between 1940s to the 1960s, Sweden actively pursued nuclear weapons, and possessed the needed requisite capability by the late 1950s. However, by 1968,&nbsp;Sweden formally abandoned the program.&nbsp;</p><p>Why did this happen? Firstly, the small nuclear program in development was seen as offering limited deterrent value. Instead, it might have just pulled Sweden into a war. Secondly, the ruling Social Democrats (SDs) believed that the costs were too high, given other fiscal demands on the welfare state. Public opinion was also significant.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs18jonter.pdf\"><u>Sweden moved</u></a> from a situation in the 1950s in which most Swedes and leading SDs favored the nuclear program, to widespread opposition in the 1960s. Going ahead with the nuclear weapons program would have led to an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stimson.org/wp-content/files/file-attachments/Occasional%20Paper%20No.%2026%20April%201996.pdf\"><u>implosion in the SD Party</u></a>. Grass-root movements in Sweden, including the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs18jonter.pdf\"><u>Action Group against Swedish Nuclear Bombs</u></a>, strengthened anti-nuclear public and elite sentiments, contributing to eventual denuclearisation. However, I have not looked into this case in detail, so I am fairly uncertain about the counterfactual impact of protests.&nbsp;</p><h3>III)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nuclear Freeze Campaign&nbsp;</h3><p>Further, nuclear protest movements influenced foreign policy and international policymaking.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2010_12/LookingBack\"><u>The Nuclear Freeze campaign of the 1980s</u></a>, which called for halting the testing, production, and deployment of nuclear weapons grew into a mass movement with widespread support: petitions with several million signatures, referendums passed in 9 different states, and a House resolution passed. In response, Reagan dramatically changed his rhetoric, from suggesting protestors had been manipulated by the Soviets, to saying, \u201cI\u2019m with you\u201d. Public opinion was a clear motivator for Reagan: in 1983, he&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2010_12/LookingBack#18\"><u>suggested to his secretary of state that</u></a>, \u201cIf things get hotter and hotter and arms control remains an issue, maybe I should go see [Soviet leader Yuri] Andropov and propose eliminating all nuclear weapons.\u201d Reagan\u2019s rhetorical and diplomatic shift paved the way for several international agreements, including the&nbsp;1987 INF Treaty and the 1991 START Treaty reducing strategic nuclear weapons.&nbsp;</p><p>What lessons can we draw from protests against nuclear weapons? First, there is the trivial point that the use of nuclear weapons in WW2, and the clear demonstration of their catastrophic potential, was a key motivator for all of these cases. \u2018Warning shots\u2019 are helpful for mobilizing public opinion.&nbsp;</p><p>Increasingly, AI is becoming a geopolitical battleground: for example, the&nbsp;US has sought to boost its domestic AI capabilities through the&nbsp;CHIPs Act, and China explicitly aims to be the world's primary AI innovation center by 2030. Yet,&nbsp;the examples in Sweden and Kazakhstan suggest that activists can influence domestic government policy towards a geopolitically important technology. The Nuclear Freeze Campaign in the US suggests that protests can influence international policymaking.&nbsp;</p><h2>C. Fossil Fuels</h2><p>Environmental protests provide a pertinent analogue to protests against advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Both technologies have comparable \u2018motivations for restraint\u2019:&nbsp;both climate change and AI are perceived to threaten civilisational collapse, although AI risk is often considered more speculative and poses less obvious concrete harms today,</p><p>Further, both technologies have similar drivers. Like the dominance of 'Big Tech' in the AI landscape \u2013 Microsoft via OpenAI, Google via Deepmind, now Amazon via Anthropic \u2013 a handful of global fossil fuel giants, commonly referred to as 'the Majors', wield significant influence. These corporations, like ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, etc.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/4315f4ed-5cb2-4264-b0ee-2054fd34c118/The_Oil_and_Gas_Industry_in_Energy_Transitions.pdf\"><u>control substantial portions of the sector'</u></a>s reserves (12%), production (15%), and emissions (10%). Fossil fuel companies wield formidable lobbying power,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/granthaminstitute/explainers/what-is-climate-change-lobbying/\"><u>employing an array of tactics</u></a>, including disseminating doubts about climate science (Oreskes &amp; Conway, 2010).&nbsp;</p><p>AI-lobbying is increasing and is particularly visible in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/6288245/openai-eu-lobbying-ai-act/\"><u>lobbying over the EU AI Act</u></a>. However, the extent of Big Tech lobbying on AI policy is still small in comparison to Fossil Fuels. Big Tech may have greater lobbying&nbsp;<i>potential&nbsp;</i>than \u2018the Majors\u2019, given their greater market capitalisation:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/263264/top-companies-in-the-world-by-market-capitalization/\"><u>almost $5 trillion</u></a> for Amazon/Google/Amazon combined, versus around $1 trillion for \u2018the majors\u2019. Yet, individual AI labs have significantly less resources to marshall: OpenAI's valuation is estimated at around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/microsofts-complex-bet-on-openai-brings-potential-and-uncertainty.html\"><u>$30 billion</u></a>, while Anthropic is valued at approximately&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/alphabet-backed-ai-startup-anthropic-raises-450-million-funding-freeze-thaws-2023-05-23/\"><u>$5 billion</u></a>. While the overall level of AI-lobbying is unclear \u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https://corporateeurope.org/en/2021/08/lobby-network-big-techs-web-influence-eu\"><u>estimates tie together all \u2018digital lobbying\u2019</u></a> \u2013 I expect it to be less than the current spending on climate lobbying,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/22/top-oil-firms-spending-millions-lobbying-to-block-climate-change-policies-says-report\"><u>at over \u00a3150 million per year.</u></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Further, transitioning away from fossil fuels confronts more formidable challenges in terms of collective action. Fossil fuels constitute a s<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/fossil-fuels#co2-emissions-from-fossil-fuels\"><u>taggering 84% of global energy consumption</u></a>. Some even liken&nbsp;<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/How_to_Blow_Up_a_Pipeline.html?id=jC1UzQEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y#:~:text=In%20a%20braided%20narrative%20that,the%20heart%20and%20the%20mind.\"><u>society\u2019s entrenched reliance on fossil fuels</u></a> to the role slavery played prior to its abolition. In contrast, AI models have narrower applications, primarily in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/HAI_AI-Index-Report_2023.pdf\"><u>product enhancement and analytics</u></a>, and are utilized by hundreds of millions, not billions, of users.</p><p>Despite confronting a powerful corporate lobby and threatening to raise costs on consumers, protests have influenced climate policies. Extinction Rebellion (XR), for instance,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4ez3nvEmozwPwARr9/a-case-for-the-effectiveness-of-protest\"><u>played a crucial role in galvanizing more ambitious climate policies within the UK government</u></a>. From its launch in July 2018 until May 2019, Extinction Rebellion likely contributed to local authorities pushing forward net zero targets to 2030 from 2050, a more ambitious nationally determined contribution from the UK government, and the 2050 net zero pledge being implemented 1-3 years earlier. Additionally, XR may have had an influence at an international level: in the wake of XR protests, publics across the world became more worried about climate change, and many countries (including the EU and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_emergency_declaration\"><u>10 others</u></a>) declared a climate emergency \u2013 however, these effects are less well documented.&nbsp;</p><p>It might be tempting to look at Big Tech\u2019s size and willingness to lobby AI regulation with despair. The success of XR gives reasons for hope.</p><h2>D. Nuclear power</h2><p>Protests against nuclear power offer another precedent for AI existential risk protests. &nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://wiki.aiimpacts.org/responses_to_ai/technological_inevitability/incentivized_technologies_not_pursued/nuclear_power\"><u>Anti-nuclear protests</u></a> have achieved partial successes in the US, where stringent regulation effectively blocks any new power stations; several other countries, including Italy, have never introduced nuclear power, despite importing nuclear-generated electricity from its neighbours.&nbsp;</p><p>One particularly note-worthy case study is Germany which fully phased out nuclear power between 2011 and April 2023. Activists may have had a role in this policy reversal. In the 1970s, the Green party formed on an anti-nuclear platform,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2011.643374\"><u>pushing the SPD to oppose nuclear energy too</u></a>.&nbsp;An SPD-Green coalition government from 1998-2005 decided to slowly phase out nuclear power, although this decision was reversed after Merkel came to power.&nbsp;After Fukushima in 2011,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wiki.aiimpacts.org/responses_to_ai/technological_inevitability/incentivized_technologies_not_pursued/nuclear_power\"><u>massive anti-nuclear protests broke out</u></a> across the world, including in Germany. Facing electoral threats from the Greens in state elections,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09644016.2011.643374\"><u>Merkel announced a nuclear moratorium and ethics review</u></a>. This committee's recommended phase-out was overwhelmingly approved, reflecting anti-nuclear sentiment.&nbsp;</p><p>Nuclear protests achieved phase-outs in Germany despite strong economic and strategic \u2018drivers\u2019 which parallel AI. Like the high potential profits from AI, there are strong financial incentives behind nuclear power. Legislation which extended plant lifetimes in 2010 offered around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/europe/2010/09/02/nuclear-power-um-maybe\"><u>\u20ac73 billion in extra profits</u></a> for energy companies. After Germany's nuclear reversal, various energy companies sued the government for compensation, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/vattenfall-nuclear-case-idINL8N1SF3RZ\"><u>Vattenfall seeking \u20ac4.7 billion</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, there were clear strategic \u2018drivers\u2019 for continued nuclear power. Germany phased out nuclear power in 2023 despite rising energy costs following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ans.org/news/article-4623/countries-change-nuclear-policies-in-response-to-ukraine-war/\"><u>Other countries</u></a> boosted investments (France), or delayed their phase-outs of nuclear power (e.g. Belgium), following the Russian invasion (ANS, 2023).</p><p>The case of nuclear power shows that geopolitical calculus is not an overwhelming determinant of government policy, at least in the short-run. Public pressure, including from protests, was influential. Further,&nbsp;Germany\u2019s anti-nuclear mobilization was catalysed by the Fukushima meltdown in 2011. This suggests that, similarly to other cases, \u2018warning shots\u2019 from AI might also be significant.&nbsp;</p><h2>E. CFCs&nbsp;</h2><p>Another interesting analogue for AI protests is protests against CFCs. CFCs were first unilaterally banned in the US in the late 1970s, before spreading to other countries. The discovery of the \u2018ozone hole\u2019 in 1985 spurred countries to agree to substantial CFC reduction via the Montreal Protocol of 1987. &nbsp;</p><p>The 'drivers' of both CFCs and AI share some similarities. CFC production was concentrated in a few powerful chemical firms like DuPont, analogous to the dominance of Big Tech. While CFCs posed some benefits for the public in the 1970s, particularly in refrigeration and foam production, they CFCs were not as foundational to the world economy as fossil fuels \u2013 a closer comparison with the stage AI is at currently.</p><p>What role did activists have in regulating CFCs?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;recordOId=4448289&amp;fileOId=4467239\"><u>Their role in the early CFCs bans is fairly clear</u></a>. In 1974, a coalition of environmental groups helped to publicize the initial \u2018Molina-Rowland\u2019 hypothesis that CFC could destroy ozone molecules. The popularization of the risks, and media campaigns by groups like Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC), helped spur the first bans on CFCs in the US in 1977. &nbsp;</p><p>Protests may also have influenced international regulation of CFCs. The Friends of the Earth ran an extensive corporate campaign encouraging consumers to boycott products with CFCs. It was particularly successful in the UK, with the British aerosol industry reversed its opposition to CFC regulation, which helped enable the strengthening of the Montreal Protocol in 1990. However, I am more uncertain about this: firms may have reversed their opposition to regulation because of changing profit incentives. For example, by the mid-1980s CFCs,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/%28SICI%291099-0836%28199711%296%3A5%3C276%3A%3AAID-BSE123%3E3.0.CO%3B2-A\"><u>DuPont realized global regulation</u></a> could create a more profitable market for substitute chemicals the company was positioned to produce, so actually supported the signing of the Montreal Protocol.</p><p>In addition, there were other factors aside from activists which were key. First, there was the role of \u2018epistemic communities\u2019&nbsp;of scientists. As described in the case of de-nuclearization in Kazakhstan,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2706951\"><u>\u2018epistemic communities\u2019</u></a> are groups of experts who share similar worldviews and shape political outcomes by giving information and advice to politicians. In the CFC case, scientists advising US departments, especially in the EPA and State Department,<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2706955.pdf?refreqid=fastly-default%3A4382d41c45bf09a706de264e0a38ec0d&amp;ab_segments=&amp;origin=&amp;initiator=&amp;acceptTC=1\"><u> influenced the US government</u></a> to advocate for a more stringent treaty, enabling the success of the Montreal Protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, US\u2019s government support for the Montreal Protocol was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=12377&amp;context=journal_articles\"><u>unilaterally incentivised</u></a>: if the US had unilaterally implementing the Montreal Protocol on its own, it would have prevented millions of skin cancer deaths among US citizens for example, equivalent to roughly $3.5 trillion in benefits, versus $21 billion in costs.&nbsp;</p><p>What lessons can be learnt from the case of CFCs?&nbsp;</p><p>There are several reasons for optimism. Just like with the Nuclear Freeze Campaign, activists helped shape international policymaking surrounding CFCs. Furthermore, the activists who carried out corporate campaigns benefitted the expert scientists who were working within the US government and pushing for stricter CFC regulation. &nbsp;</p><p>However, there are other reasons to be pessimistic about AI protests.&nbsp;</p><p>Different countries were unilaterally incentivised to sign the Montreal Protocol. This might be the case for AI, in theory: different countries pursuing continued AI development might be competing in a \u2018suicide race\u2019. However, this is not how countries are behaving. Instead, they are pushing ahead with AI capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps in the future, a clear AI \u2018warning shot\u2019 might change policymakers\u2019 perceptions of the national interest. The discovery of the \u2018ozone hole\u2019 was crucial for mobilizing public opinion and policymakers\u2019 attention. Perhaps in the future we will see similar \u2018warning shots\u2019 from which could spur stringent,&nbsp;<i>international</i> AI regulation.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, stringent international regulation was aided by a diminishing profit incentive behind CFCs. By the late 1980s, alternative products might have been more profitable for Dupont. In contrast, there are no obvious substitutes to 'frontier AI models' like GPT-3, so firms are much less likely to support a \u2018phasing out\u2019.&nbsp;</p><h2>F. GMOS</h2><p>(I have covered the case of GMOs in detail&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6jxrzk99eEjsBxoMA/go-mobilize-lessons-from-gm-protests-for-pausing-ai#II__Fighting_a_Shared_Battle_\"><u>here</u></a>. Please skip this section if you\u2019re already familiar!)</p><p>In several ways, GMOs are a useful analogy for AI. It was seen as a revolutionary and highly profitable technology, which powerful companies were keen to deploy. Furthermore, GMOs did not have any clear \u2018warning shots\u2019, or high events which demonstrate the potential for large-scale harm, unlike the discovery of the ozone hole for CFCs or the meltdown of Fukushima for nuclear power.&nbsp; Yet, within the space of only a few years, between 1996 and 1999, public opinions shifted rapidly against GMOs, due to increasingly hostile media attention surrounding key \u2018trigger events\u2019 and heightened public mobilization. There was a de-facto moratorium on new approvals of GMOs in Europe by 1999. Today, only 1 GM crop is planted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7553740/\">&nbsp;in Europe</a>, and the region accounts for 0.05% of total GMOs grown worldwide. I am confident that protests had a key counterfactual impact.&nbsp;</p><p>There are several lessons from the GMO case. Firstly, \u2018trigger events\u2019 which lead to mass mobilization need not be catastrophes.&nbsp;The cloning of Dolly the Sheep, and the outbreak of \u2018Mad Cow Disease\u2019 were unrelated to GMOs, and did not pose any immediate catastrophic risks to the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, powerful corporate lobbies can be overwhelmed by activists.&nbsp;In the US,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://watermark.silverchair.com/9780262255509_cad.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAA10wggNZBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggNKMIIDRgIBADCCAz8GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMB0fB8vl_yl4zfXZZAgEQgIIDELpr_cRLSEGYUK4dg1ndrVrgTYJB0qgS-p0QVWnU-1N8TiOzFuaPwPWev1rL6GHvaSQAzsTYEgignWhSzNxE5iO16gZYW_XWQOJvUgzYjO4KfMJXbDzXTi8HBMUAwv2PyTP2PKKdUrdBrMg1VmmhvR2RwwxMPP4kGxcdKqA0DWeYXHXGlh_Ifij4Iwcx8zhNlXCe3Jz6UVzdALsG797l2mkDEWTchVVRkXfm85_0A2RupVoOLRJt0kotuu2Ar1b_fCP9thu5vgURlHOpnt9UKC1vuHyY8xcNzFVmbt8E-Gy-MmmnPNVm0e6G8etIoVfAOUyWOMXQBkb--sf4qmdkagA4YbaA8i8Zh7L4_4Akhy3UKM4OZLUBhYkp7mY4z7kgxQbFmP3DUaGcR_QMe6-lAHGrzeUqr-fDm2NDAt1BCQsFz4er39gJuuokt1KmDoalfgp2565cWcQt5LhutllKU6mepqWnuHezMie4UpmtWpvFJ1IvL85QNiTYLiryL5I5hsbxZxMqJBmHWLsPXk94P3ECFpNiUL4Ru14oioTjF1PzyN0wmkyO9lAX6BREWZ9ASoeiunVRUA2ScsWzPsL3vcgPOOWL7C_dQr-_89CLvzcsmlXrRIWyq9D0ypfCWOH1gkgQBWUW7P7mvDbcKakeK0i2BbyBB02abdILBUhes0bdxZGagM4CgMULI9iTvjBpOpGBWWF-zEKmzXeG1PoK1l5zShQiZyrdP84LVhFhkDQnfM6iJREJbUDGaYK3N_KMSVzAv3KFdGLAi3vqtzkcjAsyA9v7t_EKGFcgVdpWq-HiRG6BHH8fcNlDfyE30TRPaaL7oAqbfg7JqRsEYhTlvO1YjYvNytS7_sqDVWjouJ5pMj01VEe504FZJQXc94Ygk0pMEDwhW7wSbByPHxVdJkfBp74T-k5q--9MWUiyQ9IG4xaA0vOVvAxh-DZrsxCtCMeBvJ7DzavOVRABgr6FGqT483w-vv6Th_GIqKaxuC0DDxaQAStkmcE5tHM7aeoFC5UGiShsQi2Kk3eZ981o0D8\">biotech companies</a> spent over $140 million between 1998 and 2003 on lobbying.

These levels of lobbying likely exceeds levels of AI-lobbying.&nbsp;</p><p>The messaging of GMO protests did not focus on risk. Instead, it focused on injustice. Opponents of GMOs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.285.5426.384\"><u>thought principally in terms of moral acceptability</u></a>, not risk. Rhetoric targeted particular companies (e.g. \u201cMonsatan\u201d) not systemic pressures.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the anti-GMO movement brought together a broad range of groups, including environmental NGOs, consumer advocacy groups, farmers, and religious organizations. More generally, diverse protests are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.socialchangelab.org/post/what-makes-a-protest-movement-successful\"><u>more likely to succeed</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><h1>5. Conclusion</h1><p>So, have we ever said no? Given the history of technology, should we see AI development like \u201cone big slime mold slowly rolling toward an inevitable future\u201d?</p><p>In this piece, I have tried to set out a framework for thinking about these questions. When asking the question, \u201cis slowing AI development possible?\u201d, we should not look towards cases of restraining General Purpose Technologies like electricity or the internet, as the key reference class. Instead, we should look for technologies with similar geopolitical and commercial drivers, and groups who had comparable motivations for restraining them.&nbsp;</p><p>And looking at this reference class, there are several relevant cases in which&nbsp;<i>we have said no</i>: from geo-engineering experiments, nuclear weapons programs, and the use of fossil fuels, CFCs, and GMOs. (I am uncertain exactly how influential: these case studies constitute shallow dives (2-4 hours of research), and showing causation is difficult in social science.)&nbsp;</p><p>There are several more general \u2018meta-lessons\u2019 we can draw from these protests.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, the role of geopolitical incentives in determining policy outcomes is not overriding. The case studies of nuclear weapons (denuclearisation in Kazakhstan and Sweden; \u2018Nuclear Freeze\u2019 in US in 1980s) and the phase-out of nuclear power in Germany demonstrate that protests can have influence policy outcomes even in the face of powerful geopolitical drivers. Similarly, powerful corporate interests do not always have their way. Powerful lobbies&nbsp;\u2013 comparable to corporate interests favoring continued AI development \u2013 were overwhelmed by activists in several cases: fossil fuels, nuclear power, and GMOs.&nbsp;</p><p>Protests have also demonstrated their capacity to shape international governance, as seen in the Nuclear Freeze campaign and efforts against CFCs. If you believe that international governance is necessary for safe AI governance, protests could help enable this.</p><p>Additionally, in the cases of CFCs and de-nuclearisation in Kazakhstan, experts pushing for certain policies within governments benefitted from public mobilisations. This suggests that community of AI researchers, who share similar concerns about AI existential risk, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/rishi-sunak-artificial-intelligence-pivot-safety-summit-united-kingdom-silicon-valley-effective-altruism/\"><u>have privileged positions in the UK\u2019s AI taskforce</u></a>, would benefit from public mobilization in achieving more stringent regulation of \u2018frontier AI\u2019.&nbsp;More generally, these two case studies lend some support to the broader idea that \u2018inside-game\u2019 strategies for creating social change (working within the existing system: e.g., running for office, working for the government)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://paxfauna.org/inside-outside-strategy/\"><u>are benefitted by other \u2018outside-game strategies\u2019</u></a> (community organizing, picketing, civil resistance etc.).&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, the importance of <a href=\"https://ayni.institute/massprotest/\">\u2018trigger events\u2019</a> \u2013 highly publicised public events which lead to mass mobilisation \u2013 &nbsp;should not be understated. The dropping of nuclear weapons in WW2, the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and the discovery of the Ozone Hole were pivotal in galvanizing public awareness and support for these protest movements. However, the case of GMOs suggests that&nbsp;mass mobilisation does not require a catastrophic 'warning shot'.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnm7xyppvz99c\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefm7xyppvz99c\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3995225\"><u>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3995225</u></a>, p11: \u201cThe policy recommendations for mitigating [risks from AI] in <i>The Precipice&nbsp;</i>support R&amp;D into aligned artificial general intelligence (AGI), instead of delaying, stopping or democratically controlling AI research and deployment.\u201d</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnthqyzwyy22\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefthqyzwyy22\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This is based on personal conversations.

I am a first year student at UTAS in Australia. I am currently majoring in Data Science, and I am curious if anyone knows any good internships/graduate programs I can do over summer/when I finish my degree. I am currently focusing on building career capital (as Benjamin Todd says in the 80,000 hours book, it is better to do build yourself up now so in ten years you can do an immense amount of good, rather than doing feel-good projects at non-profits with limited benefits in the short-term), so I want to get something clouty. I am doing well in my studies (6.75 GPA on a 7 scale last semester. A little lower this semester as I had to learn programming, but I am currently aiming for a High Distinction finish), and I want to get a masters degree at somewhere clouty as well (currently thinking about the 1 year Applied Masters of Data Science at Monash. It's one of the top universities in Australia, but you only need CR average to attend, so it's something I could realistically do. It also is only 2 years part time and online, and also highly flexible, whereas other Australian universities are 1.5 or 2 years for the same thing). If I have a LinkedIn page that says 'Data Engineer at Deloitte (or some other top company. I will be applying to the Big 4 and doing the virtual work experience programs etc., but other recommendations will be listened to)', 'Master's degree at Monash', '5+ years work experience (or however many I have at that time)', I will have built a good foundation for the future, and then I could go into earning to give, or something better if an opportunity comes my way. Fundamentally I want to build myself up though, as this means I can do more good for both myself, and it means I have more options meaning I can do more good in the future. For further context, I am 19 years old, and I have dual citizenship for Great Britain, however data scientists get paid more in Australia from what I know, so will not move without reasons. Any ideas what I should be doing?</p><p>Thank you</p><p>P.S. It is too late for applying for internships for the end of this year, as it finishes in about a week, but I have things I can do this summer so it's not a disaster.

I am a student at the University of Tasmania. I have found that a really good way of getting people interested in effective altruism is to point out how overrated the worlds most famous charities are (e.g. Oxfam, Red Cross etc.). For instance, Angus Deaton wrote in his book 'The Great Escape' that 70% of aid donations from the UN are government-to-government transactions. Those of you who know a little about international politics will know that the vast majority of the global south live in poverty mostly because of their corrupt governments (Magatte Wade has done a TED talk on this, to give but one example, which is worth watching if this is news to you), which essentially means that 70% of aid donations to the UN are funding the extension to Robert Mugabe's Blue Roof mansion whilst millions of Zimbabweans starve to death. This is but one example. I am exaggerating of course, but I suspect there are similar stories amongst other famous charities, of which I would greatly appreciate somebody providing links to reliable sources to examples of these charities so I can use them as practical examples when discussing the subject (reliable meaning I can cite it in as evidence in a debate, and the person trying to tear down my position cannot say \"this is just a blog post therefore it's unreliable\" or something along those lines. There are a lot of top sources saying that [insert program] works, even though they work at a fraction of the efficiency of the worlds top charities, and that is enough for people to dismiss my view if I cannot prove I am standing on a rock). My email is <a href=\"mailto:notfranic@gmail.com\">notfranic@gmail.com</a> (I spelt Francis wrong. I know I'm an idiot. That's my middle/other name if anyones curious, but my preferred name is Jack) if you have a serious example, as I rarely respond on forums (This is not my main email, so I may be slow to respond, but this is my first post, so I need to make sure I am not spammed with emails or anything like that before giving away my main).&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Jack Sands"}}, {"_id": "jSHdoSJW3nDZgBqFt", "title": "Giving Game: Giving What We Can Melbourne", "postedAt": "2023-10-27T05:45:13.830Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Join our latest Giving What We Can Melbourne event where we will be giving away real money to charities \u2014 and you can help decide which!</p><p>Join us for a Giving Game event where you can learn more about effective giving and how to identify which charities can do the most good.

In fact, impact evaluation seems fairly rare in the EA space.</li><li>There are some things specific actors could do for EA to get more of the benefits of impact evaluation. For example, organisations that don\u2019t already could carry out evaluations of their impact, and a well-suited individual could start an organisation to carry out impact evaluations and analysis of the EA movement.</li><li>Overall I\u2019m unsure to what extent more focus on impact evaluation would be an improvement. On the one hand, establishing impact is challenging for many EA activities and impact evaluation can be burdensome. On the other hand, an organisation's historic impact seems very action-relevant to its future activities and current levels of impact evaluation seem low.</li></ul><h3>What Is Impact Evaluation?</h3><p>Over the last year I\u2019ve been speaking to EA orgs about their impact evaluation. This includes setting up a theory of change (ToC), choosing metrics and methods of evaluation, and carrying out evaluations. Impact evaluation can be done internally, by a funder, or by another external evaluator.</p><h3>Why is Impact Evaluation Important?</h3><p>Whereas companies have a clear metric to understand their success (profit), the social impact of a nonprofit is much harder to see. As a result, if a nonprofit wants to have a good sense of its success then it\u2019s likely to need to make an explicit assessment of its impact. For this reason impact evaluation is often viewed as a core part of strategy and operations for nonprofits, particularly in the Global Health and Development space.</p><p>Concretely, the main benefits of impact evaluation to an organisation are:</p><ol><li>Confidence that targeted impacts are achieved</li><li>Decision-making being more closely tied to desired social impact (including organisational alignment)</li><li>Identifying changes to activities to increase impact and mitigate harms</li><li>Sharing progress with stakeholders, and highlighting successes publicly</li></ol><h3>I\u2019d expect Impact Evaluation to be quite common in EA</h3><p>Given the history of EA, I\u2019d have expected impact evaluation to be quite common in the EA movement. One early EA message was something like \"even programs that sound good and are implemented by people with the best intentions can be ineffectual or even harmful, and you might not realise this until you rigorously look into the outcomes\".</p><p>EA also has values and norms that align with impact evaluation. The movement has a focus on rigour, quantification, and impact. It has a reputation for making use of cost-effectiveness analysis and placing weight on \u2018getting to the truth of the matter\u2019, and there is a culture of&nbsp;<i>actually</i> caring about good outcomes.&nbsp;</p><h3>Impact evaluation is fairly rare in EA</h3><p>My impression is that impact evaluation is actually quite rare in the EA space, in the following ways:</p><ul><li>As far as I can tell many organisations in EA, perhaps somewhere between 30 and 70% (outside of GHD work), including the larger ones:<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefosuhn435exq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnosuhn435exq\">[1]</a></sup></span><ul><li>Don\u2019t have explicit theories of change</li><li>Don\u2019t carry out or publish assessments of their impact</li><li>Don\u2019t have explicit internal functions focussing on impact evaluation</li></ul></li><li>There aren\u2019t established and sophisticated ways in the movement to evaluate the impact of many common EA activities, such as movement-building and policy change</li></ul><p>To be clear, there definitely are evaluation efforts in EA, such as:</p><ul><li>Many orgs do publish impact reports with meaningful information and detailed metrics</li><li>Funders carry out work that might be considered impact evaluation to support grants</li><li>Rethink Priorities carries out the EA survey annually, and there have been other surveys carried out such as OP\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/AKYivq6uKhsyDJXnE/p/NP5B6yNMoZiZbmEQ8\"><u>2020 survey</u></a>, the CEA events team&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CkJW7ctJvTindBpsK/which-cea-funded-community-building-events-are-cost\"><u>2023 survey</u></a></li><li>Individuals have occasionally explored early methodological approaches to impact assessment for various EA areas (e.g. see examples&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RQzieJvu6Ecmgagbp/a-model-estimating-the-value-of-research-influencing-funders\"><u>here</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RqzSQwGEPmvbemgkH/a-botec-model-for-comparing-impact-estimations-in-community\"><u>here</u></a>)</li><li>There are multiple charity evaluators (GiveWell, GWWC, Founders Pledge, ACE, EA Funds, Giving Green, potentially others) focussed on impact evaluation for funders</li><li>Culturally, organisations seem motivated by impact, and it is common to carry out cost-effectiveness calculations and reason in social impact terms when making decisions</li></ul><p>But overall I\u2019m still surprised by the level of impact evaluation in EA.</p><h3>Potentially justified reasons for this</h3><p>This might be the optimal level of impact evaluation. Some potentially well justified reasons for the current level are:</p><ol><li><strong>It\u2019s challenging for many EA activities</strong><ol><li>The impact of many EA activities is indirect, hard to see and/or a long way in the future, making evaluation challenging. This increases the burden of impact evaluation work, and reduces the pay-off. Some organisations I spoke to have attempted this work in the past but found it too challenging without enough reward, so reasonably shelved it for the timebeing. (This is also the most obvious explanation for why impact evaluation is much more common for GHD organisations than e.g. policy, AI safety and movement-building organisations)</li></ol></li><li><strong>Org\u2019s are busy</strong><ol><li>Many organisations I spoke to expressed a desire to have better impact evaluation and/or a theory of change, but it was on a long list of things to do</li></ol></li><li><strong>Org\u2019s might have strong priors about activities</strong><ol><li>Organisations might have strong views that work is worth carrying out and expect that the evidence from impact evaluation would be weak, so that the results of an evaluation would be unlikely to change their focus</li></ol></li></ol><h3>Some low- to medium-cost opportunities</h3><p>Here are some actions that different actors could take if they wanted to do or encourage more impact evaluation:</p><ol><li><strong>Strengthen internal evaluations \u2013&nbsp;</strong>organisations above a certain size (e.g. &gt;10 employees) could carry out a minimal level of impact evaluation, including:<ol><li>Creating an explicit theory of change, with a description of what they do, what they hope it will lead to, and how they evaluate their success</li><li>Running internal impact evaluations to assess their social impact (and potentially publishing the results)</li><li>Having staff dedicated to impact evaluation or with it included in their duties</li><li>Leadership teams being invested in the results of evaluations</li></ol></li><li><strong>Carry out external evaluations&nbsp;</strong>\u2013 individuals who want to work on this problem and are well-suited to this type of work could:<ol><li>Carry out impact evaluations for EA organisations (or provide advice on evaluations carried out internally)<ol><li>They could focus on a specific cause area or sub-section of EA, since evaluation methods differ between them</li></ol></li><li>Carry out analysis of the EA movement as a whole, including historic impact and potential risks and opportunities<ol><li>Will Macaskill points out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DdSszj5NXk45MhQoq/decision-making-and-decentralisation-in-ea#:~:text=Someone%20could%20set%20up%20an%20organisation%20or%20a%20team%20that%E2%80%99s%20explicitly%20taking%20on%20the%20task%20of%20assessing%2C%20monitoring%20and%20mitigating%20ways%20in%20which%20EA%20faces%20major%20risks%2C%20and%20could%20thereby%20fail%20to%20provide%20value%20to%20the%20world%2C%20or%20even%20cause%20harm.\"><u>here</u></a> that EA should potentially have an org focussed on identifying potential risks of harm.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefb6bgqq0sh4f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnb6bgqq0sh4f\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;To me the more natural idea would be that there is an evaluation org focussed on more generally assessing the progress of the EA movement, since if this is done properly it would include potential harms.</li><li>This analysis could be distributed to EA org leaders, or published online. For analysis made public, it would be important to get the buy-in of central EA org\u2019s and be considerate of PR risks.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><strong>Collect and centralise resources and improve methodology</strong><ol><li>An individual could:<ol><li>Collect public impact evaluations and methodological resources in e.g. a wiki</li><li>Develop evaluation methods for common EA cause areas or interventions (this is perhaps best done while simultaneously carrying out actual evaluations)</li></ol></li><li>CEA could refresh and deepen the public impact&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/impact\"><u>page</u></a></li></ol></li></ol><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Overall, I\u2019m fairly uncertain to what extent more focus on impact evaluation in EA would be an improvement.</p><p>On the one hand, impact evaluation is challenging for many EA activities and can carry a high resource burden, without a guarantee that it will affect decisions in significant ways.</p><p>On the other hand, the historic impact of activities seems very action-relevant to future activities, and current levels of evaluation seem low.</p><p>If someone was particularly excited and well-suited to work on impact evaluation in EA then that seems more unambiguously positive and I could imagine them being really useful to many organisations.<br><br><br><i>Thanks to Stephen Clare, Ben Clifford and Devon Fritz for providing comments on a draft of this post.</i><br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnosuhn435exq\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefosuhn435exq\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I\u2019m basing this on conversations I\u2019ve had with ~20 org\u2019s, and on quickly checking the websites of ~10 other prominent EA org\u2019s for a public ToC or impact report.

That is, for attendees focusing on other areas, you\u2019ll be welcome to apply and register for the Bay Area event (and your chances of admission won't be affected), we just expect it\u2019ll be less useful for you.&nbsp;<strong>We expect the London event to be similar to our past London conferences</strong> \u2014 with most attendees likely still focused on AI and GCRs, and with about 50% of our content focused in these areas.</p><p>We\u2019re also announcing our ticketing structure for 2024, which is similar to the structure we had in 2021.&nbsp;<strong>The default ticket price for EA Global will be \u00a3400 GBP or $500 USD with discounts for students, people on low incomes, and select mentors.</strong></p><p>The rest of this post explains some of the reasoning behind these decisions.</p><h2>Why are we running a GCR-specific conference?</h2><h3>Funding</h3><p>Most of our funding comes from funders who are prioritizing GCR capacity building (notably,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks-capacity-building/\"><u>Open Phil\u2019s GCR Capacity Building team</u></a>). Historically, we\u2019ve not attracted substantial funding from donors prioritizing farm animal welfare and global health and wellbeing, though we\u2019d be excited about broadening our donor base over time. Fortunately, support from the GCR funders allows us to maintain programs serving the full scope of EA, even those not directly related to global catastrophic risk reduction.</p><p>This also means that our funders are more excited about us experimenting with cause-specific events on GCRs \u2014 though we want to clarify that the Events Team is excited about pursuing this too.</p><h3>We\u2019re excited about exploring cause-specific events</h3><p>As mentioned above, the Events Team is also excited about exploring cause-specific events. Over the past two years, we\u2019ve run retreats focused on GCRs and have also been exploring a conference focused on global health and wellbeing (we\u2019ve also lightly explored running a FAW conference). We also recently ran a retreat for folks focused on effective giving.</p><p>Like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/S4udTauZnnojap74K/what-do-staff-at-cea-believe-evidence-from-a-rough-cause\"><u>many at CEA</u></a>, the majority (but not all) of the Events Team currently lean towards GCRs in their cause prioritization. Most of the team is still very excited about pursuing other cause area events as well and is also excited about big tent / principles-first events like the regular EA Global events. But, like our funders, some on the team are excited about putting particular energy into GCR and/or AI Safety events.</p><h3>Historic attendee pool</h3><p>Our Bay Area events have historically had a very GCR-focused (and specifically AI Safety-focused) attendee pool. Part of what we\u2019re doing here is trying to make this more explicit, so that attendees know what to expect. Previously we\u2019ve heard that these Bay Area events have been less valuable for non-GCR attendees as there haven\u2019t been many people from their cause area present.</p><h2>Why keep the event EA branded?</h2><h3>Costs to building a new brand</h3><p>Since this is a test, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth doing the lift of a significant rebrand with new application portals, branding, etc. Having the event under the EA Global umbrella also means we can have one central admissions process, which saves our users from having to apply to multiple events.</p><p>We want to avoid creating a new brand unless we feel confident in it, to avoid potentially rebranding multiple times. If this event goes well, we may iterate on it the year after and perhaps create a new event brand if we think there\u2019d be sufficient demand.</p><h3>Skepticism around a GCR-branded conference</h3><p>We\u2019re skeptical that we\u2019d get lots of attendees to come to a \u201cGCRs Global\u201d who wouldn\u2019t otherwise come to an EA Global \u2014 currently the GCR field as EAs consider it isn\u2019t a substantial area outside of EA. We think such a conference could make sense as a more introductory event, but EA Global conferences have largely been targeted at people who have engaged with these ideas substantially, and we don\u2019t expect there to be a large pool of people who\u2019ve engaged with GCRs who wouldn\u2019t attend an EA Global.</p><p>We\u2019re more excited about an AI safety (or biorisk) specific event \u2014 that seems more clearly something that would get counterfactual attendees, and is more clearly a package of ideas that would make sense to someone outside of EA. We\u2019ve been exploring an AI safety conference and will continue to do so, though this is a bit tricky as our team aren\u2019t AI experts and don\u2019t have authority in this area. We expect such an event would likely involve partnering with an AI safety org to execute their vision and we\u2019ve been talking with various orgs to explore this. We\u2019ve also already helped to support various other (smaller scale) AI safety and biorisk events.</p><h2>Ticket pricing</h2><p>In a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/n5GJEP3tMrzdfYPGG/how-much-do-eags-cost-and-why\"><u>previous post</u></a> we outlined our event costs and mentioned that we would likely increase ticket prices to help recoup some of our costs. We wanted to do this in such a way that wouldn\u2019t price out the bulk of our attendees, some of whom are students, are on a low income, or are attending mostly to provide value to others at the event (in which case it makes less sense for them to pay much to attend).</p><p>As a result, we\u2019re planning to raise our ticket prices to a similar level to what they were in 2021.&nbsp;<strong>We\u2019ll have default ticket prices of \u00a3400 (or $500)</strong>, with discounted options for students, people on low incomes, and select mentors. In general, we\u2019d like everyone to pay&nbsp;<i>something</i> in order to create some sort of buy-in, so we\u2019ll be moving towards a world where we\u2019re more restrictive with who\u2019s able to get a free ticket. We encourage folks to email us if they need a free ticket due to financial hardship, and we expect to grant nearly all of these requests (though we may have to backtrack here if we get inundated with requests).</p><h2>Other info</h2><ul><li>We\u2019re in the process of organising many EAGx events in 2024 and think it\u2019s likely that there\u2019ll be at least one EAGx event in the US in 2024 (as well as events in various other locations).</li><li>We expect the EA Global: Bay Area (GCRs) event to be pretty similar to other EA Globals; we\u2019ll likely be keeping the food all-vegan, using Swapcard, and expect the branding and feel of the event to remain the same.</li></ul><figure class=\"table\"><table style=\"background-color:hsl(0, 0%, 90%)\"><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"https://effectivealtruism.force.com/EAGlobal/s/eaglobalapplication?eId=a4WAJ000000000k2AA\">Apply Now</a></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>", "user": {"username": "Eli_Nathan"}}, {"_id": "dLWCZgJsyC4z7wDaG", "title": "Existential Hope and Existential Risk: Exploring the value of optimistic approaches to shaping the long-term future", "postedAt": "2023-10-27T09:07:49.198Z", "htmlBody": "<h2>Epistemic Status</h2><p>Personal takes aimed to raise a discussion and get input. This is a side product of another strategy project, rather than a systematic and rigorous analysis of longtermist movement building and different concepts related to (very) positive long-term futures. We have not been able to confirm with original authors that we represent their ideas correctly, and while we have done our best and tried to refrain from speculating about their views, we might be mistaken. We apologize in advance and will do our best to update the post as needed.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the authors (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/elteerkers?mention=user\">@elteerkers</a>) has a clear bias as she works at Foresight Institute and runs their existential hope program (both of which will be referred to in the post).

This is written in a personal capacity and does not represent the views of our employers.</p><p>We think the most significant downside risks of this post are that:</p><ul><li>We come across as making a case for redirecting resources away from work to decrease existential risk toward work on increased long-term flourishing, thus increasing tension between people/groups on different sides of this spectrum. (Rather, we wish to raise a discussion to help ourselves and others better build the community of people interested in working to shape the long-term future.)</li><li>People overupdate on these takes or do not critically consider what they might mean for their respective contexts.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Summary</h2><p>This post explores if there could be value in considering alternative approaches to motivate work aiming to shape the long-term future. More concretely, we consider strategies aiming to increase upside risk to complement what we see as the current primary approach - decreasing large downside risk (primarily existential risk). We begin by describing a few terms regarding pursuing upside risk, such as \u201cexistential hope,\u201d \u201cutopia,\u201d and \u201cpositive trajectory change,\u201d and consider how these terms are being used today and what work (if any) is being done under these banners in the EA and longtermist community.&nbsp;</p><p>We find all these terms relevant to consider when working to shape the long-term future. As we mainly want to consider the potential effects of approaches and framings pursuing upside risk in general, we use the term \u201cvery positive futures\u201d (VPF) for the remainder of the post, where we discuss the potential arguments for and against putting more emphasis on pursuing upside risk.&nbsp;</p><p>Potential arguments for focusing more on VPF approaches and framings include:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>A crucial consideration when deciding on how to prioritize between near-term and long-term causes and interventions (including reducing existential risk) is the potential value of the future. And to understand the potential value of the future, it is important to understand VPF.</li><li>Understanding what positive long-term futures could look like and what would make them more or less likely could aid in prioritizing between different causes and interventions aimed at shaping the far future.&nbsp;</li><li>Putting more emphasis on VPF in communication and crafting compelling visions of the future might;<ol><li>Attract more people to work on improving the long-term future (including reducing existential risk) by creating a better understanding of how good the future could be, as well as increasing people\u2019s emotional attachment to the future.&nbsp;</li><li>Help in bridging the gap between communities working on reducing existential risk from emerging technologies and techno-optimists who are skeptical of attempts to govern or slow down work on technological capabilities. This might be especially important if such techno-optimists are working on two-sided technologies and become more interested in differential technological development under a VPF approach.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Building on the above, currently, in culture, there seems to be a bias toward dystopian depictions of the future. Apart from making people pessimistic about the future and inhibiting action, this might make people underestimate the potential of scientific and technological advances and, thus, generally skeptical of societal investments in these fields.</li><li>Considering the potential of AI to accelerate innovation rapidly, a radically different future could be here soon. If this is the case, we need research and work on VPF to guide this acceleration towards desirable outcomes.</li><li>As far as we can tell, little work has been done on VPF, and we think the potential value is high while very uncertain. Thus, this area could have low-hanging fruit and likely substantial information value to be gained.</li></ol><p>Potential arguments against focusing more on VPF approaches and framings include:</p><ol><li>We should prioritize work on reducing existential risk. The authors of this post think work on existential risk is extremely important, and we are unsure if the current relative proportions of work to increase upside risk and decrease downside risk are sound. But you might think it is clear that the current relative proportions are sound or that there should be more focus on existential risk. A few reasons for this position could be that you think:<ol><li>We can work on VPF when we have reduced more urgent existential risk to a sufficient level.</li><li>There is a \u201clow\u201d upper bound on how good the future could be that future civilizations can be expected to achieve.</li><li>It is not tractable to find and/or take actions with big, contingent, and persistent effects on the long-term future other than reducing existential risk.</li><li>Work on VPF could (unintentionally) increase existential risks, e.g., by accelerating AI development without proper safety considerations.</li></ol></li><li>Putting more emphasis on VPF might not be an effective way to attract more people to work on improving the long-term future, or it might attract people who are less sympathetic to the complexities of long-term challenges, leading to ineffective or even harmful work.</li><li>Utopian pursuits have a bad track record. Similarly, work on VPF risks fostering naive overconfidence, leading to ill-conceived solutions or extreme measures that may cause more harm than good.</li></ol><p>We end the post asking for input and discussion on the topic. A few key uncertainties we would love higher clarity on are the current proportions of work dedicated to VPF versus existential risk, the \u201cdefault trajectory\u201d of the future, conditional on survival, and ideas for promising causes or pathways for VPF.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Most people in the EA community working to shape the long-term future focus on avoiding existential risk, for example, by preventing unaligned AI or engineered pandemics. There are good reasons for this; existential catastrophes are possible, and many think we are now experiencing a heightened level of risk. If they did occur, we would be unable to grasp our civilization\u2019s long-term potential, and while it is difficult, we can act to avoid existential risk.</p><p>However, avoiding existential risk isn\u2019t the only way we can shape the long-term future. Rather than avoiding large downside risks, we could act to attain large upside risks. For example, if we think humanity\u2019s values might get locked in, we can take strategic action to improve our values today, which may lead to humanity being guided by better values for millennia to come. Or we might be able to speed up progress persistently - giving humanity access to life-altering technology or social development sooner than what would otherwise have happened.</p><p>We think there could be value in considering such (complementary rather than rivalry) approaches for the community of people working to shape the long-term future. We mean this partly in terms of what causes and interventions to focus on and partly in terms of how we talk about and frame our work. At least, we think this area would benefit from more conceptual clarity and deserves exploring. That is what we hope to do in this post. More precisely, we aim to:</p><ol><li>Explore a few of ideas and terms related to very positive long-term futures (probably skip this if you have thought a lot about alternative approaches to shape the long-term future)</li><li>Present potential benefits for the EA and wider longtermist community of focusing more on very positive long-term futures</li><li>Present potential drawbacks of focusing more on very positive long-term futures</li><li>List our main uncertainties and raise questions for further discussion<br>&nbsp;</li></ol><h2>1. Ideas and terms regarding positive long-term futures</h2><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Before exploring the arguments for and against focusing more on pursuing large upside risk, we want to describe the frameworks and terms we think seem most relevant in this domain - Existential Hope, Utopia(s), and Positive Trajectory Changes. Note that this is not an exhaustive list, and our understanding of these concepts might differ from how others use them. Please let us know if you think something important is lacking or disagree with what we say!&nbsp;</p><h3>Existential Hope (and Eucatastrophes)</h3><p><strong>Origin</strong></p><p>The terms existential hope (and eucatastrophe) were, in the meaning used here, introduced by Toby Ord and Owen Cotton-Barratt in the paper \u201c<a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Existential-risk-and-existential-hope.pdf\"><u>Existential Risk and Existential Hope: Definitions</u></a>.\u201d They start the paper by exploring different definitions related to existential risk and suggest that a definition via expectations might be better than the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12002#:~:text=Existential%20risk%20and%20uncertainty,development%20(Bostrom%2C%202002).\"><u>traditional Bostrom definition</u></a> as it handles non-binary events better. (Note that it seems Ord has gone back to prefer Bostrom\u2019s traditional definition. At least it is what he uses in&nbsp;<i>The Precipice</i>.)</p><p>More precisely, they suggest the following definitions:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAn existential catastrophe is an event which causes the loss of a large fraction of expected value.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cExistential risk is the chance of an existential catastrophe taking place.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>With that background, we can now move on to existential hope and eucatastrophes because it is quite natural to consider these parallel concepts as \u201cthe other side of the coin\u201d when defining existential risk and existential catastrophe this way, via expectations.&nbsp;</p><p>Ord\u2019s and Cotton-Barratt\u2019s definitions:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAn existential eucatastrophe is an event which causes there to be much more expected value after the event than before.\u201d</p><p>\u201cExistential hope is the chance of an existential eucatastrophe taking place.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Many uncertainties arise with this definition, especially concerning what they see as the threshold for \u201cmuch more expected value.\u201d &nbsp;Our understanding is that they have a (very) high bar in mind. The origin of life is mentioned as a specific eucatastrophe. Also, they mention the rise of multicellular life and intelligence as eucatastrophes, to the extent that they were not inevitable, and suggest successfully passing any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/great-filter\"><u>\u2018great filter\u2019</u></a> as a general type of eucatastrophe. A further indication of their high bar is that in an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/L9TWehZhpPAf6tcrj/increasing-existential-hope-as-an-effective-cause\"><u>EA Forum post</u></a>, Owen Cotton-Barratt has said that he does not think successful whole-brain emulation or full automation of the labor required to maintain a comfortable style of living for everyone would amount to eucatastrophes, as it is unclear what the effect on the long-term expected value of these events would be.</p><p><strong>Use today</strong></p><p>As far as we can tell, the organization that uses the terms existential hope and eucatastrophe most today is Foresight Institute. Note that the co-author of this post, elteerkers, works at Foresight Institute.&nbsp;</p><p>Their use of the term existential hope is much broader than what Ord and Cotton-Barratt initially seem to have intended. On Foresight\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.existentialhope.com/\"><u>existential hope website</u></a>, it is explained in the following way: \u201cExistential hope is a way of looking at the future with a lens that acknowledges the potential for positive change in the world. By focusing on what is actually possible, we can start to map out the main developments and challenges that need to be navigated to reach our desired outcome.\u201d</p><p>Foresight also uses the term \u201ceucatastrophe\u201d in a much broader way than Ord and Cotton-Barratt, simply stating that \u201cA&nbsp;<i>eucatastrophe&nbsp;</i>would be the opposite of a catastrophe, i.e., an event after which the expected value of the world would be much higher.\u201d There is no definition of how much higher the value would have to be to count as a eucatastrophe. Examples of what is referred to as potential eucatastrophes on their website are inventions like cryopreservation or safe fusion energy.</p><p>Foresight often communicates what they believe existential hope is in relation to existential risk.&nbsp; When asked why they work with existential hope, Foresight CEO Allison Duettmann has said:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe think it is useful to engage with the possibility that we may not be doomed and to consider what may be on the other side. There are many great projects dedicated to identifying the threats to human existence, but very few serious projects offer guidance on what to aim for instead. Our Existential Hope work is focused on generating the common knowledge needed to coordinate toward beautiful futures. By mapping the space of peril&nbsp;<i>and</i> promise which lie before us, perhaps we can use that knowledge to actively shoot for promising futures, rather than merely avoiding the terrifying ones.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>As alluded to in this quote, Foresight does not only focus on existential hope when considering&nbsp;<i>what</i> (causes) to work on when trying to improve the long-term future, but also&nbsp;<i>how</i> to talk about this work. While acknowledging risks and needing to be careful, Foresight aims to imbue people with hope and excitement about the future.&nbsp;</p><h3>Utopias and describing very positive futures</h3><p><strong>Origin</strong></p><p>The history of the term \"utopia\" is too long and broad to go over in this post. Suffice it to say that it is a highly established term, coined by Sir Thomas More in 1516 when he wrote a fictional book by the same name. The word is derived from the Greek words: \"ou,\" meaning \"not,\" and \"topos,\" meaning \"place,\" which together suggest that a utopia is a \"no-place\" or an idealized, nonexistent society.&nbsp;</p><p>Over time, the term \"utopia\" has come to represent any visionary or idealized state of society and has been used in a variety of contexts, both positive and negative. Some have also sought to bring utopian ideals one step further and turn them into reality through planned communities or political reforms, sometimes leading to significant suffering. More on this below.</p><p>We recommend the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia#:~:text=Etymology%20and%20history,-This%20is%20the&amp;text=The%20word%20utopia%20was%20coined,'described%20in%20considerable%20detail'.\"><u>Wikipedia article</u></a> for a more comprehensive account of the history of the word Utopia and how it has been used more generally.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Use today</strong></p><p>Today, utopia is used in many contexts. Below, we will focus on use within EA and the community of people working to shape the long-term future.</p><p>Several people in EA and the community working to shape the long-term future have written about utopia. While not all offer explicit definitions, and they use the term somewhat differently, we think it is fair to say that most use it to refer to \u201ca profoundly good future\u201d (borrowing words from Bostrom).</p><p>A common theme in these writings is an emphasis on the fact that humanity, along with our descendants, has the potential to construct a profoundly good future through sufficient patience and wisdom. Another theme in the writing and thinking on utopias seems to be centered around trying to describe concrete utopias and why it is both important and challenging.</p><p>To avoid the difficulties of describing appealing concrete utopias and to aid in steering toward positive futures, authors have described different types of utopias or paths toward them, such as:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/visualizing-utopia/\"><u>Mild to Radical Utopias</u></a> - Introduced by Holden Karnofsky, who argues that utopias can be thought of as existing on a spectrum. Mild utopias are those that make incremental improvements to the current world and do not fundamentally challenge the status quo. These utopias might involve minor changes to laws and policies or the implementation of new technologies that make life better in some way. Radical utopias are those that involve more significant changes to the way society is organized and operated.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/X3XZbt3Ft4QWHy8kz/actually-possible-thoughts-on-utopia\"><u>Concrete vs Sublime Utopias</u></a> - Introduced by Joseph Carlsmith, who worries that most imagined Utopias today are too small. Most depictions of Utopia fall into the category of Concrete Utopias. Sublime Utopias may be too hard for us to even imagine based on how we function and are limited as human beings.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://kk.org/thetechnium/protopia/\"><u>Protopia</u></a> - Introduced by Kevin Kelly to describe a state of continuous improvement and incremental progress in the future rather than a fixed and static utopian outcome.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cWjK3SbRcLkb3gN69/building-weirdtopia\"><u>Weirdtopia</u></a> - Introduced by Eliezer Yudkwosky to explain the fact that the future will be weird to us. It may even be indistinguishable from a Dystopia for us today. That\u2019s because values drift a lot over time. Especially given the fact that technological progress is speeding up and leading to new social realities, values may only drift faster and farther.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/ea-global-2018-paretotopian-goal-alignment\"><u>Paretotopia</u></a> - Introduced by Eric Drexler and Mark S. Miller as a comparison to phototropism in plants. Just as plants naturally grow towards light, Paretotopia represents a utopian state where society gravitates towards Pareto-preferred outcomes. They argue that we already live in a form of Paretotopia, as voluntary interactions gradually move civilization into Pareto-preferred directions, e.g., we have become less violent over time, and various aspects of life, such as health and education, have improved.</li></ul><p><strong>Worldbuilding</strong></p><p>A concept related to imagining positive futures that seems worth noting is&nbsp;<i>worldbuilding</i>. We understand worldbuilding to be a mix of art and science (with more or less focus on one of them depending on context) that aims to construct a coherent, and preferably detailed, fictitious depiction of a world. When exploring possible futures for our own world, worldbuilding can serve as a tool to gain a deeper understanding of which types of worlds may be more or less desirable and potentially how to navigate towards a more desirable reality.&nbsp;</p><p>Worldbuilding has been employed in fields like emergency and defense planning. In a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/conf_proceedings/CF398.html\"><u>paper from RAND</u></a>, it is argued that worldbuilding can help create a system for identifying concrete actions that \u201clead to both new thinking and coordinated effort [...] in a direction that aims at a desirable future, not merely a default one\u201d and \u201chelp(s) inject more focus on human agency into our consideration of technology futures by exploring purposely different scenarios that stretch the imagination to think about what we would like to have happen within a robust framework for how it might happen.\u201d</p><p>For interesting examples of worldbuilding and imagined worlds, see Future of Life Institute\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://worldbuild.ai/#our-finalists\"><u>Worldbuilding contest</u></a> and listen to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/project/future-of-life-institute-podcast/\"><u>their podcast</u></a>, where top entries are explored.</p><h3>(Positive) Trajectory Change</h3><p><strong>Origin</strong></p><p>In his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/40469/\"><u>Ph.D. thesis</u></a>, Nick Beckstead introduced the concept of the world's development trajectory (trajectory for short), which is a rough summary of the way the future will unfold over time. This summary includes various facts about the world, e.g., \u201chow rich people are, what technologies are available, how happy people are, how developed our science and culture is (...), and how well things are going all-things-considered at different points of time.\u201d Notably, the concept of a trajectory change is related to the concept of path dependence (whenever some aspect of the world could easily have been arranged in way X but is arranged in way Y due to something that happened in the past) and historical contingency (chance-influenced events with substantial long-term effects).</p><p>A positive trajectory change occurs when our actions improve the long-term path along which our descendants will walk.</p><p><strong>Use today</strong></p><p>Various actors use the concept of trajectory changes today. For example, Will MacAskill explores it in&nbsp;<i>What We Owe the Future</i>, distinguishing between attempts to<i> ensure civilizational survival</i> (avoiding extinction) and&nbsp;<i>change trajectory</i> (improving the quality of future people\u2019s lives). Further, he introduces a framework for assessing the expected value of attempts to influence the future. We can utilize three main criteria: significance, persistence, and contingency.</p><ul><li>Significance considers the impact of an event on the world's overall value. It gauges the difference an event makes, whether positive or negative.</li><li>Persistence evaluates the duration of that impact. Essentially, how long will the consequences of a particular event last?</li><li>Contingency considers whether the event is likely to have occurred without any intervention. It questions the inevitability of an outcome.</li></ul><p>For instance, let's examine species loss. One should assess the value that a specific species brings to the world. This is its significance. Next, consider the permanence of its loss: once a species is gone, can it ever be reclaimed? This is its persistence. Finally, it's essential to evaluate contingency: even if efforts were made to prevent a species' extinction, could external forces still lead to its demise shortly after?</p><p>Toby Ord recently published&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amirrorclear.net/files/shaping-humanity's-longterm-trajectory.pdf\"><u>a great paper</u></a> describing different potential positive trajectory changes. To learn more about these trajectories, we recommend reading the paper or watching&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb7BoXYTWYI\"><u>this clip</u></a>, as the graphics are helpful for gaining an understanding, but below is a very rough summary of the trajectories Ord considers (other than avoiding extinction):&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Advancements \u2013 If we think the future is likely to be better than the present, we could try to improve it by shifting the trajectory of humanity\u2019s instantaneous value earlier by some amount of time. This may correspond roughly to advancing all forms of progress by that same amount of time.</li><li>Speed-ups \u2013 Instead of only advancing progress by some amount, we could maybe do something to permanently speed it up - to achieve in 100 years what would otherwise have taken us 101, achieve in 1,000 years what would otherwise have taken 1,010, and so on. As this would have a proportionally more significant effect further into the future, it wouldn\u2019t be shifting the future trajectory but rather compressing it.</li><li>Gains \u2013 What if, instead of adjusting the timings of the future trajectory, we could directly adjust the instantaneous value itself? A gain is a direct increase of instantaneous value by a constant absolute amount.</li><li>Enhancements \u2013 It may also be possible to permanently improve humanity\u2019s instantaneous value by a given proportion. E.g., making every moment across humanity\u2019s future 1% more valuable. Ord calls this an enhancement.</li></ul><h3>Continued terminology in this post</h3><p>We think all of the concepts above - Existential Hope, Utopias, and Trajectory Change - are relevant to consider when working to improve the long-term future. And the main thing we want to do with this post is to explore the value of upside risk approaches as complementary to reducing existential risk approaches. Thus, in the following, we will not limit ourselves to one of the concepts but rather refer to \u201cVery Positive Futures\u201d (VPF) in general, and only when relevant, highlight if one of the concepts seems especially useful.&nbsp;</p><p>We will not give a precise definition of VPF but settle with saying that working on VPF means trying to identify and/or bring about something that would be very good for the expected value of the long-term future. Examples of what working on VPF could look like are changing society\u2019s values to care more about non-human-sentient beings living now and in the future, creating institutions that better represent future generations, or finding techniques to increase the likelihood of potential sentient artificial intelligence having better lives, to mention a few.</p><p>Importantly, with VPF and in the following, we also want to focus on framings and narratives of work to shape the long-term future; that is not only&nbsp;<i>what to work on</i> but also&nbsp;<i>how to talk about the work</i>. We consider what benefits and disadvantages more positive and hopeful framings might have. We want to be very clear that a VPF framing does not imply that risks should not be mentioned or considered. It means that considerations of large downside risks (catastrophic and existential risks) should be complemented with considerations of large upside risks (very positive futures).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Reasons why we might want to focus more on VPF</h2><h3>Generate ideas for new causes and interventions</h3><p>If we can ensure the survival of humanity broadly construed, we believe there could still be vast differences in the expected value of the future, including between a \u201cdefault\u201d future and a very good future. While we think that it will be very hard to increase the chance of VPF, there does not seem to have been much thought put into finding such opportunities. Giving this more consideration might help generate ideas for new causes and effective interventions. Arguably, improving values, as advocated by Will MacAskill in&nbsp;<i>What We Owe the Future</i>, falls into this bucket.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, a better mapping of VPF and a better understanding of what to aim for and how to get there might aid in avoiding paths that lead to unrecoverable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/dystopia\"><u>dystopias</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/civilizational-collapse-and-recovery\"><u>collapses</u></a> (i.e., existential catastrophes other than extinction).</p><h3>Improve how to prioritize the future in relation to the present</h3><p>A crucial consideration when deciding on how to prioritize between near-term and long-term causes and interventions (including causes and interventions to lower existential risk) is the potential value of the future. To understand the potential value of the future, it is important to understand VPF, especially if we think there is a high variance in the value of potential futures. As far as we have been able to tell, few have given these questions serious thought, indicating that there is still low-hanging fruit to pick.</p><p>One important sub-question here is whether the future will be good by \u201cdefault,\u201d conditional on us getting there. For more on this, we want to recommend&nbsp;<i>What We Owe The Future</i> chapter 9 by William MacAskill,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/the-expected-value-of-extinction-risk-reduction-is-positive\"><u>this post</u></a> by Jan Brauner and Friederike Grosse-Holz, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rationalaltruist.com/2013/02/27/why-will-they-be-happy/\"><u>this post</u></a> by Paul Christiano.</p><h3>Improve how to prioritize between long-term focused causes and interventions</h3><p>A better understanding of how good and likely various long-term futures are, what they would look like, and what would make them more or less likely could aid in prioritizing different causes and interventions aimed at shaping the far future.&nbsp;</p><p>First, we want to point to Toby Ord's recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amirrorclear.net/files/shaping-humanity's-longterm-trajectory.pdf\"><u>paper</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jb7BoXYTWYI\"><u>talk</u></a>, comparing different long-term trajectories. It is much better and more exhaustive than anything we can hope to create. However, we want to highlight two observations in Ord\u2019s paper that we think are good examples of how alternative approaches to VPF can help us prioritize between and within longtermist causes.</p><ol><li>Work aimed at improving the long-term future should ideally scale with both the instantaneous value of the long-term future and its duration. Using Ord\u2019s terminology, Advancements and Speed-ups seem less promising than Enhancements (and existential risk reduction).</li><li>The value of work bringing about progress sooner critically depends on whether they also (risk to) bring about extinction sooner. Using Ord\u2019s terminology, Advancements and Speed-ups are negative if they also bring forward extinction.</li></ol><p>Further, we make a few of our own observations. If a cause both reduces existential risk and increases existential hope, it seems like it, all else being equal, should be prioritized higher than one only reducing existential risk by an equal amount. More concretely, this might, on the margin, push for something like AI Safety being more valuable than nuclear security, as it seems AI has larger potential to bring about very positive things (if safe) compared to nuclear technology. Similarly to prioritizing between causes, if a particular intervention within a cause both reduces existential risk and increases existential hope, it seems like it, all else being equal, should be prioritized higher than one only reducing existential risk. More concretely, this might push for something such as focusing on neglected green tech rather than campaigns to nudge people to use less fossil fuels.</p><p>Also, prioritizing existential risk reduction leans quite heavily on the assumption that the expected value of human survival is positive. However, if the expected value (by default) is lower than previously thought, it suggests a need to reallocate some longtermist resources from focusing on&nbsp;<i>extinction</i> risk reduction and towards trying to improve the&nbsp;<i>quality</i> of the future. This could be done both by decreasing downside quality risk, including s-risks, and increasing upside quality risk, including the chance of VPF. Some potential approaches to enhance the quality of the long-term future include expanding the moral circle, cooperative game theory, the well-being of digital minds, and global priorities research. It seems worth noting that risk aversion increases the value of improving the quality of the future relative to ensuring survival, conditional on thinking there is some likelihood of a bad future. Another potential argument for valuing qualitative change higher than survival is that, plausibly, the value lost as a result of the gap between expected and highest-possible-quality is greater than the value lost as a result of the gap between expected and highest-possible-duration of survival. (Obviously, this argument could be turned on its head.)</p><h3>Attracting more people to work on shaping the long-term future</h3><p><strong>Increasing the salience and emotional connection to the future</strong></p><p>Something we find striking is that many early thinkers about existential risks were transhumanists, such as Nick Bostrom, Anders Sandberg, and David Pearce. One might wonder why. Was it just a fear of AI bringing about the end of humanity or the concerns about the misuse of biotechnology? We do not think so; rather these thinkers seem to have been driven by an understanding and a sense that when it comes to the future, there's so much at stake. We think this is an interesting indication that viewing the future through a VPF lens, where the stakes are understood to be very high, could motivate a deeper concern for the long-term future, including existential risks. In a recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/anders-sandberg-best-things-possible-in-our-universe/#grand-futures-000319\"><u>80,000 Hours podcast episode with Anders Sandberg</u></a>, he seems to allude to a similar conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI think one reason I started on this [writing his book on Grand Futures] was I realised we need to write about hope. A lot of my research is about existential risk and global catastrophes and other dreadful things. Quite often journalists ask me, \u2018But how do you sleep at night?\u2019 And I usually explain actually quite well, because I\u2019m thinking that I\u2019m doing my part to reduce some of this risk. But the deeper answer is that I\u2019m really optimistic. And you have to be optimistic about the future to want to save it. If the future actually could be very grand, we have a very good reason to save it.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>On this point, we think that most people seem to vastly underestimate how good or how large the future could be. This is perhaps a defense mechanism, as it may be easier to be complacent about a future that is only marginally better than the present. More on this below.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bridging the gap between different communities</strong></p><p>By offering a complementary framing, VPF could potentially expand engagement in longtermist work, attracting groups that haven't traditionally participated because of their less risk-focused approach to development and the future.&nbsp;It seems that some actors that fit this description have reacted against the current EA and longtermist discourse and community, as they think too little attention is given to the benefits of development (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.econtalk.org/marc-andreessen-on-why-ai-will-save-the-world/\"><u>Marc Andreessen</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/silicon-valley-tech-leaders-accelerationism-eacc-twitter-profiles-2023-7?r=US&amp;IR=T\"><u>Effective Accelerationists</u></a>).</p><p>We think it may be especially important to consider VPF for people who are excited about (unchecked) technological development and/or working on two-sided techniques with limited concern for the downside risks or the long-term future. Our intuition is that such actors would be more attracted to a VPF-framing, as this perspective, while emphasizing longer-term effects and the importance of safety and reducing existential risk, also talks about the upside, which fits more naturally with a development mindset. Further, if someone already is, or is more likely to, work on two-sided techniques or short-term capabilities without much consideration for the long-term future, the counterfactual of getting them to update seems extra high.&nbsp;</p><p>There is a very important counter-consideration here. A VPF approach might lead to over-excitement and work for unchecked technological development. Therefore, it's crucial that VPF places a strong emphasis on safety-centric strategies like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_technological_development\"><u>differential technological development</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>There is currently a bias toward negative futures</h3><p>Our perception is that there's little discussion or description of potential VPFs, while there is a lot of dystopian futures. Further, the few existing attempts to describe VPF often fall short.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/why-describing-utopia-goes-badly/\"><u>Holden Karnofsky, writing about potential Utopias</u></a>, notes that they often seem:</p><ul><li>Dull: Due to the lack of conflict and challenge.&nbsp;</li><li>Homogeneous: it's hard to describe a world of people living very differently from each other. To be concrete, utopias tend to emphasize specific lifestyles, daily activities, etc., which ends up sounding totalitarian.</li><li>Alien: Anything too different from the status quo is going to sound uncomfortable to many people.</li></ul><p>We think the lack of compelling visions for the long-term future is problematic for a couple of different reasons (this is obviously more or less what this entire post is about, but a few things seem especially relevant to note here):</p><ul><li>Faced with a flow of dystopian stories in our popular culture, it seems easy to feel pessimistic about the future, inhibiting action.</li><li>Building on the above, we think many underestimate the potential of scientific and technological advances. There's a perspective that posits technological and scientific advancements as neutral or even harmful. It's cautioned that while some problems may be solved, others of equal or higher weight might emerge or that the benefits plateau beyond a certain threshold of advancement. This perspective seems especially likely to occur where pessimistic narratives overshadow optimistic ones. We think it is more indicative of our lack of imagination than any intrinsic limitations of the future itself.</li><li>Short-term aims and visions are not enough. While we think addressing immediate societal concerns is paramount, an exclusive focus on them seems myopic. We should also look to the horizon, considering humanity's longer-term objectives (including preventing potential large-scale catastrophes, not only for those living today but also considering the broader scope of humanity's potential future). If the notions of positive futures seem ambiguous or ill-defined, it could be tempting to shift focus to more tangible, short-term goals.</li><li>Radical changes and (what we might think of as) the long-term future could be here surprisingly quickly, so we want to know what to aim for. See more below.</li></ul><p>As an end note here, we believe that, while conceptualizing VPF seems complicated, it is worth further effort; we haven\u2019t tried enough to conclude it is intractable.</p><h3>The future could be here sooner than we think</h3><p>This section, arguing that the future could be here sooner than we think, mainly summarizes some posts in Holden Karnofsky's Most Important Century series.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/the-duplicator/\"><u>The Duplicator: Instant Cloning Would Make the World Economy Explode</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/transformative-ai-timelines-part-1-of-4-what-kind-of-ai/\"><u>Forecasting Transformative AI, Part 1: What Kind of AI?</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/why-ai-alignment-could-be-hard-with-modern-deep-learning/\"><u>Why AI alignment could be hard with modern deep learning</u></a></li></ul><p>Standard economic theory suggests that any technology capable of fully automating innovation would lead to productivity skyrocketing to infinity this century. This is due to the creation of a powerful feedback loop: more resources lead to more innovation, which leads to more resources, and so on. To some extent, we have already seen this - economic history followed a loop of more resources, leading to more people, leading to more ideas, which led to more resources, and so on. However, a couple of hundred years ago, during the \"demographic transition,\" the \"more resources leading to more people\" dynamic of that loop stopped. Instead of leading to more people, more resources led to richer people; at least, this has been the case for more developed nations. If some other technology were to restore the \"more resources leading to more ideas\" dynamic, the feedback loop could come back. One such technology could be the right kind of AI, where more resources lead to more AIs, which lead to more ideas, which lead to more resources, and so on.&nbsp;This means that a radically different (long-run) future could be upon us shortly after relevant AI is developed (if it ever is). And as it seems relevant AI could be developed in the decades to come, our perspectives on which future to aim for may become increasingly important.</p><p>We think this raises the potential importance of conducting more research on VPF and desired futures now, particularly as we put some probability to scenarios where our current choices in non-trivial ways will shape future possibilities. By working to increase the chances of VPF, we enhance our likelihood of building AI systems and a society that not only mitigates downside risks but also brings about upside risks.</p><h3>Information value</h3><p>As indicated throughout this post, we believe little work has been done on VPF, and we think the potential value at hand is high but very uncertain. Thus, it seems there is substantial&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/value-of-information\"><u>information value</u></a> to be gained by further work and research on VPF. (Though we think it is far from obvious how to gain more information, making it less tractable.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Reasons why we might&nbsp;<u>not</u> want to focus more on VPF</h2><p>We want to stress that we feel uncertain about all our suggested reasons for concentrating more on VPF. Thus, relevant counterarguments could simply be negations of these suggestions. Below, we list the counterarguments that seem most relevant to us.</p><h3>We should prioritize work on avoiding existential risk</h3><p>As we have tried to highlight throughout the post, we think work on existential risk is extremely important. One of the authors, Vilhelm Skoglund, thinks this is where most people focusing on shaping the long-term future should direct their resources (and that there are compelling reasons for focusing on existential risk reduction also from a near-medium-term perspective) and is uncertain where resources should be directed on the margin in terms of focus on existential risk, vs. other approaches to shape the long term future. But you might think that it is clear that existential risk deserves more, or all, resources. There could be several reasons for this:</p><ul><li>We can work on VPF when we have reduced more urgent existential risk to a sufficient level, and there will not be any meaningful lock-in limiting the potential upside following from this delay.</li><li>There is a \u201clow\u201d upper bound on how good the future could be, that future civilizations can be expected to achieve, or that moral convergence is very likely, conditional on survival.</li><li>It is not tractable to find and/or take action that has big, contingent, and persistent effects on our long-term future other than reducing existential risk.</li><li>Building on the above, feedback loops for increasing the likelihood of VPF are (even) worse than feedback loops for decreasing existential risk.</li><li>One might prioritize existential risk from the expected value in the near-medium-term and not be (primarily) motivated by potential value in the long-term future.</li><li>Work on VPF could potentially (unintentionally) increase existential risks. For instance, by accelerating AI capabilities or atomically precise manufacturing without proper safety considerations.</li><li>It is (much) more important to avert expected suffering than to increase expected well-being. (This would likely push you to focus on decreasing S-risks rather than existential risks.)</li></ul><h3>VPF will <u>not</u> effectively motivate people to work on shaping the long-term future</h3><p>We have suggested some reasons why VPF might be an effective complementary framing to attract and motivate people to work on shaping the long-term future, including existential risk. Reasons you might disagree:</p><ul><li>VPF approaches, and messaging might attract individuals who are development-biased and underestimate the complexity of long-term challenges, leading to, at best, resources redirected to ineffective attempts to shape the long-term future and, at worst, naive accelerationism that causes harm.</li><li>Focus on VPF might be seen as detached from present concerns (more so than existential risk), leading to lashback from those focusing on the near term. It might exacerbate the perception that most people concerned about the long-term future, including existential risk, don\u2019t care much about near-term issues and/or are mainly motivated by small chances of astronomically good outcomes.</li><li>Focus on VPF might diminish the perceived urgency to take action today to bring about a positive long-term future and mitigate existential risks.</li><li>Several existential risks could affect those living today, making society more likely to engage with them for (partly) self-serving and near-term reasons. This might be especially true for institutions with built-in near-term focus, such as (most) political institutions.</li><li>Existential risk is simpler and more concrete than VPF, and when discussing existential risks, we agree on one fundamental point, in contrast to when discussing VPF; we desire survival and continued potential for good things but disagree on what those good things are. This might make existential risk a more compelling message for people to \u201crally\u201d behind. On this, and as noted above, it is hard to craft compelling visions for the future, and this might make such attempts ineffective.</li><li>VPF may seem overly optimistic or \"pollyannaish,\" as it may resonate with people as unrealistic expectations of a guaranteed positive future. Further, lack of progress or setbacks could lead to disappointment and loss of motivation to engage in work to shape the long-term future.</li><li>We should prioritize focusing more on individual causes, rather than VPF.</li></ul><h3>Work on VFP will have negative consequences</h3><p>Utopian thinking has a bad track record, and there might be a risk of similar developments with work on VPF. As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/01/18/actually-possible-thoughts-on-utopia\"><u>noted by Carlsmith</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;\u201cUtopian\u201d thinking has an aura, at best, of a kind of thin-ness and na\u00efvet\u00e9 \u2014 an aspiration to encompass all of the world\u2019s mess and contradiction in a top-down, rational plan, to \u201csolve things once and for all,\u201d to \u201cdo it right this time.\u201d Here one thinks of poorly but \u201crationally\u201d planned cities, failed communes, and the like.</p><p>And at worst, of course, Utopianism ends in abject horror. There is a certain type of fervor that comes from thinking, not just that paradise is possible, <i>but that you and your movement are actually, finally, building it. </i>In the grip of such enthusiasm, humans have historically been very willing to do things like \u201cpurge\u201d or \u201cpurify\u201d; to crush and suppress any opposition; to break eggs to make omelets, and so on.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>4. Ending Remarks</h2><p>This post has explored the concept of very positive long-term futures and its potential influence and value to the EA community and efforts to shape the long-term future.&nbsp;We remain uncertain about whether to invest more resources in VPF approaches and framings in the long term, but we think it seems plausible enough that we should spend resources to get higher clarity on this and experiment more with VPF approaches and framings.&nbsp;As mentioned, perhaps it could help us gain a better understanding of what futures to aim for, help prioritize between causes and interventions, and motivate more people to work on shaping the long-term future.&nbsp;</p><p>A few of our key uncertainties that have not been highlighted in the above counterarguments:</p><ul><li>How many are pursuing relevant work related to VPF in comparison to relevant work in existential risk?</li><li>Will (most of the) potential upside of the long-term future be harnessed by default, conditional on avoiding existential risks?</li><li>Apart from research similar to that of Ord, what are the most promising alternatives to existential risk reduction for shaping the long-term future? Are there any tractable causes or interventions?</li></ul><p>We\u2019d love to receive feedback on the post and the potential benefits and disadvantages of different approaches and framings, as well as those not covered in this post. Here are a few prompts for further discussion:</p><ul><li>What are your views on the potential pros and cons of more focus on VPF?&nbsp;&nbsp;With which points do you agree or disagree? What are other arguments?</li><li>Which term resonates most with you: Existential Hope, Positive Trajectory Change, Utopia, or perhaps a similar term not described in the post?</li><li>Are there any significant pieces of writing or research on this topic that we have overlooked?</li><li>What are the best accounts of VPF you're familiar with?&nbsp;</li><li>Do you think it would be useful with a more rigorous conceptual mapping or creation of frameworks and standardized terminology for VPF?</li></ul>", "user": {"username": "Vilhelm Skoglund"}}, {"_id": "Gj9yNFn3HJHJ3TKAD", "title": "RA Bounty: Looking for feedback on screenplay about AI Risk", "postedAt": "2023-10-26T14:27:12.219Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Writer"}}, {"_id": "3qpaRKe8R4ptiqSkr", "title": "UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Speech on AI", "postedAt": "2023-10-26T10:34:00.140Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Ahead of the AI Safety Summit starting in the UK next week, <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/prime-ministers-speech-on-ai-26-october-2023\">Prime Minister Rishi Sunak gave a speech talking about AI Safety and the UK's AI plans</a> (including the AI Safety Institute and the AI Safety Summit). He expresses concerns over catastrophic misuse and the risk of humanity losing control over artificial intelligence.<br><br>Here's the transcript, highlights are mine:</p><blockquote><p>I\u2019m delighted to be here at the Royal Society, the place where the story of modern science has been written for centuries.</p><p>Now, I\u2019m unashamedly optimistic about the power of technology to make life better for everyone.</p><p>So, the easy speech for me to give - the one in my heart I really want to give would be to tell you about the incredible opportunities before us.</p><p>Just this morning, I was at Moorfields Eye Hospital.</p><p>They\u2019re using Artificial Intelligence to build a model that can look at a single picture of your eyes and not only diagnose blindness, but predict heart attacks, strokes, or Parkinson\u2019s.</p><p>And that\u2019s just the beginning.</p><p><strong>I genuinely believe that technologies like AI will bring a transformation as far-reaching as the industrial revolution, the coming of electricity, or the birth of the internet.</strong></p><p>Now, as with every one of those waves of technology, AI will bring new knowledge new opportunities for economic growth, new advances in human capability and the chance to solve problems that we once thought beyond us.</p><p>But like those waves, it also brings new dangers and new fears.</p><p>So, the responsible thing for me to do \u2013 the right speech for me to make \u2013 is to address those fears head on giving you the peace of mind that we will keep you safe while making sure you and your children have all the opportunities for a better future that AI can bring.</p><p>Now, doing the right thing, not the easy thing, means being honest with people about the risks from these technologies.</p><p>So, I won\u2019t hide them from you.</p><p>That\u2019s why today, for the first time, we\u2019ve taken the highly unusual step of publishing our analysis on the risks of AI including an assessment by the UK intelligence communities.</p><p>These reports provide a stark warning.</p><p><strong>Get this wrong, and AI could make it easier to build chemical or biological weapons.</strong></p><p><strong>Terrorist groups could use AI to spread fear and destruction on an even greater scale.</strong></p><p><strong>Criminals could exploit AI for cyber-attacks, disinformation, fraud, or even child sexual abuse.</strong></p><p><strong>And in the most unlikely but extreme cases, there is even the risk that humanity could lose control of AI completely through the kind of AI sometimes referred to as \u2018super intelligence\u2019.</strong></p><p>Indeed, to quote the statement made earlier this year by hundreds of the world\u2019s leading AI experts:</p><p>\u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\u201d.</p><p>Now, I want to be completely clear:</p><p>This is not a risk that people need to be losing sleep over right now.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to be alarmist.</p><p>And there is a real debate about this - some experts think it will never happen at all.</p><p>But however uncertain and unlikely these risks are, if they did manifest themselves, the consequences would be incredibly serious.</p><p>And when so many of the biggest developers of this technology themselves warn of these risks leaders have a responsibility to take them seriously, and to act.</p><p>And that is what I am doing today \u2013 in three specific ways.</p><p>First, keeping you safe.</p><p>Right now, the only people testing the safety of AI are the very organisations developing it.</p><p>Even they don\u2019t always fully understand what their models could become capable of.</p><p>And there are incentives in part, to compete to build the best models, quickest.</p><p>So, we should not rely on them marking their own homework, as many of those working on this would agree.</p><p>Not least because only governments can properly assess the risks to national security.</p><p>And only nation states have the power and legitimacy to keep their people safe.</p><p>The UK\u2019s answer is not to rush to regulate.</p><p>This is a point of principle \u2013 we believe in innovation, it\u2019s a hallmark of the British economy so we will always have a presumption to encourage it, not stifle it.&nbsp;</p><p>And in any case, how can we write laws that make sense for something we don\u2019t yet fully understand?</p><p>So, instead, we\u2019re building world-leading capability to understand and evaluate the safety of AI models within government.</p><p>To do that, we\u2019ve already invested \u00a3100m in a new taskforce more funding for AI safety than any other country in the world.</p><p>And we\u2019ve recruited some of the most respected and knowledgeable figures in the world of AI.</p><p>So, I\u2019m completely confident in telling you the UK is doing far more than other countries to keep you safe.</p><p>And because of this \u2013 because of the unique steps we\u2019ve already taken \u2013 we\u2019re able to go even further today.</p><p><strong>I can announce that we will establish the world\u2019s first AI Safety Institute \u2013 right here in the UK.</strong></p><p><strong>It will advance the world\u2019s knowledge of AI safety.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>And it will carefully examine, evaluate, and test new types of AI so that we understand what each new model is capable of exploring all the risks, from social harms like bias and misinformation, through to the most extreme risks of all.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The British people should have peace of mind that we\u2019re developing the most advanced protections for AI of any country in the world.</p><p>Doing what\u2019s right and what\u2019s necessary to keep you safe.</p><p>But AI does not respect borders.</p><p>So we cannot do this alone.</p><p><strong>The&nbsp;second&nbsp;part of our plan is to host the world\u2019s first ever Global AI Safety Summit next week</strong>, at Bletchley Park \u2013 the iconic home of computer science.</p><p>We\u2019re bringing together the world\u2019s leading representatives from Civil Society to the companies pioneering AI and the countries most advanced in using it.</p><p>And yes \u2013 we\u2019ve invited China.</p><p>I know there are some who will say they should have been excluded.</p><p>But there can be no serious strategy for AI without at least trying to engage all of the world\u2019s leading AI powers.</p><p>That might not have been the easy thing to do, but it was the right thing to do.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So, what do we hope to achieve at next week\u2019s Summit?</strong></p><p><strong>Right now, we don\u2019t have a shared understanding of the risks that we face.</strong></p><p><strong>And without that, we cannot hope to work together to address them.</strong></p><p><strong>That\u2019s why we will push hard to agree the first ever international statement about the nature of these risks.</strong></p><p>Yet AI is developing at breath taking speed.&nbsp;</p><p>Every new wave will become more advanced, better trained, with better chips, and more computing power.</p><p>So we need to make sure that as the risks evolve, so does our shared understanding.</p><p>I believe we should take inspiration from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change which was set up to reach an international scientific consensus.</p><p><strong>So, next week, I will propose that we establish a truly global expert panel nominated by the countries and organisations attending &nbsp;to publish a State of AI Science report.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Of course, our efforts also depend on collaboration with the AI companies themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>Uniquely in the world, those companies have already trusted the UK with privileged access to their models.&nbsp;</p><p>That\u2019s why the UK is so well-placed to create the world\u2019s first Safety Institute.</p><p>And at next week\u2019s Summit I will work together with the companies and countries to deepen our partnerships.</p><p>My vision, and our ultimate goal, should be to work towards a more international approach to safety where we collaborate with partners to ensure AI systems are safe before they are released.</p><p>And so to support this, we will make the work of our Safety Institute available to the world.</p><p>That\u2019s the right thing to do morally, in keeping with the UK\u2019s historic role on the international stage.</p><p>And it\u2019s also the right thing economically, for families and businesses up and down the country.</p><p>Because the future of AI is safe AI.&nbsp;</p><p>And by making the UK a global leader in safe AI, we will attract even more of the new jobs and investment that will come from this new wave of technology.</p><p>Just think for a moment about what that will mean for our country.&nbsp;</p><p>The growth it will catalyse, the jobs it will create, the change it can deliver \u2013for the better.</p><p>And that\u2019s the&nbsp;third&nbsp;part of our plan \u2013 to make sure that everyone in our country can benefit from the opportunities of AI.</p><p>We\u2019ve already got strong foundations.</p><p>Third in the world for tech, behind only the US and China.</p><p>The best place in Europe to raise capital.&nbsp;</p><p>All of the leading AI companies - choosing the UK as their European headquarters.</p><p>The most pro-investment tax regime. The most pro-entrepreneur visa regime, to attract the world\u2019s top talent and the education reforms to give our own young people the skills to succeed.&nbsp;</p><p>And we\u2019re going to make it even easier for ambitious people with big ideas to start, grow, and compete in the world of AI.&nbsp;</p><p>That\u2019s not just about having the technical skills, but the raw computing power.&nbsp;</p><p>That\u2019s why we\u2019re investing almost a billion pounds in a supercomputer thousands of times faster than the one you have at home.&nbsp;</p><p>And it\u2019s why we\u2019re investing \u00a32.5bn in quantum computers, which can be exponentially quicker than those computers still.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To understand this, consider how Google\u2019s Sycamore quantum computer can solve a maths problem in 200 seconds, that would take the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer 10,000 years.</p><p>And as we invest more in our computing power, we\u2019ll make it available for researchers and businesses, as well as government so that when the best entrepreneurs in the world think about where they want to start and scale their AI businesses, they choose the UK.&nbsp;</p><p>And finally, we must target our scientific efforts towards what I think of as AI for good.</p><p>Right across the western world, we\u2019re searching for answers to the question of how we can improve and increase our productivity.</p><p>Because that\u2019s the only way over the long-term to grow our economy and raise people\u2019s living standards.&nbsp;</p><p>And in a million different ways, across every aspect of our lives, AI can be that answer.</p><p>In the public sector, we\u2019re clamping down on benefit fraudsters and using AI as a co-pilot to help clear backlogs and radically speed up paperwork.&nbsp;</p><p>Just take for example, the task of producing bundles for a benefits tribunal.</p><p>Before, a week\u2019s work could produce around 11.&nbsp;</p><p>Now \u2013 that takes less than an hour.&nbsp;</p><p>And just imagine the benefits of that rolled out across the whole of government.&nbsp;</p><p>In the private sector, start-ups like Robin AI are revolutionising the legal profession writing contracts in minutes, saving businesses and customers time and money.&nbsp;</p><p>London-based Wayve is using sophisticated AI software to create a new generation of electric, self-driving cars.</p><p>But more than all of this \u2013 AI can help us solve some of the greatest social challenges of our time. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It can help us finally achieve the promise of nuclear fusion, providing abundant, cheap, clean energy with virtually no emissions.</p><p>It can help us solve world hunger, by making food cheaper and easier to grow and preventing crop failures by accurately predicting when to plant, harvest or water your crops.</p><p>And AI could help find novel dementia treatments or develop vaccines for cancer.</p><p>That\u2019s why today we\u2019re investing a further \u00a3100m to accelerate the use of AI on the most transformational breakthroughs in treatments for previously incurable diseases.</p><p>Now I believe nothing in our foreseeable future will be more transformative for our economy, our society, and all our lives, than this technology.</p><p>But in this moment, it is also one of the greatest tests of leadership we face.</p><p>It would be easy to bury our heads in the sand and hope it\u2019ll turn out alright in the end.</p><p>To decide it\u2019s all too difficult, or the risks of political failure are too great.</p><p>To put short-term demands ahead of the long-term interest of the country.</p><p>But I won\u2019t do that.</p><p>I will do the right thing, not the easy thing.&nbsp;</p><p>I will always be honest with you about the risks.</p><p>And you can trust me to make the right long-term decisions giving you the peace of mind that we will keep you safe while making sure you and your children have all the opportunities for a better future that AI can bring.</p><p>I feel an extraordinary sense of purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>When I think about why I came into politics\u2026</p><p>Frankly, why almost anyone came into politics\u2026</p><p>It\u2019s because we want to make life better for people to give our children and grandchildren a better future.</p><p>And we strive, hour after hour, policy after policy, just trying to make a difference.</p><p>And yet, if harnessed in the right way, the power and possibility of this technology could dwarf anything any of us have achieved in a generation.&nbsp;</p><p>And that\u2019s why I make no apology for being pro-technology.&nbsp;</p><p>It\u2019s why I want to seize every opportunity for our country to benefit in the way I\u2019m so convinced that it can.&nbsp;</p><p>And it\u2019s why I believe we can and should, look to the future with optimism and hope.</p></blockquote><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "TobiasH"}},

reaching out to seek collaboration and support for an ambitious project known as OWSEN (One-Health Wastewater Surveillance for Emerging Pathogens in Plateau State, Nigeria).</p><h1><strong>Project Overview:</strong>&nbsp;</h1><p>OWSEN is a project that aims to harness the power of one-health wastewater surveillance to monitor the spread of emerging pathogens and antimicrobial resistance in Plateau State, Nigeria. This initiative involves the collection and metagenomic analysis of sewage and wastewater samples from various sources, including rivers, farms, gutters near hospitals, the airport, migratory birds, and abattoirs. By employing advanced metagenomic techniques, we aim to comprehensively detect the presence of all pathogens within these samples, shedding light on the circulating pathogens in the community. This is obviously a high-risk, high-yield project.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>One-Health Approach:</strong>&nbsp;</h1><p>Our project embraces the one-health concept, which takes a holistic approach to disease surveillance by examining the potential spillovers from animals to humans. This method is crucial for the early detection of prospective pandemics or ongoing epidemics, which is of paramount importance in our increasingly interconnected world.</p><h1><strong>Project Objectives:</strong></h1><ol><li>Conduct a comprehensive virological examination of wastewater at multiple sites in Jos, Plateau State.</li><li>Unveil resistomes in raw sewage through cutting-edge nanopore sequencing techniques.</li><li>Investigate the mobility of novel antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and their potential transfer to pathogens.</li><li>Identify critical settings where human-animal-environment interactions occur and sample accordingly to reveal important pathogenic organisms and resistant environmental bacteria.</li><li>Provide resources to facilitate the integration of routine wastewater surveillance in Nigeria.</li></ol><h2><strong>Importance:</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the significance of wastewater surveillance in tracking the spread of pathogens within communities. Wastewater sentinel surveillance serves as an early warning system for a wide range of pathogens, including flu, cholera, monkeypox, and typhoid. Additionally, it can identify hotspots of antimicrobial resistance genes.</p><h2><strong>Neglectedness:</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Wastewater surveillance studies in Plateau State, Nigeria, are underdeveloped, and there is no national wastewater surveillance strategy. Our project seeks to address this gap by collaborating with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to report pathogens and areas of concern.</p><h2><strong>Tractability:</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Investing in a robust national wastewater disease surveillance system can improve national preparedness for new infectious diseases and monitor the resurgence of known pathogens. Wastewater surveillance is particularly valuable for early disease diagnosis when clinical testing is not available, or individuals exhibit mild or no symptoms.</p><h2><strong>Feasibility Assessment:</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Plateau State has the necessary infrastructure and expertise for this project, including the National Veterinary Research Institute, BSLIII facilities, and your contributor's lab, which is well-equipped for field studies, molecular analysis, and bioinformatics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are now looking for collaborators, donors, and partners who share our passion for this project's mission. If you are interested in contributing your expertise, resources, or connections to help us secure funding and support for OWSEN, please reach out to me at <a href=\"mailto:eennadi@gmail.com\">eennadi@gmail.com</a> .</p><p>Let's work together to create a comprehensive early warning system that can safeguard the health of communities in Plateau State and beyond.</p><p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p><p>Best regards</p>", "user": {"username": "emmannaemeka"}}, {"_id": "fkPBQNNuDzSeX8jmp", "title": "Apply to the Constellation Visiting Researcher Program and Astra Fellowship, in Berkeley this Winter", "postedAt": "2023-10-26T03:14:41.715Z", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p><i>This is a link post for two AI safety programs we\u2019ve just opened applications for: </i><a href=\"https://www.constellation.org/programs/astra-fellowship\"><i><u>https://www.constellation.org/programs/astra-fellowship</u></i></a><i> and&nbsp; </i><a href=\"https://www.constellation.org/programs/researcher-program\"><i><u>https://www.constellation.org/programs/researcher-program</u></i></a></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"http://constellation.org\"><strong><u>Constellation</u></strong></a><strong> is a research center dedicated to safely navigating the development of transformative AI.</strong> We\u2019ve previously helped run&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vvocfhQ7bcBR4FLBx/apply-to-the-second-ml-for-alignment-bootcamp-mlab-2-in\"><u>the ML for Alignment Bootcamp (MLAB) series</u></a> and Redwood\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.redwoodresearch.org/remix\"><u>month-long research program on model internals (REMIX)</u></a> in addition to a variety of other field-building programs &amp; events.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff0wvag8ixj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf0wvag8ixj\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>This winter, we are running two programs aimed at growing and supporting the ecosystem of people working on AI safety:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.constellation.org/programs/researcher-program\"><strong><u>The Constellation Visiting Researcher Program</u></strong></a> provides an opportunity for around 20 researchers to connect with leading AI safety researchers, exchange ideas, and find collaborators while continuing their research from our offices in Berkeley, CA.

We appreciate his work, which led us to investigate some questions about iron fortification programs in India that we had not previously considered.</p>\n<p>Below, we discuss Akash's arguments, the additional research we've conducted in response to the issues he raised, and our current views.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>GiveWell has granted roughly $9.5 million to support iron fortification programs in India so far, and may consider additional grants going forward.</li>\n<li>In his post, Akash argues that GiveWell is overestimating the cost-effectiveness of iron fortification in India\u2014his arguments imply that the program may only be around 4x as cost-effective as cash transfers, compared to GiveWell's current estimate of 9x.</li>\n<li>Several of Akash's arguments focus on external validity\u2014the extent to which existing evidence on how to define anemia and the impact of iron fortification on reducing anemia applies to populations in India. A summary of Akash\u2019s claims, their potential impact on cost-effectiveness, and our assessment of those claims is below. Relevant calculations are in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nxfEitNiYT76szzf_G19KRslfzmn-ZMIN8MzMACMFws/edit#gid=0\">this spreadsheet</a>. <strong>We've currently concluded against updating our cost-effectiveness analysis for iron fortification programs in India based on Akash's specific arguments, but we do think that continued consideration of external validity issues for iron fortification programs in India is warranted.</strong></li>\n<li>In <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2gG7eeDD5uqud4Rfm/cost-effectiveness-of-iron-fortification-in-india-is-lower\">his post</a>, Akash argues:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Anemia prevalence in India may be overestimated in our models, due to the hemoglobin cutoffs we use.</strong> This argument is based on a 2021 paper by <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X21000772\">Sachdev et al.</a> that claims cutoffs for defining anemia based on hemoglobin levels should be <em>lower</em> for India than those adopted by WHO, which are based on data from countries in North America and Europe. Sachdev et al. claim that using their recommended hemoglobin concentration cutoffs for 0 to 19 year-olds in India would result in a drop of anemia prevalence of 19 percentage points. If we followed this recommendation, our anemia prevalence estimate for 0 to 19 year-olds in India would drop from 44% to 25% and our estimate of anemia YLDs (Years Lived with Disability) would be cut in half. We estimate that, taken at face value, this concern would lower the cost-effectiveness of iron fortification programs in India by roughly 54%.</li>\n<li><strong>The proportion of anemia cases in India caused by iron deficiency may be overestimated in our models.</strong> This is based on research indicating that areas with higher levels of infectious disease may have a lower than average proportion of anemia caused by inadequate iron intake (and a higher proportion caused by inflammation as a response to infections). This would limit the share of anemia burden that is addressable by iron fortification programs. Akash did not specify how much this concern might impact cost-effectiveness.</li>\n<li><strong>There may be harms of iron fortification GiveWell isn't accounting for, such as higher risk of type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</strong> This is based on research showing an association between blood iron levels and these conditions. We make a rough guess that these concerns, taken at face value, would lower cost-effectiveness by 10%.</li>\n<li><strong>There may be ethical considerations or reputational risk related to iron fortification in India.</strong> Akash notes that GiveWell might be perceived as interfering with individuals\u2019 personal choices on whether to consume iron-fortified food or not, which is especially concerning given the additional harms of iron fortification he lists above.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>In response to Akash's concerns, we reviewed the literature he cited, and also spoke with three iron and anemia experts and a person familiar with public perceptions of food fortification in India.</li>\n<li>Based on our research, our current bottom line is:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>We don\u2019t think we should lower cost-effectiveness to account for the potential for lower hemoglobin cutoffs for anemia in Indian populations</strong>: We spoke to an anonymous iron and anemia expert who was critical of the methodology of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X21000772\">Sachdev et al. 2021</a>, since the sample studied may not have been fully healthy (which could explain their lower hemoglobin concentrations). He also noted that he thinks there are not clear theoretical explanations for why anemia cutoff thresholds would differ by race or nationality. This makes us think there aren't compelling enough reasons to disagree with the current WHO guidelines.</li>\n<li><strong>We don't think that we should lower our cost-effectiveness estimates to account for a larger share of anemia being driven by infection, rather than iron deficiency.</strong> Based on a shallow review, we don't think this is a greater concern among populations reached by Fortify Health's programs in India compared to the settings of the trials we're relying on to estimate the impact of iron fortification on anemia (Brazil, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and the Philippines). Additionally, we have seen evidence from trials of iron supplementation that iron interventions can have a large impact on anemia prevalence in India, which suggests that iron deficiency is an important cause of anemia (at least among the specific populations studied in the trials).</li>\n<li><strong>We don\u2019t think we should update our cost-effectiveness estimates due to risk of type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</strong> We think the evidence for iron fortification causing increased risk of these diseases is fairly weak, based on a light review of the evidence and discussions with an iron and anemia expert.</li>\n<li><strong>We think the reputational risk of funding iron fortification in India is low.</strong> We guess the risks of iron fortification are very low relative to the benefits, which we think limits ethical concerns.

Quoting from his post:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Multiple pieces critical of iron fortification have been published recently in leading Indian newspapers (<a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/inescapable-risks-of-mandatory-iron-fortification/article37986787.ece\">The Hindu</a>, <a href=\"https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rice-fortification-programme-iron-anaemia-7470938/\">Indian Express</a>, <a href=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/report-says-iron-fortified-rice-unscientific-and-risky/articleshow/92349468.cms\">Times of India</a>). International philanthropy/charities already tend to be viewed with a degree of hostility in India and it's possible EA gets dragged under the bus because of its support for iron fortification.\"</li>\n<li>\"I'm worried about the ethics of fortification with respect to the way it takes away agency from the dietary choices of people. This seems okay if we can be extremely confident that the choices being pushed have minimal risks of harm (a priori seems true for chlorination of water and vitamin A supplementation) but iron doesn't seem to as clear-cut. It also seems important that GiveWell consults with medical and public health researchers from respective countries where interventions are being assessed to catch country-specific considerations.\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We agree that these are important issues, and we thank Akash for raising them. Below are our current responses to these concerns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Individual agency in dietary decisions:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We think that the issue of individual agency has limited relevance to most of the iron fortification programs we've supported in India so far. Fortify Health has primarily focused its work on partnering with specific millers who sell wheat flour in the open market.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-52\" id=\"fnref-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-52\">[52]</a></sup> Our understanding is that Fortify Health's partner mills use labels to indicate that their flour is fortified, and that individuals who would prefer to buy unfortified flour remain able to purchase other brands.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>However, Fortify Health also partners with mills producing flour for consumption in schools and in India's public distribution system (PDS), a social safety net program.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-53\" id=\"fnref-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-53\">[53]</a></sup> The concern about limiting individuals' ability to choose whether or not to consume fortified flour appears more relevant to these programs than Fortify Health's open market fortification.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We acknowledge that the issue of food fortification and individual agency in dietary decisions is complex, but we currently don't expect this to be a determining factor in our grant decisions. Akash's concern appears to be motivated in part by the perception of increased risk of type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease due to iron fortification, which we are less convinced of. Our overall view is that the risks of iron fortification are very low relative to the benefits, which we think limits ethical concerns.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-54\" id=\"fnref-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-54\">[54]</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Reputational risk:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>We spoke with Advait Deshpande, a food technologist who has worked on scaling up food fortification programs in eastern states in India, to learn more about public perceptions of food fortification in India.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-55\" id=\"fnref-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-55\">[55]</a></sup> Our overall view following the conversation was that the reputational risk to GiveWell of funding iron fortification programs in India is low.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some highlights from our conversation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>General concerns about fortification:</strong> Advait noted that food fortification in India is a somewhat contentious issue in some circles, but that the debate tended to focus on whether fortification is driven by corporate interests or genuine concern for public health, more so than concerns about limiting individual choice.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-56\" id=\"fnref-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-56\">[56]</a></sup> Advait also emphasized that implementing food fortification (especially rice fortification) is a major priority of the national government over the next few years.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-57\" id=\"fnref-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-57\">[57]</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>International philanthropy:</strong> Advait told us that there are Indian government regulations about the influence of funding from foreign sources through NGOs, but that this didn't present a risk as long as the organizations we fund in India are properly registered and following appropriate regulations.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-58\" id=\"fnref-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-58\">[58]</a></sup> Fortify Health has shared documents with us providing details on its legal structure and registration in India.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-59\" id=\"fnref-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-59\">[59]</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Continued research on external validity</h2>\n<p>We expect to continue to research external validity issues when considering future grants to iron fortification programs in India\u2014some potential areas for research are listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To what extent does consumption of tea (or other iron absorption inhibitors) reduce iron absorption in Fortify Health's populations, as compared to groups studied in the wheat flour fortification RCTs?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-60\" id=\"fnref-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-60\">[60]</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>To what extent does consumption of iron absorption enhancers (e.g., ascorbic acid - i.e., vitamin C) enhance iron absorption in Fortify Health's populations, as compared to groups studied in the wheat flour fortification RCTs?<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-61\" id=\"fnref-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-61\">[61]</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Trials included in <a href=\"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011302.pub3/full\">Field et al. 2021</a> primarily focused on children and adolescents.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-62\" id=\"fnref-2o27AmeDhwSxrwWhg-62\">[62]</a></sup> Are any external validity adjustments appropriate for adults reached by wheat flour fortification programs?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>How is iron-fortified food distributed across different individuals at the household level?

I\u2019d like to solve the puzzle.</p><p>While also pointing out the puzzles that remain unsolved.</p><p>[Note: Unattributed quotes here are from the book. The number refers to the Kindle location of the quote. The ability to easily do this is why I read such books on Kindle.]</p><p>Who Was This Guy?</p><blockquote><p>By the end of this walk I was totally sold. I called my friend and said something like: Go for it! Swap shares with Sam Bankman-Fried! Do whatever he wants to do! What could possibly go wrong? It was only later that I realized I hadn\u2019t even begun to answer his original question: Who was this guy? (70)</p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s the central mystery of the book. It\u2019s not the money. It\u2019s SBF. Who was this guy?</p><p>The book solves this mystery, despite Lewis not noticing he has done so.</p><p>This is a very raw-G \u2018smart\u2019 person, who manufactured an entirely artificial superficial charm, has grandiose self-worth, pathologically lies, is endlessly manipulative, lacks remorse or guilt, has extreme emotional shallowness, fails to accept responsibility for anything ever, needs stimulation constantly to the point of constantly fidgeting, never sleeping and playing video games during television appearances, is constantly impulsive and irritable and irresponsible, has goals like going infinite and mostly does things without any plan or vision at all, did all the crimes and the first opportunity he got had his bail revoked, although Lewis seems to be in denial about the crimes and the bail got revoked after the book\u2019s events.</p><p>There are two other things on the list I\u2019m drawing from there, but I think we get the point? This should not be a hard type to recognize once we have everything in front of us. It also is presumably not an especially new personality type to the author of The Big Short, Flash Boys and Liar\u2019s Poker. I mean, come on.</p><p>Nor is this a type of person who we could consider might not be committing fraud if you put him in charge of a crypto exchange. There would not even be a distinction in their head between \u2018fraud\u2019 and \u2018not fraud,\u2019 between \u2018I tell truth\u2019 and \u2018I tell lie\u2019 or between \u2018customer money\u2019 and \u2018money.\u2019</p><p>To them, there are only actions and (some of their) consequences. If the customer asks for their money and you don\u2019t have it, or people find out you don\u2019t have the money, or that you said you had the money and you didn\u2019t (or that you took the money), people might get mad. They might demand their money back. Don\u2019t let that happen. That would be bad. But also don\u2019t worry about it.</p><p>Is that \u2018fraud sort of happened?\u2019 It is \u2018super ultra fraud from day one?\u2019 Yes.</p><p>What about the Effective Altruism and the Benthamite Utilitarianism? Was that for real? Yes, in an abstract intellectual way. Number go up. There needs to be McGuffin. A utility function. A justification for everything. This provided one.</p><p>If SBF was not so impulsive and impatient, we would not be able to tell. This is the Orthogonality Thesis and Instrumental Convergence. A proper SBF, with an actual linear utility function and expected impact curve, with any sane discount rate, would not be in the business of shoveling money out the window well before he\u2019d maxed out his ability to provide himself with operating capital and guard against downside risks.</p><p>Instead, he would have done the amount necessary to convince most people he was sincere, as this would serve his purposes. Optimal fully fake SBF would be vegan and drive a Toyota Corolla. This was different. Next level. Could he fool me this way?</p><p>Sure, if he wanted to. But I believe him exactly because there would be no value in investing this much in order to fool me. We see him shoveling tons of money out the door, well in advance of any reasonable pace for doing so and in deeply irresponsible fashion, often in ways that plausibly make things worse while also putting him at risk.</p><p>That does not mean his positions on any of this were coherent, or optimized, or made any sense, or was a good thing, or anything like that. That if he had made his utilitarian Number Go Up that I or you would have liked that world, or that his play was +EV even by his own metrics. It also does not mean that his motivations would have survived as he gained further wealth and power. It does mean that I buy that he wanted to make the utilitarian Number Go Up as he saw it, up until the end.</p><p>In particular, this caught my eye:</p><blockquote><p>In 2018, trading $40 million in capital, Alameda Research had generated $30 million in profits. Their effective altruist investors took half, leaving behind $15 million. Five million of that was lost to payroll and severance for the departing crowd; another $5 was lost to expenses. On the remaining $5 million they\u2019d paid taxes, and so, after all was said and done, they\u2019d donated to effective altruist causes just $1.5 million. (1,841)</p></blockquote><p>At this time, they were borrowing at 50% (!) interest in order to trade, were very much in danger of going broke, very much liquidity constrained, and the claim is they donated much or all of their yearly profits. This is a completely crazy thing to do, in a way that could not possibly have had sufficient signaling value to compensate for it, especially since it also sends other highly negative signals.</p><p>So I am inclined to believe him.</p><p>Also, that is not how any of this works. That is not what profits mean. Your expenses count. Your payroll counts. This is absurd.</p><p>Oh, and by the way: <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/186187/alameda-promised-high-returns-with-no-risk-in-2018-pitch\">This is their 2018 deck, the same year, which claims &gt;100% consistent annualized returns</a> (and \u2018no risk\u2019).</p><p>So, yes. A fraud from the start.</p><p>What about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23462333/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-cryptocurrency-effective-altruism-crypto-bahamas-philanthropy\">the Vox interview with Kelsey Piper</a>? Didn\u2019t SBF admit to having no ethics, to it all being a lie? Well, kind of. He admitted that he plays lots of stupid signaling games and pretends to care about various issues including woke ones, and that he treats all that with contempt. He showed he cares not one bit for ethics, that reputation is only instrumental to him.</p><p>But all of that is totally compatible with being a true believer in EA and Benthamite Utilitarianism. <a href=\"https://time.com/6321668/michael-lewis-sam-bankman-fried-going-infinite/\">In a post-book interview</a>, Lewis calls the interview an aberration. But it wasn\u2019t an aberration. It was peak Sam all the way.</p><p>How did he get to be that way? We\u2019ll return to that at the end of the story.</p><p>Where Was This Guy?</p><p>This proved a bigger question than one might expect, well before SBF had any reason to be on the run. According to Lewis, SBF tasked a woman named Natalie, with no relevant prior experience in such matters, to manage all of his logistics and scheduling and also PR. And then SBF systematically ignored her advice, caused constant shitshows, and failed to tell her even where he was going to be or whether he intended to keep any of his prior commitments.</p><p>Luckily, she was a quick study.</p><blockquote><p>She could never be sure where he was, for a start. \u201cDon\u2019t expect that he\u2019ll tell you where he\u2019s going to be at when,\u201d said Natalie. \u201cHe\u2019ll never tell you. You need to be smart and fast to find out by yourself.\u201d And Sam might be anywhere, at any hour. She\u2019d book him a room for two nights at the Four Seasons in Washington, DC, and Sam might even check in, but never enter the room. (174)</p><p>There had been nights Natalie had gone to bed at 3:00 a.m., set an alarm for 7:00, woken up to see what public relations shitstorm Sam might have caused in the interim, set a second alarm for 8:00, checked again, then set another alarm and fallen back to sleep until 9:30. (180)</p><p>She learned to humor the professor at Harvard, for example, by saying, \u201cYes, Sam told me he agreed to come and speak to a room full of important Harvard people at two next Friday. It\u2019s on his schedule.\u201d Yet even as she uttered those words, she\u2019d already invented the excuse she\u2019d make to that same Harvard person, likely next Thursday night, to explain why Sam would be nowhere near Massachusetts. Sam has Covid. The prime minister needed to see Sam. Sam is stuck in Kazakhstan. (195)</p></blockquote><p>Why? Because Sam did not care about keeping his word or commitments. At all. Not unless he could point to concrete negative consequences of not doing so, which mostly did not much bother him. He cared about what he felt like doing, what seemed worth doing.</p><blockquote><p>They didn\u2019t know that inside Sam\u2019s mind was a dial, with zero on one end and one hundred on the other. All he had done, when he said yes, was to assign some non-zero probability to the proposed use of his time. The dial would swing wildly as he calculated and recalculated the expected value of each commitment, right up until the moment he honored it or didn\u2019t. (187)</p><p>The funny thing about these situations was that Sam never really meant to cause them, which in a way made them feel even more insulting. He didn\u2019t mean to be rude. He didn\u2019t mean to create chaos in other people\u2019s lives. He was just moving through the world in the only way he knew how. The cost this implied for others simply never entered his calculations. With him it was never personal. If he stood you up, it was never on a whim, or the result of thoughtlessness. It was because he\u2019d done some math in his head that proved that you weren\u2019t worth the time. (199)</p><p>It required him to estimate probabilities, but also to guess. This was important; Sam didn\u2019t care for games, like chess, where the players controlled everything and the best move was in theory perfectly calculable. (250)</p></blockquote><p>[Gamer\u2019s note: Sam did love bughouse, which is 4-player chess played on two boards. In theory it is indeed solvable, in practice there are enough variables you have to wing it. But this emphasizes that what matters to Sam is almost certainly that something is probabilistic in practice, not in theory.]</p><p>This was less \u2018calculated\u2019 than \u2018some math\u2019 by which we mean something between Fermi estimate, motivated five second approximation and ass pull. You can throw together numbers that justify whatever, if that is what you are inclined to do. Somehow Lewis thinks that \u2018done some math in his head\u2019 does not represent \u2018a whim\u2019 or \u2018thoughtlessness.\u2019 Yes, Sam thought he had something better to do with his time, he didn\u2019t feel like doing what he said he would do. Call that exactly what it always is.</p><p>It gets easier if you give exactly zero consideration to the costs you impose on others, or how they might react, or the mess others will need to clean up, or any ethical considerations, or any second-order or other considerations he didn\u2019t notice when giving this a few seconds of thought. Sam would likely object this is not quite right, he does consider the cost to the person inconvenienced, but doesn\u2019t care more about the person he\u2019s inconveniencing than he would to people halfway across the world, so the size is trivial and who cares really? Think of all the good Sam can do by leaving you alone at lunch.</p><p>It also gets easier if you decide to treat your utility of money as linear, despite this being completely Obvious Nonsense on so many levels, such as whether not having enough money might suddenly be a real problem that meant the music would stop, and many clear acknowledgements that he had zero idea how to efficiently deploy even the money he already had.</p><p>Who Was This Guy as a Kid?</p><p>Books like this ask such questions. People think it matters. So here are some quotes?</p><blockquote><p>The trip to the amusement park was a good example. When Sam was a small child, his mother had located a Six Flags or Great America park. She\u2019d hauled him dutifully from amusement to amusement until she realized Sam wasn\u2019t amused. Instead of throwing himself into the rides, he was watching her. \u201cAre you having fun, Mom?\u201d he asked finally, by which he meant, Is this really your or anyone else\u2019s idea of fun? \u201cI realized I had been busted,\u201d said Barbara [Sam\u2019s mom]. (397)</p></blockquote><p>Yes. It actually is many people\u2019s idea of fun. What interests me here is Barbara\u2019s reaction. Why is she busted? The correct answer is \u2018No, I\u2019m here for you, and I\u2019d be happy if you were having fun. A lot of kids find this kind of thing fun and I thought you might as well, but it is clear you aren\u2019t.\u2019</p><p>The idea that you as a parent have to not only take them on but also enjoy their kid activities is so toxic. Kid activities, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RBlqjEEm1s&amp;ab_channel=augustv123\">like Trix</a>, are for kids.</p><p>Then his mother realized that SBF was instead interested in talking about real things.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI told him I was giving some paper, and he asked, \u2018What\u2019s it on?\u2019 \u201d I gave him a bullshit answer, and he pressed me on it, and by the end of the walk we were in the middle of a deep conversation about the argument. The points he was making were better than any of the reviewers\u2019. At that moment my parenting style changed.\u201d (404)</p></blockquote><p>This must have been so amazing. I can\u2019t wait for this to happen to me with my kids.</p><p>And yet, she says everything changed, but it does not sound like she updated enough:</p><blockquote><p>One interpretation of Sam\u2019s childhood is that he was simply waiting for it to end. That\u2019s how he thought about it, more or less: that he was holding his breath until other people grew up so he could talk to them. (459)</p><p>One day, in the seventh grade, it slipped. His mother returned from work to find Sam alone, in despair. \u201cI came home, and he was crying,\u201d recalled Barbara. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m so bored I\u2019m going to die.\u2019 (479)</p><p>By high school Sam had decided that he just didn\u2019t like school, which was odd for a person who would finish at the top of his class. He\u2019d also decided that at least some of the fault lay not with him but with school. (498)</p></blockquote><p>School drove SBF away from books by forcing him to engage in stupid ways with stupid books, which SBF would later justify with arguments about information density.</p><blockquote><p>In elementary school he\u2019d read the Harry Potter books over and over. By the eighth grade he had stopped reading books altogether. \u201cYou start to associate it with a negative feeling, and you stop liking it,\u201d he said. (505)</p></blockquote><p>Seriously, what the actual f*** was SBF doing in a high school? (Also, why would he want to read the Harry Potter books a second time, one of the deeper unsolved mysteries remaining?) He was doing philosophy better than philosophers, off the cuff. He was bored out of his mind.</p><p>At their semi-famous deeply philosophical family dinners, SBF would hold his own against various guests. He wanted to talk and think about real things.</p><p>His parents decided to\u2026 send him to a more competitive high school?</p><p>They quite obviously should have instead sent him to Stanford.</p><p>Not that college ultimately went so well for Sam.</p><blockquote><p>Two years of college classes and the previous summer\u2019s internship, during which he\u2019d helped MIT researchers with their projects, had killed that assumption. During college lectures he\u2019d experienced a boredom that had the intensity of physical pain.</p></blockquote><p>If he had been four years younger, perhaps it would have gone better.</p><p>Maybe they should have made him a gamer instead?</p><blockquote><p>In sixth grade Sam heard about a game called Magic: The Gathering. For the next four years it was the only activity that consumed him faster than he could consume it. (539)</p></blockquote><p>Or let him found a business or write or otherwise do something real.</p><p>Instead they did none of that. You give a child endless bullshit that can\u2019t keep him engaged? He\u2019s going to call you on it, whether it is an amusement park ride or pretentiousness.</p><blockquote><p>The very first question on the final exam set him off. What\u2019s the difference between art and entertainment? \u201cIt\u2019s a bullshit distinction dreamed up by academics trying to justify the existence of their jobs,\u201d wrote Sam, and handed the exam back. (532)</p></blockquote><p>Or\u2026 Shakespeare? Here\u2019s the now-famous quote.</p><blockquote><p>I could go on and on about the failings of Shakespeare&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but really I shouldn\u2019t need to: the Bayesian priors are pretty damning. About half the people born since 1600 have been born in the past 100 years, but it gets much worse than that. When Shakespeare wrote almost all Europeans were busy farming, and very few people attended university; few people were even literate\u2014probably as low as ten million people. By contrast there are now upwards of a billion literate people in the Western sphere. What are the odds that the greatest writer would have been born in 1564? The Bayesian priors aren\u2019t very favorable. (519)</p></blockquote><p>This is classic SBF thinking. Choose some considerations, ignore others opinions entirely and treat them as dumb, answer a different question than everyone else is asking, completely disregard aesthetics and history and really all context of any kind.</p><p>Here is early SBF doing philosophy to explain why the math says that actually murder is usually bad.</p><blockquote><p>There are lots of good reasons why murder is usually a really bad thing: you cause distress to the friends and family of the murdered, you cause society to lose a potentially valuable member in which it has already invested a lot of food and education and resources, and you take away the life of a person who had already invested a lot into it. (602)</p><p>In the end murder is just a word and what\u2019s important isn\u2019t whether you try to apply the word to a situation but the facts of the situation that caused you to describe it as murder in the first place. (607)</p></blockquote><p>Murder is just a word.</p><p>So is fault?</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI\u2019m a utilitarian,\u201d [SBF] wrote. \u201cFault is just a construct of human society. It serves different purposes for different people. It can be a tool to discourage bad actions; an attempt to recover pride in the face of hardship, an outlet for rage, and many more things. I guess maybe the most important definition\u2014to me, at least\u2014is how did everyone\u2019s actions reflect on the probability distribution of their future behavior?\u201d (1,797)</p></blockquote><p>Indeed, why would any of those other aspects matter? Why stay stuck in the past?</p><p>SBF bites all the bullets, all the time, as we see throughout. Murder is bad because look at all the investments and productivity that would be lost, and the distress particular people might feel. I hope there isn\u2019t too much on the other side of that ledger today. Luckily this one stayed theoretical as far as we know, but it sure sounds like SBF has no \u2018on principle\u2019 objection to killing an innocent person if they were to be standing in his way and it was especially important to not miss his next meeting. Or they kept saying inconvenient things.</p><p>To be fair, although I think the quote is more insightful without it, I did delete an important sentence in between those two quotes, which was:</p><blockquote><p>But none of those apply to abortion. (602)</p></blockquote><p>Why Was That Guy So Misaligned?</p><p>Since everything these days is about AI, consider SBF as a misaligned AGI (or NGI?).</p><p>Was Sam born a criminal? Of all Sam\u2019s characterizes in the list I open with, one of the few that is conspicuously missing involves doing juvenile crimes.</p><p>Why would he? There was no point. Crime looked boring. Until it didn\u2019t.</p><p>Having spent his entire childhood bored out of his mind, with no goal or utility function beyond not being bored, and having been sufficiently disabused of the virtues of academia, Sam did not know what to do. What would be a worthy goal or activity? Here we had this super smart person, lacking the motivations and interests that drive ordinary people, at a loss. What to do?</p><p>In stepped Will MacAskill, who suggested the goal of Number Go Up.</p><blockquote><p>The argument that MacAskill put to Sam and a small group of Harvard students in the fall of 2012 went roughly as follows: you, student at an elite university, will spend roughly eighty thousand hours of your life working. If you are the sort of person who wants to \u201cdo good\u201d in the world, what is the most effective way to spend those hours? It sounded like a question to which there were only qualitative answers, but MacAskill framed it in quantitative terms. He suggested that the students judge the effectiveness of their lives by counting the number of lives they saved during those eighty thousand hours. The goal was to maximize the number. (819)</p><p>\u201cThe demographics of who this appeals to are the demographics of a physics PhD program,\u201d he said. \u201cThe levels of autism ten times the average. Lots of people on the spectrum.\u201d (849)</p></blockquote><p>The utilitarian part of this equation, the part where people don\u2019t matter as individuals including himself, was already there.</p><blockquote><p>The notion that other people don\u2019t matter as much as I do felt like a stretch,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it would be bizarre even to think about.\u201d (584)</p></blockquote><p>Of course from your perspective you must in important senses care about yourself more than other people. You must care about those around you, close to you, in a different way than others. Without this both your life and also society fall apart, the engine of creation stops, the defectors extract everything, and so on. The consequences, the utilitarian calculus, is self-refuting.</p><p>Even more than that, if you take such abstractions too seriously, if you follow the math wherever it goes without pausing to check whether wrong conclusions are wrong? If you turn yourself into a system that optimizes for a maximalist goal like \u2018save the most lives\u2019 or \u2018do the most good\u2019 along a simple metric? What do you get?</p><p>You get misaligned, divorced from human values, aiming for a proxy metric that will often break even on the margin due to missing considerations, and break rather severely at scale if you gain too many affordances and push on it too hard, which is (in part, from one perspective) the SBF story.</p><p>Yet SBF did not take such concerns seriously. As many (very far from all!) others I know in EA do not take such concerns seriously. The math is treated as real, the metric as the map as the territory, and so on.</p><p>MacAskill set SBF on a maximalist goal using an abstracted ungrounded simplified metric, hoping to extract a maximal amount of SBF\u2019s resources for MacAskill\u2019s (on their face altruistic) goals.</p><p>Did MacAskill understand the inevitable result? Would he have approved of the actions taken, or the consequences of them? No.</p><p>Nor do I expect he people who set other people and systems on such paths, most of the time, to appreciate what they are doing or what the consequences will be, either.</p><p>That does not change what MacAskill did: He took young SBF, a powerful agent, a proto-utilitarian in want of a functioning definition of utility and a willingness to bite all of the bullets and ignore all of the unprincipled reasons not to be a terrible person doing terrible things, and gave him a maximalist utility function to save the most lives possible (or do the most good possible, as defined by things that can be quantified and measured, and then added up linearly, with no risk aversion).</p><p>Then he pointed out and argued explicitly that the way to do that was via instrumental convergence. Rather than doing good or saving lives directly, you could maximize money, and then spend the money to do the good or save the lives. Which meant that SBF\u2019s behaviors should look no different from anyone looking to make money, except when you give the money away afterwards. That was the intended path.</p><p>And then that led SBF directly into contact with finance and trading, and their zero-sum-style competitions, and to move from chess and Magic to trading as his puzzle of choice.</p><p>What happened with SBF will happen with an AI given a similar target, in terms of having misalignments that start out tolerable but steadily grow worse as capabilities increase and you face situations outside of the distribution, and things start to spiral to places very far than anything you ever would have intended.</p><p>Imagine a world in which SBF\u2019s motivations had even less anchors to human intuition, and also he had a much larger capabilities advantage over others (say he was orders of magnitude faster, and could make instantiations of himself?) and he had acted such that the house of cards had not come crashing down, and instead of taking the risks and trying to score object-level wins prematurely he had mostly instead steadily accumulated more money and power, until no one could stop him, and his inclination to risk all of humanity every time he felt he had a tiny edge under some math calculation.</p><p>Which for a while was kind of fine, because he\u2019d landed at Jane Street (which we\u2019ll cover soon), where they had strong alignment and good supervision of their agents, and where the way to succeed and make money and climb the incentive gradient was to be socially responsible and honest and manage risk and make money straight up and pretend to be a normal person with normal tones of voice and facial expressions. So he did his best on all such fronts, and for a while it was fine, or fine-ish.</p><p>Then he left Jane Street for crypto, where fraud was par for the course, because that was also where he could make the most money, which was what MacAskill told him to do. A world full of fraud, and a world vulnerable to fraud, where everyone was constantly breaking the rules and laws.</p><p>Then, as they always do, cheating, lying and fraud fed upon themselves. Get away with a little, feel the rush, get reinforced, update you can get away with a little more. Grow contempt for the rules. Rince. Repeat. Once the doom loop starts, it rarely stops until the inevitable blow-up.</p><p>The rest is the last few chapters of the book.</p><p>Also notice how little anyone did to try and stop him, despite all the giant fire alarms, other than those he directly attacked before he was ready to do so.</p><p>Will All of This Happen Again?</p><p>We are still doing this.</p><p>We are taking many of the brightest young people. We are telling them to orient themselves as utility maximizers with scope sensitivity, willing to deploy instrumental convergence. Taught by modern overprotective society to look for rules they can follow so that they can be blameless good people, they are offered a set of rules that tells them to plan their whole lives around sacrifices on an alter, with no limit to the demand for such sacrifices. And then, in addition to telling them to in turn recruit more people to and raise more money for the cause, we point them into the places they can earn the best \u2018career capital\u2019 or money or \u2018do the most good,\u2019 which more often than not have structures that systematically destroy these people\u2019s souls.</p><p>SBF was a special case. He among other things, and in his own words, did not have a soul to begin with. But various versions of this sort of thing are going to keep happening, if we do not learn to ground ourselves in real (virtue?!) ethics, in love of the world and its people.</p><p>All of this has happened before. If we are not careful, all of this will happen again.</p><p>Was there a reckoning, a post-mortem, an update, for those who need one? Somewhat. Not anything like enough. There was a rush to deontology that died away quickly, mostly retreating back into its special enclave of veganism. There were general recriminations. There were lots of explicit statements that no, of course we did not mean that and of course we do not endorse any of that, no one should be doing any of that. And yes, I think everyone means it. But it\u2019s based on, essentially, unprincipled hacks on top of the system, rather than fixing the root problem, and the smartest kids in the world are going to keep noticing this. We need to instead dig into the root causes, to design systems and find ways of being that do not need such hacks, while still preserving what makes such real efforts to seek truth and change the world for the better special in the first place.</p><p>Then we are going to do the same thing with Artificial General Intelligence. Make it an agent, give it a maximalist goal that becomes misaligned out of the intended distribution that ignores key second-order and ethical considerations and inherently is incompatible with the necessary safeguards, and unleash upon the world. It will not end well for us. And that could even be thought of as the good scenario, where we are able to point the thing towards anything at all.</p><p>So yes. Remember and beware the tale of Sam Bankman-Fried. Not to blame or to label, but to learn from it. Do not let history repeat itself.</p><p>Behold the Power of Yup</p><p>Sam\u2019s great persona transformation, the book says, was when Sam realized that he should stop trying to make his words have meaning or map in any way to reality, and instead focus purely on agreeing with everything anyone said and telling people what they want to hear.</p><blockquote><p>But he wasn\u2019t going to change human nature, and so he decided that, going forward, he would bury any negative reactions he had to anything anyone said or did. He would give human beings with whom he interacted the impression that he was far more interested in whatever they were saying or doing than he actually was. He\u2019d agree with them, even if he didn\u2019t. Whatever idiocy came from them, he\u2019d reply with a Yuuuuuuppp! \u201cIt comes with a cost, but it\u2019s on balance worth it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn most ways, people like you more if you agree with them.\u201d He went from being a person you\u2019d be surprised to learn approves of you to a person you\u2019d be surprised to learn that, actually no, he doesn\u2019t. (1,834)</p></blockquote><p>The claim is that this completely brazen strategy flat out works, including when dealing with the rich, famous and powerful. Could it be this easy?</p><blockquote><p>\u201cYup\u201d was Sam\u2019s go-to word, and the less he\u2019d actually listened to whatever you\u2019d just said, the longer he drew it out. Yuuuuuuuuup. (209)</p></blockquote><p>This is a great reverse tell, because normally extending your \u2018yup\u2019 means that you are aware of the gravity of the situation.</p><p>The best part of a strategy where your entire plan is to agree with everything is you do not need to listen to what people say or have the slightest interest in it.</p><blockquote><p>Sam was game to talk to anyone\u2014so long as he could play a video game while doing it. Sam went from being totally private to being a media whore. (161)</p></blockquote><p>I\u2019ve come around to the video game playing being genius. By trying to also play games that will not wait for you, like Storybook Brawl and League of Legends, SBF had a constant look that he was engaged and paying close attention. That is a hard thing to fake. Better to make it real. Also you get to play the video games.</p><p>What Sam also did frequently was to talk completely unguarded. Most famously on Odd Lots <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZYqL79GDXU&amp;ab_channel=BloombergPodcasts\">there was The Box</a> (link goes to episode, if you don\u2019t know I won\u2019t ruin it for you) but such statements were common.</p><p>This also went for philosophy, as when he told Tyler Cowen he would take a 51% coinflip to double or destroy the Earth, and then keep taking the flips until everyone was dead. Reminds me of Trump, who will lie right to your face but will sometimes be honest about lying right to your face, which some people find endearing.</p><p>Thus, Sam in some ways had a reputation for honesty.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cSam was unlike anyone else, in that when he stated his opinion he did it with exactly his level of confidence, which is often very high,\u201d recalled Adam Yedidia. (1,250)</p><p>Often he\u2019d leave her feeling uneasy about how much he\u2019d disclosed, and to perfect strangers. \u201cThere are some times I told him in the early days, You don\u2019t have to be so honest. In crypto everyone bluffs. Sam is always, Let me show you my last card.\u201d (3,457)</p></blockquote><p>Yes, Sam was often very (over)confident, and said so. He also constantly lied to everyone\u2019s face and told them what they want to hear.</p><p>I wonder if this was the trick to getting an actual Sam opinion. If he does not give you a probability, look out, he wasn\u2019t even listening to you, sorry man. If he does give you a probability, then sure you have to recalibrate it but probabilities might be a sort of sacred trust, and also it is much harder to know what you want to hear.</p><p>It also helps to be graded on the crypto curve. Do you have any idea how little you could trust the word of anyone in crypto in 2018? A simple \u2018you follow professional norms and honor the word done in a trading chat\u2019 backed with halfway decent execution went a long way.</p><p>The book claims that the PR campaign really was a pure \u2018let Sam be Sam\u2019 where being Sam meant this superficially agreeable persona who took meetings while playing video games, combined with a willingness to talk remarkably frankly about technical details. They say that Natalie, the woman charged with PR and Sam\u2019s calendar despite having zero relevant experience, tried to call in professional help, but the professionals they did nothing.</p><blockquote><p>To help her in her new and unfamiliar role as head of FTX public relations, Natalie had called a New York public relations firm called M Group Strategic Communications. Its head, Jay Morakis, was at first wary.</p><p>\u201cI thought maybe it was some shady Chinese thing,\u201d he said. But then he heard Sam\u2019s pitch, and watched Sam\u2019s first big public appearance, on Bloomberg TV. \u201cWhatever the closest thing in my PR experience has been to this, nothing is close,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m fifty years old. I\u2019ve had my firm for twenty years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. All my guys want to meet Sam. I have CEOs calling me and asking: Can you do for us what you did for Sam?\u201d He\u2019d had to explain, back in 2021, that he actually hadn\u2019t done anything. Sam had just sort of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;happened. (2,025)</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1710436548599067021\">Patrick McKenzie is in awe of this paragraph</a>.</p><blockquote><p>Patrick McKenzie (recently): We get more than a chapter with a twenty-something Taiwanese aide de camp who has no PR experience. Lewis would have you believe she single-handedly managed calendar, juggled magazine cover shoots, and put on conferences featuring e.g. Clinton.</p><p>And we get one paragraph where the CEO of a strategic comms consultancy shows up to modestly refuse any credit, then exits from the narrative at the speed of light.</p><p>*shakes head in confused mix of exasperation and professional regard*</p><p>God they\u2019re good.</p><p>The subtext, and is it even subtext, in the above is that: it is resoundingly unlikely one person, no matter talent level nor devotion, achieved the results that operation achieved. At some point you are limited by keystrokes possible per day.</p><p>And then the sort of stunning level of chutzpah it takes for the strategic consultancy to get a deniable PR hit *in a Michael Lewis book cataloging their client\u2019s implosion.* Which is carefully calibrated to say everything it needs to say to people who have budget authority.</p><p>Patrick McKenzie (11/17/22): An offhand comment on the topic of the day, from a comms professional: if you look at the number of interviews in prestige publications, the timing of them, the magazine covers, and the glowing coverage *post implosion*, I think you start to perceive the dark matter of a PR firm.</p><p>I wish I knew who it was, and I\u2019m not sure the conclusion would be \u201cNever work with them\u201d or \u201cDefinitely work with them; the apparently have the ability to root any media org they want at any time given any facts.\u201d</p><p>They also seem to be intensely loyal to their client even though he is very, very clearly not listening to their advice.</p><p>An aside: some of the pieces which read to the general public as puff pieces read to journalists as hit pieces, for complicated cultural reasons. There is a language to these things, like there is a language to LessWrong.</p></blockquote><p>I am going to go ahead and agree with Patrick McKenzie that we saw, especially in the aftermath of FTX\u2019s collapse, what he described as \u2018the dark matter of a PR firm.\u2019 I do not buy the story that there were no public relations professionals involved, that Sam went out and said \u2018yep\u2019 a lot while playing video games, driving a Corolla and having a net worth of $20 billion, while one person with no experience did all the arrangements and scrambling, and everyone loved him and every press source treated him with kid gloves and all that.</p><p>The system is hackable. It is not that hackable. The parts of Sam\u2019s public relations operations I did have interaction with were very much conscious of exactly how public relations works via their well-compensated expert consultants. It would have been completely insane to do things any other way. Even by SBF standards.</p><p>This is one of many places where I am confident the events the book describes happened, and I am also confident that there is quite a lot of \u2018dark matter\u2019 that is being left out, at least a lot of which Michael Lewis never found. Some of it I get a chance to mention here. Definitely not all, not even of the parts I know about.</p><p>Now for the chronological story of how this all played out.</p><p>First stop, Jane Street Capital.</p><p>Jane Street Capital</p><p>This is the part of the story I am best able to fact check. I too worked at Jane Street Capital, and directly witnessed a lot of this part of the story.</p><p>I also am deeply thankful to Jane Street Capital. It was not a fit for me in the end, but it was a pretty great place to work and they treated me right. I am not about to spill their secrets in ways they would not want such secrets spilled. I can safely say that this chapter is not entirely accurate, but the inaccuracies do not bear strongly on the SBF story, so I will decline to elaborate further.</p><p>SBF does not have that kind of ethical code. He was happy, on top of all SBF\u2019s actions at the time, to share a bunch of details with Michael Lewis.</p><p>I will say that the description of the interview process was spot on, I very much enjoyed my shot at it, and that I can totally believe SBF got the high score.</p><blockquote><p>Jane Street offered him a summer internship. So for that matter did the other high-frequency trading firms that had invited him to apply. One firm had halted their interview process midway through and announced that Sam had done so much better at their weird games and puzzles than every other applicant that there was no longer any point in watching him play. (769)</p></blockquote><p>As I have said before, I recommend <a href=\"https://www.janestreet.com/join-jane-street/programs-and-events/internships-all-cycles/\">going through the Jane Street interview process</a>, even if you do not think you have much chance of being hired. It is great.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-10-04/sbf-was-reckless-from-the-start?srnd=undefined\">Matt Levine has extensively discussed the Asher Incident</a>.</p><p>What matters to the broader story is that this Asher guy was another intern who offered SBF a bet without thinking through the implications, offering SBF a chance to both make about $33 in expected value and also humiliate Asher, and oh boy did SBF take full advantage, continuing to rub it in well past the point where he had secured his profit and was doing anything other than rubbing it in Asher\u2019s face.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt was not like I was unaware I was being a piece of shit to Asher,\u201d he said. \u201cThe relevant thing was: Should I decide to prioritize making the people around me feel better, or proving my point?\u201d (951)</p></blockquote><p>This is such a strange response. There was quickly nothing left to prove once Sam pointed out Asher\u2019s mistake. Sam did not prioritize proving his point over having others feel better. He prioritized making Asher feel worse. That is not cute nerd indifference to social cues. Michael Lewis pretends not to notice the difference.</p><p>The actual bet was on the maximum loss by any Jane Street intern that day from gambling. Interns were encouraged to bet and make markets against each other, with a maximum loss of $100 per day so no one got seriously hurt. SBF bought a contract for $65 that paid out equal to the maximum loss, then (of course) paid $1 to get another intern to flip a coin for, oh, about $99. Then, for no good reason, he did it two more times.</p><p>Matt Levine and his readers point out that there was a better version of the trade, which was to pay $1 to get two interns to flip against each other. What he forgets is that SBF is not one to shy from variance. What was not pointed out was the fun problem that if SBF had lost the initial coin flip, then Asher could have claimed that since SBF won his bet with Asher, he hadn\u2019t lost the full $100. The bet is now self-referential. And SBF couldn\u2019t have clarified this before accepting the bet without tipping Asher off to why SBF would always win.</p><p>What is the result? Presumably you need the result where the contract resolves correctly, Sam has to lose what the contract pays out, so it is the halfway point and resolves $82.50, paying out $17.50? And by flipping the coin himself, Sam gave up a quarter of his expected profit?</p><p>The bosses were not happy, and thought Sam needed to learn to read the room.</p><blockquote><p>Sam thought his bosses had misread his social problems. They thought he needed to learn how to read other people. Sam believed the opposite was true. \u201cI read people pretty well,\u201d he said. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t read me.\u201d (951)</p></blockquote><p>It had not occurred to the bosses, presumably, that Sam could read others fine. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NyFuuKQ8uCEDtd2du/the-genie-knows-but-doesn-t-care\">The problem was that Sam did not care</a>. Either way, Sam was right that his lack of ordinary facial expressions was a problem.</p><p>So Operation Ordinary Facial Expressions was born.</p><blockquote><p>Just because he didn\u2019t feel the emotion didn\u2019t mean he couldn\u2019t convey it. He\u2019d started with his facial expressions. He practiced forcing his mouth and eyes to move in ways they didn\u2019t naturally. (1,014)</p></blockquote><p>Here\u2019s one anecdote I can confirm, and it was as crazy as it sounds:</p><blockquote><p>Every time Brazil won a World Cup match, the Brazilian stock market tanked, for instance, because the win was thought to increase the shot at reelection of Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff, perceived to be corrupt. (1,111)</p></blockquote><p>The book then describes a refinement or extension of this trade, which I would not choose to confirm or deny regardless of whether it happened. What if SBF could simply predict the outcome of the 2016 election an hour ahead of everyone else?</p><blockquote><p>That is, it would be surprising if Jane Street couldn\u2019t learn the results of the presidential election before anyone else in the financial markets or for that matter the entire world. (1,123)</p></blockquote><p>There then follows a section on Sam\u2019s version of what happened with the 2016 presidential election, where he and Lewis both draw all the wrong conclusions (even if you were to believe the exact story presented), and became convinced that he could be the best like no one ever was and make all the money and Jane Street was not maximizing enough and thus holding him back.</p><p>Then a bit later, SBF decided to leave Jane Street, because he discovered the Japan and South Korea Bitcoin arbitrage trade, and he wanted the trade all to himself.</p><p>This is one place I will introduce myself into the story a tiny bit. When Sam decided to quit, the two of us went for a walk in the park. He said he was leaving to run or at least help run CEA, the Center for Effective Altruism.</p><p>Which was not a crazy fit. Sam was clearly deeply into EA and the thesis that he could be a major upgrade there seemed plausible, as did the possibility that from his perspective this could be high leverage. I was confused by his decision, Jane Street seemed like a better fit for him, but we strategized a bit about how good could be done and I wished him the best of luck.</p><p>As we all know now, he was, as with everyone else, lying right to my face.</p><blockquote><p>During his final weeks at Jane Street, Sam traveled to Boston just to tell Gary about his plan to make a billion dollars trading crypto for effective altruistic causes. (1,423)</p></blockquote><p>He admit it. He was not leaving to join CEA. He was leaving to pursue the Japan trade. And he had decided that I was not someone he wanted to bring in on that.</p><p>I\u2019d also note Sam wrote this:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cbut [my coworkers] show no interest in seeing who I really am, in hearing the thoughts I hold back. The more honest I try to make our friendships, the more they fade away. No one is curious. No one cares, not really, about the self I see. They care about the Sam they see, and what he means to them. And they don\u2019t seem to understand who that Sam is\u2014a product of thoughts that I decide people should hear. My real-life twitter account.\u201d (1,205)</p></blockquote><p>I am not saying I made the most robust effort to build a close friendship with Sam, but I was right there, happy to talk to him before he was him, culturally rather adjacent sharing many of his interests, and (I like to think) very clearly able to keep a secret. We had him over for dinner once, and by my wife\u2019s recollection he didn\u2019t say two words to her, nor did he eat any of the food (yes we\u2019re not vegans but we do make efforts to accommodate), while trying to get me to disassociate with Ben Hoffman because he was making concrete criticisms of EA and such criticisms hurt the cause. So, yeah.</p><p>On reflection, it was vastly overdetermined that Sam had no reason to tell me what was going on. Why take that risk? I clearly was not about to work 18 hour days in Berkeley, California. It was unlikely I would have let him own 100% of the firm. I was too old and busted, a \u2018grown-up\u2019 he had no use for, and ultimately a rationalist is not an EA who will trust Sam completely, so in many ways I was the opposite of EA. Why take the risk that I might not keep his confidence?</p><p>Looking back now, of course, I am for my own sake deeply happy that he did not attempt to take me with him. How might things have been different if I had somehow ended up going with him? Would I have been able to steer things to turn out differently? Would I have been only another person who left with the management team, or another witness on the stand, or could I have helped steer the ship? Would I have perhaps managed to block the Anthropic investment? We will never know.</p><p>Without loss of generality or confirming any of the other bits, there are too many different things to get into it all, I\u2019d also like to dispute this (very gentle?) slander:</p><blockquote><p>By Wall Street standards, Jane Street was not a greedy place. Its principals did not flaunt their wealth in the way that the guys who had founded other high-frequency trading firms loved to do. They didn\u2019t buy pro sports teams or hurl money at Ivy League schools to get buildings named for themselves. They were not opposed to saving a few lives. But Jane Street was still on Wall Street. To survive, it needed its employees to grow attached to their annual bonuses, and accustomed to their five-bedroom Manhattan apartments and quiet, understated summer houses in the Hamptons. The flood of effective altruists into the firm was worrisome. (1,312)</p></blockquote><p>That is quite a rich thing to say. The employees I knew in no way felt stuck trading in order to support their lavish lifestyles. They traded because they very much enjoyed it, were good at it, liked the team they were on and so on. Many indeed were and are largely altruists, and wanted to do good as effectively as possible. Not being ostentatious was not an act.</p><p>It was the flood of effective altruists out of the firm that was worrisome. It was the effective altruists who were the greedy ones, who were convinced they could make more money outside the firm, and that they had a moral obligation to do so. You know, for the common good. They proved themselves neither honest nor loyal. Neither was \u2018part of their utility function.\u2019</p><p>All right. On to Alameda.</p><p>Soiling the Good Name of Alameda County</p><p>All time great chapter opening. Again, the man can write.</p><blockquote><p>It took only a couple of weeks of working for Sam before Caroline Ellison called her mother and sobbed into the phone that she\u2019d just made the biggest mistake of her life. (1,271)</p></blockquote><p>Caroline had many very good instincts throughout. If only she had followed them.</p><blockquote><p>Over coffee in Berkeley, Sam was cagey about what he was up to. \u201cIt was, \u2018I\u2019m working on something secret and I can\u2019t talk about it,\u2019 \u201d recalled Caroline. \u201cHe was worried about recruiting from Jane Street. But after we talked a while, he said, \u2018I guess maybe I could tell you.\u2019 (1,295)</p></blockquote><p>Oh yes, Sam, famously worried about recruiting from Jane Street.</p><blockquote><p>In late March she started the job. The situation inside Alameda Research wasn\u2019t anything like Sam had led her to expect. He\u2019d recruited twenty or so EAs, most of them in their twenties, all but one without experience trading in financial markets. (1,337)</p></blockquote><p>Why did he recruit EAs? Partly because he thought EAs would work infinite hours for almost no pay and still be worthy of and provide limitless trust. Exploit the recruits for cheap labor, without even the pretense of a non-profit.</p><blockquote><p>Anyone who started a crypto trading firm would need to trust his employees deeply, as any employee could hit a button and wire the crypto to a personal account without anyone else ever having the first idea what had happened. Wall Street firms were not capable of generating that level of trust, but EA was. (1,402)</p></blockquote><p>That would explain how Alameda could lose money trading crypto in large parts of 2018, despite it being extremely difficult to lose money trading crypto in 2018 if you know how trading works. It could also explain why Sam wanted to rely on his bot program. No one knew how to trade!</p><p>Alameda started out with the arbitrage trade with South Korea and Japan. It is not clear the extent to which they managed to take advantage of it - the book describes them as getting only secondary, much less profitable versions of it, Sam debating various wild schemes to do better but not pulling the trigger on them because they were too absurd even for him, and ultimately the opportunity vanishing.</p><blockquote><p>It wasn\u2019t Sam\u2019s first thought, but he considered buying a jumbo jet and flying it back and forth from Seoul, filled with South Koreans carrying suitcases each holding $10,000 worth of won, to a small island off the coast of Japan. \u201cThe problem is that it wasn\u2019t scalable,\u201d said Sam. \u201cTo make it worthwhile, we needed like ten thousand South Koreans a day. And we probably would have attracted so much attention doing it that we would have been shut down. Once the South Korean central bank saw you with ten thousand South Koreans carrying suitcases full of won they\u2019d be like, There\u2019s going to be a new direction here.\u201d Still, he was tempted. (1,483)</p></blockquote><p>Which brings us to the bot.</p><p>The bot in question was called Modelbot. I would have simply called it Arbbot.</p><p>The idea was simple, and also very much something I would have tried. There were a lot of different exchanges trading a lot of cryptos at lots of different prices. Sometimes the prices were different. When that happened, you could do various forms of arbitrage (and statistical arbitrage). Sam, being a trader and also being Sam, was a big fan of taking the free money.</p><p>What made it extra attractive was that, while Sam had declined (or failed) to hire actual traders, he did manage to hire a world class programmer, and he did manage to raise capital while exploiting the country arbitrage trade.</p><blockquote><p>They didn\u2019t blow up, not at first. Those first few weeks, they made no real money, but then they had only a few people and Sam\u2019s bonus money. By the end of December, they\u2019d hired a bunch of people and raised $25 million in capital. Gary, basically all by himself, had written the code for an entire quantitative system. That month they generated several million dollars in profits. In January 2018 their profits rose to half a million dollars each day, on a capital base of $40 million\u2014whereupon an effective altruist named Jaan Tallinn, who\u2019d made his fortune in Skype, handed them $130 million more to play with.</p></blockquote><p>So Sam built Modelbot to do exactly that, and he would have gotten away with it too except for those meddling (Effective Altruist) kids.</p><blockquote><p>He had not been able to let Modelbot rip the way he\u2019d liked\u2014because just about every other human being inside Alameda Research was doing whatever they could to stop him. \u201cIt was entirely within the realm of possibility that we could lose all our money in an hour,\u201d said one. One hundred seventy million dollars that might otherwise go to effective altruism could simply go poof. (1,368)</p></blockquote><p>Not \u2018170 million dollars of our investors money.\u2019 Not \u2018our only opportunity to trade, obviously we wouldn\u2019t get another.\u2019 Not even \u2018and if we lost it like that I can\u2019t help but wonder if we\u2019d have some legal or other problems to deal with.\u2019</p><p>No, this was 170 million dollars \u2018that might otherwise go to effective altruism.\u2019</p><p>Something is deeply, deeply wrong with that picture. Although not as wrong as Sam\u2019s part of the picture.</p><blockquote><p>[One] evening, Tara argued heatedly with Sam until he caved and agreed to what she thought was a reasonable compromise: he could turn on Modelbot so long as he and at least one other person were present to watch it, but should turn it off if it started losing money. \u201cI said, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m going home to go to sleep,\u2019 and as soon as I left, Sam turned it on and fell asleep,\u201d recalled Tara. From that moment the entire management team gave up on ever trusting Sam. (1,372)</p></blockquote><p>I mean, good on the management team for fully updating on trusting Sam, although not fully updating on \u2018this person needs to be removed immediately if not sooner,\u2019 assuming Tara\u2019s account is accurate, and the book does not say that Sam disputes it, nor does it seem remotely inconsistent with other Sam things. Turning on the bot after promising not to is bad enough, but turning on a new bot and then falling asleep with no one else watching it? Yeah, that is another planet of not okay.</p><p>That is not the weird part of the story. The weird part of the story is, why was it non-trivial to test whether or not the bot worked?</p><p>Any bot you would ever dare turn on has various risk limits. You can turn the bot on, with very low limits on how much it is allowed to trade. Do the trades small. See if you end up with more money than you started with, in the same places it started. If you can do that, you can start slowly ramping the numbers up. Standard procedure. If you can\u2019t do that, you haven\u2019t finished programming your bot, so get on that. Have multiple people watching at all times, analyzing the trades, seeing if things make sense, refining your algorithms as you go.</p><p>Instead, the claim is that Sam turned the program on with no one watching, without any reason not to wait, then went indefinitely with no way to test whether the program would actually work if one turned it on. I notice I am confused.</p><p>Alameda, without a profitable bot and without the arbitrage trade, started bleeding money as per the book\u2019s own report, and they were paying very high interest rates to borrow money. Things did not look so good and were escalating quickly.</p><p>Then comes the story of the missing Ripple. They were supposed to have $4 million worth of Ripple. Then they lost it. No one knew where it was. What to do?</p><p>Sam\u2019s attitude was that the Ripple would probably turn up, so no duty to the investors to say anything, no need to worry, carry on your day. Others were, understandably, rather more concerned?</p><blockquote><p>After the fact, if we never get any of the Ripple back, no one is going to say it is reasonable for us to have said we have eighty percent of the Ripple. Everyone is just going to say we lied to them. We\u2019ll be accused by our investors of fraud. That sort of argument just bugged the hell out of Sam. He hated the way inherently probabilistic situations would be interpreted, after the fact, as having been black-and-white, or good and bad, or right and wrong.</p></blockquote><p>Remind you of anything that\u2019s going to happen in the second half of the book? Yes, it turns out that if you tell people everything\u2019s fine but you have reason to know it very well might not be fine, often that would constitute fraud. You cannot, in general, simply not mention or account for things that you\u2019d rather not mention or account for.</p><p>So between Sam asking everyone to work 18 hour days all the time, and being a generally irritable and horrible person to work for, and being completely untrustworthy and risking all the money for no reason, and misplacing $4 million in Ripple and then proposing to act like that hadn\u2019t happened, and also for the company bleeding money and a bunch of other stuff, for some strange reason, Sam\u2019s entire management team decided they had enough and wanted Sam out.</p><p>The management team ran into a problem. Thanks to them taking \u2018I promise I\u2019ll get to that later, we need to move fast\u2019 as an explanation, Sam owned the entire company. Somehow everyone had allowed this.</p><p>The book\u2019s account also claims the offer had an absurd clause that was completely unsingable, aiming to bankrupt Sam outright. Not typically how one gets to yes.</p><blockquote><p>For a start, Sam owned the entire company. He\u2019d structured it so that no one else had equity, only promises of equity down the road. In a tense meeting, the others offered to buy him out, but at a fraction of what Sam thought the firm to be worth, and the offer came with diabolical fine print: Sam would remain liable for all taxes on any future Alameda profits. At least some of his fellow effective altruists aimed to bankrupt Sam, almost as a service to humanity, so that he might never be allowed to trade again. (1,555)</p></blockquote><p>What? Liable for all taxes on any future Alameda profits? As fine print they hoped Sam wouldn\u2019t notice, perhaps? That is the most absurd ask I have ever seen. Sam obviously would rather light the entire enterprise on fire than agree to that. I have no knowledge here one way or the other, but I have to assume this is not a complete and accurate description?</p><p>The book confirms that the whole thing seemed pretty nuts the way it is described.</p><blockquote><p>The conversations we had were absolutely fucking nuts,\u201d he recalled. \u201cLike to what extent Sam should be excommunicated for deceiving EAs and wasting EA talent. And like \u2018the only way Sam will learn is if he actually goes bankrupt.\u2019 They told our investors he was faking being an EA, because it was the meanest thing they could think to say.\u201d Ruining Sam wasn\u2019t enough, however: they expected to be paid on their way out the door. \u201cThey wanted severance, even though they were quitting and it was a money-losing operation in which they didn\u2019t have a stake,\u201d said Nishad. \u201cThey were saying that Sam needed to buy them out and they were worth more than one hundred percent of the value of the entire company because Sam was a net negative.\u201d (1,575)</p><p>And now all these unprofitable effective altruists were demanding to be paid millions to quit\u2014and doing whatever they could to trash Sam\u2019s reputation with the outside world until they got their money. (1,584)</p></blockquote><p>That is not typically how any of this works. Quitters do not typically get severance. Quitters definitely do not typically get more than 100% of the value of the entire company. If someone demands you buy them out for more than the company is worth, and they accurately describe how much the company is worth, presumably you say \u2018wait, that is more than the company is worth, why would I ever pay that?\u2019</p><p>To his credit, Nishad noticed that he was deeply confused.</p><blockquote><p>It occurred to Nishad that the effective altruist\u2019s relationship to money was more than a little bizarre. Basically all of Alameda Research\u2019s employees and investors were committed to giving all their money away to roughly the same charitable causes. You might surmise that they wouldn\u2019t much care who wound up with the money, as it all would go to saving the lives of the same people none of them would ever meet. You would be wrong: in their financial dealings with each other, the effective altruists were more ruthless than Russian oligarchs. Their investors were charging them a rate of interest of 50 percent. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a normal loan,\u201d said Nishad. \u201cIt was a shark loan.\u201d In what was meant to be a collaborative enterprise, Sam had refused to share any equity (1,578)</p></blockquote><p>Ah, yes, the funders demanding 50% interest. I can take this one. Loaning money to even a relatively responsible crypto firm is highly risky and, typically, deeply stupid. This is not 2022-hindsight, back in 2018 I was trading for a crypto firm and we had borrowed money and I remarked that I had no idea why anyone had voluntarily loaned us any.</p><p>Invest in a crypto trading firm? Sure, maybe. Could work. Big upside. But why would you instead loan money to a crypto firm, where if Number Go Up you get a modest interest payment and if Number Go Down your number goes down to zero?</p><p>The ideal answer is that you don\u2019t. If you must, earn enough interest that it is worth it. A rate of 50% seems if anything a bit low.</p><p>The whole idea of the EAs who left \u2018trashing Sam\u2019s reputation\u2019 is treated as a big deal here, and as the reason the funders cut back a lot in size. But I never heard the complaints until FTX was blowing up? Most I know didn\u2019t hear them? Given how big FTX was in EA spaces, does it seem a bit weird that this massive reputation-trashing operation went so unnoticed? They certainly had plenty of good material to work with. If they\u2019d presented the facts as laid out in the book, that seems like enough?</p><p>Why do we get to flash forward to this, after it all fell apart:</p><blockquote><p>From the start, Zane had been enthralled by Sam, and by the empire he might create. But he hadn\u2019t signed up to the cause blindly. Before joining FTX, he\u2019d consulted his old friends in crypto. CZ was one of them. \u201cIt was CZ who told me about him,\u201d he now recalled. \u201cHe said, \u2018I think that\u2019d be a really good option for you.\u2019 People have asked me, \u2018How did you come to trust Sam so much?\u2019 CZ was the start of it. But nobody had a bad thing to say about him.\u201d Zane was the gunslinger who\u2019d been talked into making a respectable home in the town alongside what appeared to be law-abiding folk. Lots of big crypto speculators had entrusted their money to FTX because they trusted Zane.

What will you do next?</p><blockquote><p>What happened next, in retrospect, seems faintly incredible. With no one left to argue with him, Sam threw the switch and let Modelbot rip. \u201cWe turned it on and it instantly started making us lots of money,\u201d said Nishad. And then they finally found the $4 million worth of missing Ripple. (1,606)</p></blockquote><p>I notice I am still confused. Modelbot instantly made a lot of money? Why didn\u2019t they turn it on for small before? Was there no experiment to run? What happened the previous time that Sam turned it on and fell asleep? None of this makes sense.</p><p>(What happened to the Ripple was that it was improperly labeled when sent to an exchange, so it piled up there while the exchange had no idea whose it was until they finally traced the thing and figured it out, at which point the exchange yelled at them for being complete idiots but did hand over the Ripple. Very nice of them, and also pretty insane that they let things drag out that long before figuring it out.)</p><p>Those who stayed behind did not make the correct updates.</p><blockquote><p>They were no longer a random assortment of effective altruists. They were a small team who had endured an alarming drama and now trusted Sam. He\u2019d been right all along! (1,618)</p></blockquote><p>Sam proved he could design a profitable arbitrage bot. And that he got lucky with his carelessness. That this time the risks paid off. Also that he was a terrible manager and team builder whose chosen management team all hated him so much after a short period that they walked out on him while actively trying to take him down.</p><p>Those who remained concluded\u2026 other things.</p><p>Sam also concluded that since EAs would not play ball, he shouldn\u2019t hire so many EAs.</p><blockquote><p>His fellow EAs\u2019 behavior caused him to update his understanding of their probability distributions in ways that left him less willing to hire EAs. (1,805)</p></blockquote><p>As much as I criticize EAs here and elsewhere, they do tend to notice when you are completely untrustworthy and your statements are not at all truth tracking. And they tend to then care about it. They often don\u2019t actually want to work constant 18 hour days. Also, newly hired EAs were not going to be personally loyal in the way that SBF wanted.</p><p>How fraudulent was the operation? Once again: <a href=\"https://www.theblock.co/post/186187/alameda-promised-high-returns-with-no-risk-in-2018-pitch\">This is their 2018 deck, which claims &gt;100% consistent annualized returns</a> (and \u2018no risk\u2019). There is no ambiguity here.</p><p>How Any of This Worked</p><p>The crypto world was a hive of scum and villainy long before SBF got involved. There were also plenty of idealists and well-meaning, honest people, as there usually are. Those were mostly not the people getting rich, or the ones running the exchanges.</p><p>The exchanges were licenses to print money proportional to their user bases, with users who were asking all the wrong questions and no regulators or consumer watchdogs keeping them in check, so it got ugly out there.</p><blockquote><p>Across Asia, new cryptocurrency exchanges were popping up every month to service the growing gambling public. They all had deep pockets and an insatiable demand for young women.</p><p>They were hiring lots of people because they could afford to, and big headcounts signaled their importance. (93)</p></blockquote><p>The main thing customers demanded of crypto exchanges was, and I can confirm this, the ability to take wildly irresponsible gambles with their crypto. As in customers highly valued 100:1 leverage, using $100 of Bitcoin to buy $10,000 of Bitcoin, willing to lose it all if the price dipped by 1% for a microsecond.</p><p>People think using this leverage is a good idea. They are always wrong. Michael Lewis seems confused about this as well.</p><blockquote><p>Here was one example of the games that were played: Several of the Asian exchanges offered a Bitcoin contract with one hundred times leverage. Every now and then, some trader figured out that he could buy $100 million worth of bitcoin at the same time he sold short another $100 million worth of bitcoin\u2014and put up only a million dollars for each trade. Whatever happened to the price of bitcoin, one of his trades would win and the other would lose. If bitcoin popped by 10 percent, the rogue trader collected $10 million on his long position and vanished\u2014leaving the exchange to cover the $10 million he\u2019d lost on his short. (1,736)</p></blockquote><p>This is mostly a no good, very bad trade, because the exchange liquidates your account while it still has positive value, and by \u2018liquidate\u2019 the exchange meant \u2018confiscate all of it and write you down to zero.\u2019 Maybe they would then actually liquidate what was there. Maybe they wouldn\u2019t. That was up to them.</p><p>Are there versions of this trade that are good for you and bad for the exchange? Assuming, of course, that we completely ignore that it would be safe to presume all of this is market manipulation and multi-accounting and very much not legal, because lol legal, lol compliance department, this is crypto what are you even talking about.</p><p>Yes. If there were effectively no law but code, I can think of three.</p><p>You have reason to expect (or cause) Bitcoin to be even more volatile than usual, and for there to be a jump in price that gets your wrong-way trade liquidated at a negative account value. For example, if you are allowed to do this trade right before the decision on whether to allow a Bitcoin ETF, then the trade seems good.</p><p>You can size big enough to force the exchange to make big trades that impact the entire Bitcoin market. As in, Bitcoin goes up 75bps (0.75%) and they liquidate your short position (which was still worth $250k) to zero. But by doing that, they drive up the price of Bitcoin a lot more, after they have impact you sell your Bitcoins, and you end up ahead. Not impossible back in the day if they let you scale up big enough.</p><p>You can provide directly to the liquidation, and the liquidation mechanism is dumb. So when your short account is liquidated, the exchange issues market buy orders bigger than their market can bear rather than doing something less stupid, your account has various sell orders at higher prices, you fill a lot of the liquidation order at stupid prices, you quickly sell off the remainder before prices restabilize, and you laugh.</p><p>When I was trading crypto, I insisted on caring about things like not doing market manipulation, not spoofing orders and not trading when I had material non-public information (aka insider trading). This mostly made everyone else rather annoyed at me for being such a stickler for the laws of some alien world. They put up with it because, as the smoking man put it, they needed my expertise.</p><p>Wash trading was common.</p><blockquote><p>Wash trading, as it was called, would have been illegal on a regulated US exchange, though the sight of it did not bother Sam all that much. He thought it was sort of funny just how brazenly many of the Asian exchanges did it. In the summer of 2019, FTX created and published a daily analysis of the activity on other exchanges. It estimated that 80 percent or more of the volume on the second- and third-tier exchanges, and 30 percent of the volume on the top few exchanges, was fake. Soon after FTX published its first analysis of crypto trading activity, one exchange called and said, We\u2019re firing our wash trading team. Give us a week and the volumes will be real. The top exchanges expressed relief, and gratitude for the analysis, as, until then, lots of people assumed that far more than 30 percent of their volume was fake. (2,429)</p></blockquote><p>I discovered this because I was trading on Binance, attempting to purchase Stellar for someone who wanted to purchase a bunch of Stellar when it was the #8 coin in the world (it is #23 now), and continuously failing to purchase any Stellar. There would be trading, I would issue a buy order where it was trading, and the entire market would mysteriously shift up. I would withdraw the order, things came back down. The market moved if you breathed on it, there was no way to get any size. It didn\u2019t make sense until I realized that most of the trading was not real. The whole thing was a house of cards. I reported this back and the person said, yes, everyone knows there\u2019s a lot of wash trading, I still want to buy Stellar. There\u2019s only so much you can do.</p><p>Lewis offers a strange claim here:</p><blockquote><p>Toward the end of 2018 the markets suddenly changed again. Spreads tightened dramatically, going from 1 percent to seven one-hundredths of a percent. (1,754)</p></blockquote><p>I mean, no, they didn\u2019t? I was at least kind of there, unrelatedly trading crypto. Throughout 2018 there were plenty of ways to trade rather large amounts for far less than a percent. Yes, spreads did tighten, and I am confident Alameda contributed to that tightening, but this was not an order of magnitude change.</p><p>Nor was it the final change. As time went on, spreads would tighten further. Alameda would be in a more and more competitive business. This was likely a prime motivation behind creating a crypto exchange, FTX, before Alameda lost its edge.</p><p>During this period, SBF relocated to Hong Kong, because he found that being in the room with other crypto people was very good for business. For example:</p><blockquote><p>Weeks before he flew to Asia, one of the big Chinese crypto exchanges had frozen Alameda\u2019s account with a bunch of money in it, for no obvious reason. Customer service hadn\u2019t returned their calls. After meeting Sam in person, the exchange\u2019s bosses handed him back his money. (1,782)</p></blockquote><p>It also gave Sam access to a new labor pool, one eager to get into the game and do whatever it took without asking questions, and got everyone out of the United States.</p><p>Sam\u2019s approach to hiring was to ensure no one ever know what they were doing, so this new pool of talent worked out great.</p><blockquote><p>Faced with a necessity, Sam turned it into a virtue. \u201cIt\u2019s a moderately bad sign if you are having someone do the same thing they\u2019ve done before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s adverse selection of a weird sort. Because: why are they coming to you?\u201d (1,974)</p></blockquote><p>Spoken like an employer who does not know how to attract the best talent, and also someone who even Michael Lewis knows is bullshitting this time.</p><p>Another potential factor in this story that is not mentioned by Lewis, and also that did not come up in my previous post, is Tether. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1712096233672581273\">Patrick McKenzie has the theory</a> that Alameda\u2019s true main business was knowing what to say to American banks to allow Tether to move capital. That they were centrally engaged in fraud on this entire additional level.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1709206146249117927\">This related thread of Patrick McKenzie\u2019s is also fun.</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1709583245153599940\">As is this one</a>. Or at least, you can learn more about what I (and I assume Patrick) find fun.</p><p>The next step was building a crypto exchange.</p><p>Building FTX</p><p>Sam had a secret weapon in building FTX, which is that he had a programmer that could single-handedly (so the book says) program the whole thing better than most programming teams. Knowing what I know about exchanges and engineers, this claim is a lot less wild than it sounds. At core an exchange is about getting a small number of important things right, which FTX mostly did get right except where Sam chose to intentionally get them wrong. I totally believe that a two person team, one to know what to do and the other to do it, could have pulled that off.</p><p>Before going down other funding routes, Sam tried to get CZ of Binance to pay.</p><blockquote><p>The first decision CZ had to make was whether to pay Sam the $40 million he was asking for his cleverly designed futures exchange. After thinking it over for a few weeks in March 2019, CZ decided no\u2014and then told his people to create a futures exchange on their own. Which struck Sam as such an ordinary and vaguely disappointing thing to do. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of a douche but not worse than a douche,\u201d said Sam. \u201cHe should be a great character but he\u2019s not.\u201d (1,893)</p></blockquote><p>I do not really know what Sam was expecting. CZ presumably took a few weeks to think it over in order to keep optionality and get a head start, if he wasn\u2019t already building such an exchange anyway as seems rather plausible. Luckily for Sam, he still managed to do the better execution than CZ.</p><p>The book describes CZ as a strangely conventional and unimaginative person, who created Binance and made it the dominant exchange on the planet, becoming one of the richest people on Earth, without any exceptional qualities or skills of note. Lewis makes it sound like CZ was one of many who started exchanges, and he was at the right place at the right time and things broke his way. I don\u2019t know anything about CZ that isn\u2019t common knowledge, but I do not buy this at all. Random people do not luck into that kind of situation. But that would be the story of a different book.</p><p>So now Sam needed money to build FTX. He had a killer programmer, but there is a lot more to an exchange than that. So it was time to fundraise.</p><p>The book talks about two ways they raised money: Selling FTT tokens, which are a cryptocurrency Sam created representing claims on a portion of FTX\u2019s future revenue and thus effectively a form of preferred stock in FTX, and traditional VC fundraising.</p><p>The FTT story is told as a story of quick success. He starts out charging early people $0.10, then quickly that goes up quite a lot, some people get rich out of the gate, Sam is sad at what he gave away. VCs in this spot, and crypto people too, tell you not to be upset about that. You need big gains and a story to drive excitement, you still have most of the company and a ton of the tokens. You have what you need. Why fret it? Instead, Sam says later in the book he regretted creating the tokens and sold them so cheap, rather than regretting the tokens because he used them later in such crazy fashion that he blew up his whole empire.</p><p>The stock story is where SBF learns the basics of how VC works. In traditional Sam fashion, he noticed things were kind of arbitrary and dumb, then did not stop to think that they might not be as arbitrary and dumb as all that and there might be method to the madness even if it wasn\u2019t fully optimal.</p><blockquote><p>In early 2021, Jump Trading\u2014not a conventional venture capitalist\u2014offered to buy a stake in FTX at a company valuation of $4 billion. \u201cSam said no, the fundraise is at twenty billion,\u201d recalled Ramnik. Jump responded by saying that they\u2019d be interested at that price if Sam could find others who were too\u2014which told you that the value people assigned to new businesses was arbitrary. (2,060)</p></blockquote><p>No, this does not mean the valuation is arbitrary. That is especially true when, as was the case in FTX and most crypto companies, you politely decline to let anyone do proper due diligence, and you\u2019re not even a traditional VC. What is going on is that Jump is quite reasonably deciding that at a fair rate they would be willing to invest, but that they are not in position to evaluate what is fair. So they outsource that to others, including to the lead whoever that might be. If VCs are willing to costly signal, via their own investment, that a $20 billion valuation is reasonable, then Jump can be in as well.</p><blockquote><p>Selling a new business to a VC was apparently less like selling a sofa than it was like pitching a movie idea. (2,063)</p></blockquote><p>Well, yeah, that one is largely right. They care a ton about a good story.</p><p>Then we have Sam being peak Sam.</p><blockquote><p>A guy from Blackstone, the world\u2019s biggest private investment firm, called Sam to say that he thought a valuation of $20 billion was too high\u2014and that Blackstone would invest at a valuation of $15 billion. \u201cSam said, \u2018If you think it is too high, I\u2019ll let you short a billion of our stock at a valuation of twenty billion,\u2019 \u201d recalled Ramnik. \u201cThe guy said, \u2018We don\u2019t short stock.\u2019 And Sam said that if you worked at Jane Street you\u2019d be fired the first week.\u201d (2,084)</p></blockquote><p>Sam is very much the one who gets fired in the first week here. No, you are not obligated to flip coins every time you think you have a tiny edge, especially billion dollar ones with uncapped potential losses subject to potential rampant manipulation and huge adverse selection. Nor has Sam paused to consider the cost of capital. VCs demand edges well in excess of 33% before they are willing to invest.</p><p>It is crazy, completely insane, to think that a VC willing to invest in a start-up at $15 billion would want to be short for size at $20 billion, with no market or way to cover.</p><p>Another part of the puzzle is that Sam used Alameda\u2019s resources to create FTX, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alpackaP/status/1593308236568055808\">and the first VC that Sam talked to figured this and a number of other things out</a>.</p><p>Yet presumably Sam said this because he not only thought he was right, he thought he was so obviously right it made sense to say so over the phone. That tells you a lot about Sam\u2019s attitude towards capital, sizing, risk and other related matters, and also in believing that he knows all and everyone else is an idiot, which is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaHDBL7dVgs&amp;ab_channel=TheTomLehrerWisdomChannel\">more, more, I\u2019m still not satisfied</a>.</p><p>The Sam Show</p><p>What about physically building FTX, as in their new headquarters in the Bahamas that was never finished?</p><p>There\u2019s a bunch of great stories in the book about the architects who got brought in to make this very expensive building, who were given no guidance, and desperately tried to figure out what their client wanted. All they got were three quick notes - the shape of an F, a side that looked like Sam\u2019s hair, and a display area for a Tungsten Cube - that Sam also didn\u2019t bother writing, instead someone else tried to imagine what Sam might ask for. It was all the Sam show, all about Sam all the time, very cult of personality or at least hair.</p><blockquote><p>Even from their jungle huts people jockeyed for a view of him. The architects schemed the main building with glass walls and mezzanines that offered unlikely interior views of Sam. \u201cIt gives you an opportunity to catch glimpses of Sam no matter where you are sitting,\u201d said Ian [the architect]. (2,569)</p><p>The list had been created by someone else inside FTX who\u2019d tried to imagine what perhaps he himself might want in his new office buildings, were he Sam. Sam didn\u2019t want his Jewfro on the side of the building. This other person had just imagined that \u201cJewfro on the side of the building\u201d was the kind of thing Sam might find amusing. (2,612)</p></blockquote><p>Another way he kept it all about him was not to give anyone else a title that represented what they were actually doing.</p><blockquote><p>Sam then listed some reasons why this might be so: Having a title makes people feel less willing to take advice from those without titles. Having a title makes people less likely to put in the effort to learn how to do well at the base-level jobs of people they\u2019re managing. They end up trying to manage people whose jobs they couldn\u2019t do, and that always goes poorly. (2,644)</p><p>Having titles can create significant conflicts between your ego and the company.

None of the people in the world thought to kidnap Sam, despite zero attempts to prevent this, so despite being perhaps the most juicy kidnap target the world has ever known, he remained un-kidnapped. The man had actual zero security, posed zero physical threat, had billions in crypto that was accounted for by literal no one including himself, and was a pure act utilitarian and effectively a causal decision theorist. That person pays all the ransom, and then shrugs it off and gets back to work.</p><p>Which is good, given they had no other decision making process whatsoever.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt is unclear if we even have to have an actual board of directors,\u201d said Sam, \u201cbut we get suspicious glances if we don\u2019t have one, so we have something with three people on it.\u201d When he said this to me, right after his Twitter meeting, he admitted he couldn\u2019t recall the names of the other two people. \u201cI knew who they were three months ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt might have changed. The main job requirement is they don\u2019t mind DocuSigning at three a.m. DocuSigning is the main job.\u201d (2,833)</p></blockquote><p>There was no CFO. Why have a CFO? What would they do, keep track of how much money we have?</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a functional religion around the CFO,\u201d said Sam. \u201cI\u2019ll ask them, \u2018Why do I need one?\u2019 Some people cannot articulate a single thing the CFO is supposed to do. They\u2019ll say \u2018keep track of the money,\u2019 or \u2018make projections.\u2019 I\u2019m like, What the fuck do you think I do all day? You think I don\u2019t know how much money we have?\u201d (2,838)</p></blockquote><p>You know what? I do indeed think you did not know how much money you had.</p><p>A Few Good Trades</p><p>Sam did a lot of trades. Some of them were good trades. Some of them were not.</p><p>That means sometimes you look dumb, and sometimes you look like a genius.</p><p>When the good ones can pay off by orders of magnitude, every VC and everyone in crypto knows that is a nice place to be.</p><p>For example, that Solana trade? Sweet.</p><blockquote><p>Even if it wasn\u2019t [true], Solana\u2019s story was good enough that other people might see it that way and drive up the price of its token. Eighteen months later, Alameda owned roughly 15 percent of all Solana tokens, most purchased at twenty-five cents apiece. The market price of Solana had gone as high as $249, a thousand-times increase on what Sam had paid for the tokens, and the face value of Sam\u2019s entire stash was roughly $12 billion. (2,346)</p></blockquote><p>Makes up for a lot of other trades gone bad, provided you then sell some rather than double down. Yeah, I know. This is Sam we are talking about.</p><p>With a lot of effective control over Solana, Sam then was properly motivated to drive more hype and adaption. He even got to create a spin off, a \u2018Sam Coin\u2019 called Serum, which was meant to be a claim on a portion of the fees for financial transactions on the Solana blockchain.</p><p>This was, presumably, a way to expropriate other holders of Solana. Instead of returning the fees to Solana holders, they would go to Serum holders, so suddenly there was another coin to distribute and manipulate and hype. Fun.</p><p>The only problem was that it worked too well.</p><blockquote><p>Soon after Serum\u2019s creation, its price had skyrocketed. Sam clearly had not anticipated this. He now had all these employees who felt ridiculously rich. (At least in theory, the value of Dan Friedberg\u2019s Serum stash peaked, in September 2021, at over $1 billion.)</p><p>In Sam\u2019s view, everyone at once became a lot less motivated to work fourteen-hour days. And so he did a very Sam thing: he changed the terms of the employees\u2019 Serum.</p><p>In the fine print of the employee Serum contract, he\u2019d reserved for himself the right to extend Serum\u2019s jail time, and he used it to lock up all employees\u2019 Serum for seven years. Sam\u2019s employees had always known that he preferred games in which the rules could change in the middle.</p><p>They now understood that if he had changed the rules once, he might do it again. They became less enthusiastic about their Serum. \u201cIt was very unclear if you had it or if you didn\u2019t have it,\u201d said Ramnik, who had watched in irritation as Sam locked up a bunch of tokens that he\u2019d bought with his own money on the open market before he joined FTX. \u201cI guess you would know in seven years.\u201d (3,980)</p></blockquote><p>Lewis is so close to getting it. He understands that Sam will betray everyone around him whenever he can. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpE_xMRiCLE&amp;ab_channel=AdultSwim\">He is altering the deal, pray that he does not alter it any further</a>. Only from Sam\u2019s perspective, there is no deal, there is only <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Reality-What-You-Can-Away/dp/1561840807\">reality, which is what you can get away with</a>.</p><p>Sam also had the advantage of being Sam and controlling Alameda and FTX.</p><p>He also had the bonus of not being so inspired to turn his paper gains into actual dollars (or stable coins, or liquid cryptos like BTC or ETH). Why liquidate what you can borrow against? That way Number Go Up.</p><p>Another trade he did was to take advantage of all the wash trading. The wash trading was so ingrained into how business was done, and done so poorly, that when SBF intercepted some of it, Binance\u2019s employees failed to explain to their boss CZ what was even happening. Or, he credibly pretended not to understand.</p><blockquote><p>It was a weird conversation\u2014the CEO of one crypto exchange calling the CFO of another to inform him that, if he didn\u2019t want to lose money on his new futures contract, he\u2019d need to improve his market manipulation. Wei Zhou spoke to CZ, who called Sam for a brief though not unfriendly chat, after which Sam concluded that CZ still had not been told by his traders what had actually happened.</p></blockquote><p>What happened was that Binance was doing its market manipulation via predictable market orders, so SBF would step in front of those orders, which made a bunch of money that came out of Binance\u2019s pocket. Which Binance did not like.</p><p>Sam would occasionally consult others on what to do? I guess? Even Lewis realizes Sam does not actually care what anyone else thinks.</p><blockquote><p>After talking to them, Sam could tell himself that he\u2019d checked his judgment without having done so. (2,771)</p><p>Sam had invested $500 million in an artificial intelligence start-up called Anthropic, apparently without bouncing the idea off anyone else. \u201cI said to Sam after he did it, \u2018We don\u2019t know a fucking thing about this company,\u2019 \u201d said Ramnik. (2,818)</p></blockquote><p>Putting the $500 million into Anthropic was arguably the most important decision Sam ever made. I do not know if investing in Anthropic was a good or bad move for the chances of everyone not dying, but chances are this was either a massively good or massively bad investment. It dwarfs in impact the rest of his EA activities combined.</p><p>Another good trade Sam noticed was that rich people dramatically underinvest in politics, whatever you think of Sam\u2019s execution during what one might generously label his learning phase.</p><blockquote><p>What surprised Sam, once he himself had unlimited sums of money, was how slowly rich people and corporations had adapted to their new political environment. The US government exerted massive influence on virtually everything under the sun and maybe even a few things over it. In a single four-year term, a president, working with Congress, directed roughly $15 trillion in spending. And yet in 2016, the sum total of spending by all candidates on races for the presidency and Congress came to a mere $6.5 billion. \u201cIt just seems like there isn\u2019t enough money in politics,\u201d said Sam. \u201cPeople are underdoing it. The weird thing is that Warren Buffett isn\u2019t giving two billion dollars a year.\u201d (2,874)</p></blockquote><p>We should not forget the original arbitrage trade with South Korea and Japan.</p><p>The good arbitrage trade that still doesn\u2019t fully make sense was ModelBot. I see no reason for it not to have worked, but I also see no reason Sam could not have safely proved that it worked by starting small and then scaling up. Why all the drama? Then it stopped working as competition improved.</p><p>Even excluding the arbitrage trades, that track record is really good. Sam took a lot of shots, but I think not thousands of such shots. If you can make trades like Solana at $0.25 and early Anthropic, the rest of your trades can lose and you could still have very good alpha - provided you are responsible with your sizing and other risk management, and cut your losses when trades fail and properly consider liquidity issues. There would be no need to lie, or to do all the fraud and crime.</p><p>The problem was that Sam was the opposite of responsible with the sizing and risk management. He did not cut his losses when trades failed. He did not consider liquidity issues.</p><p>There is also the highly related issue of all the lying and fraud and crime.</p><p>The Plan</p><p>Behind every great fortune, they say, is a great crime. Certainly that was true for this one. Then, as The Godfather tells us, one needs to appear to go legit.</p><p>Sam\u2019s plan was to present FTX as the responsible adults in the room.</p><p>It did help that the room was crypto, and filled with crypto exchanges. Many of which were indeed doing all the crimes. From the perspective of the United States, even the ones not doing all the crimes were still doing crimes anyway, the SEC has yet to explain to anyone what it would take to do crypto without doing crimes.</p><p>The biggest fish in the pond was CZ and Binance. Oh boy were they doing crimes. Their headquarters is intentionally nowhere. Their internal messages explicitly affirm that they are running an unlicensed security exchange in America. And so on.</p><blockquote><p>Which is why, when Sam took in the situation, he decided that Binance\u2019s strategy was unsustainable. That the smart thing to do was to be the world\u2019s most law-abiding and regulator-loving exchange. FTX could use the law, and the regulators, to drive crypto trading from Binance and onto FTX. If countries did not yet have the laws, a small army of FTX lawyers would help them to create them. (2,406)</p></blockquote><p>Step one was to get CZ and Binance off the cap table, so no one evaluating FTX for its legitimacy would see them on the cap table doing all the crime. So Sam bought him out.</p><blockquote><p>For the stake he\u2019d paid $80 million to acquire, CZ demanded $2.2 billion. Sam agreed to pay it. Just before they signed the deal, CZ insisted, for no particular reason, on an extra $75 million. Sam paid that, too. (2,461)</p></blockquote><p>If SBF was going to pretend FTX was worth that much, why shouldn\u2019t CZ get paid accordingly? However, SBF made a big mistake, and left CZ with $500 million in FTT tokens rather than fully paying out in cash. It really should not have been that hard to not let that happen, given all the money available for spewing elsewhere. Ideally you sell a little of the equity you bought back, and use the proceeds from that.</p><p>The next step in reputation washing was a bunch of advertising.</p><blockquote><p>And so when someone from the Miami Heat reached out to them to suggest that FTX buy their naming rights, for $155 million for the next nineteen years, Sam leapt at the chance. That the deal required the approval not just of the NBA but also of the Miami-Dade Board of County Commissioners, a government body, was a bonus. After that, they could point to a government entity that had blessed FTX.</p><p>Once their name was on an American stadium, no one turned down their money. They showered money across US pro sports: Shohei Ohtani and Shaquille O\u2019Neal and LeBron James became spokespeople.</p><p>They paid Major League Baseball $162.5 million to put the company name on every umpire\u2019s uniform. Having the FTX logo on the umpires\u2019 uniforms, Sam thought, was more useful than having it on the players\u2019 uniforms. In basically every TV shot of every Major League Baseball game, the viewer saw the FTX patch. \u201cThe NBA put us through a vetting process,\u201d said FTX lawyer Dan Friedberg. \u201cMajor League Baseball just said okay!\u201d (2,482)</p></blockquote><p>It really is that easy. Once the Miami Heat opened the door, no one else asked any questions. Everyone wanted the money, and that was that, FTX on the umpires. Sure, why not?</p><p>Given how restrictive FTX US was, this helps explain why SBF was so eager to sponsor all the things. He was after a different goal.</p><p>A common theme of FTX\u2019s sponsorships, like much of what FTX did, is that SBF would spew money in spectacular fashion, most of which was wasted, but he\u2019d also have big wins. In this case, the win was Tom Brady.</p><blockquote><p>But everywhere Sam went, people mentioned that they had heard of FTX because of Brady. Hardly anyone mentioned any of the other endorsers. \u201cIt was very clear which things had an effect and which did not,\u201d said Sam. \u201cFor the life of me, I can\u2019t figure out why this is. I still don\u2019t know how to verbalize it.\u201d (2,505)</p></blockquote><p>No one has ever <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalResearchFailure\">Not Done the Research</a> <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CreatorsApathy\">more than Sam</a>, who is confused why Tom Brady impacted people more than Brett Farve. I am not confused at all. Tom Brady is the quarterback everyone was already always talking about, the one everyone hated or perhaps loved, the cheater, the one with the rings, the GOAT, the one who got a girl in trouble and left her, and all that. I say quarterback, you say Brady.</p><p>Next up was getting into politics. As I noted in the good trades section, Sam noticed this was remarkably cheap. So since he had no time to waste but he definitely had money to waste, he got cracking. Gabe Bankman-Fried, Sam\u2019s brother, got put in charge of the political operation.</p><p>Attention is not always people\u2019s strong suit.</p><blockquote><p>I really appreciate this, but it wouldn\u2019t be good for me to take money from FTX, so I can\u2019t\u2014besides, I have found another source of funding.\u2019 That other source of funding was Gabe, my brother.\u201d (2,897)</p></blockquote><p>Sam\u2019s most famous political bet was on Carrick Flynn. The decision to back Flynn comes off in the book, if anything, massively stupider than it looked in real time.</p><blockquote><p>Carrick Flynn\u2019s most important trait, in Sam\u2019s view, was his total command of and commitment to pandemic prevention. His second-most important trait was that he was an effective altruist. (2,927)</p><p>Flynn asked some fellow EAs what they thought about him running for Congress. As a political candidate he had obvious weaknesses: in addition to being a Washington insider and a bit of a carpetbagger, he was terrified of public speaking and sensitive to criticism. He described himself as \u201cvery introverted.\u201d And yet none of the EAs could see any good reason for him not to go for it\u2014and so he\u2019d thrown his hat into the ring. (2,930)</p></blockquote><p>I don\u2019t blame Flynn, who was trying to do what he thought was the right thing and wasn\u2019t legally allowed to coordinate with SBF\u2019s efforts at all. But it seems so utterly obvious every step of the section on him that this man was never going to be in Congress. Yet they threw tons of money at him anyway, even after that money became the central campaign issue, and all the other candidates ganged up on Flynn over being a crypto stooge and a carpetbagger, and everyone in the district was complaining how their mailboxes were overflowing from campaign ads and they couldn\u2019t take one more of Flynn\u2019s spots on the television.</p><p>To be fair, there was real uncertainty the night before, no one knew for sure that it hadn\u2019t worked. And yes, a champion is super valuable?</p><p>What did Sam learn?</p><blockquote><p>[Sam] actually didn\u2019t mind all that much. He\u2019d learned a lesson: there were political candidates no amount of money could get elected. (2,959)</p></blockquote><p>Well, yes. Also, you learned that when you stick your neck out like that you and those associated with you (read: EA) pay a lasting reputational cost. Sam did not seem to notice this.</p><p>No time to lose. Sam was off to meet Mitch McConnell, with everyone scrambling to get SBF into a presentable suit (he had been convinced to technically bring a suit, but had given no thought to its presentability, he let others handle such things) and he worked to ensure not to call Mitch, who insisted on being called Leader, \u2018dear leader\u2019 instead. Which I admit sounds hard.</p><p>Also, check out the claim at the end here.</p><blockquote><p>At that moment, Sam was planning to give $15\u2013$30 million to McConnell to defeat the Trumpier candidates in the US Senate races. On a separate front, he explained to me, as the plane descended into Washington, DC, he was exploring the legality of paying Donald Trump himself not to run for president. His team had somehow created a back channel into the Trump operation and returned with the not terribly earth-shattering news that Donald Trump might indeed have his price: $5 billion. Or so Sam was told by his team. (2,972)</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://puck.news/s-b-f-s-mcconnell-money-tickle-part-2/\">A $10 million donation to a McConnell dark money group One Nation has been confirmed.</a></p><p>I once again remind everyone that, while the price has likely gone up, the offer is probably still on the table if someone is bold enough to take it. Sure, now that he\u2019s got the nomination in his sights it probably costs you $10 billion, but given the way people talk about what a Trump victory would look like, surely that is a small price to pay?</p><p>Meanwhile, Sam claimed to have infiltrated Trump\u2019s team, and I love what they did with the place.</p><blockquote><p>Sam\u2019s team had come up with an idea\u2014which, Sam claimed, was just then making its way to Trump himself. The idea was to persuade Trump to come out and say \u201cI\u2019m for Eric!\u201d without specifying which Eric he was for. After all, Trump didn\u2019t actually care who won. (2,979)</p></blockquote><p>Trump actually did it, and it is plausible this switched which Eric won. Good show.</p><p>The Tragedy of FTT</p><p>The whole FTT situation still blows my mind.</p><p>I mean, I know it happened, I accept it. Still. Blows my mind every time.</p><p>The tragedy is there was absolutely no need for any of it. There was no need to keep flipping coins double-or-nothing for all the money on the assumption that the odds were in Sam\u2019s favor.</p><p>Which they weren\u2019t. Yet he kept flipping.</p><p>So here\u2019s the basics, for those who don\u2019t know.</p><p>Alameda owned a lot of FTT, which is effectively stock in FTX.</p><p>This FTT was highly illiquid. Trying to sell even a fraction of it would have collapsed the price, as everyone involved knew. Collapsing the price of FTT would then, as again everyone involved knew, cause a collapse of confidence in FTX, causing a run on the bank that was FTX. Which those involved had information to know would be quite a serious problem, were it to happen.</p><p>Every trader knows that you do not borrow heavily against your own illiquid stock, with loans recallable at any time and likely to be recalled when times get tough for your industry, to buy other illiquid and highly speculative things highly correlated to your stock and your industry.</p><p>Especially if you know you could not survive the resulting bank run because you\u2019ve appropriated billions in customer funds to cover your other losses or even to keep making more illiquid investments, or to spend on random stuff. All while your exchange was a highly valued money printing machine that could easily raise equity capital.</p><p>And if you were still for some reason going to do that, they would at least know not to also give your biggest rival a huge chunk of that same illiquid token sufficient to crash the market, then actively try to drive him out of his home and bring regulators down on his head, in ways he can see you doing right there.</p><p>I mean, come on, that\u2019s completely insane.</p><p>Except that is, by the book\u2019s admission, exactly what happened.</p><blockquote><p>It seemed perfectly natural for Alameda to control all the remaining FTT, and use it as collateral in its trading activity. Sam didn\u2019t even try to hide what he was doing. (2,105)</p></blockquote><p>Did other crypto firms accept this collateral, knowing or even worse somehow not knowing exactly what this implied? Why yes. Yes they did.</p><p>This created a highly volatile situation. A downward spiral waiting to happen.</p><p>Then crypto crashed, everyone including Alameda lost a lot of money, and it happened.</p><p>To try and prevent it from happening, Alameda had to actually repay its loans, or else the FTT it used as collateral was going to get liquidated. Then it had to bail out firms like Voyager. This was all on top of all the money Alameda and FTX had already spent and lost.</p><p>Sam still did not seem to notice that funding might be an urgent issue.</p><blockquote><p>At their peak, they\u2019d together been valued at roughly $7 billion. Now Ramnik was acquiring them for no more than $200 million. A pittance. Or so it seemed. Ramnik recently had asked Sam how much capital he should assume was available for possible acquisitions, and Sam had said, Just let me know if you get to a billion. (3,100)</p></blockquote><p>So Sam kept poking the bear. Hence, The Vanishing.</p><p>The Vanishing</p><p>That\u2019s what Michael Lewis calls the collapse of FTX.</p><p>The proximate cause was that Sam pissed off CZ, while very much not being in a position to call BS on anyone. As in doing things like this:</p><blockquote><p>Sam later wrote up the message he\u2019d tried to convey to them. \u201cI love Dubai,\u201d he said. But we can\u2019t be in the same place as Binance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;This is for two reasons: first they are constantly devoting significant company resources to trying to hurt us; and second that they soil the reputation of wherever they are. I can\u2019t emphasize this enough: in general I hear great things from other jurisdictions/regulators etc. about Dubai and the UAE [United Arab Emirates], except that there\u2019s a constant refrain of: that\u2019s the jurisdiction that accepted Binance, and so we don\u2019t trust their standards. It was unclear to Sam, if Dubai decided to rid itself of CZ and his exchange, whether any country in which CZ would be willing to live would accept them. In these woods, CZ was the biggest bear and Sam seemed to be going out of his way to poke him. (3,154)</p></blockquote><p>CZ was understandably upset, leaked a supposed balance sheet from Alameda that looked bad but not as bad as the full reality, and announced his intention to dump his FTT.</p><p>Caroline Ellison decided to respond by offering to buy all the FTT at $22, thinking this was a show of strength, except for once crypto investors understood what that meant and acted accordingly.</p><blockquote><p>Within twenty seconds of Caroline\u2019s tweet came a rush to sell FTT by speculators who had borrowed money to buy it. The panic was driven by an assumption: if Alameda Research, the single biggest owner of FTT, was making a big show of being willing to buy a huge pile of it for $22, they must need for some reason to maintain the market price at 22. The most plausible explanation was that Alameda Research was using FTT as collateral to borrow dollars or bitcoin from others. \u201cYou don\u2019t tell someone a price level like $22 unless you have a lot of confidence that you need that price,\u201d the CEO of Gauntlet, Tarun Chitra, told Bloomberg News. By Monday night, the price of FTT had fallen from $22 to $7. (3,203)</p></blockquote><p>Then the run on FTX began in earnest. Which would not have been a problem\u2026</p><blockquote><p>Ramnik could see that money was leaving FTX, but he didn\u2019t view it as a big deal. The customers might panic and pull out all their money. But once they realized that there was nothing to panic about, they\u2019d return, and their money would too. (3,221)</p></blockquote><p>\u2026except that FTX did not have the money to pay their customers, because Alameda had taken it and did not have the ability to give it all back.</p><p>Or have much idea how much they even had.</p><blockquote><p>Though Caroline was in charge of Alameda Research, she seemed totally clueless about where its money was. She\u2019d come onto the screen and announce that she had found $200 million here, or $400 million there, as if she\u2019d just made an original scientific discovery. Some guy at Deltec, their bank in the Bahamas, messaged Ramnik to say, Oh, by the way, you have $300 million with\u2026 And it came as a total surprise to all of them!</p><p>That he\u2019d been taken by surprise. He wondered: If these people knew there was a risk that they might not have enough money, why hadn\u2019t they even bothered to figure out how much they had? They\u2019d done nothing. (3,244)</p></blockquote><p>Didn\u2019t see it coming, I suppose. Did decide to use $8 billion in customer funds as if it was Alameda operating capital. Did not anticipate that the customers might ask for that money back all at once when they found out what was going on. Whoops.</p><p>Lewis rightly points out, near the end, that while many people did realize FTX was obviously up to no good, no one actually managed to figure out the exact no good they were up to until rather late in the game.</p><blockquote><p>Even those who had expressed suspicion about Sam or FTX had failed to say the one simple thing you would say if you knew the secret they were hiding: the customers\u2019 deposits that are supposed to be inside FTX are actually inside Alameda Research. (4,007)</p></blockquote><p>They also couldn\u2019t imagine that things could have been as chaotic and unaccounted for, or as blatant, as they were. It wasn\u2019t necessary for the no good to be that no good. The borrowing against FTT tokens was bad enough on its own.</p><p>A lot of people, as FTX started to collapse, did the same calculation I did. It was quickly clear, as Sam went on Twitter to put on his best dog-drinking-coffee face and say \u2018assets are fine,\u2019 that there were only two possible worlds.</p><p>Either things really were fine, because FTX was obviously a money machine, things not being fine would have meant a completely crazy level of recklessness and incompetence, and SBF had gone way over the \u2018this is fraud if things are not fine\u2019 line and was very all-in. No one would be so stupid as to.</p><p>Or this was pure fraud, through and through, and FTX and SBF did all the crime.</p><p>That\u2019s why me and so many others turned around on a dime - once we could rule out scenario #1, we knew we were in scenario #2.</p><p>One by one, people who wanted it to be one way got the piece of evidence that convinced them it was the other way.</p><blockquote><p>Zane pinged Sam and asked, \u2018Should I do damage control?\u2019 \u2018Yup,\u2019 he said.\u201d Zane then sent Sam a message asking three questions: \u201cOne, are we insolvent, two, did we ever lend out customer funds to Alameda, and three anything I didn\u2019t ask that I need to know?\u201d Sam didn\u2019t reply\u2014and then went totally silent on him. (3,344)</p><p>Still, Zane figured there was no way that FTX was in real trouble. It made no sense. The price of FTT shouldn\u2019t have any effect on the value of the exchange, any more than the price of Apple stock should have on Apple\u2019s iPhone sales. Just the reverse: the exchange\u2019s revenues drove the value of FTT. \u201cIf FTT goes to zero, so what?\u201d said Zane. The other reason it made no sense was that FTX had been so wildly profitable. \u201cI know how much real revenue we were making: two bips [0.02 percent] on two hundred fifty billion dollars a month,\u201d said Zane. \u201cI\u2019m like, Dude, you were sitting on a fucking printing press: why did you need to do this?\u201d (3,347)</p></blockquote><p>Here is happens to Constance, on seeing the \u2018balance sheet.\u2019</p><blockquote><p>The next document in her stack was a rough balance sheet of Alameda Research that differed in important ways from the rough balance sheet that had inspired the CoinDesk article now being credited with bringing down the entire business. It appeared to Constance that it had been hastily concocted either by Sam or Caroline, or maybe by both. Constance had first come across it the previous Tuesday, after FTX had ceased sending money back to its customers. \u201cWhen I saw it, I told my team not to respond to external parties because I did not want them to lose their good name and reputation,\u201d she said.</p><p>The list of assets included the details of hundreds of private investments Sam had made over the previous two years, apparently totaling $4,717,030,200. The liabilities now had a line item more important than everything else combined: $10,152,068,800 of customer deposits. More than $10 billion that was meant to be custodied by FTX somehow had ended up inside Sam\u2019s private trading fund. The document listed only $3 billion in liquid assets\u2014that is, US dollars or crypto that could be sold immediately for dollars.</p><p>\u201cI was like, Holy shit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe question is: Why?\u201d It was the same question Zane had asked. \u201cWe had so profitable a business,\u201d said Constance. \u201cOur profit margin was forty to fifty percent. We made four hundred million dollars last year.\u201d (3,478)</p></blockquote><p>They may have made five hundred million, but even if they hadn\u2019t stolen everyone\u2019s money, that was not about to pay the expenses.</p><blockquote><p>Constance herself had lost around $25 million. She still had $80,000 in an ordinary bank account she\u2019d kept from her previous life, but otherwise she\u2019d lost everything. (3,492)</p></blockquote><p>This is the kind of thing that still blows my mind. You have stock in FTX, you have $25 million in liquid assets, the world is in front of you. And you chase FTX\u2019s interest payments, and trust FTX so much, that you keep all your money on the exchange. What? That is completely crazy behavior. And yet, most employees tell exactly that story. It seems likely SBF/FTX insisted upon it, and Lewis either missed this or declined to mention it.</p><p>Because at $25 million while working at a crypto company, I\u2019d hope I\u2019d be doing things like millions in gold in a secret vault. At minimum I\u2019d have $5 million in an offshore bank account.</p><p>But even after that, Constance didn\u2019t turn on Sam yet. She only turned on Sam when she realized that, compared to those around her, she\u2019d been given an order of magnitude or two less stock than she should have gotten.</p><blockquote><p>That\u2019s when Constance\u2019s feeling about Sam changed: when she saw how she\u2019d actually been treated. (3,524)</p></blockquote><p>Only then did she decide to spend the last chapter of the book helping Sam with logistics so she could try to get Sam to confess.</p><p>The Reckoning</p><p>As future prisoners, having been caught doing all the crime, the principles of FTX faced the prisoner\u2019s dilemma.</p><p>The game theory of SBF: You have to commit to the bit.</p><blockquote><p>That night, Nishad requested a meeting with just Gary and Sam. Once the three were alone in a room, Nishad asked, What happens if law enforcement or regulators reach out? What do you mean? Sam asked. How do we make sure we cooperate in prisoner\u2019s dilemma? How do we all make sure we say the other ones are innocent? I don\u2019t have any reason to think any one of us had criminal intent, said Sam. (3,291)</p><p>No, said Nishad. That\u2019s not good enough. You need to talk to them. You need to tell them I had no clue. How could I know that? asked Sam. You are saying that I should say that you know nothing about something I know nothing about. How is that even possible? It makes no sense. But I didn\u2019t know, said Nishad. Then say that, said Sam. It\u2019s not going to work for me, said Nishad. Because there is code-based evidence of what I did. (3,295)</p></blockquote><p>The game theory of everyone else? Not so much.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/matt_levine/status/1713273141118509317\">Caroline held this meeting on November 9</a> to explain the situation to her employees. as Patrick McKenzie says \u2018what a document.\u2019</p><p>Being Causal Decision Theory agents, and being somewhat more grounded in reality, the rest of the EAs all turned state\u2019s witness.</p><p>Sam also had many other bizarre ideas about how any of this worked.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cAt the end of the day, the deciding factor in the jurisdictional dispute is Gary,\u201d said Sam, the night Zane left, \u201cbecause he\u2019s the only one who knows how to use a computer.\u201d (3,374)</p></blockquote><p>Sam was convinced to declare bankruptcy in America lest he instead have it declared for him by less friendly other parties, then tried to undo it which you cannot do, then went around insisting that if he hadn\u2019t declared bankruptcy it would all have worked out.</p><p>Sam kept trying to explain how the money was all there, really, or close to it, and how all of this was merely a serious of unfortunate \u2018fuck ups\u2019 and misunderstandings. Sam thought he had plenty of money, didn\u2019t keep track of things properly, everything seemed safe at the time, he was as surprised as anyone.</p><p>So far, so public domain. The weird thing is that Michael Lewis seems to buy it.</p><blockquote><p>In Sam\u2019s telling, FTX had switched off Alameda\u2019s risk limits to make itself more appealing. The losses caused by this unsettling policy were in any case trivial. Ordinary trading loans made by FTX to Alameda constituted a small fraction of the losses to customers; on their own, they wouldn\u2019t have posed a problem. The bulk of the customers\u2019 money inside of Alameda that should have been inside FTX\u2014$8.8 billion of it, to be exact\u2014resided in an account that Alameda had labeled fiat@. The fiat@ account had been set up in 2019 to receive the dollars and other fiat currencies sent by FTX\u2019s new customers. (3,543)</p><p>In Sam\u2019s telling, the dollars sent in by customers that had accumulated inside of Alameda Research had simply never been moved. Until July 2021, there was no other place to put them, as FTX had no US dollar bank accounts. They\u2019d been listed on a dashboard of FTX\u2019s customer deposits but remained inside Alameda\u2019s bank accounts. Sam also claimed that, right up until at least June 2022, this fact, which others now found so shocking, hadn\u2019t attracted his attention. (3,555)</p><p>But even if you valued the contents of Alameda more rigorously, as Sam sort of did in his head sometimes, you could still easily get to $30 billion. The $8.8 billion that should not have been inside Alameda Research was not exactly a rounding error. But it was, possibly, not enough to worry about. As Sam put it: \u201cI didn\u2019t ask, like, \u2018How many dollars do we have?\u2019 It felt to us that Alameda had infinity dollars.\u201d (3,562)</p><p>At that point, in Sam\u2019s telling, Sam thought that Alameda might be in trouble. He decided to dig into its accounts on his own and understand the problem. By October, he had a clearer picture. It was only then that he could see that Alameda had been operating as if the $8.8 billion in customer funds belonged to it. And by then it was too late to do anything about it. (3,576)</p></blockquote><p>This story does not actually make any sense, and of course is directly and blatantly contradicted by testimony at the trial. And yet Michael Lewis is intrigued:</p><blockquote><p>I had a different question. It preoccupied me from the moment of the collapse: Where had the money gone? It was not obvious what had happened to it. (3,610)</p><p>At any rate, when I was done, my extremely naive money-in, money-out statement looked like this:</p><p>MONEY IN:</p><p>Net customer deposits: $15 billion</p><p>Investments from venture capitalists: $2.3 billion</p><p>Alameda trading profits: $2.5 billion</p><p>FTX exchange revenues: $2 billion</p><p>Net outstanding loans from crypto lenders (mainly Genesis and BlockFi): $1.5 billion</p><p>Original sale of FTT: $35 million</p><p>Total: $23,335,000,000</p><p>MONEY OUT:</p><p>Returned to customers during the November run: $5 billion</p><p>Amount paid out to CZ: $1.4 billion (Just the hard cash part of the payment. I\u2019m ignoring the $500 million worth of FTT Sam also paid him, as Sam minted those for free. I\u2019m also ignoring the $80 million worth of BNB tokens that CZ had used to pay for his original stake, worth $400 million at the time Sam returned them as part of his buyout of CZ\u2019s interest.)</p><p>Sam\u2019s private investments: $4.4 billion (The whole portfolio was $4.7 billion, but at least one investment, valued at $300 million, Sam had paid for with shares in FTX. He likely did the same with others, and so this number is likely bigger than it actually was.)</p><p>Loans to Sam: $1 billion (Used for political and EA donations. After his lawyers explained to him that taking out loans was smarter than paying himself a stock dividend, as he\u2019d need to pay tax on the dividends.)</p><p>Loans to Nishad for same: $543 million</p><p>Endorsement deals: $500 million (This is likely generous too, as in some cases\u2014Tom Brady was one of them\u2014FTX paid its endorsers with FTX stock and not dollars.) Buying and burning their exchange token,</p><p>FTT: $600 million</p><p>Corporate expenses (salaries, lunch, Bahamas real estate): $1 billion</p><p>Total: $14,443,000,000 (3,626)</p></blockquote><p>The case has been made to me that this accounting is not as naive and stupid as it looks. I continue to mostly disagree with that. Lewis continues to double down.</p><blockquote><p>There were some likely explanations for the missing money. The more you thought about them, however, the less persuasive they became. For example, Alameda traders might have gambled away $6 billion. But if they had, why did they all believe themselves to be so profitable, right to the end? I\u2019d spoken to a bunch of them. Several were former Jane Streeters. They weren\u2019t stupid. (3,462)</p></blockquote><p>This is perhaps the most \u2018naive guy\u2019 thing in the entire book. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Smartest-Guys-in-Room-audiobook/dp/B004BZQQAS/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1PBAF26FV2Q3&amp;keywords=the+smartest+guys+in+the+room&amp;qid=1698193060&amp;sprefix=THE+SMARTEST%2Caps%2C79&amp;sr=8-1\">Smart people can\u2019t think they are making good trades when they are making bad ones</a> <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/When-Genius-Failed-audiobook/dp/B00005QTH9/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2I1NDUINSQZH0&amp;keywords=long+term+capital+management&amp;qid=1698193171&amp;s=audible&amp;sprefix=long+term+capital+management%2Caudible%2C61&amp;sr=1-1\">and losing tons of money</a>, right? And they wouldn\u2019t lie to Michael Lewis about profitability, right?</p><blockquote><p>The most hand-wavy story just then being bandied about was that the collapse in crypto prices somehow sucked all the money out of Sam\u2019s World. And it was true that Sam\u2019s massive holdings of Solana and FTT\u2014and other tokens of even more dubious value\u2014had crashed. They\u2019d gone from being theoretically worth $100 billion at the end of 2021 to being worth practically zero in November 2022.</p><p>But Sam had paid next to nothing for these tokens; they had always been more like found money than an investment he\u2019d forked over actual dollars to acquire. He\u2019d minted FTT himself, for free. (3,647)</p></blockquote><p>At their peak, Alameda was on (some form of electronic) paper worth $100 billion or so. We know that Alameda\u2019s edge in algorithmic trades had likely been going away as they faced stiffer competition, that source of profit was likely gone, yet they continued to borrow. What was the profitable trading Alameda was doing with all that capital?</p><p>They were getting long. Alameda was borrowing a bunch of capital from various lenders, and using it to get long and then get longer. That is where the money was going.</p><p>Then Number Went Down. Money gone.</p><p>Does Michael Lewis think the people at Three Arrows Capital or Voyager were stupid? The people who created and ran Luna? Enron? Lehman Brothers? Does this man not remember his own books?</p><p>He said it himself. Sam\u2019s entire empire was a leveraged - Lewis\u2019s word - bet on the success of crypto and the empire itself more generally. When you have no ethics only a quest for Number Go Up (you know, for the common good) and therefore don\u2019t care that, sure, technically that was customer deposits right there, that leverages your bet all the more. As Number Go Down, rather than hedge, they doubled down, including via providing bailouts.</p><p>Leverage plus Number Go Down equals Broke Fi Broke, overwhelming other sources of profits.</p><p>Yes, a lot of their horde of stuff they bought for pennies. But they then used that as collateral to borrow money and put more things into the horde. All of which was correlated, and all of which was down. A lot.</p><p>Also, SBF was shoving money out the door in any number of other ways that the above numbers are missing, money was constantly being misplaced or stolen, a fire sale is not a cheap thing to partake in, and so on. So I do not think there is any mystery here.</p><p>We then get a fascinating story. San says combined losses from things like this were only $1 billion, but honestly how would he even know given everything.</p><blockquote><p>But on that evening, Sam filled in one piece of this particular puzzle: FTX had lost a lot of money to hackers. To avoid encouraging other hackers, they\u2019d kept their losses quiet. The biggest hacks occurred in March and April 2021. A lone trader had opened an account on FTX and cornered the market in two thinly traded tokens, BitMax and MobileCoin.</p><p>His purchases drove up the prices of the two tokens wildly: the price of MobileCoin went from $2.50 to $54 in just a few weeks. This trader, who appeared to be operating from Turkey, had done what he had done not out of some special love for MobileCoin. He\u2019d found a flaw in FTX\u2019s risk management software. FTX allowed traders to borrow bitcoin and other easily sellable crypto against the value of their MobileCoin and BitMax holdings.</p><p>The trader had inflated the value of MobileCoin and BitMax so that he might borrow actually valuable crypto against them from FTX. Once he had it he vanished, leaving FTX with a collapsing pile of tokens and a loss of $600 million worth of crypto.</p><p>The size of those hacks was an exception, Sam said. All losses due to theft combined had come to just a bit more than $1 billion. In all cases, Gary had quietly fixed the problem and they\u2019d all moved on and allowed the thieves to keep their loot. \u201cPeople playing the game,\u201d was Sam\u2019s description of them. (He really was easy to steal from.) (3,701)</p></blockquote><p>That is not a hack. He did not steal the money. You gave it to him.</p><p>I know that people call such things hacks, like the \u2018hack\u2019 about going both ways using leverage earlier. Instead, Sam is right here. This is people playing the game. If your risk engine is stupid enough to let me use my MOBL at $54 to borrow and withdraw a bunch of actual BTC, treating the value of MOBL as real, then that is on the risk engine, whether or not there was also market manipulation involved. I felt the same way about Avi and the Mango trade - yes sure it is illegal and no one is crying for him when he gets arrested nor should they, but also suck it up and write better code, everyone, as is the crypto way.</p><p>FTX\u2019s risk engine was by all accounts excellent, when dealing with coins that were liquid relative to the position sizes involved, and when the risk engine was set to on. FTX\u2019s risk engine was sometimes turned off, and the risk engine clearly did not make reasonable adjustments for illiquid or obviously bubble-shaped coins.</p><p>This also was rather a big deal - FTX lost, by Sam\u2019s own account, a full year\u2019s profits. And that\u2019s the official Sam story. The real story is inevitably much worse. I do not for a second buy that they only lost $1 billion total in hacks.</p><p>John Ray, the Hero We Need</p><p>John Ray is pretty great. He\u2019s the guy who cleaned up the Enron mess, the guy you call when you have a world-class mess, and he\u2019s the one they called in for FTX.</p><p>Suddenly there is a no-nonsense adult in the room who is having none of it, even when there is some of it worth having.</p><p>Michael Lewis tries his best to throw shade at him, but Lewis is too honest - too much a naive guy - for any of it to stick even a little.</p><blockquote><p>As a legal matter, at 4:30 in the morning on Friday, November 11, 2022, Sam Bankman-Fried DocuSigned FTX into bankruptcy and named John Ray as FTX\u2019s new CEO. As a practical matter, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell lined up John Ray to replace Sam as the CEO of FTX, and then John Ray hired Sullivan &amp; Cromwell as the lawyers for the massive bankruptcy. (3,772)</p><p>While Sam stewed, John Ray read up on him and this company he\u2019d created. \u201cIt\u2019s like, What is this thing?\u201d said Ray. \u201cNow it\u2019s just a failure, but it was once some kind of business. What did you guys do? What\u2019s the situation? Why\u2019s this falling into bankruptcy so quickly?\u201d He briefly considered the possibility that the failure was innocent: maybe they got hacked. \u201cThen you start looking at the kid,\u201d said Ray, the kid being Sam. \u201cI looked at his picture and thought, There\u2019s something wrong going on with him.\u201d</p><p>Ray prided himself on his snap judgments. He could look at a person and in ten minutes know who they were, and never need to reconsider his opinion. The men he evaluated he tended to place in one of three bins in his mind: \u201cgood guy,\u201d \u201cnaive guy,\u201d and \u201ccrook.\u201d Sam very obviously was not a good guy. And he sure didn\u2019t seem naive. (3,783)</p></blockquote><p>That\u2019s a great skill if you are consistently correct. Based on the evidence presented, John Ray is almost never wrong about what type of guy he is dealing with.</p><blockquote><p>He\u2019d spoken only long enough with the other members of Sam\u2019s inner circle to see them for what they were. Nishad Singh struck him as a naive guy. \u201cHe\u2019s narrow,\u201d said Ray. \u201cIt\u2019s tech, tech, tech. There\u2019s never a problem he can\u2019t solve. He\u2019s not going to steal money. He\u2019s not going to do anything wrong. But he has no idea what\u2019s going on around him. You ask him for a steak and he puts his head up the bull\u2019s ass.\u201d</p><p>The bankruptcy team had located Caroline Ellison by phone on the Saturday after Ray became FTX\u2019s new CEO. She at least had been able to explain where some of the wallets storing the crypto were stashed. Other than that, she wasn\u2019t much use. \u201cShe\u2019s cold as ice,\u201d said Ray. \u201cYou had to buy words by the vowel. An obvious complete fucking weirdo.\u201d (3,797)</p></blockquote><p>Nishad being a naive guy seems right to me, based on the rest of the book. He had more than enough information to know what was happening, but the <a href=\"https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArcWords\">Arc Words</a> of the whole book are that people don\u2019t see what they don\u2019t look for, so there you go.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThere\u2019s people that are born criminals, and there\u2019re people that become criminals,\u201d said Ray. \u201cI think [Sam] became a criminal. The how and why he became a criminal I don\u2019t know. I think maybe it takes an understanding of this kid and his parents.\u201d (3,808)</p></blockquote><p>John Ray is here to let you know that you are suffering, and pitying, too many fools.</p><blockquote><p>Six days into his new job, Ray filed a report with the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. \u201cNever in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here,\u201d he wrote. Instead of grilling the people who had created the mess, Ray hired teams of hard-nosed sleuths\u2014many of whom he\u2019d worked with before. \u201cSerious adults,\u201d as he called them. The Nardello firm was a lot of former FBI guys. (Corporate motto: We find out.) (3,822)</p></blockquote><p>First he got things under some semblance of order. He then moved on to looking for all the money.</p><blockquote><p>That was in early 2023. By late April, John Ray\u2019s head was on a swivel. \u201cThis is live-action,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always something every hour.\u201d One day, some random crypto exchange got in touch and said, By the way, we have $170 million in an account of yours: do you want it back? Another day, some random FTX employee called them out of the blue to say that he\u2019d borrowed two million bucks from the company and wanted to repay the loan\u2014of which, so far as Ray could see, there was no record. Of course, once you heard about one loan, you had to wonder how many others like it you\u2019d never hear about. (3,836)</p><p>Several months into the hunt, Ray\u2019s sleuths had discovered that \u201csomeone had robbed the exchange of four hundred fifty million.\u201d They\u2019d stumbled upon not the simple hack of November 2022 but the complicated BitMax and MobileCoin hacks of $600 million in the spring of 2021. (The dollar value changed with fluctuations in the price of the stolen crypto.) They\u2019d tracked the hacker not to Turkey but Mauritius. \u201cWe have a picture of him going in and out of his house,\u201d said Ray. He was pretty sure he was going to get most of that money back. \u201cWe believe there are a lot more of these,\u201d said Ray. (3,844)</p></blockquote><p>Lewis portrays Ray in all this as an archeologist, shifting through the ruins for cash and clues. Michael Lewis makes a point of all the money Ray and his team were going to bill FTX for the work they did. I look at what they had to deal with and how much money they ultimately rounded up, and I say they earned every penny. Part of earning that is that when you are Ray, you cannot rely upon or trust anyone who made the mess in the first place. That\u2019s hostile information sources. If you want it done right, and you do, you have to figure it all out for yourself.</p><p>The best thing about Ray is his reaction to Lewis, as Lewis keeps trying to explain all the things he think he knows, and Ray keeps ignoring him, and it\u2019s going to be some of the straight up funniest scenes in the movie.</p><p>I demand that Ray be played by John Goodman, it would be so perfect.</p><blockquote><p>At some point his team discovered that a Hong Kong subsidiary of Alameda Research called Cottonwood Grove had bought vast sums of FTT, for example. To the innocent archaeologist, it was evidence of Sam\u2019s World artificially propping up the value of FTT. Ray didn\u2019t know that FTX had been obligated to spend roughly a third of its revenues buying back and burning its token, and that Cottonwood Grove was the entity that did it. From my perch on the side of the dig, I would occasionally shout down to the guy running it my guess about the most recent find, but he\u2019d just look up at me, pityingly. I was clearly a naive guy. (3,875)</p></blockquote><p>Yes. Very clearly.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/liron/status/1710193485763289469\">We have a fun clip of Ray spelling the uselessness of Lewis to him out for us</a>.</p><p>The thing about Ray is that, in order to be so good at his job, he needs to have zero tolerance for pretty much anything. So when something actually is real, he can miss it.</p><blockquote><p>The hundreds of private investments made by Alameda Research, for instance. When we first met, in early 2023, Ray went on about how fishy these all were. He had a theory about why Sam had thrown money around the way he had: Sam was buying himself some friends. \u201cFor the first time in his life, everyone ignores the fact that he\u2019s a fucking weirdo,\u201d said Ray. As an example, he cited the dollars Sam had invested in artificial intelligence companies. \u201cHe gave five hundred million bucks to this thing called Anthropic,\u201d said Ray. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bunch of people with an idea. Nothing.\u201d (3,886)</p></blockquote><p>Lewis would say this theory is ridiculous, and on its face it definitely is, everyone wanted to be Sam\u2019s friend, but also how much got invested into OpenAI and Anthropic in the name of access? As in, friendship?</p><p>What Ray cannot see is that Anthropic was obviously a very good financial investment, because he does not know anything about AI. He certainly does not want to hear anything about existential risk, or whether Anthropic is helping or not helping with that concern.</p><p>A key question was, what crypto was worth anything, and what wasn\u2019t? For some reason Ray locked onto Serum, the offshoot of Solana.</p><blockquote><p>And yet now, somehow, in John Ray\u2019s book, the locked Serum was good shit. Primo crypto of the finest vintage imbibed by all gentlemen of good taste. And who knows?\u2014maybe one day it will be. But if Serum was a token to be taken seriously, Sam Bankman-Fried and the world he created needed to be viewed in a different light. At Serum\u2019s peak price, the stated market value of Sam\u2019s stash of it was $67 billion. On November 7, 2022, Sam\u2019s pile of mostly locked Serum was still \u201cworth\u201d billions of dollars. If even locked Serum had that kind of value, FTX was solvent right up to the moment it collapsed. And John Ray would have no grounds for clawing back money from any of the many lucky people on whom Sam Bankman-Fried had showered it.

Ray was inching toward an answer to the question I\u2019d been asking from the day of the collapse: Where did all that money go? The answer was: nowhere. It was still there. (4,000)</p></blockquote><p>Caroline Ellison</p><p>Sam\u2019s on-again, off-again, very-bad-idea relationship with Caroline Ellison is a key part of the story, because Caroline ended up effectively in charge of Alameda when the worst of the fraud went down. It does not seem like a coincidence that Caroline ended up in charge of Alameda, despite her not seeming like someone who should be given that kind of responsibility, as per (among other signs) her repeated observations that she was not up to the job.</p><p>Also she did not have an ideal attitude with respect to willingness to do various crimes, where the whole thing made her deeply uncomfortable but she still did the crimes anyway - you want someone who does not do crimes, or contains their crimes to contextually \u2018ordinary decent crimes\u2019 rather than outright frauds like stealing customer funds. Or if you have decided that your plan is to do a lot of crimes, a plan I recommend strongly against, you want someone who is fine with doing lots of crime.</p><p>In any case, Caroline it seems exchanged long emails spelling out the arguments for exactly how obviously she and Sam should not have been dating, with Sam offering points like this:</p><blockquote><p>[Sam] began with a seriously compelling list, titled: ARGUMENTS AGAINST:</p><p>In a lot of ways I don\u2019t really have a soul. This is a lot more obvious in some contexts than others. But in the end there\u2019s a pretty decent argument that my empathy is fake, my feelings are fake, my facial reactions are fake. I don\u2019t feel happiness. What\u2019s the point in dating someone who you physically can\u2019t make happy? I have a long history of getting bored and claustrophobic. This has the makings of a time when I\u2019m less worried about it than normal; but the baseline prior might be high enough that nothing else matters. I feel conflicted about what I want. Sometimes I really want to be with you. Sometimes I want to stay at work for 60 hours straight and not think about anything else. I\u2019m worried about power dynamics between us. This could destroy Alameda if it goes really poorly PR-wise. This combos really badly with the current EA shitshow I\u2019m supposed to be, in some ways, adjudicating. I make people sad. Even people who I inspire, I don\u2019t really make happy. And people who I date\u2014it\u2019s really harrowing.</p><p>It really fucking sucks, to be with someone who (a) you can\u2019t make happy, (b) doesn\u2019t really respect anyone else, (c) constantly thinking really offensive things, (d) doesn\u2019t have time for you, and (e) wants to be alone half the time. There are a lot of really fucked up things about dating an employee.</p><p>This list was followed by another, briefer list, titled \u201cARGUMENTS IN FAVOR.\u201d I really fucking like you. I really like talking to you. I feel a lot less worried about saying what\u2019s on my mind to you than to almost anyone else. You share my most important interests. You\u2019re a good person. I really like fucking you. You\u2019re smart and impressive. You have good judgement and aren\u2019t full of shit. You appreciate a lot of me for who I am. (2,126)</p></blockquote><p>While I admit those are actually pretty strong arguments in favor, and in other circumstances would be very good reasons to date someone, the arguments against seem rather conclusive.</p><blockquote><p>Caroline wanted a conventional love with an unconventional man. Sam wanted to do whatever at any given moment offered the highest expected value, and his estimate of her expected value seemed to peak right before they had sex and plummet immediately after. (2,155)</p></blockquote><p>This is exactly what one would expect from the rest of Sam\u2019s behavior in other contexts. Story checks out.</p><p>That I guess brings us to the psychiatrist? Who according to other reports had the entire firm including Sam hopped up on various pills in ways the book declines to mention?</p><blockquote><p>It didn\u2019t take a psychiatrist to see a pattern in Sam\u2019s relationship with Caroline, but there happened to be one sitting in the middle of it. His name was George Lerner, and by late 2021 he might have been the world\u2019s leading authority on the inner life of effective altruists. (2,208)</p></blockquote><p>I know of at least two psychiatrists who were and are better experts on this than George Lerner. For example, have you met\u2026 Scott Alexander? Anyway.</p><blockquote><p>Then the effective altruists started showing up\u2014and when they did, George took a new and keener interest in his patients. Gabe Bankman-Fried, Sam\u2019s younger brother, was the first, but hard on his heels came Caroline Ellison and others from Alameda Research. By the time Sam arrived, a year later, George was treating maybe twenty EAs. As a group, they eased a worry George had about himself: the limits to his powers of empathy. When ordinary people came to him with their ordinary feelings, he often found himself faking an understanding. The EAs didn\u2019t need his empathy; the EAs thought that even they shouldn\u2019t care about their feelings. In their single-minded quest to maximize the utility of their lives, they were seeking to minimize the effect of their feelings. In their single-minded quest to maximize the utility of their lives, they were seeking to minimize the effect of their feelings. \u201cThe way they put it to me is that their emotions are getting in the way of their ability to reduce their decisions to just numbers.\u201d (2,238)</p><p>They were all completely and utterly sincere. They judged the morality of any action by its consequences and were living their life to maximize those consequences. (2,249)</p></blockquote><p>You can\u2019t do that. I mean, obviously you literally can, but professionally no, you really, really can\u2019t treat Gabe and his brother Sam and his girlfriend and employee Caroline and everyone else in their entire social network. This is Dr. Nick territory. Then again, given what everyone involved wanted, maybe you can? It\u2019s not like they wanted anything from him except drugs and practical advice understanding other people. Maybe there is no conflict of interest here after all.</p><p>Also, who cares, given George didn\u2019t even have a license in the Bahamas in the first place?</p><blockquote><p>The Bahamas hadn\u2019t granted George a medical license. His title was Senior Professional Coach. (2,633)</p></blockquote><p>Perhaps he was taking inspiration from the (nominal) psychiatrist in Billions?</p><p>New and Old EA Cause Areas</p><p>In addition to his EA causes, SBF did have his own cause area, which was physical beauty.</p><p>He was against it.</p><blockquote><p>[Anna Wintour of Vogue] looked like a million bucks, but her art, like all art, was wasted on Sam. (235)</p><p>\u201cYou start by making decisions on who you are going to be with based on how they look,\u201d he said. \u201cThen, because of that, you make bad choices about religion and food and everything else. Then you are just rolling the dice on who you are going to be.\u201d</p><p>Anna Wintour, now that he thought of it, represented much of what he disliked about human beings. \u201cThere are very few businesses that I have strong moral objections to, and hers is one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI actually have disdain for fashion. I have general disdain for the importance that physical attractiveness has, and this is one thing emanating out of that.\u201d (348)</p></blockquote><p>He also investigated but dismissed as a child <a href=\"https://unsongbook.com/\">the cause area of hell</a>.</p><blockquote><p>He found his way to a solution that offered temporary relief: only children suffered from this madness. Yes, kids believed in Santa. But grown-ups did not. There was a limit to the insanity. But then, a year or so later, a boy in his class said he believed in God.</p><p>\u201cAnd I freaked out,\u201d recalled Sam. \u201cThen he freaked out. We both freaked out. I remember thinking, Wait a minute, do you think I\u2019m going to hell? Because that seems like a big deal. If hell exists, why do you, like, care about McDonald\u2019s? Why are we talking about any of this shit, if there is a hell. If it really exists. It\u2019s fucking terrifying, hell.\u201d</p><p>From the widespread belief in God, and Santa, Sam drew a conclusion: it was possible for almost everyone to be self-evidently wrong about something. \u201cMass delusions are a property of the world, as it turns out,\u201d he said.</p></blockquote><p>According to the company psychiatrist, the EAs really did only care about suffering.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t really start with people,\u201d said George. \u201cIt starts with suffering. It\u2019s about preventing suffering.\u201d (2,257)</p></blockquote><p>This attitude drives me bonkers. Yes, suffering is bad. It is the way we indicate to ourselves that things are bad. It sucks. Preventing it is a good idea. But when you think that suffering is the thing that matters, you confuse the map for the territory, the measure for the man, the math with reality. Combine that with all the other EA beliefs, set this as a maximalist goal, and you get\u2026 well, among other things, you get FTX. Also you get people worried about wild animal or electron suffering and who need hacks put in to not actively want to wipe out humanity.</p><p>If you do not love life, and you do not love people, or anything or anyone within the world, and instead wholly rely on a proxy metric? If you do not have Something to Protect? Oh no.</p><p>I mean, listen to yourselves, as George is describing you:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cA lot of EAs chose not to have kids,\u201d said George. \u201cIt\u2019s because of the impact on their own lives. They believe that having kids takes away from their ability to have impact on the world.\u201d After all, in the time it took to raise a child to become an effective altruist, you could persuade some unknowably large number of people who were not your children to become effective altruists. \u201cIt feels selfish to have a kid. The EA argument for having a kid is that kid equals happiness and happiness equals increased productivity. If they can get there in their head, then maybe they have a kid.\u201d (2,261)</p><p>\u201cThere are two parts of being EA,\u201d said George. \u201cPart one is the focus on consequences. Part two is the personal sacrifice.\u201d (2,267)</p></blockquote><p>That is saying, my own child\u2019s only value would be if they too become an effective altruist, or if they increase my altruistic productivity. This is not an attitude compatible with life. If this is you, please halt, catch fire and seek help immediately.</p><p>This last point does not ring true, EAs totally complain about lack of dating opportunities, although I can totally buy that everyone else thought the EAs thought they were smarter than everyone else - and in context, that they were technically right.</p><blockquote><p>\u201cEveryone is complaining about the lack of dating opportunities,\u201d said George. \u201cExcept the EAs. The EAs didn\u2019t care.\u201d</p><p>The non-EAs thought the EAs thought they were smarter than everybody else. (2,628)</p></blockquote><p>As much as I criticize EAs, I do it because they are worthy of criticism. They aspire to do better. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t waste my time. And when Lewis goes too far and misses the mark, there\u2019s big \u2018no one picks on my brother but me\u2019 energy.</p><blockquote><p>One day some historian of effective altruism will marvel at how easily it transformed itself. It turned its back on living people without bloodshed or even, really, much shouting. You might think that people who had sacrificed fame and fortune to save poor children in Africa would rebel at the idea of moving on from poor children in Africa to future children in another galaxy. They didn\u2019t, not really\u2014which tells you something about the role of ordinary human feeling in the movement. It didn\u2019t matter. What mattered was the math. Effective altruism never got its emotional charge from the places that charged ordinary philanthropy. It was always fueled by a cool lust for the most logical way to lead a good life. (3,045)</p></blockquote><p>We rationalists have long had a name for the \u2018emotional charge\u2019 that drives ordinary philanthropy. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3p3CYauiX8oLjmwRF/purchase-fuzzies-and-utilons-separately\">We call it \u2018cute puppies with rare diseases.</a>\u2019 There is a reason most philanthropy accomplishes nothing except fueling that emotional charge, which is that most decisions in most philanthropy are driven by fueling that emotional charge. The entire point, the founding principle, of EA, the core of what is good about EA, is to care about actually accomplishing the mission and cutting the enemy.</p><p>Can this be taken too far in various ways to the point where it loses its connection to reality? Does relying too much on the math and not enough on common sense and error checks lead to not noticing wrong conclusions are wrong? Oh yes, this absolutely happens in practice, the SBF group was not so extreme an outlier here.</p><p>But at least the crazy kids are trying. At all. They get to be wrong, where most others are not even wrong.</p><p>Also, future children in another galaxy? Try our own children, here and now. People get fooled into thinking that \u2018long term\u2019 means some distant future. And yes, in some important senses, most of the potential value of humanity lies in its distant future.</p><p>But the dangers we aim to prevent, the benefits we hope to accrue? They are not some distant dream of a million years from now. They are for people alive today. You, yes you, and your loved ones and friends and if you have them children, are at risk of dying from AI or from a pandemic. Nor are these risks so improbable that one needs to cite future generations for them to be worthy causes.</p><p>I fight the possibility of AI killing everyone, not (only or even primarily) because of a long, long time from now in a galaxy far, far away. I fight so I and everyone else will have grandchildren, and so that those grandchildren will live. Here and now.</p><p>If some other EAs made this change because the numbers (overwhelmingly, and in this case I believe correctly) said so, and would have done so even if the case was less overwhelmingly correct? So be it. We need some people like that. Others need to help with global poverty, and so they do. And they make a lot of mistakes there too, they take the math too seriously, they don\u2019t consider second and third order effects properly, and so on. I could go on rants. But you know what? They try, damn it.</p><p>As opposed to ordinary philanthropy, where the EAs are right: It\u2019s mostly kinda dumb.</p><blockquote><p>They\u2019d been doing this for only a year and already had been pitched nearly two thousand such projects. They\u2019d handed out some money but in the process they\u2019d concluded that conventional philanthropy was kind of dumb. Just to deal with the incoming requests\u2014most of which they had no ability to evaluate\u2014would require a big staff and lots of expense. Much of their money would end up being used on a vast bureaucracy.</p><p>And so they had just recently adopted a new approach: instead of giving money away themselves, they scoured the world for subject matter experts who might have their own, better ideas for how to give away money.</p><p>Over the previous six months, one hundred people with deep knowledge of pandemic prevention and artificial intelligence had received an email from FTX that said, in effect: Hey, you don\u2019t know us, but here\u2019s a million dollars, no strings attached. Your job is to give it away as effectively as you can.</p><p>The FTX Foundation, started in early 2021, would track what these people did with their million dollars, but only to determine if they should be given even more. \u201cWe try not to be very judgy once they have the money,\u201d said Sam. \u201cBut maybe we won\u2019t be reupping them.\u201d (3,060)</p><p>They were moving fast, as Sam always did. \u201cIf you throw away a quarter of the money, that\u2019s very sad,\u201d he said at one point, \u201cbut if it allows you to triple the effectiveness of the rest, that\u2019s a win.\u201d (3,073)</p></blockquote><p>This was a really good idea, in the world in which FTX had properly secured the money in order to give it away, and in which they had the proper infrastructure to do this responsibly. Even without either of those things, it was still a reasonable idea.</p><p>There were problems. People were unprepared to hand out a million dollars. A lot of decisions involving a lot of money got made, if not Brewster\u2019s Millions style, in ways that were quite warping on the places the money got spread around. From what I heard, essentially any 19-year-old could get a $50,000 grant to move to Berkeley and think about AI safety, and there was a general failure to differentiate good and real and worthwhile efforts from others. The dynamics this created were an invitation to fake work, to predators and entryism and sociopaths, to hype and networks and corruption. If things had continued, that effect could have gotten worse.</p><p>As always, Sam was not considering second-order effects, and also not considering that efforts might backfire rather than be wasted. Nor did he pay enough attention to one of the most important questions traders always must ask on every trade they do, which is: What is the correct sizing?</p><p>Doing this trade with only a select few would have been great. Doing it with everyone who had an EA identity and a pulse was plausibly net negative.</p><p>Won\u2019t Get Fooled Again</p><p>In the wake of publication, many people pointed out that Michael Lewis had been fooled, <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/10/how-michael-lewis-got-duped-by-sam-bankman-fried.html\">including this book report from David Roth</a>. <a href=\"https://time.com/6321668/michael-lewis-sam-bankman-fried-going-infinite/\">Michael Lewis did not take kindly to this</a>, while confirming he had been fooled.</p><blockquote><p>Michael Lewis: I\u2019d love for the jury to read the book. Mark Cohen [Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s lawyer] said this to me: \u201cYou get up, you tell one story, and they tell the other story, and the question is which story the jury believes.\u201d I\u2019m in a privileged position to tell a fuller story, without leaving out any of the nasty details. If I were a juror, I would rather hear my story than either defense or prosecution.</p><p>I'm just going to tell you the story as I see it, and then leave you the discretion that then you lynch him, acquit him, or don't know what to think of him. I don't want the jury thinking I left anything else they needed to know.</p><p>There's something about Sam and the situation that pushes a lot of people's buttons and causes them to want to judge quickly. If I had five hours with the prosecutors, one of the things I would love to know is why they moved so fast. Sam\u2019s lawyers had a guy on the inside and outside advising on when he might be extradited from the Bahamas. And no way did they think it was gonna happen as fast as it did, because they thought it would take the government much longer to figure out what the hell happened.&nbsp;</p><p>I thought that was of a piece with the general social response: how quick people wanted to judge. So I thought, I'm going to be dealing with a reader who is going to be in that judgy kind of mood.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>He really thinks he included all the nasty details. The trial has made it clear this was not the case. <a href=\"https://thezvi.substack.com/p/sadly-ftx\">Even my old post on FTX</a>, among many other source options, also made it clear this was not the case.</p><p>As does the book. The book, despite conspicuously leaving out all the most blatant details, repeatedly shows SBF doing fraud.</p><p>Even more than that, the book describes a person who is so obviously doing all the fraud. It would not make any sense for the Sam portrayed here to not be doing all the fraud. That much is clear by the end of chapter one. Did Lewis read his own book?</p><p>The idea that the arrest was a \u2018rush to judgment\u2019 is laughable. Sure, they partly moved quickly because it was important to send a message - which it was - but also because no one else has ever more obviously been doing all the crime. There are so many distinct frauds right out in the open.</p><p>Also, seriously, what the hell, you want to poison the jury pool or even the actual jury? The interviewer points out how our system works, and Lewis says no, it shouldn\u2019t work that way, people should read my book.</p><p>At one point, Lewis confirms that FTX violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as was revealed during the trial, and also perhaps as tellingly that it put a billion dollars into an account at an exchange that regularly freezes accounts frozen by the local police for no reason.</p><p>And Lewis is wondering how the money could be missing.</p><blockquote><p>Michael Lewis: This is what happened, to my knowledge\u2014and I know this from the people in Hong Kong who orchestrated it\u2014a Chinese exchange was routinely targeted by local Chinese police departments. They would find a pretext for freezing an account. In this case, they froze Alameda\u2019s account. And Alameda had like a billion dollars in this account.&nbsp;</p><p>There was an operation inside of FTX, or Alameda, whatever, in Hong Kong, to legitimately get the money back without having to go pay the ransom. And they pursued that, and it didn't work. So they went in and paid ransom to the Chinese police department directly to get the money released, and it was released.&nbsp;</p><p>I actually would have loved to include it. But they weren\u2019t running around bribing people to change laws. It was more telling about how the Chinese government works than anything about Sam. I then came back and confirmed it all with Sam. He said he knew he'd sent someone in to get the money out, but he wasn't completely sure how he'd gotten the money out.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Next he admits that SBF committed bank fraud.</p><blockquote><p>Michael Lewis: My impression was that the bank wasn't actually misled about who these people were. That it was a kind of fig leaf thing.</p><p>Q: But it\u2019s still illegal to mislead a bank about the purpose of a bank account.</p><p>Michael Lewis: But nobody would have cared about it.</p></blockquote><p>He seems to not understand that this does not make it not a federal crime? That \u2018we probably would not have otherwise gotten caught on this one\u2019 is not a valid answer?</p><p>Similarly, Lewis clearly thinks \u2018the money was still there and eventually people got paid back\u2019 should be some sort of defense for fraud. It isn\u2019t, and it shouldn\u2019t be.</p><p>And then there\u2019s this:</p><blockquote><p>Michael Lewis: No one shows me receipts. But no one suggested otherwise. I interviewed 10 people in Alameda. They just weren't lying. None of them could think of a big loss.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>But I was kind of there through it. And there was no detectable change in Caroline, Nishad, Sam: their interactions or their demeanors. If they had this sharp, swift loss, they were really, really good with their poker faces.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>All right, that is a purer Naive Guy statement. They just weren\u2019t lying, no sir.</p><p>Nor was Sam a liar, in Lewis\u2019s eyes. Michael Lewis continued to claim, on the Judging Sam podcast, that he could trust Sam completely. That Sam would never lie to him. True, Lewis said, Sam would not volunteer information and he would use exact words. But Sam\u2019s exact words to Lewis, unlike the words he saw Sam constantly spewing to everyone else, could be trusted.</p><p>It\u2019s so weird. How can the same person write a book, and yet not have read it?</p><p>Even then, on October 1, Lewis was claiming he did not know if Sam was guilty. Not only that, he was claiming that many of the prosecutors did not know if Sam was guilty. And Lewis keeps saying that Sam himself really actually believes he is innocent, and for weeks after it was so over Sam really believed he\u2019d be able to raise funds and turn it all around.</p><p>Lewis really did believe, or claimed to believe on his podcast, even in early October that, absent one little mistake where $8 billion dollars ended up in the wrong place, the rest of what happened was fine. That the rest of the story was not filled to the brim with all the crime.</p><p>Yet I totally believe that Lewis believed all of it. The man seems so totally sincere.</p><p>Then on October 9 Lewis said nothing that came out so far at the trial surprised him, other than the claim by one of Sam\u2019s oldest friends that Alameda\u2019s special code not only let them steal all the money, it also let them trade faster than their competitors, implemented on Sam\u2019s orders. Everyone was constantly asking point blank about that, and Sam constantly said that wasn\u2019t true. Even so, Lewis still repeated that in his model Sam doesn\u2019t outright lie, he simply doesn\u2019t tell you the answer that you needed to hear. He was still holding onto that even then.</p><p>When it is revealed that the FTX insurance fund to cover trading losses, that Sam often talks about, was purely fake, literally the product of a random number generator written into the code to display to people to make them think there was an insurance fund? Because to Sam money is fungible, so why would there be an insurance fund? Still no change.</p><p>I still can\u2019t process all that. Not really. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV6NoNkDGsU&amp;t=132s&amp;pp=ygURY2hld2JhY2NhIGRlZmVuc2U%3D\">Chewbaca is a wookie</a>. It does not make sense.</p><p>He has Matt Levine on the podcast, and Matt Levine points out that the book made it that much clearer that Sam\u2019s fraud unfolded exactly the way frauds always unfold, that there was nothing confusing here. Yeah, on some level Sam fooled himself that would all work out (or, given it was Sam, that it had odds, and the words \u2018safe\u2019 and \u2018risk\u2019 were meaningless, so who cares?).</p><p>In later podcasts, Lewis did admit that a lot of the trial testimony was rather damning, and that he is confident that Sam will be convicted. But there is no sign he has figured out that Sam was doing all the lying and all the crime.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>I mostly feel good closing the book on the events of SBF, Alameda and FTX. It all makes sense. We know what happened.</p><p>There are still a few mysteries, mostly centered on early Alameda. The story there, as outlined, continues not to make sense.

SBF was fortunate to get as far as he did before it all blew up. A blow up was the almost inevitable result.

However, the term \u201cmoral circle\u201d is very ambiguous. Different definitions yield different conceptions of moral circle expansion, some of which could be much higher priority than others. In this post I discuss different ways we can define a moral circle, and offer some thoughts on which are most relevant to those interested in improving the long-term future of sentient life.<br><br>Overall, I\u2019d actually rather use the term \u201cmoral circle\u201d less, and instead focus on finer-grained consequences of work to benefit groups like nonhuman animals or artificial sentience. So why did I write this? A few reasons:</p><ul><li>Comparing definitions of the moral circle necessitates asking important strategic questions about what our advocacy should prioritise that I want to discuss. (This is my primary interest in the post.)</li><li>If people are going to keep talking about \u201cmoral circles\u201d, I\u2019d like us to be able to communicate more clearly about what we have in mind by that term.</li><li>I hope seeing the ambiguity of the current approach will help create space for alternative models of what we aim to accomplish in advocacy for nonhumans\u2014stay tuned for one of those from me in the near future.</li></ul><p>The style of this doc is less \u201cpropose resolutions to some well-defined questions about moral circles\u201d and more \u201cexplore a number of important issues using disambiguating moral circles as a unifying frame/motivation\u201d.</p><p>Feel free to jump around to parts that interest you most.

At first narrowly embracing one\u2019s relatives or tribe, a typical moral circle now includes larger ethnic groups, nation-states, or for some people all of humanity or all of sentient life.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefli2n47ieunk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnli2n47ieunk\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The intuition behind the expanding circle metaphor is that (i) it is easier to care about those who are similar or close to you than others who are dissimilar or distant, but (ii) moral progress necessitates making the effort to care for even those in your periphery.</p><p>While the idea of a steadily expanding growing moral circle is uplifting, the truth is more complicated. Here are a few problems with the \u201cmoral circle\u201d metaphor:</p><ul><li><strong>Our moral concern for some groups may have diminished over time</strong>. Gwern\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/The-Narrowing-Circle\"><i><u>The Narrowing Circle</u></i></a> lists some examples; of particular note is a lessened concern for past people (especially our ancestors) in many regions relative to historic norms.</li><li><strong>Along what axis is our moral circle expanding/contracting?&nbsp;</strong>There is no obvious distance metric by which to collapse arbitrary classes of beings onto a single metric of moral proximity or remoteness. Michael Aird\u2019s post&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M2gBGYWEQDnrPt6nb/moral-circles-degrees-dimensions-visuals\"><i><u>Moral circles: Degrees, dimensions, visuals</u></i></a> discusses more specific conceptions of distance along which we may be able to observe moral circles expand or contract.</li><li><strong>Increasing moral consideration for one group might not have much of an effect on moral consideration for other groups.&nbsp;(h/t Megan Kinnemet)&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Moral circle expansion is not inevitable.&nbsp;</strong>The picture of an expanding moral circle has also been criticised for creating an illusion of inevitability, when in reality many groups deserving of moral consideration may be denied it for reasons of historic accident.</li></ul><p>These all point to important flawed assumptions in standard framings of the moral circle, and may merit retiring the term \u201cmoral circle\u201d altogether to prevent confusion. In the rest of the piece though, I\u2019ll continue to use \u201cmoral circle\u201d as the label for the concept I\u2019m interested in defining, and simply ask that readers view as contingent rather than definitional any properties of the moral circle mentioned above which originally may have motivated its invention but are now in dispute.</p><p>The issues I am concerned with below are more foundational than&nbsp;<i>whether&nbsp;</i>or<i> how</i> the moral circle is expanding. Rather, I want to ask:</p><ul><li><i><strong>Whose</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>moral circle</strong></i><strong> is expanding or contracting</strong>? Is it that of an individual or that of a society? If we plan to discuss the moral circle of a society, how can we relate that society\u2019s moral circle to those of the individuals within it?</li><li><i><strong>What sort of beings</strong></i><strong> lie in the potential domain of the moral circle?</strong></li><li><i><strong>What properties&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>determine moral circle inclusion</strong>? Attitudes or behaviours? Do moral gaps or partiality matter?</li></ul><p>I have in mind two main goals for a preferred definition of a moral circle, in addition to wanting it to accord well with current usage.</p><ul><li><strong>Point out ways for us to intervene in the world.</strong> Interventions that cause a neglected class of beings to be more included in people\u2019s moral circles should at least be&nbsp;<i>prima facie&nbsp;</i>worthy of our consideration as priorities. Nevertheless, such interventions may have counterproductive backfire effects that make them neutral or net-negative in expectation.</li><li><strong>Be a good metric of progress towards a better future. The greater the extent to which an entity is included in a people\u2019s moral circles, the more we should generally expect their interests to be respected in the future\u2014though the same caveat about unintended negative consequences applies.</strong></li></ul><p>I think the first goal (making promising intervention points apparent) is somewhat more important than the second.</p><h1>What determines moral circle inclusion?</h1><p>This section will talk about the moral circle of an individual for simplicity, but all of these considerations apply to societal moral circles as well.</p><h2>Choice 1: Attitudes or behaviours?</h2><p>Two questions which could be of interest in demarcating a moral circle are: (i) what&nbsp;<i>beliefs</i> does a person hold about whether certain individuals matter morally, and (ii) does a person demonstrate concern for certain individuals through their&nbsp;<i>actions</i>?</p><p>Compare these two situations.</p><blockquote><p><strong>John</strong> does not think animals\u2019 interests matter, but he is vegan because he thinks accepting cruelty towards animals encourages cruelty towards other humans. He also encourages others to follow his example.<br><br><strong>Mary</strong> thinks animals\u2019 interests matter, but she does not reduce her animal product consumption or take other actions which could benefit animals because she views these as too effortful for her, or thinks they are a low priority relative to other altruistic actions.</p></blockquote><p>In an entirely&nbsp;<i><strong>attitudinal</strong></i> conception of the moral circle, only Mary\u2019s moral circle would include animals, because she but not John believes that animals\u2019 interests are important. In an entirely&nbsp;<i><strong>behavioural</strong></i> conception of the moral circle, only John\u2019s moral circle would include animals, because he but not Mary takes actions that benefit animals.</p><p>The moral expansiveness scale (MES) popularised by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brockbastian.com/s/moral-expansiveness.pdf\"><u>Crimson et al. 2016</u></a> is mostly attitudinal in the above sense, but not entirely so. The description of a particular level of moral concern for an entity conflates (i) the \u201clevel of moral concern and standing\u201d an entity \u201cdeserves\u201d, (ii) a respondent\u2019s \u201cmoral obligation to ensure their welfare\u201d, and (iii) a respondent\u2019s felt \u201csense of personal responsibility for their treatment\u201d.&nbsp;<br><br>(iii) is the criterion which is the most focused on behaviours: it seems difficult for someone to feel personally responsible for an entity\u2019s wellbeing without trying to take actions to benefit them.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wD4jXEQFFkk9xgoo3/xml6rg9ipl0q226wwnog\"><figcaption>Figure from <a href=\"https://www.brockbastian.com/s/moral-expansiveness.pdf\"><u>Crimston et al. 2016</u></a></figcaption></figure><p><br>Consider also the following case:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Susan thinks that animals\u2019 interests matter, but she believes existence is always preferable to nonexistence. Therefore, by the logic of the larder argument she is supportive of factory farming.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I think Susan is very mistaken about what is in animals\u2019 interests, but does that mean that animals are absent from her moral circle? Not according to the MES or other uses of the term, as far as I can tell. When we discuss someone\u2019s moral circle, whether behavioural or attitudinal, we are interested only in the extent of their concern for the moral patient, rather than whether that concern is directed in a fruitful way.&nbsp;</p><p>Moral circle expansion that conveys a deeply flawed picture of moral patients\u2019 interests is probably harmful in the near-term, but might still be helpful in the long-term so long as flawed beliefs or values of this sort would not be expected to persist for an extremely long time.&nbsp;</p><p>In particular, we might think that current mistaken beliefs about others\u2019 interests are harmless because future decision-makers will have access to more empirical knowledge relevant to helping moral patients effectively. This could include questions like how best to advocate on a being\u2019s behalf, what causes various beings to suffer and how intensely, and which sort of beings are sentient\u2014but it is also possible these questions crucially depend on non-empirical beliefs and values.</p><p>Whether non-empirical beliefs about moral patients\u2019 interests would also trend towards \u201ctruth\u201d seems like a fraught and uncertain matter. In the absence of a value lock-in, I tend to think that people\u2019s moral views will track beings\u2019 actual interests better (so long as they are motivated to understand these interests to begin with). I wouldn\u2019t count on this effect, however, and value lock-ins (especially those brought about by a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/singleton\"><u>singleton</u></a> AI) seem quite plausible to me.</p><h3><strong>Analysis</strong></h3><p>Attitudes about potential moral patients only matter because influential actors who hold those attitudes may act in ways which benefit or harm those patients. Call such actors&nbsp;<i>decision-makers</i>. The attitudes or behaviour of non-decision-makers in the far future are only indirectly relevant.</p><p>If a future society consists of humans and is either democratic or allows its inhabitants to make relevant personal choices\u2014for example, whether to incentivise a market to bring into existence non-human animals as food products\u2014the decision-makers of the long-term future might be ordinary people. Otherwise, they might be elites, or agentic AIs.</p><p>Below I will argue:</p><ol><li>Of the variables we can affect with moral circle expansion work, the&nbsp;<strong>behaviour</strong> of future decision-makers has the most influence on the&nbsp;<strong>wellbeing</strong> of future moral patients.</li><li>Of the variables we can affect with moral circle expansion work, the&nbsp;<strong>attitudes</strong> of future decision-makers have the most influence on the&nbsp;<strong>behaviours</strong> of future decision-makers.</li><li>Between our current attitudes and behaviours towards moral patients, our&nbsp;current&nbsp;<strong>attitudes</strong> have more influence on the&nbsp;<strong>attitudes</strong> of future decision-makers.<ul><li>Therefore, in MCE work it is more important from an upside perspective for us to focus on people's&nbsp;current&nbsp;<strong>attitudes</strong> towards moral patients than their behaviour. Nevertheless, changing current behaviour can remain&nbsp;<i>instrumentally</i> valuable in order to change current attitudes.</li></ul></li><li>However, there is more&nbsp;<strong>backfire risk</strong> from influencing attitudes than influencing behaviour.</li></ol><p>It's a little confusing to read this in list form, so feel free to skip down to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wD4jXEQFFkk9xgoo3/the-hidden-complexities-of-moral-circles#Flowcharts\"><u>flowcharts</u></a> for a graphical overview.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm also not very confident in any of these points! I'll try to point out along the way where the argument is particularly sensitive to various assumptions one might disagree with. If you just want to read about different ways the moral circle can be defined without getting bogged down in macrostrategy, you can skip to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wD4jXEQFFkk9xgoo3/the-hidden-complexities-of-moral-circles#Choice_2__Impartial_concern_or_partial_concern_\"><u>Choice 2</u></a>.</p><p><i><strong>1. The behaviour of future decision-makers most influences future wellbeing</strong></i></p><p>In longtermist moral circle expansion work, our ultimate goal is to improve the wellbeing of far-future moral patients. If the far future contains decision-makers who can reliably influence the treatment of moral patients on a broad scale, then the best way to further this goal is probably indirectly, by influencing the behaviour of those decision-makers.&nbsp;</p><p>There are at least three exceptions to the idea that the attitudes and behaviour of present actors essentially only matter indirectly to longtermist MCE, though in all likelihood there are other concerns I'm neglecting.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Existential risk</strong> (x-risk) means the existence of future decision-makers and future moral patients may depend on our current actions.</li><li>There may be certain&nbsp;<strong>long-lasting interventions</strong> we can enact now that can persist in a future with no decision-makers or with decision-makers of limited capacity.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wildanimalinitiative.org/blog/persistenceandreversibility\"><u>Liedholm 2019</u></a> discusses some of these, such as directed gene drives, in the context of terrestrial wild animal welfare. Another which seems promising to me is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/will-space-colonization-multiply-wild-animal-suffering/\"><u>preventing directed or accidental panspermia</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MKmowJNCeJCaitK3x/wild-animal-welfare-in-the-far-future#How_can_we_influence_wildlife_spreading_scenarios__\"><u>\u0160im\u010dikas 2022</u></a> lists some interventions that might accomplish this.</li><li>Efforts to affect future decision-makers may be&nbsp;<strong>intractable</strong>, or be expected to have&nbsp;<strong>negative effects</strong> by default due to backfire risk.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><strong>Existential risk</strong> is mostly beyond the scope of this post. It is very possible that the continuation of earth-originating life is a huge input to the future wellbeing of groups like nonhuman animals (whether for good or ill)\u2014but influencing either attitudes or behaviours towards nonhuman animals is unlikely to affect existential risk much.&nbsp;</p><p>Say we are convinced that x-risk reduction is extremely positive for groups like nonhuman animals, to the extent any nonnegligible reduction in x-risk dominates the effects of improving the wellbeing of nonhumans in surviving futures. Then we should deprioritise MCE work targeted at nonhumans in favour of x-risk reduction.&nbsp;</p><p>One form of MCE work may still be very important even if x-risk reduction dominates our future impact: expanding the moral circle to encompass future generations. In this case, we would most want to influence the behaviours of&nbsp;<i>present</i> decision-makers (not future ones), to the extent that we think we are in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/hinge-of-history\"><u>particularly precarious</u></a> moment in time. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Long-lasting interventions</strong> could also be very important, especially the chances of a human-controlled future look bleak. However, in a future controlled by an unaligned AI, \u201clong-lasting interventions\u201d seem fairly likely to be reversed or rendered irrelevant.&nbsp;</p><p>I don\u2019t find&nbsp;<strong>intractability</strong> concerns very persuasive: some precedents like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/british-antislavery\"><u>antislavery movement</u></a> certainly indicate it is possible to influence attitudes or behaviours in a broad and lasting way, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/value-lock-in\"><u>lock-in</u></a> means that values might stabilise after a critical moment instead of continuing to change unpredictably over time.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9tx7m9lejej\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9tx7m9lejej\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I\u2019m more sympathetic to the argument that we should tend to avoid interventions directed at having a large future impact, because in many domains it is easier to have a&nbsp;<strong>negative effect</strong> than a positive one. I\u2019m not sufficiently convinced that I believe we should abandon efforts to improve future behaviour towards groups like nonhuman animals, but I do think we should strongly prefer strategies to accomplish this that seem more robust to the various backfire risks that have been identified so far.&nbsp;</p><p>With the above caveats in mind, I'll proceed as though what we aim to influence is the behaviour of future decision-makers, and next ask what most influences that behaviour.</p><p><i><strong>2. The behaviour of future decision-makers is most influenced by their attitudes</strong></i></p><p>An agent\u2019s behaviour can be understood as a function of their attitudes (both endorsed and unendorsed), their knowledge, and constraints imposed by their environment. Of these, I think attitudes are most influential to the behaviour of future decision-makers, because future decision-makers seem likely to have better knowledge and more control over their environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Why might future decision-makers have better knowledge and more control over their environment?</p><ul><li><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Scientific progress might slow (or have already slowed) along various dimensions, but it seems unlikely that it would reach a ceiling any time soon, barring collapse scenarios. If this is right, discovering empirical facts earlier is only helpful insofar as it helps us achieve attitudinal or behavioural changes that have lasting consequences.&nbsp;<br><br>There&nbsp;<i>are</i> some situations where dissemination of accurate knowledge to decision-makers could be quite difficult, such as futures which are highly fragmented or which have tightly controlled information ecosystems.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2t4q0ctblou\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2t4q0ctblou\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I think&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/risks-of-stable-totalitarianism/\"><u>stable totalitarian states</u></a> are the most plausible future context in which impaired knowledge is very influential to harming moral patients.</li><li><strong>Environmental constraints</strong>: These could vary in quite unpredictable ways. In general, I would expect that if existential risks do not come to pass, decision-makers will have more freedom to shape the world in accordance with their values in the long-term future. Nevertheless, manipulating the environment in ways that make people less disposed to harm sentient beings (e.g. by developing more realistic animal product alternatives) could be important when any changes induced are long-lasting and not inevitable.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><i><strong>3. The attitudes of future decision-makers are most influenced by present attitudes</strong></i></p><p>If I'm correct that the attitudes of future decision-makers are the largest input to their actions, then the next question to ask is which of our current attitudes and behaviour most influence those of future decision-makers.</p><p>Arguments for a greater influence of current&nbsp;<i><strong>attitudinal interventions</strong></i> on future attitudes:</p><ul><li>If we build an AI aligned to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/cev/\"><u>extrapolated volition</u></a>, the values of this AI will probably depend more on our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5bd75cc58225bf06703751db/learning-meta-preferences\"><u>second-order preferences</u></a> about our behaviour than our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revealed_preference\"><u>revealed preferences</u></a>.</li><li>Some types of lock-in not driven by AI (such as a political&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/singleton.html\"><u>singleton</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XXLf6FmWujkxna3E6/are-we-living-at-the-most-influential-time-in-history-1#:~:text=the%20motivations%20and%20values%20of%20the%20subsequent%20generation%20(-,such%20as%20through%20AI%2C%20but%20also%20perhaps%20through%20other%20technology%2C%20such%20as%20genetic%20engineering%20or%20advanced%20brainwashing%20technology,-)%2C%20and%20that%20we%E2%80%99re%20close%20to%20that%20point.%20(H\"><u>advanced brainwashing</u></a>) also seem more likely to fix attitudes than behaviours.</li></ul><p>Arguments for a greater influence of current&nbsp;<i><strong>behavioural interventions</strong></i> on future attitudes:</p><ul><li>People sometimes change their attitudes to better accord with their behaviour, in order to reduce cognitive dissonance.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp67k2s5c5ze\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp67k2s5c5ze\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Depending on the strength of this effect, most of those whose attitudes we directly influence may later revert to those beliefs which best accord with their habits.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefatyx31n8eks\"><sup><a href=\"#fnatyx31n8eks\">[8]</a></sup></span></li><li>If environmental constraints are very important to future attitudes, then it may be more useful to influence current behaviours than current attitudes.

Backfire risk</strong></i></p><p><i>Backfire risk&nbsp;</i>in this context refers to ways efforts to increase concern for an entity could paradoxically create worse conditions for that entity, or could be otherwise harmful to our ability to improve the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Some types of backfire risk seems most likely to result from influencing&nbsp;<i>behaviours</i>. This is often because prominent behaviours towards moral patients are generally more noticeable, and more threatening to those who might be impacted by them, than attitudes.</p><p><i>Examples of backfire that seem riskier if we influence&nbsp;<strong>behaviours</strong>:</i></p><ul><li>Animal advocacy tends to be more popular in left-wing political groups than right-wing ones. If left-wing groups increase their level of concern for animals over time, ideologies that define themselves in large part by their opposition to left-wing groups may come to view unconcern for animals as an important expression of their values.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Why this seems worse if we influence behaviours:&nbsp;</i>Concretely, I weakly believe Republicans would be more likely to increase their meat consumption or engage more in other forms of animal exploitation if most Democrats were actually vegan (including for environmental reasons) in a way that was highly visible than they would if most Democrats said they care about animal welfare without this influencing individual behaviours.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>If the public considers caring about insect welfare absurd, then close association with advocacy for insects may damage the reputations of movements like effective altruism or animal advocacy. (Though to be clear, I don\u2019t think this effect is strong enough to make EA insect welfare work counterproductive.)<br><br><i>Why this seems worse if we influence behaviours:&nbsp;</i>Reputation damage seems more likely if effective altruists invested huge amounts of resources into insect welfare (and this was widely reported on) than if we only endorse this as a concern without acting on it.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In both these examples, it\u2019s important to my intuitions that the behaviours in question (<i>helping insects</i> or&nbsp;<i>becoming vegan</i>) are visible to those who have an adverse reaction to them. When influenced behaviours helpful to moral patients are enacted in a less visible way, their downside is more limited.</p><p>Other types of backfire risk seem most likely to come about as a result of influencing&nbsp;<i>attitudes</i>.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Examples of backfire that seem riskier if we influence&nbsp;<strong>attitudes</strong></i>:</p><ul><li>If the public becomes more concerned about the interests of animals, but thinks the \"<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/logic-of-the-larder\"><u>logic of the larder\" argument</u></a> is correct, more animals on factory farms could be factory farmed than would be otherwise. This is possible even if animal advocates are convinced that the logic of the larder argument fails\u2014we might succeed in getting others to care more about animals, without improving their beliefs about how to best express that care.</li><li>Similarly, work in wild animal welfare that is too conciliatory might have the net effect of getting people to care more about wild animals, without changing their beliefs about what is in a wild animal's interest. For example, someone might think it is always in the interest of a wild animal to live in an environment that is maximally free from human interference. Such combinations of mistaken attitudes with increased concern could result in worse outcomes for wild animals.&nbsp; (I think current work on wild animal welfare generally does not fall into this trap, but we should continue to be careful of it.)</li><li>Some alignment failures might result in an AI with inverted values from those developers tried to instil. These scenarios include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WMhiJf3xx9ZopC2tP/likelihood-of-hyperexistential-catastrophe-from-a-bug\"><u>sign-flip errors</u></a> and possibly the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D7PumeYTDPfBTp3i7/the-waluigi-effect-mega-post\"><u>Waluigi effect</u></a>.

Someone may think that in an impartial sense the welfare of nonhuman animals is important, for example, but never consider the wellbeing of animals in any of their decisions\u2014because they always prioritise their own interests (or those of humans in general) over animals.&nbsp;<br><br>It is important to distinguish here three related phenomena that give rise to theoretically valuing moral patients in a way that is not behaviour-guiding:</p><ul><li><strong>Moral gaps:&nbsp;</strong>Someone may think they&nbsp;<i>should</i> consider the interests of moral patients more in their decision-making, but fail to live up to their theoretical moral standards.</li><li><strong>Impartial competition of interests:&nbsp;</strong>Someone may think that the interests of moral patients have some importance, but those interests are (perhaps even&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.simonknutsson.com/value-lexicality\"><u>lexically</u></a>) outweighed by competing interests or values.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Partial competition of interests:&nbsp;Someone may think that the interests of moral patients are important, but they have partial duties to themselves or others which should take precedence.</strong></li></ul><p>In futures with less scarcity and fewer other environmental constraints,&nbsp;<i>competition of interests</i> and&nbsp;<i>moral gaps</i> would likely be less determinative of the wellbeing of moral patients.</p><p>For example, if inexpensive cultured meat indistinguishable from animal products becomes widely available, fewer people's interests will conflict with those of animals when it comes to choosing whether to eat meat. (Nevertheless, some decision-makers may have negative attitudes towards cultured meat, or otherwise prefer to source their food from beings who were once sentient.)</p><p>If we use a&nbsp;<i>behavioural</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>conception of the moral circle, we can look at individuals' behaviour towards moral patients in cases of moral gaps, impartial competition of interests, partial competition of interests, or a combination of these, in order to determine to what extent the behaviour comports with the interests of moral patients.</p><p>If we use an&nbsp;<i>attitudinal</i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>conception of the moral circle, then moral gaps become irrelevant. Still, we can distinguish between an&nbsp;<i>impartial</i> or&nbsp;<i>partial</i> attitudinal conception of the moral circle.</p><ul><li>A&nbsp;<i><strong>partial</strong></i> moral circle would be sensitive to how often an attitude holder thinks they should act in the interests of a moral patient when their partial duties conflict with the interests of the patient (i.e. cases of partial competition of interests). But it wouldn't be sensitive to how often they actually act in the interests of a moral patient in such cases.</li><li>An&nbsp;<i><strong>impartial</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>moral circle would not be sensitive to cases of partial competition of interests, but would be sensitive to cases of impartial competition of interests.</li></ul><p>My speculation above suggests that an&nbsp;<strong>impartial moral circle</strong> may be more useful for longtermists to think about, since&nbsp;<i>impartial competition of interests</i> could be the most influential type of attitude in how future moral patients are treated.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Should we weigh interests differently?</strong></p><p>In the elaboration of&nbsp;<i>impartial competition of interests&nbsp;</i>above, what does it mean for an interest to be outweighed? For example, some moral patients probably differ in their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/how-to-measure-capacity-for-welfare-and-moral-status\"><u>moral status</u></a> because they&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/research-summary-the-intensity-of-valenced-experience-across-species\"><u>have different intensities of subjective experience</u></a>. So it's probably sometimes correct to sometimes ascribe more weight to one animal's interest to avoid a particular painful stimulus than that of a member of a different species, depending on how we construe the meaning of \u201cinterest\u201d.</p><p>Personally, I think talking about a \"moral weight\" which magnifies or diminishes an interest is overly confusing. Instead we can say that individuals of one species tend to have a&nbsp;<i>greater interest</i> in avoiding this stimulus than those of another. As long as the factors that cause one species more suffering in a given situation than another are packaged into our assessment of interests\u2019 magnitude, those intensity-adjusted interests ought to be weighted equally.</p><p>This model allows us to distinguish between speciesist and non-speciesist versions of&nbsp;<i>impartial competition of interests</i>: in the speciesist version, an unjustified weight is applied to interests whose sizes have already been properly estimated. In the non-speciesist version, the typical size of an individual's interests may be largely determined by their species membership, but any variation in their importance must be justified by the nature of the interest itself.</p><p>In an impartial conception of the moral circle, the extent to which a moral patient is included in an attitude-holder's moral circle seems to depend on the extent to which the attitude-holder (i) thinks equal interests should be treated equally, and (ii) accurately judges the importance of the moral patient's interests. However, both (i) and (ii) would be somewhat less important in low-scarcity futures, since there would be more opportunity to fulfil various interests that would have been difficult to satisfy simultaneously in high-scarcity environments.</p><p>So perhaps if we expect the future to be low-scarcity, we should worry less about how fairly attitude-holders weigh the interests of moral patients in cases of impartial competition of interests, and more about whether those interests are significantly represented at all.&nbsp;</p><h3>Choice 3: Binary inclusion or graded inclusion?</h3><p>As discussed above, the Moral Expansiveness Scale of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brockbastian.com/s/moral-expansiveness.pdf\"><u>Crimson et al. 2016</u></a> allows participants to classify entities they care about as belonging to the \u201cinner circle\u201d, \u201couter circle\u201d, or \u201cfringes\u201d of moral concern. When aggregated across individuals, this scale provides a&nbsp;<i>graded</i> measure of how much respondents tend to value a given entity.</p><p>In contrast, some discussions I\u2019ve been in seem to suppose expanding the moral circle to include a particular class of moral patients as a task which is either accomplished or failed.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1k4vea3m6dm\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1k4vea3m6dm\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This is possibly just an understandable laxity of language, but I think there can be some advantages to looking at moral circle inclusion as&nbsp;<i>binary</i> in this way.</p><ul><li>A&nbsp;<i><strong>binary</strong></i> moral circle would track whether a moral patient merits some minimum level of moral concern from an attitude-holder. This minimum level of concern could be set to be a high bar, or a low bar.</li><li>A&nbsp;<i><strong>graded</strong></i> moral circle would instead track&nbsp;<i>to what extent&nbsp;</i>a moral patient merits moral concern from an attitude-holder.</li></ul><p><strong>Analysis</strong></p><p><i>Competition of interests</i> (both partial and impartial) may be less of a concern in the future, if for example resources in future societies are very abundant, or if future technologies allow for interests that at first glance look opposed to be simultaneously accommodated. All we really need to ensure a group\u2019s wellbeing in such a future might be for their interests only to be considered to some minimal extent. In this scenario, we would want to have some idea of what basin of moral concern entities need to fall into in order for them to not be neglected in the long-term future, and set our bar for binary moral circle inclusion to be at or within the boundary of this basin.</p><p>Another way there could be a broad basin of moral concern leading to good outcomes for moral patients is if moral consideration for an entity tends to predictably increase once it reaches a minimal level of significance. I\u2019m sceptical that this holds, since we might face various forms of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/value-lock-in\"><u>value lock-in</u></a>, there may be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/The-Narrowing-Circle\"><u>historical precedent</u></a> for entities dropping out of the moral circle, and moral circle expansion has various&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ox8aDeXQtbAjDURR8FJlmD0o1bysg6Sm_obMLa2jJrA/edit#heading=h.cnahudbzh8qr\"><u>backfire risks</u></a>.</p><p>However, even supposing a broad basin of attraction towards good outcomes, pursuing a binary approach carries a risk that we will choose an uninformative minimum level of concern to pay attention to. Doing so could cause us to be either too optimistic or too pessimistic about the progress of moral circle expansion work.&nbsp;</p><p>Mostly for this reason, I think a graded conception of moral circles is generally more useful.</p><h2>Who is a potential member of the moral circle?</h2><p>What sort of entities are potential subjects of moral consideration? One possible answer is any entities that might be sentient.</p><p>I think the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiocentrism\"><u>sentientist</u></a> conclusion that only sentient beings are proper subjects of moral consideration is correct;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjbqfblrmvse\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjbqfblrmvse\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;but many people exclude from moral consideration some beings (like nonhuman animals) they think are sentient, and include in moral consideration some entities (like nature) which they don\u2019t think are sentient. If we only view people\u2019s moral circles as subsets of potential sentient beings, we might miss out on important aspects of their moral valuations.</p><p>Additionally, we might still be very mistaken about the sort of entities capable of sentience. See, for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/24704177.pdf\"><i><u>If materialism is true, the United States is probably conscious</u></i></a><i>&nbsp;</i>by Eric Schwitzgabel, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/#which_beings_are_sentient\"><u>various articles</u></a> by Brian Tomasik.</p><p>Here are some (non-exhaustive) examples of entities that I think are sometimes given moral consideration despite being unlikely to be sentient:</p><ul><li>Physical entities<ul><li>Plants</li><li>Specific natural features of the environment<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgzld5yahg85\"><sup><a href=\"#fngzld5yahg85\">[12]</a></sup></span></li><li>Planets</li><li>Toys</li><li>Houses</li><li>Computers,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cetpuhRlJkc\"><u>printers</u></a>, other electronics</li></ul></li><li>Aggregates (beyond the interests of the beings within them)<ul><li>Nations</li><li>Cultural traditions</li><li>Species</li><li>Races/ethnicities</li><li>Ecosystems</li><li>Geographical places</li></ul></li><li>Fictional entities<ul><li>Specific deities (h/t&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/The-Narrowing-Circle#religion\"><u>Gwern</u></a>)</li><li>Fictional characters</li></ul></li><li>Abstract entities<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdu89nzm7lo\"><sup><a href=\"#fndu89nzm7lo\">[13]</a></sup></span><ul><li>Languages</li><li>Works of art or literature</li><li>Memes</li><li>Nature</li><li>The law</li><li>Morality (and particular components of morality like&nbsp;<i>justice</i>)</li><li>Truth</li></ul></li></ul><p>There are also a few categories of entities who are not&nbsp;<i>currently</i> sentient in our world and time, but who I think are likely to sometimes be moral patients:</p><ul><li>Entities who will exist in the future</li><li>Entities who existed in the past</li><li><i>Maybe:</i> entities who exist in counterfactual or counterlogical worlds (i.e.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7nAxgQYGYrEY5ZCAD/l-zombies-l-zombies\"><u>l-zombies</u></a>)</li></ul><p>It\u2019s probably best to keep the potential domain of the moral circle broad enough to encompass all the entities above\u2014though I don\u2019t expect it would be useful to ask about people\u2019s moral consideration for Harry Potter in any research the EA community conducts!&nbsp;</p><h2>Whose moral circle are we interested in?</h2><p>The sections above mostly supposed we were talking about the moral circle of an individual attitude-holder. However, it is often important to consider the moral circle of&nbsp;<i>groups</i> of various individuals. Should we consider the moral circle of a group to be a function of the moral circles of its members? If so, what sort of function should we use?</p><h3>Choice 4: Aggregative or non-aggregative?</h3><p>For an&nbsp;<i><strong>aggregative moral circle</strong></i> of a group G, the extent to which G includes a particular entity in its moral circle is determined solely by the extent to which&nbsp;<i>G\u2019s members</i> include that entity in their moral circles. (I think this is the most natural way to interpret the moral circle of a group, though it is&nbsp;<i>prima facie</i> unclear how the aggregation of G\u2019s members\u2019 views should be conducted.)</p><p>For a&nbsp;<i><strong>non-aggregative moral circle</strong></i> of a group G, the extent to which G includes a particular entity in its moral circle depends on factors other than the moral circles of G\u2019s members.</p><p>What factors might those be? Consider the example of concern for farmed animals within the United States. For an&nbsp;<i>attitudinal non-aggregative moral circle</i>, we might be interested in laws, policies, and media within that country which indicates a concern for animals\u2014even if these are mostly symbolic.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft0vh8bwyj1c\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt0vh8bwyj1c\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;For a&nbsp;<i>behavioural non-aggregative moral circle</i>, we might be interested in statistics about how many animals are farmed in the United States, or non-symbolic legislation which protects farmed animals.</p><p><strong>What would aggregation of individual moral circles look like?</strong></p><p>Given a&nbsp;<i>graded</i> conception of the moral circle, the average or median level of moral concern in a group could be derived from the scores on tests like the Moral Expansiveness Scale assigned to a sample of group members.</p><p>But we might also be interested in metrics which wouldn\u2019t be captured by an average/median of member scores. For example, there might be some threshold of passive support for a moral patient that when crossed would lead to rapid change throughout the rest of the society.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeklz4pfd68m\"><sup><a href=\"#fneklz4pfd68m\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In this model, even if we view individuals\u2019 moral circles as graded, it might be preferable to consider the inclusion of an entity within a group\u2019s moral circle as the proportion of individual moral circle inclusion scores that count as being passively supportive of the entity.</p><p>Another example: If dislike or hatred for a moral patient tends to have a greater negative impact for them than moral consideration for them has a positive impact, we might want a metric and a conception of the moral circle that reflects this. One appropriate approach to quantifying the moral consideration of a group has for a given moral patient under this model would be to:</p><ol><li>Use a graded scale to measure moral circle inclusion/exclusion in individuals, which ranges over some set of positive and negative numeric values like -3 to 3.</li><li>Scale up negative values by a multiplier greater than 1 to reflect that exclusionary attitudes affect moral patients more than inclusionary attitudes do. (Or depending on the details of&nbsp;<i>why</i> dislike of the patient is particularly concerning, perhaps by a non-constant function greater than 1.)</li><li>Average together the rescaled scores.</li></ol><p>A last possibility: maybe those who have the most extreme views as to the importance of moral patients will have a disproportionate influence on their wellbeing. We could account for this by applying a function to moral circle inclusion scores whose area mostly lies towards the left and right edges of the domain of scores.</p><p>In all these examples, we&nbsp;<i>could</i> just alter how we measure moral circle inclusion to account for these effects, rather than apply corrections after scoring during aggregation. However, if there is disagreement on which corrections are appropriate, or if an existing scoring method like MES is in common use, it makes sense to consider the two steps of measuring inclusion and correcting for expected impact separately.</p><p>What sort of aggregative metric is most helpful to us will depend on both our models of social change and on our models of how moral consideration results in long-term wellbeing of moral patients.</p><p><strong>Analysis</strong></p><p>I feel very unsure of what conception of group moral circles is most useful. I think when looking at the inclusion of an entity within a group\u2019s moral circle, we should continue to pay attention to many different factors\u2014including both those aggregative and those non-aggregative of group members\u2019 attitudes or behaviours.</p><h3>Choice 5: Weighted or non-weighted aggregation?</h3><p>The attitudes of some individuals have more potential to help or harm moral patients than others. For example, celebrities sometimes leverage their platforms to promote concern for nonhuman animals or other causes. Policymakers (including legislators or members of executive bodies like the USDA) have more ability to create regulatory change than others do. In the event of an AI takeover, developers or other individuals involved in the design or deployment of the AI might have had a unique opportunity to influence the system in a way that benefits or harms various moral patients.</p><p>If there is a very large and predictable difference in whose attitudes influence the long-term wellbeing of moral patients, then it could make sense to weight their attitudes as being more significant when aggregating attitudes to measure a group\u2019s moral circle.</p><p><strong>Analysis</strong></p><p>I do think the difference in how important individuals\u2019 attitudes are is large and (in expectation) predictable. Nevertheless, I expect it will usually be clearer to report the attitudes of influential subgroups separately rather than to conduct an aggregation which gives their attitudes more weight. For example, if a group surveys attitudes towards nonhuman animals in a given country, they could report the attitudes of software engineers or regulators there, in addition to the attitudes of the entire country.</p><p><strong>How might the values of AI developers and deployers be disproportionately important for future moral patients?</strong></p><p>I used this group above as an example of individuals whose attitudes might be particularly important, and think this possibility is worth discussing in more detail.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Low alignment-power scenarios</i></p><p>Suppose that we largely fail to align AI systems to human interests, and an unaligned AI takes over the world. Then the values of that AI would not be straightforwardly derived from the values of its developers or anyone else. Nevertheless, developer\u2019s values could sometimes motivate them to influence architecture decisions in ways that could benefit future moral patients.</p><p>A few examples:</p><ul><li><strong>Some alignment approaches may carry more risk of suffering sentient subroutines or simulations than others</strong>. One way to achieve interruptibility is to give an interrupted agent compensatory rewards corresponding to what it would have received if it had not been shut off (<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/Corrigibility.pdf\"><u>Soares 2015</u></a>). If these rewards are sometimes computed in sufficient detail that inhabitants of the simulated counterfactual are sentient, this could be pretty bad.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7mllo5kt0ws\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7mllo5kt0ws\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I don\u2019t think this example is itself a large cause for concern, since it depends a lot on the exact implementation of interruptibility, but I think it\u2019s good at illustrating how alignment or corrigibility proposals could differ in their propensity to be realised in ways that would lead to sentient simulations suffering in the subroutines of an AI.</li><li><strong>Some decision theories or bargaining policies could be more or less likely to result in catastrophic conflict between AI systems. </strong>Conflict between AI systems could result in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://s-risks.org/an-introduction-to-worst-case-ai-safety/\"><u>worst-case outcomes</u></a> (i.e.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/risks-of-astronomical-suffering-s-risks\"><u>s-risks</u></a>). People who care about nonhumans might be especially concerned about preventing these worst-case outcomes\u2014both because historical precedents of massive suffering like factory farms can make future s-risks seem more plausible, and because worst-case scenarios have the potential to contain more suffering if small, artificial minds can be sentient. So developers may be more likely to pay attention to such issues if they care about nonhumans. (Though I think preventing AI conflict is probably still a somewhat neglected priority from a human-centric perspective currently!)</li><li><strong>Some alignment failures could result in inverted values rather than random values.</strong> Suppose that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D7PumeYTDPfBTp3i7/the-waluigi-effect-mega-post\"><u>waluigi</u></a> of a language model chatbot escapes and executes a takeover. If developers were careful to include concern for nonhuman animals in the chatbot\u2019s prompt or during RLHF, the result could be an unaligned AI that is particularly hostile to animals due to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D7PumeYTDPfBTp3i7/the-waluigi-effect-mega-post\"><u>Waluigi effect</u></a>,&nbsp;<i>if</i> that effect does actually produce personas with inverted values as is sometimes claimed. This example demonstrates a&nbsp;<i>backfire risk</i> of moral circle expansion, in that increasing moral concern for patients among developers could result in lower welfare for those patients.</li></ul><p>When it comes to more foundational components of an AI (like what alignment approach people attempt), it seems unlikely developers will be able to predictably influence these, as they are probably already determined by industry-wide trends subject to competitive pressures or by scientific facts about what will work out at a certain level of AI capabilities. Still, it\u2019s unclear to me what counts as sufficiently \u201cfoundational\u201d to be overdetermined in this way, and plausibly some lower-level components of an AI could be reliably designed to be less conducive to future suffering if there are people in influential positions motivated to do this.</p><p><i>High alignment-power scenarios</i></p><p>Suppose the alignment problem is largely solved, such that an agentic AI can be aligned to human interests.</p><p>If developers are careful \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DJRe5obJd7kqCkvRr/don-t-leave-your-fingerprints-on-the-future\"><u>not to leave their fingerprints on the future</u></a>\u201d, their attitudes towards moral patients might not matter any more than any other person\u2019s attitudes. However, some developers or deployers might not follow this advice, and instead&nbsp;<strong>design an AI with similar values to themselves</strong>. In this event, their values could be locked-in indefinitely far into the future.</p><p>Moreover, there are some value-laden decisions that developers might not be able to avoid:</p><ul><li><strong>Should a&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/CEV.pdf\"><strong><u>coherent extrapolated volition</u></strong></a><strong> process take into account the volition of nonhuman animals?&nbsp;</strong>Saying \u201cjust in case the CEV of humans would imply this\u201d may well be the appropriate answer for strategic or pragmatic reasons. But endorsing this for non-strategic reasons would presuppose that animals\u2019 extrapolated preferences are not themselves of fundamental importance to how an AI should act.</li><li>Consider a sanity-checking scenario, where developers ask an AI questions about what the future will be like conditional on its deployment. (Relying too heavily on this process would be dangerous, even if related problems like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qHCDysDnvhteW7kRd/arc-s-first-technical-report-eliciting-latent-knowledge\"><u>ELK</u></a> have satisfying solutions, but it could be a helpful tool to avoid some mistakes.)&nbsp;<strong>Should sanity-checking include questions about future nonhuman animals and artificial sentience?</strong></li><li>Maybe instead of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yTy2Fp8Wm7m8rHHz5/superintelligence-15-oracles-genies-and-sovereigns\"><u>sovereign AI</u></a> being deployed, highly capable AI assistants (with some restrictions to prevent future x-risks and preclude interference with other humans) are widely distributed to everyone, creating a highly libertarian future for humans.&nbsp;<strong>Would those assistants have restrictions that prevent them from harming animals or artificial sentiences at the behest of their users?</strong></li></ul><p>The considerations from low alignment-power scenarios discussed above would also apply here as well.</p><h2>Should we be interested in preventing moral circle&nbsp;<i>exclusion</i> instead?</h2><p>Moral circle expansion is&nbsp;<i>prima facie</i> desirable because it enables other agents (present and future) to help moral patients in need of aid. However, we might expect there to be a discrepancy in how costly it is to&nbsp;<i>help</i> someone and how costly it is to&nbsp;<i>harm</i> them. Here are a few possible justifications for this:</p><ul><li><strong>It might be much easier to bring about a bad state of affairs for a moral patient than a good state of affairs</strong>. One abstract justification for this position is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina_principle\"><u>Anna Karenina principle</u></a>: an acceptable state of affairs for moral patients may be best modelled as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/conjunctive-vs-disjunctive-risk-models\"><u>conjunctive</u></a> goal, while an unacceptable state of affairs is best modelled as a disjunctive risk. On the object level, it seems as though intense suffering is more easily instantiated in sentient beings than intense happiness. See Magnus Vinding\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://magnusvinding.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/suffering-focused-ethics.pdf#page=30\"><i><u>Suffering-Focused Ethics&nbsp;</u></i><u>\u00a71.3</u></a> for more discussion.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Bad states of affairs might be much worse for moral patients than good or neutral states of affairs. </strong>See Magnus Vinding\u2019s&nbsp;<i>Suffering-Focused Ethics&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://magnusvinding.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/suffering-focused-ethics.pdf#page=23\"><u>\u00a71.2</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://magnusvinding.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/suffering-focused-ethics.pdf#page=34\"><u>\u00a71.4</u></a> for some discussion. Relatedly,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/research/a-typology-of-s-risks/#Agential_s-risks\"><u>agential s-risks</u></a> (where decision-makers intentionally seek to bring about astronomical suffering) seem much more concerning than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/research/a-typology-of-s-risks/#Incidental_s-risks\"><u>incidental s-risks</u></a> (where decision-makers bring about astronomical suffering in the course of pursuing some other goal). In some highly libertarian futures, humans who hate a group of moral patients may bring about an agential s-risk targeting them directly. But probably the dominant way humans who hate moral patients could cause them astronomical harm is by influencing the values of a sovereign AI.</li><li><strong>If we expect the future to go quite well for a group by default, there might be few opportunities to help them other than by preventing others from causing deliberate harm.</strong> For example, maybe innovative foods will entirely replace animal meat in the future, such that no farmed animals exist other than in a few sanctuaries. Suppose this occurs, and suppose further that existing in substantial numbers is not in nonhuman animals\u2019 interests. Then the only reason farmed animals&nbsp;<i>would</i> exist in substantial numbers in a human-controlled future is if someone chooses to bring about that state of affairs\u2014and&nbsp;<i>ex hypothesi</i> this decision-maker either has a mistaken view of what is in the interests of those animals, or their intentions are harmful.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>There are also arguments in the other direction; for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rationalaltruist.com/2013/02/27/why-will-they-be-happy/\"><u>Christiano (2013)</u></a> suggests that we should expect few influential agents in the future to be interested in harming others relative to those who want to help others, because people who influence the future in a strategic way will be disproportionately altruistic.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wD4jXEQFFkk9xgoo3/the-hidden-complexities-of-moral-circles#Choice_4__Aggregative_or_non_aggregative_\"><u>In the discussion of Choice 4 above</u></a> I touched on the idea of allowing quantitative measures of moral circle inclusion to range over negative values of concern. I\u2019m very confident that paying some attention to dislike or hatred for moral patients in moral circle expansion work is important; and it\u2019s also somewhat plausible to me that we should almost exclusively focus on reducing negative attitudes towards moral patients, even at the expense of promoting positive attitudes.</p><p>In an animal advocacy context, being more sensitive to negative attitudes towards nonhuman animals might translate into:</p><ul><li>Avoiding controversial tactics.</li><li>Being especially concerned about political, social, or economic polarisation of animal rights.A few preliminary thoughts on this point:</li><li>I\u2019d prefer that support for other politicised causes not determine whether someone is welcomed or treated with respect by the animal advocacy community, when this is possible and practical.</li><li>I\u2019d prefer that resources be invested in non-aggressive outreach to communities that are not well-represented in current animal advocacy work, including poorer communities, the global South, political conservatives, and communities of colour.</li><li>This consideration may sometimes be in tension with prioritising audiences who have more potential influence over an AI takeover.</li><li><i>Possibly</i>: prioritising advocacy for institutional reforms over lifestyle changes, which may be more off-putting to the public.</li></ul><p>I\u2019ll discuss the potential consequences of being more sensitive to moral circle exclusion in animal advocacy more in forthcoming work.</p><h1>Concluding remarks</h1><p>Thanks for reading!

This post focuses exclusively on our AI program. For more information on our general program or on our organization, please </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wx9GgKGWqksvMWjg2/successif-helping-mid-career-and-senior-professionals-have\">refer to our last post&nbsp;here</a>.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>High-level Summary</h2><p>For the past year and a half, we have been supporting professionals aiming to transition to high-impact roles. Today, we are announcing:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The publication of some of the findings from our ongoing AI market research.&nbsp;</li><li>An AI-specific program for those professionals who know they want to work on mitigating the catastrophic and existential risks of AI systems.</li><li>Training programs to help those currently working in AI safety and AI governance increase their impact, as well as those looking to transition into certain AI jobs.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>I. Context</h2><p>With recent developments in AI and growing political enthusiasm for certain aspects of AI safety, we decided to develop additional programs to support the fields of AI safety and AI governance.&nbsp;</p><p>Mitigating existential and catastrophic risks from AI in a short time will be facilitated by welcoming mid-career people into the field. Given shortened timelines for risk actualization, it is essential to tap into professionals who do not need years of study to be on-the-job ready. Mid-career professionals have unique skillsets. For instance, they can offer new perspectives on issues by leveraging their diverse backgrounds to draw relevant analogies. They have also had more time to develop soft skills, and are consequently better qualified to manage others and exercise leadership. Their greater career capital and network can also be leveraged to mitigate AI risks. Finally, they will be able to provide mentorship and guidance to less experienced professionals in the fields of AI safety and governance, something that is currently needed in the community.</p><p>This is why we are offering the following new services:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Continuous&nbsp;<strong>AI job market research</strong> to help others identify the most impactful jobs for mitigating catastrophic and existential risks of AI. For each of these roles, we build a theory of change, identify necessary skills, and gather the most common interview questions.</li><li><strong>Self-guided training programs</strong> to equip people in the fields of AI safety and AI governance with common policy and advocacy tools to effectively work together and contribute to the policy debate.</li><li>An&nbsp;<strong>AI-specific program</strong> to support professionals looking to transition into AI governance and AI safety.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>We are also announcing a change to our general program. While people applying for our general track still have access to peer support and collective coaching, one-on-one advising sessions are primarily reserved for AI program participants, with some exceptions.&nbsp; We may refer non-AI participants to other organizations, as the number of career services for mid-career people has been increasing and our team is particularly well placed to advise individuals seeking to transition towards high-impact AI work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>II. AI Market Research</h2><p>One of our primary focuses is conducting continuous AI job market research to pinpoint the jobs with the highest potential to mitigate the risks of AI. This includes a review of organizations\u2019 strategic documents, interviews with experts and professionals in AI, and constant monitoring of legal, political, and technological developments. Since the field is evolving at a fast pace, our research process is continuous and allows us to adapt and update our strategy accordingly in order to maximize the impact of our organization and our participants.&nbsp;</p><p>We have a continuously updated internal database that contains the types of roles we identify as high-leverage to mitigate catastrophic and existential risks from AI systems. For each role, our database includes the following:</p><ul><li>Tasks performed on the job</li><li>Required skills and background</li><li>Specific organizations where these roles could be especially leveraged</li><li>A list of interview questions frequently asked in the hiring process</li><li>A way to assess candidates\u2019 fitness</li></ul><p>As of today, we are publishing a partial version of this database in a report on our website,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.successif.org/impactful-roles-ai\">accessible here</a>. Note that it is a constantly evolving endeavor as the field is changing rapidly. We are hoping our report will be useful for the community. We are limiting the amount of public information we are releasing because we want to avoid helping non-impact oriented individuals secure the same jobs.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>III. AI Program</h2><p>Our AI program&nbsp; includes:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Access to collective workshops (Pathways to catastrophic and existential risks, Ikigai, Career transition strategies, Women &amp; leadership, Working in AI safety, Working in AI governance)</li><li>Access to a peer-support group</li><li>Skills assessment sessions&nbsp;</li><li>Individual career mentorship sessions</li><li>Mock interviews</li><li>Opportunity matching</li></ul><p>Apply <a href=\"https://www.successif.org/application-form\">here </a>for our career services.</p><h2>IV. Training Programs</h2><p>As of November 2023, we will be rolling out, unit by unit, several training modules. These are for both&nbsp;<strong>individuals who are currently in a high-impact AI role</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>those who are looking to transition</strong>. Alongside our advising services, professionals will be able, with our advice, to assemble different modules to construct their own learning path based on their previous skills and experience and on their professional goals.&nbsp;</p><p>The training program will focus on four career tracks: (1) AI media advocacy (2) AI policy advocacy (3) AI policy analysis, and (4) AI governance research. The units are self-guided and can be taken at any time. Some units include exercises graded by humans and returned to you. There is an exam you can take at the end to validate the course and be issued a certificate if you pass.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are a member of a target audience for one of the courses, and you believe taking it would help you maximize your impact, you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forms.gle/apRXQFEHBeLPVCZTA\"><u>apply here</u></a>. The training programs are free, but you have the option to make a donation at the end to offset our costs if you have found it valuable.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Career Track</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Target Audience</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Learning Objectives </strong>(not exhaustive)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">AI Media Advocacy</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>1.

For context, we usually encourage animal advocacy organisations to pursue legislative lobbying in general, and there are guides offering advice on how to conduct legislative lobbying for animal advocacy&nbsp;(1,2).</p><p>In this report, we focus specifically on party groups. Party groups are informal groups of MPs focused on a particular policy area. Party groups on various topics exist in many legislatures around the world. Party groups are a way to influence animal welfare policy through existing parties. Party groups may influence policy in a number of ways, such as: policy advocacy, in which groups can concretely affect specific details of policy proposals; information exchange, in which groups can provide information to politicians through reports and events; and agenda setting, in which groups make a particular topic more salient in a legislature or in the media. Academic studies show that party groups often have a policy impact. There are two main types of these groups:</p><ul><li>All-party groups (APGs), which draw their membership from across multiple parties in a legislature. The European Parliament's Animal Welfare Intergroup is an example of an APG.</li><li>Sub-party groups (SPGs), which exist inside a single party. The UK's Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation is an example of an SPG.</li></ul><p>We do not recommend that the movement invests huge resources into systematically launching party groups around the world. That said, we do believe that party groups are one promising tool among the many available in the legislative lobbying toolbox. While party groups are relatively cheap to run, the policy wins that tend to be obtained by party groups don't seem hugely different from what standard legislative lobbying would achieve. We also emphasise that successfully running a party group is a long-term investment\u2014running a party group requires patience, political acumen, great communication skills, and (for sub-party groups) actively participating in the broader scene of the target political party.</p><p>We also identify the countries where there are not yet animal advocacy party groups. In a 2013 publication, Ringe et al conducted a close examination of party groups in 45 of the world's advanced industrial democracies. That study found that of these 45 countries, 25 have some form of party group system. There are 17 countries that already have animal welfare party groups. Therefore, the following countries do not yet appear to have animal welfare party groups in their national legislatures: India, South Africa, Sweden, Germany, Hungary, Indonesia, New Zealand, Norway. This is also true for the subnational legislatures in India's states, South Africa's provinces, Germany's states, Indonesia's provinces, plus some states in the USA and some states and territories in Australia. These jurisdictions would be the most promising opportunities for launching new party groups focused on animal advocacy.</p><h1>Table of Contents</h1><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1loDqKJNoga32j0IVTovNjAB8kU7HemOolBHFoTigUUU/edit#heading=h.k14fxwlw27zn\">1.

Introduction</h1><p>In many democratic legislatures, it is possible to establish informal groups focused on a particular policy area. In this approach, we examine the possibility of establishing groups like these to encourage existing political parties to focus on animal welfare policy.</p><p>There are two main types of these groups. Both of these types are part of the umbrella category&nbsp;<i>party groups</i>, which are also called legislative member organisations.</p><ol><li>APG: An&nbsp;<i>all-party group</i> is any voluntary, informal body of legislators across more than one party who share a common interest in a policy area. APGs are also called cross-party groups, intergroups, and interparty caucuses. An example of an APG is the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare (UK).</li><li>SPG: A<i> sub-party group</i> is any voluntary, informal body of legislators within a&nbsp;<i>single</i> party who share a common ideological position or interest in a policy area. SPGs are also called factions or intraparty caucuses.</li></ol><p>Party groups are sometimes closely associated with outside actors, such as charities and NGOs. The boundary between party groups and NGOs is often fuzzy. For example, the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation has strong ties to Conservative Party parliamentarians in the UK, although there is no official affiliation.</p><p>Party groups are a way to influence animal welfare policy through existing parties. Typically, the parties involved are the biggest and most influential parties in a country, such as the parties that usually form government. This contrasts with minor political parties that are focused entirely on animal welfare policy (see the previous report in this series, \"Minor Political Parties\").</p><h1>2. Theory of Change</h1><p>Party groups may influence policy in a number of ways:</p><ul><li><i>Policy advocacy</i>. Groups can concretely affect the details of policy proposals. This can occur over the short-term (e.g. influencing details of particular pieces of legislation) or long-term (e.g. building coalitions to support animal welfare reforms over time). For example, there are instances where the APGs have caused specific passages to be inserted into the text of legislation&nbsp;(3).</li><li><i>Information exchange</i>. Groups can provide information to politicians, encouraging politicians to either propose, support, or oppose a particular policy. This can involve reports, working papers, email lists, or events and seminars aimed at parliamentarians.</li><li><i>Agenda setting</i>. Groups can make a particular topic salient, encouraging a legislature to focus on it. This can be achieved through a variety of tactics, including proposing motions and publishing press releases.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KDeRC5zbCquagLtCh/q9padno3l5dca7x31iw5\"></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>3. Policy Impact of Groups</h1><p>How often do party groups actually influence policy? The weight of evidence does indicate that party groups can have a policy impact that is positive, if modest. This section describes the academic evidence on the policy impact of party groups in general; we turn to the more specific case of party groups for animal advocacy below (see section \"Costs and Impacts for Party Groups in Animal Advocacy\").</p><p>Firstly, there are three seminal academic studies on party groups.</p><ul><li>Thomas&nbsp;(4) studies APGs in Canada, Scotland, Ontario, and the UK. The groups are usually supported by outside actors (e.g. businesses, charities, NGOs) that often provide funding, staff, services, and other resources. External actors often create and support APGs as part of broader lobbying campaigns while acknowledging that APGs are not always the most effective way to achieve their goals. Notably, Thomas finds that these groups can help legislators obtain information and can influence policy. Professional lobbying consultants regard APGs as often less effective than other lobbying tools.</li><li>The book by Ringe et al&nbsp;(3) gives a general study of party groups (both APGs and SPGs) in legislatures around the world. From a sample of 45 democratic countries, the authors find that party groups exist in 25 countries. The authors argue that the main role of party groups is to build social networks between legislators, which in turn allows for greater information sharing for all members of a network. This information includes technical details about and impacts of policies, but also the preferences of other parliamentarians, their constituents, whether a policy can be challenged in court, and so on. Ringe et al demonstrate that there are cases where party groups in the European Parliament have definitely influenced the content of legislation, at times even drafting text and having parliamentarians successfully insert that text into legislation via amendments&nbsp;(3). Party groups appear most likely to affect legislation in the agenda-setting stage or early consideration and drafting stages. The voluntary nature of party groups means they are very diverse in how they run and operate - this also means that groups will vary in their level of policy impact.</li><li>The book by Hammond&nbsp;(5), is a comprehensive study of party groups (both APGs and SPGs) in national policymaking in the US. Hammond argues that party groups are an informal adaptation that allow legislators to deal with the increasing complexity of policy issues and greater contact with constituents and interest groups. Hammond argues that party groups can indeed shape the legislative agenda and influence policy.</li></ul><p>Building on the above seminal studies, there are also a few empirical studies that are worth mentioning:</p><ul><li>McGee&nbsp;(6) examine intraparty caucuses in the US. Intraparty caucuses are one type of SPG, but they tend to be large and have broad policy agendas. The results are highly specific to the context of the US House of Representatives - the author repeatedly emphasises how the results are affected by the majoritarian legislature, political polarisation, the concentration of power in the hands of each party's elite, and the specific nature of the Republican and Democrat parties. So, it is unclear whether these results will generalise to animal welfare party groups in other jurisdictions. Drawing on interviews and more than 15,000 policy documents, McGee shows that SPGs in the US House \"provide a vital avenue for rank-and-file members to extract policy concessions from party leaders in a highly centralised power structure\". Influencing legislation throughout the legislative process, with interview respondents emphasising that \"earlier is better\", even though closed-door informal negotiations cannot be measured.</li><li>Clarke et al&nbsp;(7) test whether SPGs in the US enable legislators to advance their policy proposals more effectively. The authors find that SPGs can affect legislation in some situations. Specifically, they \"find robust evidence that factions in the minority party \u2013 and only the minority party \u2013 improve their members\u2019 ability to advance their policy proposals. Such effects are large and extend even to the passage of high-profile substantive and significant legislation.\" The authors find no such evidence for factions in the majority party, concluding that in a majority (governing) party, the party leaders have comparatively more power over the party members.</li><li>Zelizer&nbsp;(8\u201310) analyses \"the causal effect of information on legislators\u2019 policy positions\". Zelizer uses field experiments in a US state legislature to test the influence of three types of information that are highly relevant to APGs: staff briefings, cue-taking, and group deliberation. Staff briefing \"increased cosponsorship by 60% above baseline rates\", and negative briefing reduced cosponsorship and voting support of bills. Taking cues from other legislators \"is nearly 80% as effective as direct briefings\". Deliberations within party groups \"increased both cosponsorship and roll call voting support\" and also reduces polarisation on a bill.</li><li>Subsequently, Zelizer&nbsp;(11) found that this additional support may carry over to similar bills introduced in the future, though this appeared to be limited to closely related bills (rather than all bills relating to a broad issue). Zelizer concludes with a view that is optimistic, if modest, about the effects of information on legislators' policy positions: \"Persuasion was robust when legislators were provided technical expertise about bills; it lasted for years and crossed over to bills with related content. Legislators did not respond to a meeting with a special interest by simply supporting all of their bills, nor to a poll of constituents by persistently changing their voting behaviour. This suggests that legislators are trying to learn about the content of proposals, recall what they are given, and rely on this information when deciding what position to take. It is a relatively sanguine view of legislative persuasion.\"</li><li>Camp et al&nbsp;(12) also use field experiments to test whether providing information to legislators changes those legislators' policy positions. The results show that information changes legislators' positions when provided by legislative staffers, but not by lobbyists. The authors conclude that legislators are cautious when provided information by lobbyists, though it is also possible that the findings are attributable to the experimental design. For our purposes, it may be important to present and frame information in a way that appears trustworthy and appears buy-in from legislators, and repeated interactions through a party group is one way to accomplish this.</li></ul><p>It is also worth reporting the following passage. This excerpt was written in an email by an animal advocate running a CPG and also conducting more traditional forms of lobbying. They write that party groups \"are quite a lot of work to organise and maintain, and return on investment (in terms of policy influence and impact) is limited. They can be useful for relationship building and establishing the name and profile of the organisation that coordinates the group, but their effectiveness as a vehicle for policy change is limited. I think this is partly due to their bipartisan make up which can limit the types of issues the group is willing to engage on. That said, they can certainly still add value. Politicians love physical events and forums because they are more tangible and they can engage on a personal level. You could hold a physical event that attracts 30 people and it would have more impact on a politician than an online event that attracts 300. However, that needs to be balanced against the additional time and resources required for the physical event.\"</p><h1>4. Where Could New Groups Be Established?</h1><p>Are there countries where animal welfare groups don't already exist and could be established? In the table below, we divide the world's democratic countries into countries that&nbsp;<i>do not</i> have an animal welfare APG in their legislatures and countries that&nbsp;<i>do</i> have an animal welfare APG in their legislatures. We also list countries we are unsure about and countries that do not have any APGs.</p><p>The list builds on the analysis conducted by Ringe et al&nbsp;(3). In that study, Ringe et al examined 45 countries in detail for whether APGs are present in those countries' legislatures. The 45 countries chosen were advanced industrial democracies, defined as countries that were \"members of the OECD, EU, or G-20 and have 'institutionalised democracy' scores of 8, 9 or 10 in the 2009 Polity IV database\". Ringe et al found that 25 of these 45 countries had some form of APG system, while the remaining 20 countries did not have any APGs.</p><p>For each of the 25 countries that do have an APG system, we searched for whether that country has an APG dedicated to animal welfare/advocacy. We also asked local advocates where possible.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Promising Jurisdictions</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p>We do not think that these jurisdictions have animal welfare APGs.

Costs and Impacts for Party Groups in Animal Advocacy</h1><p>In this section, we analyse the financial costs and policy impacts of some existing, successful party groups in animal advocacy. Our overall conclusions are as follows. Firstly, party groups seem relatively cheap to run. Secondly, the policy wins\u2014while often meaningful and high-impact\u2014don't seem hugely different from what could be achieved by other approaches to legislative lobbying. These findings fit with the view that party groups appear to be one tool among the many available to legislative lobbying organisations.</p><h2><strong>5.1 Cost of running a party group</strong></h2><p>To run an animal welfare party group, the main expense is paying for a staff member to act as the secretariat, and there are occasional additional expenses for administration, document design, small payments to consultants, etc. In total, we expect that running a group would cost roughly ~$40,000 USD a year.</p><p>The Animal Welfare APG's financial statements&nbsp;(13) reveal that the annual income and expenditure is steady from year to year, consisting of:</p><ul><li>Income of around \u00a330,000 (~$38,000 USD). This comes from two key sources: the RSPCA (roughly two-thirds) and the Petfood Manufacturing Association (roughly one third). In addition, there are small contributions from general membership.</li><li>Expenditure of around \u00a330,000. Almost all of this (97%) paid for the secretariat (which appears to be one part-time staff member), and the remaining few hundred dollars went to administrative costs. There are occasionally additional expenses for particular projects. For example, \u00a33,000 was spent in 2019-2020 on \"Data Analyst for Small Abattoir Mapping\".</li></ul><p>We get a similar picture from the Animal Welfare Intergroup in the EU Parliament. Financial statements&nbsp;(14) show that the sole cost of the Intergroup is the secretariat, which is coordinated by Eurogroup for Animals. Specifically, this involves \"the provision of a part time member of staff in charge of running the Intergroup Secretariat as well as the involvement of the Eurogroup for Animals' policy experts when needed\". Specific costs aren't given, but this is consistent with a total expenditure similar to the \u00a330,000 from the UK Animal Welfare APG. These contributions are comparable to those for the UK's other APGs&nbsp;(4).</p><h2><strong>5.2 Impact case study: EU Intergroup</strong></h2><p>Turning now to the impact of existing groups, we have chosen to analyse two successful groups in particular. One is the European Parliament's Intergroup for Animal Welfare, and the other is the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation (following section).</p><p>The Animal Welfare Intergroup (also known as the Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals) is an APG of MEPs in the European Parliament. This APG is one of the oldest and largest in the European Parliament&nbsp;(15). Landorff reported in the 2010s that the Intergroup's official membership consisted of 44 MEPs, who came from six different political party alliances and six member states&nbsp;(16). The Intergroup has rules for membership and participation that are quite formal and comprehensive compared to other Intergroups in the European Parliament&nbsp;(16). The Intergroup hosts monthly meetings. Not all MEPs who are members of the Intergroup attend, though external guests and MEPs' assistants do attend also. Meetings typically have two speakers. It is striking for our purposes that one of these two speakers is almost always a representative of Eurogroup for Animals or other animal advocacy organisations&nbsp;(16). This means that the Intergroup directly facilitates communication from animal advocacy organisations to interested MEPs.</p><p>We depend on academic sources for the attribution of policies to the Intergroup, and the most recent of these were written in 2013. Therefore, our analysis ignores the Intergroup's successes over the past decade. However, it still provides a useful sample for understanding the Intergroup's impact over a particular time period, which can give us an idea of a party group's impact per year. The major policies attributed to the Intergroup, as of 2013, are as follows&nbsp;(3,15,17): a ban on the trade in seal products; amendments on animal experimentation; the withdrawal of subsidies for long-distance animal transport; and a ban on cat and dog fur. The Intergroup also successfully had animals classified as \"sentient beings\", rather than products, in the Lisbon Treaty. We have not attempted to calculate the impact of this success, though we found that the impact may have been positive in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals\"><u>our previous report on symbolic legislation</u></a>&nbsp;(18).</p><p><i><strong>Ban on trade in seal products</strong></i></p><p>The Intergroup obtained a ban on the sale and import into the EU of seal products&nbsp;(3,15,17). This was enacted in 2009 by the Regulation No 1007/2009 on the Trade in Seal Products. Prior to the Regulation, the EU was an important market for seal products, with products coming from hunts of wild seals in Canada, Greenland, and a few other places. Seals are typically killed at below 3 months of age&nbsp;(19). The welfare impacts of the seal harvest are described in detail by Butterworth and Richardson&nbsp;(19). This scientific review found that the hunt, during which seals experience considerable distress, \"compares extremely unfavourably with the societal and legal expectations for commercial slaughter conditions\".</p><p>How did the 2009 Regulation affect the number of seals killed? The average seal harvest pre-2009, summed across both Canada&nbsp;(20) and Greenland&nbsp;(21), was 464,788 seals. The average seal harvest post-2009 was 210,210 seals. Therefore, we estimate that the EU 2009 Regulation has prevented 254,578 seals from being slaughtered each year.</p><p>We assume that any differences in the seal catch before and after 2009 is entirely attributable to the 2009 Regulation. This is reasonable given that a sharp decline in seal harvests is visible in the data from 2009 exactly (especially in Canada) and that the government of Canada was sufficiently concerned about the economic impact of the Regulation to launch a complaint at the WTO. We assume that the 2009 Regulation is entirely attributable to the activity of the Intergroup. This assumption is based on interviews from MEPs reporting as such&nbsp;(3), though it is possible that a similar policy would have passed even without the activity of the Intergroup. Our estimate only accounts for the seal harvest in Canada and Greenland, the two places where almost all of the harvest happens, though there are comparatively small harvests in Namibia, Russia, Norway&nbsp;(22).</p><p>We assume that there are no indirect effects. In practice, consumers might substitute towards buying different things (e.g. leather) and producers might substitute towards hunting different animals (e.g. fish). Higher seal populations might cause suffering (or reduce suffering) experienced by seals and other wild animals. This ban also set important precedent for regulating international trade on the basis of animal welfare (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/imports-to-meet-uk-animal-welfare-standards\"><u>our report on animal welfare and trade</u></a>).</p><p><i><strong>Amendments on animal experimentation</strong></i></p><p>The Intergroup obtained \"amendments on animal experiments\" in the 2006 REACH chemical legislation (Regulation No. 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals)&nbsp;(3,15). The REACH legislation was a new regulatory regime for chemicals sold in the EU. As part of the REACH's requirements, companies were obligated to perform new tests to evaluate the safety of chemicals. This involved animal testing. According to Taylor's 2018 calculations&nbsp;(23), \"over 2.2 million animals have already been used in new tests for REACH registrations.\"</p><p>Two important statements in REACH relating to animal testing are&nbsp;(23):</p><ul><li>Article 1(1): \"[...] This Regulation should also promote the development of alternative [i.e., non-animal] methods for the assessment of hazards of substances.\"</li><li>Article 13(1): \"Information on intrinsic properties of substances may be generated by means other than tests, provided that the conditions set out in Annex XI [of the Regulation] are met. In particular for human toxicity, information shall be generated whenever possible by means other than vertebrate animal tests, through the use of alternative methods [...]\"</li><li>Article 25(1): \"In order to avoid animal testing, testing on vertebrate animals for the purposes of this Regulation shall be undertaken only as a last resort. It is also necessary to take measures limiting duplication of other tests.\"</li></ul><p>To help reduce the number of animal tests conducted, REACH provided a number of alternative methods. These alternative methods involved using and/or adapting existing data, conducting experiments&nbsp;<i>in vitro</i>, using computer models, and arguing that the information required in a particular case is unnecessary. Official data shows that these alternative methods were used for 89% of information requirements, meaning that 11% of information requirements were met by animal tests&nbsp;(24).</p><p>So, we can reason that:</p><ul><li>The number of animals who have been used for experiments to meet the requirements of REACH is roughly ~2.2 million, according to Taylor's calculations conducted in 2018&nbsp;(23).</li><li>Based on official data, the number of animals used in experiments to meet the requirements of REACH is ~11% of the number that would have been used, had the REACH legislation not permitted alternatives to animal testing. (This assumes that the number of animals used is roughly proportional to the total number of registrations made.)</li><li>2.2 million animals is 11% of 20 million. Therefore, these numbers imply that 17.8 million animals were spared experimentation due to the availability of alternatives in the REACH legislation.</li></ul><p>We assume that the clauses in the REACH legislation reducing animal experimentation are entirely attributable to the Intergroup, based on published interviews from MEPs&nbsp;(3). This may overestimate the role of the Intergroup - other animal advocacy organisations had expressed concern with the effects of REACH on animals, and the amendments to protect animals seem to have arisen from a joint campaign at the very least&nbsp;(23).</p><p><i><strong>Withdrawal of subsidies for long-distance animal transport</strong></i></p><p>The Intergroup succeeded in abolishing subsidies paid to businesses that export live cows from the EU&nbsp;(17). One MEP interviewed by Ringe et al&nbsp;(3) reported that they were \"100 percent sure that [...] that was the intergroup\". Before these subsidies were abolished, businesses were paid, for each cow, the difference between the price of cows in the EU and the price of cows in the importing country. Data of EU's cow exports don't really show a clear break before and after 2013&nbsp;(25). The EU's live cow exports would have been affected by other political and policy changes happening around the same time (e.g. accession of countries). As a conservative assumption, we will assume that this policy had no impact on the number of cows exported live from the EU. In reality, we expect that this policy would indeed have had a meaningful impact, perhaps affecting a proportion of the ~500 to 600 thousand cattle exported live each year around 2013. Due to data limitations, and the fact that the scale of this policy would be relatively small compared to the other four policies we do model, we are comfortable ignoring this impact purely for the purpose of this report.</p><p><i><strong>Ban on cat and dog fur</strong></i></p><p>The Intergroup obtained a ban on the sale and import into the EU of cat and dog fur. This ban was applied from 31 Dec 2008&nbsp;(26), though a voluntary ban had already been in place since 2002&nbsp;(27). The problem facing policymakers was that some products nevertheless used cat and dog fur either unlabelled or mislabelled, with the main products being \"jackets and coats, scarves, neckerchiefs, key rings and skin\"&nbsp;(26). As part of the 2008 ban, the European Commission and some Member States provided resources for officials to use in identifying cat and dog fur. There are two main reasons we exclude this policy from our analysis. Firstly, the scale of the ban was quite small. For example, in 2010, Member States report that 67 consignments were seized at the border, and 40 consignments were seized in shops and retailers&nbsp;(26). Member States expressed concern that it was difficult to enforce the ban for products purchased from online retailers. Secondly, the ban was placed on fur produced from cats and dogs, but not from other animals. It is unclear if this ban would actually have caused fewer animals to be farmed for their fur. Rather, it is possible that cat and dog fur products banned from the EU were simply sold to other countries instead, or that consumers and manufacturers simply switched to fur produced from other animal species - this latter possibility is concerning, as farming smaller animals (e.g. rabbits) may mean that more animals were farmed to produce a particular quantity of fur. The European Fur Breeders Association reported that \"the ban did not have a negative impact on fur trade\"&nbsp;(26). Subsequent analysis showed that cat fur products were still being sold in the EU in 2017&nbsp;(28). We suspect that a detailed analysis on this policy would reveal that the benefits for animals would have been small.</p><p><i><strong>Phase-out of battery cages?</strong></i></p><p>Corbett&nbsp;<i>et al.</i>&nbsp;(15) attribute to the Intergroup the EU's phase-out of battery cages for egg-laying hens. We have been unable to verify the Intergroup's contribution to this policy. If we were to model the impact of this policy, we are confident that we would conclude that this policy had a very large, positive impact for animal welfare&nbsp;(29).</p><h2><strong>5.3 Impact case study: Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation</strong></h2><p>For sub-party groups, the most relevant case study is the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation (CAWF). Established in 2016, this group is associated with the Conservative Party in the UK. The CAWF is actually a campaign and lobbying group with no official affiliation with the Conservative Party. However, the CAWF has strong ties with many legislators within the Conservative Party. This is precisely the type of group that the animal advocacy movement could consider replicating (for any major political party), which is why we examine CAWF in this case study.</p><p>The website lists about a dozen formal patrons - these are mostly Conservative MPs, including some MPs who previously held Minister positions, but some are the spouses of Conservative MPs, and other patrons are closely associated with the Conservative party in other ways. Notably, some MPs associated with CAWF are also closely involved in the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Animal Welfare&nbsp;(30). The CAWF also works with MPs from other parties.</p><p>We spoke with CAWF via email, and their representative mentioned six major policy successes: mandatory CCTV in England's slaughterhouses; UK ivory ban; including crustaceans and cephalopods in the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act; Defra\u2019s Action Plan For Animal Welfare; proposals added to the Animal Health and Welfare Pathway; the Conservative manifesto commitment to end live exports; and a ban on glue traps.</p><p><i><strong>Mandatory CCTV in slaughterhouses in England (2018)</strong></i></p><p>The CAWF helped to secure the introduction of mandatory CCTV into England's slaughterhouses in 2018. The CAWF spoke with politicians to press for this measure (e.g. Farming Minister), and these discussions may have contributed to the measure being included in the 2017 Conservative manifesto and then becoming law.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/cctv-cameras-in-slaughterhouses-modest-benefits-for-animal-welfare\"><u>a previous report</u></a>, we analysed the impact of CCTV cameras in slaughterhouses. We concluded that this policy probably reduces the number of animal welfare non-compliances (and therefore the amount of suffering) at slaughter. We expect that these benefits would be meaningful, but modest in scale. On the other hand, almost all of England's slaughterhouse throughput (98% of poultry) already took place in slaughterhouses with CCTV installed voluntarily by 2013&nbsp;(31).</p><p><i><strong>UK ivory ban (2018)</strong></i></p><p>The CAWF coordinated a letter supporting a ban on ivory in the UK, and this letter was signed by Conservative MPs and Conservative organisations.</p><p>While there is no comprehensive data available, the scale of the UK ivory trade was probably somewhere in the vicinity of several thousand pieces of ivory sold each year&nbsp;(32,33). Most of these are antiques, and only a minority would be from recently killed elephants. Both the UK and the Conservative party had already demonstrated a track record of restricting the UK trade in ivory and other wildlife products&nbsp;(34).</p><p><i><strong>Conservative manifesto commitment to end live exports (2019)</strong></i></p><p>In 2019, the Conservative Party's manifesto included a commitment for a ban on live exports for fattening and slaughter (but not for breeding) by 2024. The CAWF heavily campaigned for this policy and was publicly attributed by politicians as having made an important contribution&nbsp;(35,36). The policy was included in the Kept Animals Bill, though this Bill was subsequently dropped. The government has stated that they will be \"taking forward measures in the Kept Animals Bill individually during the remainder of this parliament,\" though it remains to be seen whether this promise materialises&nbsp;(37).</p><p>In a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/animal-welfare-during-transport-a-first-look\"><u>previous report</u></a>, we analysed the impact of banning live export&nbsp;(38). We concluded that this policy probably reduces a meaningful amount of suffering, but only for a small number of animals and only for a small proportion of their lives. Based on older 2016 data, the UK exports roughly 550,000 live animals to the EU each year&nbsp;(39). This excludes chickens. Exports to the EU account for about two-thirds of the UK's total live exports by value&nbsp;(39), so we could expect the total number of animals exported live by the UK to be around 800,000 per year. These figures are from before Brexit and could have changed since the UK left the EU. Live export numbers have decreased substantially over time&nbsp;(40). In more recent years, between 25,000 and 50,000 sheep and calves have been exported from Great Britain annually&nbsp;(41). It is unclear how much of this decrease is due to conscious policy change and how much is due to temporary administrative barriers resulting from post-Brexit trade negotiations. Live export numbers have decreased over time in other countries (e.g. Australia&nbsp;(38)). However, there is nothing to prevent the live exports numbers increasing once again, especially when border posts are in place in the EU.</p><p>Therefore, it would be reasonable to expect a live export ban to prevent a few hundred thousand animals being exported live from the UK each year. Since two-thirds of the UK's live exports are to the EU, the journey times for most of these animals would probably be relatively short (hours or days). A minority of animals may experience longer journey times. As such, a live export ban would probably prevent somewhere in the vicinity of 5,000 animal-years of suffering per year. Given the public support in the UK for a live export ban&nbsp;(42), only a proportion of this policy would be attributable to CAWF (though it may well be a large proportion or even a majority).</p><p><i><strong>Decapod crustaceans and cephalopods included as sentient beings in the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act 2022</strong></i></p><p>The CAWF campaigned heavily for the inclusion of decapod crustaceans and cephalopods as sentient beings in the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act 2022, and called for an end to the live boiling of crustaceans.</p><p>CAWF's campaign was widely reported in the media, both in the UK and overseas. One of a couple of groups campaigning for this, though the CAWF campaign appears to have been significant.</p><p>Given the immense scale of humans' exploitation of decapod crustaceans and cephalopods in the UK, this has the potential to be a very high-impact win. The precise impact will hinge on what future regulations are created as a result of this new law. The inclusion of decapod crustaceans and cephalopods as sentient beings will probably cause concrete improvements in the lives of these animals, as we concluded in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/does-sentience-legislation-help-animals\"><u>our recent report on this topic</u></a>&nbsp;(18): \"Though the sentience of decapod crustaceans and cephalopods has now been recognised, they are still not included in even the basic protections of the Animal Welfare Act, and they are certainly not protected by more detailed secondary legislation, such as a Code of Practice. This makes the recognition of their sentience relatively symbolic so far, but since this is a recent development, it will be important to see if they are later included in the Animal Welfare Act (2006) or other legislation, as the government-commissioned report recommends. [...] Also remarkably, as part of the UK recognition of animal sentience, an independent committee of animal sentience is to be established with the task of ensuring that other government departments pay due respect to animal sentience in their decision-making. The independent nature of this committee could be an asset, since it will make it less likely that it will be captured by industry interests. The government has said that sentience will not take priority over other considerations when formulating legislation, but this is still very significant. If properly implemented, this would make the UK\u2019s recognition of sentience more concrete and less purely symbolic than any of the other cases we have discussed in this report.\"</p><p><i><strong>Defra\u2019s Action Plan For Animal Welfare (2021)</strong></i></p><p>Defra's Action Plan For Animal Welfare 2021 was based heavily on the CAWF's 2019 manifesto document. This manifesto document included 30 animal welfare proposals. The Action Plan includes: reforms for animal welfare during transport within the UK; considering the reform of the use of farrowing crates for pigs and cages for hens; considering additional welfare improvements at slaughter; preventing farmed animal attacks by dogs; and a consultation on animal welfare labelling. Notably, the labelling consultation was dropped in July 2023.</p><p>Since this is an Action Plan rather than a concrete policy, it is difficult to estimate the number of animals who may benefit from this policy win. It is also possible that some of these components would have been included in the Action Plan even without CAWF's work. Nevertheless, if some of these proposals do make their way into concrete policies, the scale of the animal welfare benefits may be large.</p><p><i><strong>Proposals added to the Animal Health and Welfare Pathway (2022)</strong></i></p><p>The CAWF made a collection of proposals for inclusion in the Animal Health and Welfare Pathway. These proposals were added to the Pathway, and some of these proposals were not included in the original scope of the consultation. The Animal Health and Welfare Pathway prioritises areas for welfare improvement for pigs, cows, sheep and poultry. Notably, these priorities include switching broiler chickens to slow-growing breeds; shifting away from the use of enriched cages towards cage-free systems for egg-laying hens; and reducing confinement of sows during farrowing. The Pathway also offers financial support to farmers to pay for some animal welfare improvements.</p><p>Like the Action Plan discussed above, it is difficult to say what the concrete policy impact of the Animal Health and Welfare Pathway would be. However, if some of these proposals are implemented\u2014particularly the poultry welfare improvements\u2014then the scale of the animal welfare benefits may be immense.</p><p><i><strong>Banning glue traps in the UK</strong></i></p><p>The CAWF offered support to the campaign to ban glue traps in the UK. The ban on glue traps has now passed into law, though there is an exemption available for \"professional pest controllers on an exceptional basis, to preserve public health or safety where there is no suitable alternative\"&nbsp;(43).</p><p>Cox&nbsp;(44) estimates that a glue trap ban would cause a moderate reduction of suffering for each rodent who would have otherwise been killed by a glue trap. There are probably around 10 million rats in the UK&nbsp;(45), and local authorities \"dealt with 225,430 residential rodent infestations in 2022\"&nbsp;(46). On one hand, many rats would be killed by people other than local authorities, and glue traps kill wild animals other than rats&nbsp;(44). On the other hand, not all traps are glue traps. Therefore, it is probably reasonable to expect that a glue trap ban would prevent hundreds of thousands, or perhaps millions, of animals being killed by glue traps each year.</p><h1>7. Conclusion</h1><p>We do not recommend that the movement invests huge resources into systematically launching party groups around the world. However, party groups appear to be one promising tool among the many available to legislative lobbying organisations. The most appropriate lobbying tool (whether party groups or some other tool) should be chosen by on-the-ground experience and knowledge of the specific policy context.</p><p>In this report, we have found no indication that party groups should be privileged over other forms of lobbying. While party groups are relatively cheap to run, the policy wins that tend to be obtained by party groups don't seem hugely different from what standard legislative lobbying would achieve. We also emphasise that successfully running a party group is a long-term investment\u2014requiring patience, political acumen, great communication skills, and actively participating in the broader scene of the target political party.</p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p>We are grateful to the people who offered their wisdom about the policy impacts of party groups, and to members of our network who generously helped us to find country-specific information.</p><h1>Bibliography</h1><p>1.

My goals were to: (1) offer a first stab at understanding how various segments of EA are growing; (2) publish data on some core projects in the ecosystem to further the community\u2019s understanding of the ecosystem.</p><p>This is an edited version of a memo I wrote for the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/33o5jbe3WjPriGyAR/announcing-the-meta-coordination-forum-2023\"><u>Meta Coordination Forum</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftikjpzapog\"><sup><a href=\"#fntikjpzapog\">[2]</a></sup></span>. All of the data underlying this post was collected in August, and thus some of the 2023 projections are now potentially out of date.</p><p>I had a fairly short deadline to finish this project,&nbsp;and many of the decisions I made on data collection + synthesis were constrained by my time budget. So&nbsp;I intended this post to be a data-driven starting point to further more discussion, but this is certainly not a full investigation of the question.</p><p>In general, while I conducted this investigation as part of my role at CEA, the findings here shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as CEA\u2019s opinion on this matter. Most of my colleagues didn\u2019t engage with this memo prior to publishing this on the Forum, and may not necessarily agree with the bottom line conclusions.</p><h2>Some global data notes:</h2><ul><li><strong>Most of the specific numbers reported in this post are ballpark estimates</strong>, as opposed to careful and precise numbers.&nbsp;In particular:<ul><li>I encouraged orgs&nbsp;to report ballpark numbers if easiest, and didn\u2019t thoroughly check for data inconsistencies or obvious mistakes.</li><li>I often estimated the 2023 projections myself when orgs didn\u2019t provide them (often quite crudely \u2014 e.g. linearly extrapolating the data point I received from mid-August to cover the full year).<ul><li>I adjusted for seasonality especially for the most critical variables when possible, but did not do so consistently.</li><li>Since&nbsp;seasonality is especially likely to distort the picture for effective giving metrics, when estimating growth rates within effective giving, I <i>only</i> use projected 2023 data from orgs if I have some way of adjusting for seasonality.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>I did not run this report by all the orgs who provided me with data before publishing</strong>, and so expect many of the metrics could be off or lacking context in important ways. This also means that programs who gave me data for this project do not necessarily endorse my conclusions about their projects.<ul><li><strong>This includes CEA specific programs</strong>: Frequently, I estimated 2023 projected year end metrics for CEA programs myself, instead of asking program owners.</li></ul></li><li>I use projected 2023 data throughout this analysis, as opposed to the year to date numbers.</li><li>3 organisations whose data I initially used in this memo did not give us permission to publish their data in the public Forum post. I\u2019ve redacted the names of those organisations from this post, but still include the metrics from these orgs when presenting the weighted averages reported throughout.</li></ul><p>There are more detailed notes in the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TurdGigfQKwxBkKnb/estimating-ea-growth-rates-mcf-memo-1#Limitations\"><u>limitations</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TurdGigfQKwxBkKnb/estimating-ea-growth-rates-mcf-memo-1#Methodology\"><u>methodology</u></a>&nbsp;sections below.</p><h1>Summary chart</h1><p>Here is a summary of the overall average growth rates reported by cohort in this memo.</p><p>This chart plots the year-over-year growth rates in each cohort, after normalising all metrics to start at 1 in 2021.

selecting the metrics to investigate I ended up with a couple of buckets of metrics that were internally comparable:<ul><li>Newsletter subscriptions (<strong>80k</strong>, EA newsletter, ACX, and Animal Advocacy Careers)</li><li>Website visits (<strong>80k</strong>, ACX, EA.org, Wikipedia pages related to EA+)</li><li>Google search popularity for terms related to EA+</li><li>CEA virtual program intro course participants</li></ul></li><li>To weight these metrics:<ul><li>Within each bucket, I:<ul><li>Estimated the sizes of each program in 2023 relative to each other,<ul><li>e.g. # subscribers the EA newsletter v.s. the 80k newsletters</li></ul></li><li>And then applied a subjective adjustment on top of this to account for some metrics being more informative to tracking EA growth rates<ul><li>e.g. I expect the change in visits to ACX over time is much less informative than # visits to the EA.org website, since the latter is much more directly about EA.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>This then allowed me to compare within each bucket, how informative the trend lines in e.g. 80k vs EA newsletter vs ACX subscribers was.</li><li>I then roughly weighted these buckets against each other: e.g. estimating how informative a single visit to the 80k website was vs a single additional newsletter subscriber.</li><li>This is inspired by a relative values approach as detailed <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EFEwBvuDrTLDndqCt/relative-value-functions-a-flexible-new-format-for-value\"><u>here</u></a>.</li></ul></li><li>I attempted this exercise because initially I was worried that the approach of plotting the growth rates of many very different metrics against each other was incoherent, and perhaps the \u201creal\u201d early funnel growth rate might be extremely sensitive to what weights you chose for each metric.<ul><li>But in fact, even after trying out several different methods of weighting these metrics, I get pretty similar results.<ul><li>And as demonstrated above, even just taking the raw average over the metrics I chose gives you a pretty directionally similar result to the weighted average.</li></ul></li><li><strong>So I don\u2019t think the overall growth rates reported here are very sensitive to metric weighting</strong>, although I do think they are fairly sensitive to which metrics you choose to present / how you define \u2018early funnel\u2019.</li></ul></li></ul><p>For transparency, you can read&nbsp;the reasoning behind the weights I chose <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1niMb0LqGcKXDKto4UdTZd2FZmmol65e8MgkOq3C1uAM/edit\"><u>here</u></a>, although as noted above I don\u2019t think the analysis is very sensitive to these weights.</p><p>I\u2019m presenting this mostly to give readers a sense of my approach, and so you can check how much we agree / disagree on these relative weights. In general, a lot of these weightings are pretty loosely held and based on rough heuristics.</p><h2>Mid funnel</h2><p>I used a similar approach in selecting and weighting metrics as with the early funnel plot.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/TurdGigfQKwxBkKnb/rjsji7esamt1qe5oi7aw\"

the early funnel section.</li><li>After selecting the metrics to investigate I ended up with a couple of buckets of metrics that were internally comparable. I\u2019ve bolded the metric I used as a comparison point below (the following list excludes metrics I can\u2019t share due to data sharing constraints):<ul><li>Job board clicks: <strong>80k job board clicks</strong>, AAC job board users</li><li>Monthly active users: <strong>EA Forum</strong>, LessWrong</li><li>New givers: <strong>GWWC new givers added per year</strong>, OFTW new givers during the year</li><li>Atlas high quality applications</li><li>Virtual Program all unique participants</li><li>80k podcast total hours listened</li></ul></li><li>To weight these metrics:<ul><li>Within each bucket, I:<ul><li>Estimated the sizes of each program in 2023 relative to each other</li><li>and then applied a subjective adjustment on top of this to account for some metrics being more informative to tracking EA growth rates</li></ul></li><li>I then roughly weighted these buckets against each other. This is inspired by a relative values approach as detailed <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EFEwBvuDrTLDndqCt/relative-value-functions-a-flexible-new-format-for-value\"><u>here</u></a>.</li></ul></li><li>I present the average and weighted average growth rates above.</li><li>Again, <strong>I don\u2019t think the overall growth rates are very sensitive to the weights I chose, and tried different variations with similar results</strong>. Because of time constraints, I have presented just the overall weights I ended up with in the table above, without my detailed reasoning.</li></ul><h2>Late funnel</h2><p>I used a similar approach in selecting and weighting metrics as with the early + mid funnel plot.</p><p><img style=\"width:624px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/TurdGigfQKwxBkKnb/zrgbk5u2yf38jntx9o8b\" alt=\"\"></p><p>The following figure does not plot metrics with no data in 2021. As such, it excludes metrics such as the number of EAGx attendees, since there were no EAGxs in 2021. Metrics with no data in 2021 are still included in the overall mean + weighted mean growth rates reported for 2023.</p><p><img style=\"width:624px\"

this as a general launching off point to start untangling which metrics are performing worse or better, but not draw strong conclusions from this data.</p><p>In general, I think the growth rates of the individual programs will probably serve as a better jumping off point for specific discussion.</p><p>In my opinion, some core weaknesses of this approach include:</p><h3>The data is of highly varying quality throughout.</h3><ul><li>I&nbsp;rely on a combination of: org reported specific data points, org reported BOTEC / rough data, my own attempts to extrapolate data into the future, public data, etc.</li><li>Unfortunately, how confident I am in each metric isn\u2019t always legible in my documentation, which is a weakness of this approach.</li><li>In general, I would not trust the pinpoint data points reported throughout, and especially not the full year of 2023 projections.</li></ul><h3>I am measuring growth rates over messy, ill-defined categories.</h3><ul><li>There doesn't seem to be a canonical definition of what early / mid / late funnel means, for instance.</li></ul><h3>I am often comparing different units.</h3><ul><li>As an example, some of these metrics are explicitly about the number of users participating in a program (e.g. the # active EA Forum users), and some are about engagement (e.g. total views on the EA.org homepage).</li><li>Also, some metrics track the cumulative total value of a metric over time (e.g. total number of Giving What We Can pledges, total subscribers to the EA newsletter), whereas some metrics track only what changes have been <u>added</u>&nbsp;per year (e.g. new GWWC pledges added per year, number of virtual program participants, number of 80k 1on1 calls).<ul><li>The growth rate in the cumulative total metrics will likely be more stable (small numbers change around more easily); h/t Lizka for pointing this out.</li></ul></li><li>I attempted to adjust for factors like this where possible, but didn\u2019t prioritize doing a rigorous job here (and frequently were bottlenecked by data availability).</li></ul><h3>I only include programs that have existed since the start of 2022.</h3><ul><li>This is primarily to have enough data to compare metrics over time and account for seasonal adjustments.</li><li>But if you think that growth in EA / the ecosystem is primarily being driven by newer programs right now, I don\u2019t have many good signals to capture this kind of growth.</li></ul><h3>These metrics likely capture overlapping populations, but I don\u2019t know the size of the overlap.</h3><ul><li>For instance, I can\u2019t cleanly forecast the total number of effective donors in 2023, because it seems fairly likely that a very similar set of people will donate via GWWC, ACE, etc.</li><li>This double-counting problem is a general problem even within orgs / projects \u2014 80k and CEA, which are some of the biggest orgs represented, likely have many users that participate in multiple programs reported. I ran out of time to address this double-counting problem for this memo, but might turn back to it at some point.</li><li>I expect work like the <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/ea-survey\"><u>EA Survey</u></a>&nbsp;or the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NP5B6yNMoZiZbmEQ8/open-phil-ea-lt-survey-2020-introduction-and-summary-of\"><u>Open Phil longtermist CB survey</u></a>&nbsp;will be significantly more valuable for counting e.g. the total number of people late in the funnel, in part because it can bypass this double-counting problem.</li></ul><h3>I don\u2019t include any good \u201cquality-adjusted\u201d metrics, which is more of a problem near the bottom of the funnel.</h3><ul><li>I expect once you get close to the \u201clate funnel\u201d, for most practical cases, the specifics of how each person is engaging with a program becomes much more important than the raw number of people participating in a program. E.g. some applications to the EA Funds are likely to be much more impactful than others, but this approach effectively weighs all applications equally. Moreover, there are fewer datapoints in the bottom of the funnel, so variations in the count of various metrics means less.</li><li>For the most part, this is out of the scope of this report.</li></ul><h1>Methodology</h1><h2>What data did I collect and why?</h2><p>When deciding on the metrics I wanted to collect, I made a list of:</p><ul><li>Large EA relevant projects,</li><li>Non-EA projects that carried some interesting signal about a different segment of the community (e.g. ACX, Atlas),</li><li>A few cause-specific orgs as a comparison point (although this wasn\u2019t my focus point)</li></ul><p>I&nbsp;ended up using some level of data from 14 organisations / projects:</p><ul><li>80,000 Hours</li><li>Astral Codex Ten</li><li>Animal Advocacy Careers</li><li>Animal Charity Evaluators</li><li>Atlas</li><li>CEA</li><li>EA Funds</li><li>Giving What We Can</li><li>LessWrong</li><li>One for the World</li><li>Open Philanthropy</li><li>3 other projects that are redacted from this report due to data sharing constraints</li></ul><p>I also relied on publicly reported data from:</p><ul><li>Founders Pledge (partial)</li><li>Google search popularity results</li><li>Wikipedia page views</li></ul><p>Unfortunately I had to drop 3 other projects I initially considered from the analysis because I didn\u2019t have at least 2 full years of data from them. I also reached out to ~6 other projects who either did not respond or declined to participate in this project.</p><h2>How did I estimate 2023 projected values?</h2><p>I followed this rough preference order when forecasting 2023 projected values per metric:</p><ul><li>Whenever provided, I deferred to the projections provided by orgs (even when they were rough ballpark numbers).</li><li>If an org did not provide a 2023 projection, but they did have numbers for year-to-date (YTD, Jan-now) AND it was possible to determine what the equivalent 2022 (YTD) was, I usually tried to account for seasonal effects by estimating:<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"[2023\\ projected]\\ =\\ [2023\\ YTD]\\ *\\ (2022\\ total\\ /\\ 2022\\ equivalent\\ YTD)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

As it stands, the AI Safety Community itself can not coordinate to state that we should stop AGI progress right now!</p><p>Not only can it not coordinate, <strong>the AI Safety Community is defecting, by making it more costly for people who do say it to say it.</strong></p><p>We all feel like we are working on the most important things, and that we are being pragmatic realists.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2018/12/03/you-are-not-stuck-in-traffic-you-are-traffic/\"><strong><u>But remember: If you feel stuck in the Overton window, it is because YOU ARE the Overton window.</u></strong></a></p><p>\u2014</p><h1>1. The AI Safety Community is making our job harder</h1><p><strong>In a saner world, all AGI progress should have already stopped. If we don\u2019t, there\u2019s more than a 10% chance we all die.</strong></p><p>Many people in the AI safety community believe this, but they have not stated it publicly. Worse, they have stated <i>different beliefs</i> more saliently, which misdirect everyone else about what should be done, and what the AI safety community believes.</p><p>To date, in our efforts to inform, motivate and coordinate with people: People in the AI Safety Community publicly lying has been one of <strong>the biggest direct obstacles we have encountered.</strong></p><p>The newest example of this is \u201dResponsible Scaling Policies\u201d, with many AI Safety people being much more vocal about their endorsement of RSPs than their private belief that in a saner world, all AGI progress should stop right now.</p><p>Because of them, we have been told many times that we are a minority voice, and that most people in the AI Safety community (understand, Open Philanthropy adjacent) disagree that we should stop all AGI progress right now.</p><p><strong>That actually, there is an acceptable way to continue scaling! And given that this makes things easier, if there is indeed an acceptable way to continue scaling, this is what we should do, rather than stop all AGI progress right now!</strong></p><p>Recently, Dario Amodei (Anthropic CEO), has used the RSP to frame the moratorium position as <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mcnWZBnbeDz7KKtjJ/rsps-are-pauses-done-right?commentId=WhxB66vEeRhh6kcsB\"><strong><u>the most extreme version of an extreme position</u></strong></a>, and this is the framing that we have seen used over and over again. ARC <a href=\"https://evals.alignment.org/blog/2023-09-26-rsp/\"><u>mirrors</u></a> this in their version of the RSP proposal, describing itself as a \u201cpragmatic middle ground\u201d between a moratorium and doing nothing.</p><p><strong>Obviously, all AGI Racers use this against us when we talk to people.</strong></p><p>There are very few people that we have consistently seen publicly call for a <strong>stop</strong> to AGI progress. The clearest ones are Eliezer\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/\"><u>Shut it All Down</u></a>\u201d and Nate\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/So8res/status/1715380167911067878\"><u>Fucking stop</u></a>\u201d.</p><p>The loudest silence is from Paul Christiano, whose RSPs are being used to safety-wash scaling.</p><p><strong>Proving me wrong is very easy. If you do believe that, in a saner world, we would stop all AGI progress right now, you can just write this publicly.</strong></p><p><strong>When called out on this, most people we talk to just fumble.</strong></p><h1>2. Lying for Personal Gain</h1><p>We talk to many people who publicly lie about their beliefs.</p><p>The justifications are always the same: \u201cit doesn\u2019t feel like lying\u201d, \u201cwe don\u2019t state things we do not believe\u201d, \u201cwe are playing an inside game, so we must be tactical in what we say to gain influence and power\u201d.</p><p><strong>Let me call this for what it is: lying for personal gain. </strong>If you state things whose main purpose is to get people to think you believe something else, and you do so to gain more influence and power: <strong>you are lying for personal gain.</strong></p><p>The results of this \u201cinfluence and power-grabbing\u201d has many times over materialised with the safety-washing of the AGI race. What a coincidence it is that DeepMind, OpenAI and Anthropic are all related to the AI Safety community.</p><p>The only benefit we see from this politicking is the people lying gain more influence, while the time we have left to AGI keeps getting shorter.</p><p><strong>Consider what happens when a community rewards the people who gain more influence by lying!</strong></p><p>\u2014</p><p>So many people lie, and they screw not only humanity, but one another.</p><p>Many AGI corp leaders will privately state that in a saner world, AGI progress should <strong>stop</strong>, but they will not state it because it would hurt their ability to race against each other!</p><p>Safety people will lie so that they can keep ties with labs in order to \u201cpressure them\u201d and seem reasonable to politicians.</p><p>Whatever: they just lie to gain more power.</p><p><strong>\u201cDO NOT LIE PUBLICLY ABOUT GRAVE MATTERS\u201d is a very strong baseline. If you want to defect, you need a much stronger reason than \u201cit will benefit my personal influence, and I promise I\u2019ll do good things with it\u201d.</strong><br><br>And you need to accept the blame when you\u2019re called out. You should not muddy the waters by justifying your lies, covering them, telling people they misunderstood, and try to maintain more influence within the community.</p><p>We have seen so many people be taken in this web of lies: from politicians and journalists, to engineers and intellectuals, all up until the concerned EA or regular citizen who wants to help, but is confused by our message when it looks like the AI safety community is ok with scaling.</p><p><strong>Your lies compound and make the world a worse place.</strong></p><p>There is an easy way to fix this situation: we can adopt the norm of publicly stating our true beliefs about grave matters.</p><p>If you know someone who claims to believe that in a saner world we should stop all AGI progress, <strong>tell them to publicly state their beliefs, unequivocally</strong>. Very often, you\u2019ll see them fumbling, caught in politicking. And not that rarely, you\u2019ll see that they actually want to keep racing. In these situations, you might want to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/conflict-vs-mistake\"><u>stop finding excuses for them</u></a>.</p><h1>3. The Spirit of Coordination</h1><p>A very sad thing that we have personally felt is that it looks like many people are <strong>so tangled in these politics that they do not understand what the point of honesty even is</strong>.</p><p>Indeed, from the inside, it is not obvious that honesty is a good choice. If you are honest, publicly honest, or even adversarially honest, you just make more opponents, you have less influence, and you can help less.</p><p>This is typical deontology vs consequentialism. Should you be honest, if from your point of view, it increases the chances of doom?</p><p>The answer is <strong>YES</strong>.</p><p><strong>a) Politicking has many more unintended consequences than expected.</strong></p><p>Whenever you lie, you shoot potential allies at random in the back.<br>Whenever you lie, you make it more acceptable for people around you to lie.</p><p><strong>b) Your behavior, especially if you are a leader, a funder or a major employee (first 10 employees, or responsible for &gt;10% of the headcount of the org), ripples down to everyone around you.</strong></p><p><strong>People lower in the respectability/authority/status ranks do defer to your behavior.</strong><br><strong>People outside of these ranks look at you.</strong><br>Our work toward stopping AGI progress becomes easier whenever a leader/investor/major employee at Open AI, DeepMind, Anthropic, ARC, Open Philanthropy, etc. states their beliefs about AGI progress more clearly.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>c) Honesty is Great.</strong></p><p>Existential Risks from AI are now going mainstream. Academics talk about it. Tech CEOs talk about it. You can now talk about it, not be a weirdo, and gain more allies. Polls show that even non-expert citizens <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/19/23879648/americans-artificial-general-intelligence-ai-policy-poll\"><u>express diverse opinions</u></a> about super intelligence.</p><p>Consider the following timeline:</p><ul><li>ARC &amp; Open Philanthropy state in a press release \u201c<strong>In a sane world, all AGI progress should stop. If we don\u2019t, there\u2019s more than a 10% chance we will all die.</strong>\u201d</li><li>People at AGI labs working in the safety teams echo this message publicly.</li><li>AGI labs leaders who think this state it publicly.</li><li>We start coordinating explicitly against orgs (and groups within orgs) that race.</li><li>We coordinate on a plan whose final publicly stated goal is to get to a world state that, most of us agree is not one where humanity\u2019s entire existence is at risk.</li><li>We publicly, relentlessly optimise for this plan, without compromising on our beliefs.</li></ul><p><strong>Whenever you lie for personal gain, you fuck up this timeline.</strong></p><p>When you start being publicly honest, you will suffer a <i>personal</i> hit in the short term.

They are not a comprehensive list of all the most impactful EAIF grants (and any such list would be pretty debatable and differ between fund managers). We chose to highlight grants from 2023 rather than 2022 because they are more representative of EAIF\u2019s current funding bar, and more generally of EAIF post-FTX.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5iz1q99q3u4\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5iz1q99q3u4\">[7]</a></sup></span>For a list of all EAIF grants, see our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/grants?fund=EA%2520Infrastructure%2520Fund&amp;sort=round\"><u>public grants database</u></a>.</p><h2>Grants investigated by Max Daniel</h2><p><strong>Abigail Olvera ($12,000):</strong><i> Project expenses for a book on scholarship strategies for low-income students that also includes a chapter on high-impact careers and pointers to EA-related resources such as 80,000 Hours.</i></p><ul><li>One strong feature of this application was that the applicant seemed like a great fit for this project: Abigail has been involved in the EA community for multiple years and is very familiar with EA ideas (including, e.g., from her current work on AI governance at Rethink Priorities); and she was a low-income student who then successfully secured scholarships to attend some of the world\u2019s top universities.</li><li>By the time of her application, the applicant had already demonstrated a lot of initiative and follow-through on this project \u2013 a first draft of the book was basically completed. (Though note that we don\u2019t generally require applicants to already have substantial completed outputs by the time of an application.)</li><li>While I don\u2019t know of data to back this up, my impression is that people from low-income backgrounds are underrepresented in the EA community, and I\u2019d also guess that EA-related content on average resonates less well with that audience, e.g., because many recommended actions such as donations or risky career moves are more accessible to people in a comfortable financial position. Put differently, introducing EA principles in a context that otherwise is attentive to challenges disproportionately faced by low-income students seems neglected to me, which made me more excited about funding this opportunity.</li><li>We had some concerns about overemphasizing or advertising EA opportunities in an unnatural way, given that the overall goal of the book is to help low-income students navigate college. We discussed them with the author, and our impression was that we were broadly on the same page on how to best navigate this. (We also approved the second half of this grant, which was for marketing expenses, only after we were able to review an edited draft in order to make sure that we\u2019re comfortable with promoting the relevant content.)</li></ul><p><strong>Zachary Thomas ($13,200):&nbsp;</strong><i>6-month career transition grant to enable an early-career professional with EA-related work experience to make a more informed decision on which of three career paths to pursue (research, policy, or entrepreneurship) and to prepare strong applications for their next step.</i></p><ul><li>The EAIF has made several similar grants aimed at facilitating an applicant\u2019s move to a higher-impact career, so I\u2019m mostly going to share my thoughts on this general type of grant.&nbsp;</li><li>Many people encounter situations where they could leverage a break of a couple of months between jobs to increase the long-term impact of their career by upskilling, networking, testing their fit for different career paths, or making a lateral move between different fields or industries (which can take a while, especially if it\u2019s a relatively uncommon move). Financial support that enables such career transitions continues to strike me as a potentially high-leverage grant opportunity.&nbsp;<ul><li>That said, I think there are some common pitfalls that people contemplating such plans may want to be aware of: Many people find it challenging to navigate professional situations with relatively little external accountability and structure, so if someone\u2019s plans involve these issues I\u2019d encourage people to consider how big a challenge this may present for them (e.g., by considering in which sorts of environments they have flourished vs. struggled in the past). I think it\u2019s also worth keeping in mind that learning on the job or in a more structured environment (e.g., a coding bootcamp) can be more efficient than independent upskilling with little management or mentorship.</li></ul></li><li>When evaluating such grants for the EAIF, I\u2019m most interested in understanding what cause areas and broad types of career an applicant intends to focus on, their thinking on these cause areas and career paths (because that\u2019s relevant to whether they\u2019d be able and motivated to identify and pursue high-impact opportunities within their fields in the future), how well they might do in the relevant careers, and what difference funding would make to their plans. Applicants need not have previous work experience in effective altruism, have a highly specific plan, or be at any particular career stage.</li><li>Depending on their situation, applicants interested in such grants might also be interested in applying to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future\"><u>Long-Term Future Fund</u></a> (also part of EA Funds) or Open Philanthropy\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/early-career-funding-for-individuals-interested-in-improving-the-long-term-future/\"><u>early-career funding program</u></a>.</li></ul><h2>Grants investigated by Max Daniel with significant input from assistant fund managers</h2><p><strong>Hear This Idea ($35,328):</strong>&nbsp;<i>One year of operations support and part-time stipend for Fin Moorhouse and Luca Righetti to continue producing episodes for&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://hearthisidea.com/episodes\"><i><u>Hear This Idea</u></i></a><i>, a podcast focused on new thinking in effective altruism. This includes funding for an \u201cmini-series\u201d on reducing existential risks from artificial intelligence and for operations assistance for the podcast\u2019s small media grants program&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://hearthisidea.com/grants/\"><i><u>Amplify</u></i></a><i>.</i></p><ul><li>Hear This Idea presents the work and motivations of nascent EA researchers in a fair amount of depth. In general, I\u2019m happy with the quality of the work produced for the podcast, and I think the podcasters\u2019 internal theory of change is reasonable. The podcast has a modest listenership that has grown steadily (and doubled) over the past year. The vast majority of the existing listener base does not currently work on EA topics full-time and around one third of the listeners are current students, which suggests that there is room for inducing career changes. Hear This Idea is focused on these routes to impact\u2014during the grant window, the podcasters plan to add more concrete calls to action, produce episodes that facilitate plan changes (e.g. episodes focused on skill-building), and create episode series that provide in-depth information on topics they find important, including artificial intelligence.</li><li>The operations support for the Amplify creative grants program is relatively low cost, and it seems likely to help give the 12 media projects supported by Amplify a higher chance of success.</li><li>The content and listenership of Hear This Idea both have substantial overlap with the 80,000 Hours podcast, which reduces the counterfactual impact of the podcast. However, I estimate that &gt;25% of listenership for Hear This Idea does not listen to the 80k podcast, and the in-depth mini-series on particular issues, continued growth, focus on path changes and skill-building, and additional high-quality EA content for people in and adjacent to the EA community all increase the likelihood that the podcast catalyzes valuable career changes.</li></ul><h2>Grants investigated by Michelle Hutchinson</h2><p><strong>Training for Good\u2019s EU Tech Policy Fellowship ($114,411):</strong><i> 8-month programme helping ambitious graduates to launch EU policy careers focused on emerging tech. The majority of the funding went to paying stipends to allow 8 graduates to do placements at EU think tanks, but it also included doing a retreat between all the fellows.&nbsp;</i></p><ul><li>The model of paying stipends to allow graduates to try out working in policy seems sensible to me given that both think tanks and graduates are typically constrained by funding. Training for Good had run a previous small iteration of the fellowship (5 participants), and the fellows they took in that cohort seemed impressive. By the time of applying for this funding, 3 of those 5 had permanent jobs in EU policy, providing some evidence of it as a programme for getting people to test their fit working in the area and allowing them to find jobs. References for the individuals and organisation as a whole were very positive and their plans and answers to questions were an impressive mixture of comprehensive, measured and thoughtful.&nbsp;</li><li>One worry we had was that EU policy was less impactful than US policy and that this would encourage people who could work in the US to work in the EU instead. Fund managers had different views about the strength of this concern. When we discussed it with Training for Good they were thinking carefully about how to mitigate that possible harm.</li></ul><h2>Grants Investigated by Tom Barnes&nbsp;</h2><p>The following were grants investigated by Tom Barnes, an assistant fund manager at EAIF. As an assistant fund manager, Tom conducted the primary investigations and wrote up notes for permanent fund managers, but he did not vote on the grants directly. Instead, the final grant decisions were made by other fund managers.</p><p><strong>Scholars for Society (Birmingham Chapter) ($10,000):&nbsp;</strong><i>Logistical costs for a single in-person educational event helping young people explore potential effective career paths.</i></p><p><i>What is this?</i></p><ul><li>Scholars for Society (SfS) is a student-led organization based in the US, raising interest in global problems. SfS Birmingham is a new branch, aimed at getting high school UK students engaged in EA-related topics&nbsp;</li><li>This grant covered the costs of running an event in Birmingham, where high school students met for an all-day conference discussing high-impact causes and career opportunities for young people.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><i>Why did we recommend it?</i></p><ul><li>We were impressed with the organizers\u2019 plans, motivation and background, and thus felt excited to empower them to run events like this</li><li>The event themselves sounded well thought through, with well targeted outreach and strong speakers</li><li>We received strong references from others who had supported them at other high school programs like LEAF and Non-Trivial</li><li>The amount of money requested was very low, relative to the potential upside. As such, we recommended a larger amount of funding than originally requested ($5,025), to help cover more costs of running the event.</li></ul><p><i>What were some uncertainties?</i></p><ul><li>Given the relative youth of the organizers, we believed there was a higher risk that the event wouldn't be a success, given less of a track record to rely upon. Similarly, Scholars for Society is a relatively new organization, and one we did not spend long evaluating, and thus there was some uncertainty about how effective they are.</li><li>We were unsure about how impactful the event itself would be, believing there to be a decent chance that the vast majority of attendees don\u2019t go onto more impactful careers.&nbsp;<ul><li>Nonetheless, we think the experience was sufficiently valuable for the organizers to be worthwhile</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Anonymous ($15,500):&nbsp;</strong><i>6-month salary to support transition from PhD to a more impactful career in biosecurity</i></p><p><i>What is this?</i></p><ul><li>A very promising individual working in biosecurity had an emergency funding shortfall, for which they required immediate financial support.</li></ul><p><i>Why did we recommend it?</i></p><ul><li>We received very strong references from all experts we reached out to in the biosecurity space, who were all keen to ensure they were supported, given the applicant\u2019s experience and potential in biosecurity.</li><li>References also believed a grant at this time for a career transition could be highly impactful, given the individual\u2019s personal circumstances.</li><li>We trusted the judgment of the references we reached out to, making us confident that this application was especially promising.</li></ul><p><i>What were some uncertainties?</i></p><ul><li>Given the time sensitive nature of the application, we were unable to develop a strong inside view of the individual, mostly deferring to experts in the field instead.&nbsp;</li><li>Career transitions can generally be highly heavy-tailed, with a relatively limited number of successes which&nbsp;<i>ex post</i> we would be glad to have made the grant (especially given funding constraints)<ul><li>Nonetheless, we think the evidence given by references was strong enough to overcome this skeptical prior.</li></ul></li></ul><p>An update on this grant is that the grantee was able to evaluate a number of opportunities (including completing 3 final-round work trials for biosecurity roles, and exploring local options in their underrepresented-in-EA geographical region), and have career conversations with multiple knowledgeable people in biosecurity. Ultimate, the grantee decided based on their experiences to go back and finish their PhD. They\u2019ve spent $10,000 on the grant and will return the remaining $5,500.</p><p><strong>The Life You Can Save ($21,800):</strong>&nbsp;<i>Print, pack and ship copies of The Life You Can Save for distribution by Booktopia in Australia</i></p><p><i>What is this?</i></p><ul><li>The Life You Can Save (TLYCS) Australia developed a partnership with Booktopia, the largest online book retailer in the country.</li><li>$21,800 allowed TLYCS to print and distribute for free an estimated ~4,000 additional books&nbsp; through Booktopia</li></ul><p><i>Why did we recommend it?</i></p><ul><li>We were impressed with TLYCS\u2019 track record in driving money to effective charities, on a relatively slim budget. For instance, in 2021 TLYCS <a href=\"https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/2021-annual-report/\">reported </a>~$23m moved on a total budget of $1.3m, giving a gross multiplier of 18.5x. We believe a decent fraction of these donations were counterfactual, giving a predicted gross multiplier of around ~16x</li><li>Thus, extrapolating TLYCS\u2019 track record, we estimated that ~$22k could move about $350k to TLYCS-recommended charities.</li></ul><p><i>What were some uncertainties?</i></p><ul><li>We were concerned about the cost-effectiveness of TLYCS-recommended charities. Charity evaluators like GiveWell would not consider above their bar for funding. Our best guess (with high uncertainty) was that the average cost-effectiveness of&nbsp; donations driven by TLYCS would be ~3-4x lower than to GiveWell.<ul><li>Nonetheless, we believed that the&nbsp;<i>quantity</i> of money moved to charities at this level of effectiveness was sufficiently high to justify making the grant. Specifically, multiplying donations to TLYCS charities by 16.5x would be&nbsp;<i>roughly</i> the same as multiplying donations to GiveWell charities by 4x.</li></ul></li><li>We were less sure about the counterfactual value of other TLYCS programs. In a sense, our model alone is a lower bound for the median guess of their impact, as TLYCS comes out ahead even when we conservatively estimated the counterfactual impact of their other work to be 0.</li></ul><p><i>What are some updates?</i><br>Due to some reflection and review after making the grant, some of us decided that our initial evaluation of counterfactuality was likely too optimistic. However, we still think the grant was worth making. Note that this reflection is due to a re-evaluation of existing evidence, <i><strong>not</strong></i> due to any new evidence that came in.</p><p><strong>Anonymous ($52,500):&nbsp;</strong><i>12-month stipend to support EAs via Effective Altruism Anywhere and professional development</i></p><p><i>What is this?</i></p><ul><li>The grantee had been involved in several EA Community Building projects, including support for CEA, organizing community building retreats, leading on aspects of EAGx Singapore 2022 &amp; EAGx Virtual 2022, and volunteering for EA Anywhere, running events in the Asia-Oceania timezone.</li><li>At the time of evaluating, EA Anywhere was reaching a large number of EAs (via 1:1s, events, Coworking, talks and more). Furthermore, they were seeing a large fraction of their members moving into impactful careers. However, they were capacity constrained, with just 1 FTE staff member supporting the community.</li><li>Thus, the grantee was keen to support EA Anywhere\u2019s growth and provide more capacity.</li></ul><p><i>Why did we recommend this grant?</i></p><ul><li>As mentioned, EA Anywhere has seen significant growth, providing a critical contact point for EAs who may not have a local EA group to rely upon. We were excited to see how EA Anywhere could build on the community it had developed, deepening engagements with existing members as well as recruiting new people to the community&nbsp;</li><li>We were impressed with the grantees' extensive experience in community building, through both virtual and in-person projects. Additionally we received positive testimonies about the events that the grantee helped to lead.</li><li>Given a more funding-constrained environment, we think projects such as EA Anywhere look more promising (relative to pre-FTX), since online groups cost much less to run, and these costs probably decrease faster than any lost benefit from not being in person.</li></ul><p><i>What were some uncertainties?</i></p><ul><li>We were uncertain about whether scaling support for EA Anywhere would be above the bar in the new funding environment, since we generally expect diminishing returns.&nbsp;<ul><li>[for context, this grant was made at a time when EAIF believed it would be highly funding constrained given the separation of Open Philanthropy and EA Funds]</li><li>I think there may be potential in the broad space of online/virtual community building in principle, and perhaps experimenting with new activities would be able to identify new, more cost-effective ones. But I'm unsure, and this makes me reluctant to commit 12 months of funding for EA Anywhere upfront, compared to shorter experiments.</li></ul></li><li>We were uncertain whether the grantee's time would be more impactful at EA Anywhere supported by EAIF or organizing events such as EAGx Virtual and EAGx Philippines with support from CEA. Thus, we reached an arraignment in which EAIF and CEA would separately cover expenses for the respective projects.</li></ul><p><strong>Causeway Charitable Foundation ($50,000):</strong> <i>6 months of funding to scale an robo-advisor app for charitable giving (an accessible entry point to effective giving)</i></p><p><i>What is this?</i></p><ul><li>Causeway was set up as a new online platform to increase the impact of employee giving (primarily targeting employees in tech companies in the US). They provided users with personalized \u201cportfolios\u201d, which give a combination of charities within a given cause area (such as GiveWell\u2019s recommendations in Global Health, Giving Green in Climate, and ACE in Animal Welfare).</li><li>Our January 2023 grant followed a previous $50k grant made to Causeway in mid-2022, which helped to launch the organization.</li></ul><p><i>Why did we recommend this grant?</i></p><ul><li>We were excited by Causeway\u2019s two founders - Ben Horwitz and Reed Rosenbluth - who many people we spoke to had highly positive opinions of.</li><li>We are excited to see that Causeway was recently&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/about-us/press-room/charity-navigator-aquires-causeway/\"><u>acquired</u></a> by Charity Navigator, hiring Ben as a Vice President. We hope this offers an opportunity to integrate ideas around effective giving into Charity Navigator\u2019s evaluation process.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><i>What are some uncertainties?</i></p><ul><li>We were unsure about how fast Causeway would be able to grow. Causeway had ambitions to grow very rapidly, which we were unsure would be feasible given the reference class of similar organizations like <a href=\"https://www.tyve.org/\">Tyve</a>.</li><li>We were unsure about the cost-effectiveness of donations that Causeway would be able to generate. We estimated that donations to charities in Causeway\u2019s portfolios would be (on average) about as cost-effective as GiveDirectly, with some above and some below. As such, we expected that in order for this grant to be a success, we needed to see a large amount of money moved for each dollar provided.</li></ul><h2>Other grants we made during this period</h2><p>You can see a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/grants?fund=EA%2520Infrastructure%2520Fund&amp;sort=round\"><u>list of all of our public grants here</u></a>.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fncaode9oslhl\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefcaode9oslhl\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>These applications were quickly rejected without substantive evaluation because they were out of EAIF\u2019s scope or clearly below the funding bar.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnk5w7xg41s9\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefk5w7xg41s9\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The EA Infrastructure Fund is part of EA Funds, which is a fiscally sponsored project of Effective Ventures Foundation (UK) (\u201cEV UK\u201d) and Effective Ventures Foundation USA Inc.

Most people I talk to are excited about RSPs, but there is also some uncertainty and pushback about how they relate to regulation. In this post I\u2019ll explain my views on that:</p><ul><li>I think that sufficiently good responsible scaling policies could dramatically reduce risk, and that preliminary policies like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www-files.anthropic.com/production/files/responsible-scaling-policy-1.0.pdf\"><u>Anthropic\u2019s RSP</u></a> meaningfully reduce risk by creating urgency around key protective measures and increasing the probability of a pause if those measures can\u2019t be implemented quickly enough.</li><li>I don\u2019t think voluntary implementation of responsible scaling policies is a substitute for regulation. Voluntary commitments are unlikely to be universally adopted or to have adequate oversight, and I think the public should demand a higher degree of safety than AI developers are likely to voluntarily implement.</li><li>I think that developers implementing responsible scaling policies now increases the probability of effective regulation. If I instead thought it would make regulation harder, I would have significant reservations.</li><li>Transparency about RSPs makes it easier for outside stakeholders to understand whether an AI developer\u2019s policies are adequate to manage risk, and creates a focal point for debate and for pressure to improve.</li><li>I think the risk from rapid AI development is very large, and that even very good RSPs would not completely eliminate that risk. A durable, global, effectively enforced, and hardware-inclusive pause on frontier AI development would reduce risk further. I think this would be politically and practically challenging and would have major costs, so I don\u2019t want it to be the only option on the table. I think implementing RSPs can get most of the benefit, is desirable according to a broader set of perspectives and beliefs, and helps facilitate other effective regulation.</li></ul><h2>Why I\u2019m excited about RSPs</h2><p>I think AI developers are not prepared to work with very powerful AI systems. They don\u2019t have the scientific understanding to deploy superhuman AI systems without considerable risk, and they do not have the security or internal controls to even safely train such models.</p><p>If protective measures didn\u2019t improve then I think the question would be&nbsp;<i>when</i> rather than&nbsp;<i>if&nbsp;</i>development should be paused. I think the safest action in an ideal world would be pausing immediately until we were better prepared (though see the caveats in the next section). But the current level of risk is low enough that I think it is defensible for companies or countries to continue AI development&nbsp;<strong>if they have a sufficiently good plan for detecting and reacting to increasing risk</strong>.</p><p>If AI developers make these policies concrete and state them publicly, then I believe it puts the public and policymakers in a better place to understand what those policies are and to debate whether they are adequate. And I think the case for companies taking this action is quite strong\u2014AI systems may continue to improve quickly, and a vague promise to improve safety at some unspecified future time isn\u2019t enough.</p><p>I think that a good RSP will lay out specific conditions under which further development would need to be paused. Even though the goal is to avoid ever ending up in that situation, I think it\u2019s important for developers to take the possibility seriously, to plan for it, and to be transparent about it with stakeholders.</p><h2>Thoughts on an AI pause</h2><p>If the world were unified around the priority of minimizing global catastrophic risk, I think that we could reduce risk significantly further by implementing a global, long-lasting, and effectively enforced pause on frontier AI development\u2014including a moratorium on the development and production of some types of computing hardware. The world is not unified around this goal; this policy would come with other significant costs and currently seems unlikely to be implemented without much clearer evidence of serious risk.&nbsp;</p><p>A unilateral pause on large AI training runs in the West, without a pause on new computing hardware, would have more ambiguous impacts on global catastrophic risk. The primary negative effects on risk are leading to faster catch-up growth in a later period with more hardware and driving AI development into laxer jurisdictions.</p><p>However, if governments shared my perspective on risk then I think they should already be implementing domestic policies that will often lead to temporary pauses or slowdowns in practice. For example, they might require frontier AI developers to implement additional protective measures before training larger models than those that exist today, and some of those protective measures may take a fairly long time (such as major improvements in risk evaluations or information security). Or governments might aim to limit the rate at which effective training compute of frontier models grows, in order to provide a smoother ramp for society to adapt to AI and to limit the risk of surprises.</p><h2>I expect RSPs to help facilitate effective regulation</h2><p>Regardless of whether risk mitigation takes the form of responsible scaling policies or something else, I think voluntary action by companies isn\u2019t enough. If the risk is large then the most realistic approach is regulation and eventually international coordination. In reality I think the expected risk is large enough (including some risk of a catastrophe surprisingly soon) that a sufficiently competent state would implement regulation immediately.</p><p>I believe that AI developers implementing RSPs will make it easier rather than harder to implement effective regulation. RSPs provide a clear path to iteratively improving policy; they provide information about existing practices that can inform or justify regulation; and they build momentum around and legitimize the idea that serious precautions can be necessary for safe development. They are also a step towards building out the procedures and experience that would be needed to make many forms of regulation effective.</p><p>I\u2019m not an expert in this area, and my own decisions are mostly guided by a desire to offer my honest assessments of the effects of different policies. That said, my impression from interacting with people who have more policy expertise is that they broadly agree that RSPs are likely to help rather than hurt efforts to implement effective regulation. I have mostly seen voluntary RSPs discussed, and have advocated for them, in contexts where it appears the most likely alternative is less rather than more action.</p><h2>Anthropic\u2019s RSP</h2><p>I believe that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www-files.anthropic.com/production/files/responsible-scaling-policy-1.0.pdf\"><u>Anthropic\u2019s RSP</u></a> is a significant step in the right direction. I would like to see pressure on other developers to implement policies that are at least this good, though I think there is a long way to go from there to an ideal RSP.</p><p>Some components I found particularly valuable:</p><ul><li>Specifying a concrete set of evaluation results that would cause them to move to ASL-3. I think having concrete thresholds by which concrete actions must be taken is important, and I think the proposed threshold is early enough to trigger before an irreversible catastrophe with high probability (well over 90%).</li><li>Making a concrete statement about security goals at ASL-3\u2014\u201cnon-state actors are unlikely to be able to steal model weights, and advanced threat actors (e.g. states) cannot steal them without significant expense\u201d\u2014and describing security measures they expect to take to meet this goal.</li><li>Requiring a definition and evaluation protocol for ASL-4 to be published and approved by the board before scaling past ASL-3.</li><li>Providing preliminary guidance about conditions that would trigger ASL-4 and the necessary protective measures to operate at ASL-4 (including security against motivated states, which I expect to be extremely difficult to achieve, and an affirmative case for safety that will require novel science).</li></ul><p>Some components I hope will improve over time:</p><ul><li>The flip side of specifying concrete evaluations right now is that they are extremely rough and preliminary. I think it is worth working towards better evaluations with a clearer relationship to risk.</li><li>In order for external stakeholders to have confidence in Anthropic\u2019s security I think it will take more work to lay out appropriate audits and red teaming. To my knowledge this work has not been done by anyone and will take time.&nbsp;</li><li>The process for approving changes to the RSP is publication and approval by the board. I think this ensures a decision will be made deliberately and is much better than nothing, but it would be better to have effective independent oversight.</li><li>To the extent that it\u2019s possible to provide more clarity about ASL-4, doing so would be a major improvement by giving people a chance to examine and debate conditions for that level. To the extent that it\u2019s not, it would be desirable to provide more concreteness about a review or decision-making process for deciding whether a given set of safety, security, and evaluation measures is adequate.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>I\u2019m excited to see criticism of RSPs that focuses on concrete ways in which they fail to manage risk. Such criticism can help (i) push AI developers to do better, and (ii) argue to policy makers that we need regulatory requirements stronger than existing RSPs. That said, I think it is significantly better to have an RSP than to not have one, and don\u2019t think that point should be lost in the discussion.</p><h2>On the name \u201cresponsible scaling\u201d</h2><p>I believe that a very good RSP (of the kind I've been advocating for) could cut risk dramatically if implemented effectively, perhaps a 10x reduction. In particular, I think we will&nbsp;<i>probably</i> have stronger signs of dangerous capabilities before something catastrophic happens, and that realistic requirements for protective measures can&nbsp;<i>probably</i> lead to us either managing that risk or pausing when our protective measures are more clearly inadequate. This is a big enough risk reduction that my primary concern is about whether developers will actually adopt good RSPs and implement them effectively.</p><p>That said, I believe that even cutting risk by 10x still leaves us with a lot of risk; I think it\u2019s reasonable to complain that private companies causing a 1% risk of extinction is not \u201cresponsible.\u201d I also think the basic idea of RSPs should be appealing to people with a variety of views about risk, and a more pessimistic person might think that even if all developers implement very good RSPs there is still a 10%+ risk of a global catastrophe.</p><p>On the one hand, I think it\u2019s good for AI developers to make and defend the explicit claim that they are developing the technology in a responsible way, and to be vulnerable to pushback when they can\u2019t defend that claim.

In particular, the subsection \u201cOnly the relative good futures contain option value\u201d:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>For any future scenario to contain option value, the agents in that future need to surpass us in various ways, as outlined above. This has an implication that further diminishes the relevance of the option value argument. Future agents need to have relatively good values and be relatively non-selfishness to decide not to colonize space for moral reasons. But even if these agents colonized space, they would probably do it in a <i>relatively</i> good manner. Most expected future disvalue <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/cause-prioritization-downside-focused-value-systems/\">plausibly</a> comes from futures controlled by indifferent or malicious agents (like misaligned AI). Such \u201cbad\u201d agents will make worse decisions about whether or not to colonize space than we, currently, could, because their preferences are very different from our (reflected) preferences. Potential space colonization by indifferent or malicious agents thus generates large amounts of expected future disvalue, which cannot be alleviated by option value. Option value doesn\u2019t help in the cases where it is most needed (see footnote for an explanatory example)<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NfkEqssr7qDazTquW/the-expected-value-of-extinction-risk-reduction-is-positive#fn-etWnZrHweFuXyhsQH-45\"><sup>[45]</sup></a></p></blockquote><h1><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/225Aq4P4jFPoWBrb5/cause-prioritization-for-downside-focused-value-systems\"><u>Cause prioritization for downside-focused value systems</u></a> by Lukas Gloor</h1><blockquote><p>Some people have argued that even (very) small credences in upside-focused views, such as 1-20% for instance, would&nbsp;in itself already speak in favor of making extinction risk reduction a top priority because making sure there will still be decision-makers in the future provides high <i>option value</i>. I think this gives by far too much weight to the argument from option value. Option value does play a role, but not nearly as strong a role as it is sometimes made out to be. To elaborate, let\u2019s look at the argument in more detail: The naive argument from option value says, roughly, that our descendants will be in a much better position to decide than we are, and if suffering-focused ethics or some other downside-focused view is indeed the outcome of their moral deliberations, they can then decide to not colonize space, or only do so in an extremely careful and controlled way. If this picture is correct, there is almost nothing to lose and a lot to gain from making sure that our descendants get to decide how to proceed.&nbsp;</p><p>I think this argument to a large extent misses the point,&nbsp;but seeing that even some well-informed effective altruists seem to believe that it is very strong led me realize that I should write a post explaining the landscape of cause prioritization for downside-focused value systems. The problem with the naive argument from option value is that the decision algorithm that is implicitly being recommended in the argument, namely focusing on extinction risk reduction and leaving moral philosophy (and s-risk reduction in case the outcome is a downside-focused morality) to future generations, makes sure that people follow the implications of downside-focused morality&nbsp;in precisely the one instance where it is least needed, and never otherwise. If the future is going to be controlled by philosophically sophisticated altruists who are also modest and willing to change course given new insights, then most bad futures <i>will already have been averted in that scenario</i>. An outcome where we get long and careful reflection without downsides is far from the only possible outcome. In fact, it does not even seem to me to be the most <i>likely</i> outcome (although others may disagree). No one is most worried about a scenario where epistemically careful thinkers with their heart in the right place control the future; the discussion is instead about whether the probability that things will accidentally go off the rails warrants extra-careful attention. (And it is not as though it looks like we are particularly <i>on</i> the rails currently either.) Reducing non-AI extinction risk does not preserve much option value for downside-focused value systems because most of the expected future suffering probably comes not from scenarios where people deliberately implement a solution they think is best after years of careful reflection, but instead from cases where things unexpectedly pass a point of no return and compassionate forces do not get to have control over the future. Downside risks by action likely loom larger than downside risks by omission, and we are plausibly in a better position to reduce the most pressing downside risks now than later. (In part because \u201clater\u201d may be too late.)&nbsp;</p><p>This suggests that if one is uncertain between upside- and downside-focused views, as opposed to being uncertain between all kinds of things <i>except</i> downside-focused views, the argument from option value is much weaker than it is often made out to be. Having said that, non-naively, option value still does upshift the importance of reducing extinction risks quite a bit<i>&nbsp;\u2013 </i>just not by an overwhelming degree. In particular, arguments for the importance of option value that do carry force are for instance:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>There is still <i>some</i> downside risk to reduce after long reflection</li><li>Our descendants will know more about the world, and crucial considerations in e.g. infinite ethics or anthropics could change the way we think about downside risks (in that we might for instance realize that downside risks by omission loom larger than we thought)</li><li>One\u2019s adoption of (e.g.) upside-focused views after long reflection may correlate favorably with the expected amount of value or disvalue in the future (meaning: conditional on many people eventually adopting upside-focused views, the future is more valuable according to upside-focused views than it appears during an earlier state of uncertainty)</li></ul><p>The discussion about the benefits from option value is interesting and important, and&nbsp;a lot more could be said on both sides. I think it is safe to say that the&nbsp;non-naive case for option value is&nbsp;not strong enough to make extinction risk reduction a top priority given only small credences in upside-focused views, but it does start to become&nbsp;a highly relevant&nbsp;consideration once the credences become reasonably large. Having said that, one can also make a case that improving the <i>quality</i> of the future (more happiness/value and less suffering/disvalue) conditional on humanity not going extinct is probably going to be at least as important for upside-focused views <i>and</i> is more robust under&nbsp;population ethical uncertainty \u2013 which speaks particularly in favor of highly prioritizing existential risk reduction through AI policy and AI alignment.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><h1><a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/beginners-guide-to-reducing-s-risks/\"><u>Beginner\u2019s guide to reducing s-risks</u></a> by Anthony DiGiovanni</h1><blockquote><p>It has been argued that, under moral uncertainty, the most robustly positive approach to improving the long-term future is to preserve <i>option value</i> for humans and our descendants, and this entails prioritizing reducing risks of human extinction (MacAskill). That is, suppose we refrain from optimizing for the best action under our current moral views (which might be s-risk reduction), in order to increase the chance that humans survive to engage in extensive moral reflection.<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/beginners-guide-to-reducing-s-risks/#link_ajs-fn-id_9-8931\"><sup>9</sup></a> The claim is that the downside of temporarily taking this suboptimal action, by the lights of our current best guess, is outweighed by the potential upside of discovering and acting upon other moral priorities that we would otherwise neglect.</p><p>One counterargument is that futures with s-risks, not just those where humans go extinct, tend to be futures where typical human values have lost control over the future, so the option value argument does not privilege extinction risk reduction. First, if intelligent beings from Earth initiate space settlement before a sufficiently elaborate process of collective moral reflection, the astronomical distances between the resulting civilizations could severely reduce their capacity to coordinate on s-risk reduction (or <i>any</i> moral priority) (MacAskill 2022, Ch. 4<i>; </i>Gloor 2018). Second, if AI agents permanently disempower humans, they may cause s-risks as well. To the extent that averting s-risks is more tractable than ensuring AIs do not want to disempower humans at all (see <a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/beginners-guide-to-reducing-s-risks/#222_Empirical_considerations_practical_reasons_to_prioritize_severe_suffering\">next section</a>), or one has a comparative advantage in s-risk reduction, option value does not necessarily favor working on extinction risks from AI.</p></blockquote><h1>Acknowledgments</h1><p>Thanks to David Althaus and Lukas Gloor for comments and discussion.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn5o2cvwuwhah\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref5o2cvwuwhah\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I personally don\u2019t expect (post-)humans will carefully reflect and coordinate to do the best thing even in futures that go fairly well, but that\u2019s more open to discussion.

This prompts the question: as prediction horizons lengthen, how does uncertainty around these predictions increase? And what does this uncertainty imply for our all-things-considered beliefs about the relative impact of short and long-run interventions?&nbsp;</p><p>To address this, I employ data from various development economics randomized controlled trials (RCTs), making statistical predictions of impacts over time spans ranging from 1 to 20 years. I use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w26463\"><u>surrogate index method</u></a> to make predictions and the dataset of the predictions comes from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/estimating-long-term-treatment-effects-without-long-term-outcome-data-david-rhys-bernard-jojo-lee-and-victor-yaneng-wang/\"><u>an associated paper</u></a> (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hBLuH63e65N23T3Bz/estimating-long-term-treatment-effects-without-long-term\"><u>EA Forum post</u></a>) co-authored with Jojo Lee and Victor Wang. I compare these predictions to the observed impacts from the RCTs outcomes to measure forecast error.&nbsp;</p><p>I correct the predictions to remove bias and then use the corrected estimates of forecast error to assess how uncertainty increases over time using graphs and meta-analysis. I show that over the 20 years in my data, forecast noise increases fairly gradually. Furthermore, the relationship between noise and time horizon is roughly linear, although the power of the data to detect non-linearities is limited.</p><p>To assess how this increase in forecast noise might affect our relative valuation of interventions with short and long-run impacts, I then use these empirical estimates to estimate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/z2DkdXgPitqf98AvY/formalising-the-washing-out-hypothesis\"><u>a Bayesian updating model</u></a> introduced by Duncan Webb.&nbsp;</p><p>To build intuition for how the model works, imagine we produce an estimate of the expected value of some intervention using a quantitative method, like the surrogate index or an informal back of the envelope calculation (BOTEC). Call this estimate a&nbsp;<i>signal</i>. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\"><u>this classic post</u></a>, Holden Karnofsky argues that we should not take signals of this type literally. Instead, we should combine the signal with a&nbsp;<i>prior&nbsp;</i>distribution, our beliefs before we saw the signal. Once we combine our prior with the signal, we get a&nbsp;<i>posterior</i> distribution of the impact of an action. Importantly, our posterior distribution depends on how noisy the signal is. The noisier the signal, the closer the expected value of our posterior distribution remains to our prior. For example, we would probably think a BOTEC done in 2 minutes produces a much noisier signal than a well-executed RCT and so, if both produced the same signal, but with different levels of precision, the RCT would shift the expected value of our posterior further away from the prior.</p><p>Now imagine our quantitative method produces two signals; one for the short-run value of the intervention (say, the effect after 1 year) and one for the long-run (say, the effect after 50 years). It seems reasonable to assume that the 1-year signal will be more precise than the 50-year signal. If we modeled the impact of a cash transfer from GiveDirectly, we\u2019d be fairly confident in the precision of the signal for the effect on outcomes like consumption and savings after 1 year. However, the signal for the effect after 50 years would be much less precise: we\u2019d have to assess whether the cash transfer is likely to kickstart a persistent growth in income, look at multigenerational effects, consider how the economy as a whole would be affected, and so on. In other words, the variance or the noise of this 50-year signal would be much greater than the variance of the 1-year signal. As such, we would put less weight on the 50-year signal than the 1-year signal when forming our posteriors for the short- and long-run values of the intervention.</p><p>Webb formalizes and extends this idea in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/z2DkdXgPitqf98AvY/formalising-the-washing-out-hypothesis\"><u>an economic model of Bayesian updating</u></a>. In Webb\u2019s model we receive unbiased signals of the expected value of an intervention at each time period&nbsp;t in the future (e.g., the signals come from a BOTEC or some other quantitative method). Importantly, the noise on these signals increases as the time horizon increases and we look further into the future. This captures the intuition from above, that uncertainty increases with time horizon. What matters in the model is the rate at which the noise on the signals increases. If the noise increases sufficiently fast, then the posterior expected value of the long-term effects of an intervention may be smaller than the posterior expected value of the short-run effects of that intervention, even if the long-term expected value signals are far greater than the short-run signals.</p><p>I use data on statistical forecasts of the long-run results of RCTs to empirically estimate this model of Bayesian updating (explained in more detail below). As mentioned above, I find a gradual increase in signal/forecast noise. Despite this gradual increase, if we extrapolate forward linearly, the posterior expected value of the long-run effects of an intervention shrinks significantly towards the expected value of the prior, which I assume to be 0. With my preferred, best-case estimates, the posterior expected value is 10% of the signal expected value after 1,600 years. After 18,000 years, the posterior expected value is 1% of the signal expected value. In other words, if we received a signal that an intervention produced 100 utils each year, then our posterior expected value would be 10 utils after 1,600 years, and only 1 util after 18,000 years.</p><p>I explore a number of different cases as robustness checks and show how allowing for non-linearities in the relationship between forecast error and horizon can result in a very wide range of results. I note that all the results are dependent on the strong theoretical and empirical assumptions I make regarding the structure of the prior and the signal, and extrapolation across time. Relaxing these assumptions may significantly change the relationship between the signal and the posterior expected value. Similarly, using different data sources may also change these relationships significantly in either direction. I discuss these limitations further at the end.</p><p>This report has implications for how we interpret the results of quantitative models such as Rethink Priorities\u2019 forthcoming Cross-Cause Cost-Effectiveness Model (CCM). We should think like Bayesians when we interpret the results or signals of such models. When the signals are about short-term value and we think the signals are relatively precise, they should play a relatively large role in forming our posterior distribution or our all-things-considered view. On the other hand, some of the signals about long-term value depend on projections up to several billion years into the future. They are much less precise as they depend on many parameters about which we might be deeply uncertain. As a result, when we integrate these signals into our all-things-considered view, we should place less weight on them relative to the more precise short-run effects. Within the CCM, we can quantify the uncertainty of estimates due to parameter uncertainty, but, as with most models, we\u2019re unable to quantify model uncertainty\u2014the concern that we are using the wrong model\u2014and this model uncertainty might be the dominant source of our uncertainty, especially for more speculative long-run value estimates.&nbsp;</p><p>In the rest of the report, I go into the theory behind Bayesian updating with increasing uncertainty over time. I then describe the data I use, how to estimate forecast noise and how to estimate the relationship between time horizon and forecast noise while dealing with potential confounding. I show how forecast noise changes over time horizon in my dataset and use this to estimate how much the signal expected value should be adjusted to end up with a Bayesian posterior expected value. I explore a number of different cases and conclude by discussing the limitations of this approach and potential improvements in future work.</p><h1>Theory</h1><p>In this section I first explain the key parts of a model of Bayesian updating with noisy signals from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/z2DkdXgPitqf98AvY/formalising-the-washing-out-hypothesis\"><u>Webb (2021)</u></a> that justifies putting less weight on noisier expected value signals.&nbsp;</p><h2>Model</h2><p>An agent uses a quantitative method to predict the benefit of an intervention for each future time period.

(2023)</u></a> which tests a statistical method, the surrogate index, for forecasting the 1 to 20 year results of RCTs in development economics. This method does not produce Tetlockian subjective judgemental forecasts that readers may be more familiar with. Instead it produces statistical forecasts; the output from a purely statistical model which doesn\u2019t depend on priors. This means the forecasts from the surrogate index method dovetail nicely with the definition of signals in the Bayesian updating model described above. We know the actual results of the RCTs so we can evaluate the forecasts, which means we can empirically estimate the rate at which signal noise increases and therefore estimate the Bayesian updating model.</p><p>The surrogate index method was developed by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w26463\"><u>Athey et al. (2019)</u></a> to predict long-term treatment effects. The method combines two datasets (1) a short-term RCT where we observe short-term outcomes but don\u2019t observe the long-term outcomes, and (2) an observational dataset where we observe the long-term outcomes as well as the same set of short-term outcomes, but for a different sample of individuals. Here\u2019s a simplified breakdown of how the method works:<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3usea1t40a3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3usea1t40a3\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><ol><li>We use the observational dataset to train a predictive model. This model predicts the long-term outcomes from the short-term outcomes.</li><li>We use the predictive model, trained in the previous step, to predict the long-term outcomes in the short-term RCT.</li><li>We take the difference between the forecasted long-term outcomes in the treatment and control groups in the RCT, to estimate the long-term treatment effect.</li></ol><p>In Bernard et al. (2023), we conducted an empirical analysis of the performance of the surrogate index method using real-world long-run RCTs spanning 5 to 20 years. Here's our approach:</p><ol><li>Estimation of true long-run effect: We started by estimating the true long-run treatment effect using long-run data directly from these RCTs.</li><li>Implementation of surrogate index: Next, instead of using the long-run data, we applied the surrogate index method to predict the long-run treatment effect indirectly. We did this using various short-run outcomes observed at different times. This leads to multiple predictions of each long-run treatment effect, each with different time horizons.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhmn1v9t35hj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhmn1v9t35hj\">[3]</a></sup></span></li><li>Calculation of Forecast Error: We then compared the direct long-run treatment effect estimate from the RCTs to our predictions from the surrogate index method. The differences between these estimates gave us the forecast error for the surrogate index approach.</li></ol><p>In this post, I use the data from 8 different RCTs to estimate the relationship between time horizon and forecast noise. A summary of the RCTs is presented in table 1.

Arms is the number of treatment arms and includes both treatment and control group arms.&nbsp;</p><p>We look at the treatment effects for as many of the treatments and outcomes included in the relevant paper for each RCT. Although these outcomes may be in different units (e.g. income in dollars and weight in kilograms) we make the treatment effects comparable by (1) converting them into effect size units by dividing by the control group standard deviation and (2) flipping the signs so a positive treatment effect is always socially beneficial.</p><h1>Methodology</h1><p>In this section I explain how we can measure noise from our surrogate index forecast data (recall that the surrogate index forecasts are equivalent to signals in the theoretical model described above). I then explain how I use the forecast data to measure the relationship between forecast precision and time horizon. In particular, I show how to better deal with potential confounding of the relationship between time horizon and forecast precision.</p><h2>Measuring forecast noise</h2><p>We need to measure how the noise of forecasts changes with forecast time horizon (i.e. the function&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\sigma^2_\\varepsilon=f(t)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.001em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.001em;\">\u03c3</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-stack\" style=\"vertical-align: -0.164em;\"><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; padding-bottom: 0.255em; padding-left: 0.073em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">\u03b5</span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.06em;\">f</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">t</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>).

In the inflation context, this means that if half of the forecasts are overestimates of the inflation rate, the other half need to be equally-sized underestimates, to produce a set of unbiased forecasts.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg8ioujhxapp\"><sup><a href=\"#fng8ioujhxapp\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In our theoretical model, this would mean that the signals are on average neither overestimating or underestimating the benefit of the intervention.</p><p>Unbiasedness:&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"E(\\sigma^2)= \\sigma\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.026em;\">E</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.001em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.001em;\">\u03c3</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sup\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: 0.513em; padding-left: 0.073em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.001em;\">\u03c3</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p>For MSE, if the average error of forecasts (on outcomes with a common unit) is 0 then the bias component is 0 and we can use MSE as a measure of forecast noise. If we know a set of forecasts has a systematic bias, meaning they consistently overestimate or underestimate the true outcomes, we can correct for this bias by adjusting each forecasted value accordingly. To produce unbiased forecasts, we simply need to subtract the known bias from each forecasted value. By doing this, the average error between the forecasts and the true outcomes is reduced to zero, effectively removing the bias. See a proof of this in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13bx8P4rUwwCQtr9XvcJQs9RFm7NBgrh1D2yMhA7R8vk/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>appendix</u></a>.</p><p>We can then compute the MSE of the corrected forecasts which will then correspond to the variance, since the bias of these forecasts is zero. For instance, if forecasts of inflation are on average 1 percentage point higher than the true level of inflation, then we can debias the forecasts of inflation by subtracting 1 percentage point from all of them, and compute the MSE of these corrected forecasts. Then the MSE of these bias-corrected forecasts is a measure of forecast noise or variance.</p><h2>Estimating forecast horizon and noise relationship</h2><p>Previous studies have looked at the relationship between forecast accuracy and forecast horizon (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hqkyaHLQhzuREcXSX/data-on-forecasting-accuracy-across-different-time-horizons\"><u>Dillon, 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MquvZCGWyYinsN49c/range-and-forecasting-accuracy\"><u>Niplav, 2022</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RjNFyJS3jPb4DA7wA/how-accurate-are-open-phil-s-predictions\"><u>Prieto, 2022</u></a>). An often-noted difficulty in this analysis is forecast difficulty being a confounding variable. If the selected long-range questions are \u2018easier\u2019 then if we observe no relationship between accuracy and horizon, this could be explained by the difference in easiness across different horizons, rather than there being no relationship between horizon and accuracy.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefaomrkhum5om\"><sup><a href=\"#fnaomrkhum5om\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RjNFyJS3jPb4DA7wA/how-accurate-are-open-phil-s-predictions\"><u>Prieto (2022)</u></a> writes:</p><blockquote><p>One possible explanation is question selection. Grant investigators may be less willing to produce long-range forecasts about things that are particularly hard to predict because the inherent uncertainty looks insurmountable. This may not be the case for short-range forecasts, since for these most of the information is already available. In other words, we might be choosing which specific things to forecast based on how difficult we think they are to forecast regardless of their time horizon, which could explain why our accuracy doesn\u2019t vary much by time horizon.</p></blockquote><p>One way to deal with this issue is to&nbsp;<i>control</i> for the difficulty of questions. However, sadly it\u2019s not the case that forecast questions come naturally to us with some metric of how difficult they are. As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hqkyaHLQhzuREcXSX/data-on-forecasting-accuracy-across-different-time-horizons\"><u>Dillon (2021)</u></a> says:</p><blockquote><p>Attempting to control for the difficulty of questions seems particularly useful. In practice, the difficulty of a question is not easily established before the fact, but making sets of questions that are on common topics or otherwise similar might be a good starting point here.</p></blockquote><p>Given that we don\u2019t observe forecast difficulty and therefore can\u2019t explicitly control for it, what can we do? Instead of comparing forecasts with different ranges across different questions with different ranges, we can instead look at accuracy within questions, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MquvZCGWyYinsN49c/range-and-forecasting-accuracy\"><u>Niplav (2022)</u></a> does in their final section. More formally, we can do this by including \u2018question&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_effects_model\"><u>fixed effects</u></a>\u2019 when we analyze the relationship between accuracy and horizon. This ensures that we compare&nbsp;<i>within each question</i> how much accuracy changes when the horizon is short versus long.</p><p>As an example, in our surrogacy data this would be: how much less accurate are we when we use 2 years of data to predict the 10 year effect of deworming on income (an 8 year forecast horizon), versus when we use 6 years of data to predict the 10 year effect (a 4 year forecast horizon). By including a question fixed effect, we ensure that features that vary across questions such as question difficulty, are controlled for and do not confound the estimated relationship between forecast horizon and accuracy.</p><p>This however requires more from our data. We now need to have multiple forecasts made at different times for each question. If we only had one forecast per question, then there would not be any within-question variation of forecast horizon, which is necessary to identify the relationship between horizon and accuracy when using fixed effects. The data we use has this feature, but other datasets with which you might want to run this analysis do not (discussed in more detail in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V5HbUl1ilE-NcQGbmsWJ4IRn26IMhHw_3lMFZFZyDZ4/edit#heading=h.xm79rix1511y\"><u>Limitations - Data</u></a> below). If you were to do this sort of analysis with such other datasets, you would likely better identify the unconfounded relationship between forecast horizon and accuracy by including forecaster and/or topic fixed effects (to ensure your comparisons are within forecaster and topic respectively).</p><h1>Results</h1><h2>Debiased errors</h2><p>First we have to remove the bias from the forecasts so that the corrected forecasts are unbiased and therefore the MSE of the corrected forecasts is equivalent to the variance or forecast noise. To do this, we estimate the mean forecast error, the average difference between the forecasted treatment effect and the actual treatment effect. As the two treatment effects are themselves estimates with noise, the error of each forecast also has some noise. We therefore use a meta-analysis to estimate the mean error by giving more weight to more precisely estimated errors and to account for the correlation between error estimates within the same study.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp7p7remw4w\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp7p7remw4w\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This gives us a mean error of -0.047 as shown in Table 2. In other words, on average the surrogate index approach underestimates the benefits of treatment by 0.047 standard deviations.</p><p>Table 2: Average error from meta-analysis</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Mean</th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Standard error</th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Standard deviation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Error</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">-0.047</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">0.027</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">0.133</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>We therefore correct the surrogate index forecasts by adding 0.047 to all of them and this ensures that the bias of the full set of bias-corrected forecasts is now 0.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk7h06y0d25\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk7h06y0d25\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We then recalculate the error for each of the corrected forecasts and square these corrected errors to get our squared errors. With these squared errors in hand, we can now compute the mean squared error which is now equivalent to forecast noise.</p><h2>Errors over time</h2><p>Next, we plot the relationship between mean squared error and forecast horizon in figure 1. We do this separately for each study in the top half of the figure and for all studies combined in the bottom half of the figure. The lines of best fit for each plot capture the mean squared error, as flexibly estimated using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression\"><u>LOESS smoothing</u></a>.<br><br>Figure 1: Squared errors over time horizon with non-parametric lines of best fit</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CpgQzQzJKx95Jgguh/za8wksowguv3cuis1bdh\"><figcaption><i>Notes</i>: Loess plots are used in each graph to flexibly plot the relationship between forecast horizon and mean squared error. The loess is weighted by the inverse of the standard error in all graphs. In the combined graph, weights for each study are further adjusted by multiplying by the inverse of the number of forecasts, to give all studies equal weight. In the combined graph, the y-axis is limited to 0.3 to improve readability, cutting off a few of the larger squared errors from Graduation India.</figcaption></figure><p>Figure 1 shows us that across all studies there is not a strong relationship between forecast horizon and forecast noise, although there is some variation within each study. The relationship is roughly linear in all studies, although the power to detect nonlinearities in this data is limited. However, in this analysis, the relationship between forecast horizon and forecast noise is possibly confounded by differences in forecast question difficulty, e.g., forecasting the impact of deworming on income may be more difficult than forecasting the impact of deworming on height. As such, we need to run a meta-regression where we include fixed effects to control for question difficulty.</p><p><br>Table 3: Horizon meta-regression results</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Coefficient</th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Estimate</th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Standard error</th><th style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">95% confidence interval</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Horizon (years), question fixed effects</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>0.0009</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>0.0011</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>[-0.0013, 0.0031]</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Horizon (years), no fixed effects</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>0.0026</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>0.0016</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>[-0.0006, 0.0058]&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><i>Notes</i>: Forecast question fixed effects are included in the meta-regression in the first row but not shown in this table.

Every order of magnitude increase in forecast horizon after that results in a posterior expected value roughly an order of magnitude smaller.&nbsp;</p><p>Other than the decreasing rate of increase case, which relied on an arbitrary assumption, the central fixed effects estimate is the one that takes the longest for the posterior expected value to reach a given level. Even given the slow increase in signal noise in this case, the weight put on the signal declines at a moderate speed. You may personally be inclined to put even less weight on long-run signals than these estimates suggest, i.e., you may give signals of the impact of some intervention 561 years into the future much less than 10% of the weight in determining your posterior expected value of that intervention. Nonetheless, even this limited rate of signal noise increase does seem to reduce the posterior long-run value of interventions fairly significantly.</p><p>More importantly, though, is the variance across the different cases. There is roughly a 2.5 order of magnitude difference in the number of years it takes for the two non-linear cases to reach a posterior expected value which is 10% of the signal (13,276 to 68). Even restricting our attention to the different linear cases, there is almost an order of magnitude difference between the fastest and the slowest cases (561 to 84).&nbsp;</p><p>Please see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13bx8P4rUwwCQtr9XvcJQs9RFm7NBgrh1D2yMhA7R8vk/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>appendix</u></a> for additional robustness checks and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/rethinkpriorities/Uncertainty-over-time-and-Bayesian-updating\"><u>Github repository</u></a> for the data and code.</p><p>There are a number of assumptions made in this work and further work should improve on this by addressing some of the limitations mentioned below.</p><h1>Limitations</h1><h2>Data</h2><p>First, we use RCTs that have completed long-run follow-ups. This is clearly a selected subset of RCTs and this selection could bias results. In theory, this could go in either direction, but one plausible story is that the types of RCTs that have long-run follow ups are ones that had larger short-run effects and were expected to have larger long-run effects. This might lead us to do relatively well in predicting the long-run outcomes in this subset and as such underestimate how much predictability declines over time.</p><p>Second, we take forecasts on the medium-run impacts of global health and development interventions and generalize them to other domains. You may prefer to use forecasts on questions from a mix of domains or forecasts which are more focused on questions relevant to existential risk and longtermism. These different datasets may produce different results on the relationship between time horizon and forecast noise and the ability of each of them to control for confounding in that relationship varies as well. Other datasets that could be used for this sort of analysis have their own strengths and weaknesses and include:</p><ul><li>Expert forecasts of medium-run RCT impacts (<a href=\"https://davidrhysbernard.files.wordpress.com/2023/08/forecasting_drb_230825.pdf\">Bernard, 2023</a>)<ul><li>Judgemental forecasts of impacts from development economics RCTs</li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/niplav/iqisa\"><u>Iqisa</u></a> forecasting datasets<ul><li>Metaculus</li><li>PredictionBook</li><li>Good Judgement Project</li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RjNFyJS3jPb4DA7wA/how-accurate-are-open-phil-s-predictions\"><u>Open Philanthropy grant predictions</u></a><ul><li>Forecasts from a mix of cause areas, but typically only one forecast per question</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Model assumptions</h2><p>We make assumptions on both the prior and the signals in the model. In particular, we assume both of them are normally distributed. We assume that the prior is normally distributed around mean 0 with constant variance. We assume that the signals are each normally distributed around the true benefit in that time period with variance that increases with each time period. We discuss each of these characteristics in turn.</p><p><strong>Mean zero prior</strong>: In the context of this model, the prior is meant to be the agent\u2019s belief about the impact of an intervention before they have seen any information or done any analysis of this intervention. If we select a random intervention the agent could do (whether in the global health and development, animals, or x-risk space) it seems reasonable to assume that its net impact is zero absent any further information. This is in line with the philosophical&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_indifference\"><u>principle of indifference</u></a> whereby positive and negative effects are equally likely and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/effective-social-program/\"><u>stylised empirical fact</u></a> that \u201cmost social programs don\u2019t work\u201d. We are not saying that your personal prior given your current knowledge of interventions should be mean zero for interventions in any of these spaces; you have likely seen many signals and other evidence in the past that will have already moved your prior away from zero. We use zero for illustrative purposes but it is simple to change it and see how that affects the results (we give an example in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13bx8P4rUwwCQtr9XvcJQs9RFm7NBgrh1D2yMhA7R8vk/edit?usp=sharing\">appendix</a>). To be clear, if we\u2019re assuming normally distributed priors and signals,&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"D(t)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">D</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">t</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;is still the weight you put on the signal and&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"1-D(t)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">1</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.298em; padding-bottom: 0.446em;\">\u2212</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">D</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">t</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;is the weight you put on the prior, regardless of what you assume the expected value of the prior (or the signal) to be. Assuming an expected value of 0 for the mean and 1 for the signal, allows us to additionally interpret&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"D(t)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">D</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">(</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">t</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.593em;\">)</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;as the expected value of the posterior.</p><p>If the mean of your prior is closer to the mean of the signal then the posterior expected value won\u2019t be shifted down as much for a given signal. For example, if your signal is mean 1 and your prior and signal have the same variance, then a mean zero prior gives a mean posterior of 0.5, whereas a mean 0.5 prior would give a mean posterior of 0.75. Your prior could also be below zero or above the mean value of the signal.</p><p>What your prior actually is depends on your epistemic context. Suppose you\u2019re considering a set of interventions that have already been filtered by someone else for having high expected benefit. Your prior for this set of interventions should likely be greater than zero. However, the person who did the filtering should probably have a prior much closer to 0.</p><p><strong>Constant variance prior</strong>: We assume that the variance of the prior was the same for each time horizon whereas the variance of the signal increases with time horizon for simplicity. However we might think that the variance of the prior changes with time horizon as well, likely increasing. You might think that in our initial uninformed state, even though we\u2019re uncertain about the short-run benefits of some intervention, we\u2019re even more uncertain about the long-run benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>The amount of weight we put on the prior and the signal to form our posterior depends on the relative variance of the two. As we hold the prior variance constant and increase the signal variance, this leads to less weight being put on the signal and more on the prior as time goes on. However, if the variance of the prior grows as well, this doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the case. If the variance of the prior grows at the same speed as the variance of the signal then the expected value of the posterior will not change with time horizon. If the variance of the prior grows but more slowly than the signal variance, then we will still shrink our posteriors toward the prior, but not as much as in the model above.</p><p><strong>Unbiased signal</strong>: You might think that signals in some domains consistently over or underestimate the benefits of interventions such that they are biased. Indeed, the original forecasts in the data used did consistently underestimate the benefit of treatment (i.e. they were negatively biased) so we had to correct the forecasts to account for this. However, we were only able to do this because we had the ground truth from the RCTs. If you think signals are biased in some domain, you will have to make a more ad hoc adjustment to them in cases where you don\u2019t have access to the ground truth. However, this adjustment can be done simply by subtracting the bias you expect from the signal (and potentially accounting for the additional uncertainty introduced by your uncertainty over the bias).</p><p><strong>Increasing variance signal</strong>: This assumption matches the empirical data although the increase in the variance was itself noisily estimated and not statistically significantly different from 0. Furthermore, we take the increase in variance of the signal from a maximum of 20 years of forecast data and extrapolate it indefinitely into the future. We modeled non-linearities in the rate of signal noise increase but had to make assumptions about the shape of the non-linearities. Ultimately, it\u2019s not particularly clear what we should think about the evolution of uncertainty of signals over long time periods, whether it\u2019s increasing or decreasing over time, and a lot more forecast data would be required to properly estimate non-linear relationships here.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Normal distributions</strong>: We use normal distributions for mathematical convenience but non-normal distributions with fat tails are everywhere in the real world. The effect on your posterior distribution of using non-normal distributions for your prior or your signal would depend heavily on the exact distributions used and in particular whether they have a heavy positive tail as well as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/phpe.12133\"><u>a heavy negative tail</u></a>. For many x-risk cases, you may also have bimodal priors, for example, if you think AI will either go really well or really badly. The economic modeling would be significantly more challenging when allowing for arbitrary prior and signal distributions and it\u2019s hard to say in advance how this flexibility might affect the conclusions of this report.</p><h2>Model relevance</h2><p>You might also think that a model of this style is best targeted for modeling interventions that aim to have persistent long-run effects, whereas the most popular interventions considered by people concerned by long-run effects are existential risk (x-risk) interventions of a different style. Typical x-risk interventions instead aim to in the short-run move us from our current state where we have a moderately high chance of an x-risk, to a stable state where the rates of x-risk are much lower. If you have this concern you might prefer a model more in the style of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/christian-tarsney-the-epistemic-challenge-to-longtermism/\"><u>Tarsney (2022)</u></a> where he models an exogenous event knocking us out of that stable state. The issue is that empirically estimating the parameters of such a model is a much more challenging task than estimating parameters for the Bayesian updating model used above, and it already required a number of strong assumptions to do the latter.</p><p>However, I still think this style of model used above is appropriate for thinking about the long-run value of interventions. Although it doesn\u2019t directly model how we expect x-risk interventions to affect the world, the generality of a stream of value being produced in each period can still capture these sorts of interventions. The x-risk intervention produces value by making it slightly more likely we live in a world that doesn\u2019t face an existential catastrophe relative to the counterfactual where we didn\u2019t do the intervention. The difference between these two worlds is the expected value of the intervention and this can be modeled as a continuous stream of value across time, as in the above model.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, we might think another important application of this style of model is about inputs to risks from AI, e.g., increases in compute, dollars spent, performance on capability benchmarks etc. The sort of modeling in this case does not require assumptions about stable states of the world persisting into the future, but instead takes existing data and extrapolates it forward, similarly to the surrogate index data used in this exercise.</p><p>Finally, we need to consider how the model reflects standard generation of signals (i.e. evidence or forecasts) in effective altruism. When the signal comes from a purely statistical model like the impact of an RCT that doesn\u2019t rely on priors, as above, then the model applies perfectly. If the signal instead comes from a model that does rely at least to some extent on your priors (for example structural models such as the forthcoming Cross-Cause Cost-Effectiveness Model) then you might be concerned about double counting your prior. If this is the case, you likely should put less weight on the signal (since it is partially determined by and correlated with your priors) than the analysis suggests.</p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CpgQzQzJKx95Jgguh/nhw7ir2j0sdj7byq9pz7\"></p><p>This report was written by David Bernard.

Although the estimated rate of forecast noise increase is small, it seems likely that with more forecast data we would be able to reject the null hypothesis that the rate is 0 or negative.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "DavidBernard"}}, {"_id": "yWppBRLJcYaNhwhei", "title": "The Drowning Child Can Be Read In Two Directions ", "postedAt": "2023-10-24T16:12:22.779Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Bjartur T\u00f3mas"}}, {"_id": "i5cuLZH3SQJigiHMs", "title": "Charting the precipice: The time of perils and prioritizing x-risk", "postedAt": "2023-10-24T16:25:07.905Z", "htmlBody": "<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/i5cuLZH3SQJigiHMs/fiyvgjzsor3div05cari\"></p><p>This post is a part of Rethink Priorities\u2019 Worldview Investigations Team\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj\"><u>CURVE Sequence</u></a>: \u201cCauses and Uncertainty: Rethinking Value in Expectation.\u201d The aim of this sequence is twofold: first, to consider alternatives to expected value maximization for cause prioritization; second, to evaluate the claim that a commitment to expected value maximization robustly supports the conclusion that we ought to prioritize existential risk mitigation over all else. This report considers a time of perils-based case for prioritizing existential risk mitigation.</p><h1>Executive summary</h1><ul><li>The time of perils is an important hypothesis among those concerned with existential risk (x-risk).

According to this hypothesis, x-risk is currently high due to a number of sources, but especially the possibility of unaligned transformative AI. The primary way of transitioning out of this risky period is by developing and properly deploying aligned transformative AI, which will lead to x-risk levels being drastically reduced and kept very low for a long time. This results in a future that is very long and big in expectation and the expected size of this future is overwhelmingly morally valuable.</li><li>These premises fall into a few categories:&nbsp;<ul><li>(1) high existential risk now, (e.g., significant chance some misaligned AI will be deployed and seek power)</li><li>(2) transformative AI can significantly reduce existential risk, (e.g., the aligned AI we develop will be sufficiently capable to solve non-AI x-risks)</li><li>(3) a valuable future (e.g., future animal lives will not be too bad)</li><li>(4) moral framework, (e.g., totalism)</li></ul></li><li>All these premises are controversial to varying degrees. Given their controversial and uncertain nature, it seems reasonable to assign a low credence to this version of the time of perils.

However, if we develop and deploy aligned transformative AI, then x-risk will, with a sufficiently high probability, fall to the point that we\u2019ll no longer be in peril. By definition, aligned AI will not itself be a threat to humanity and, at the same time, it will most likely address all other existential threats. Moreover, it will allow civilization to expand beyond the Earth and make human-originating civilization robust to future existential threats. As a result, humanity will be on a trajectory toward a very long and large future that is overwhelmingly morally valuable. Conversely, if we don\u2019t get aligned AI, then an x-risk such as unaligned AI will likely kill us all or permanently damage our potential to expand outside of the solar system. In either case, the value of human civilization is limited or strongly negative and thus our potential has been wasted\u2014an existential catastrophe. Therefore, the expected value of work to mitigate x-risk, particularly the risk from AI, is much greater than the expected value of work on all other causes.</p><p>The general idea of the time of perils comes from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stafforini.com/quotes/?p=880\"><u>Carl Sagan</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/On_What_Matters/ta0-AAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;bsq=We%20live%20during%20the%20hinge%20of%20history\"><u>Derek Parfit</u></a>, although the idea has received new supporters with the development of AI and x-risk studies. In essence, the current era is pivotal for humanity's long-term future and our actions, especially regarding AI alignment, will determine whether we unlock a prosperous future or face existential catastrophe. Call this the \u201ctime of perils-based case for x-risk mitigation\u2019s overwhelming value\u201d\u2014or, for short, \u201cthe TOP case\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>Several prominent x-risk scholars have explicitly endorsed elements of this view (though we don\u2019t mean to suggest that they endorse exactly the position just outlined). For instance:</p><blockquote><p>It's quite likely the extinction/existential catastrophe rate approaches zero within a few centuries if civilization survives, [partly because\u2026] Aligned AI blocks threats from misaligned AI (and many other things)... If we're more than 50% likely to get to that kind of robust state, which I think is true\u2026 then the life expectancy of civilization is very long, almost as long on a log scale as with 100%.</p></blockquote><p>\u2014<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zLZMsthcqfmv5J6Ev/the-discount-rate-is-not-zero?commentId=Nr35E6sTfn9cPxrwQ\"><u>Carl Shulman</u></a></p><blockquote><p>\u2026 if we never get AI, I expect the future to be short and grim. Most likely we kill ourselves with synthetic biology. If not, some combination of technological and economic stagnation, rising totalitarianism + illiberalism + mobocracy, fertility collapse and dysgenics will impoverish the world and accelerate its decaying institutional quality.</p></blockquote><p>\u2014<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7WfMYzLfcTyDtD6Gn/pause-for-thought-the-ai-pause-debate#III_\"><u>Scott Alexander</u></a></p><blockquote><p>If we don't get whacked by the existential risks, the future is probably going to be wonderful.</p></blockquote><p>\u2014<a href=\"https://www.singularityweblog.com/stuart-armstrong-existential-risks/\"><u>Stuart Armstrong</u></a></p><blockquote><p>Given a long enough time with our potential intact, I believe we have a very high chance of fulfilling it: that setbacks won\u2019t be permanent unless they destroy our ability to recover. If so, then most of the probability that humanity fails to achieve a great future comes precisely from the destruction of its potential\u2014from existential risk.</p></blockquote><p>\u2014<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Precipice/W7rEDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=Given+a+long+enough+time+with+our+potential+intact\"><u>Toby Ord</u></a></p><blockquote><p>One might consequently argue that even the tiniest reduction of existential risk has an expected value greater than that of the definite provision of any \u2018ordinary\u2019 good, such as the direct benefit of saving 1 billion lives\u2026 These considerations suggest that the loss in expected value resulting from an existential catastrophe is so enormous that the objective of reducing existential risks should be a dominant consideration whenever we act out of an impersonal concern for humankind as a whole.</p></blockquote><p>\u2014<a href=\"http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf\"><u>Nick Bostrom</u></a></p><p>However, it is difficult to know whether any given element of the TOP case is true. There are, after all, many possible ways the future could play out. For instance, some possibilities include:</p><ul><li>We do not develop transformative AI because of technical or political difficulties.</li><li>We develop aligned AI but it is not able to address the continuing political or technical barriers associated with farmed and wild animal welfare; as a result, there are ongoing, animal-related moral catastrophes that make the future net negative morally.</li><li>AI helps us grow economically and temporarily increases the rate of GDP growth but it doesn't fundamentally revolutionize the world. As such, we're richer but not necessarily safer.</li><li>Resource constraints and the intrinsic complexities of existential risks prevent aligned AI from radically reducing x-risk levels; so, humanity goes extinct before it can reach a point of existential security.</li><li>Technological advancement amplifies rather than alleviates x-risks as the pace of technological growth surpasses our capacity for risk management. Even with the introduction of aligned transformative AI, x-risk may increase if AI spurs the development of other high-risk technologies such as bioengineering.</li><li>We make it through the first time of perils with the help of aligned AI but we face another \"great filter\" in the future which we fail to make it through.</li><li>We decide against pursuing space colonization because it is untenable for physical or political reasons, and that makes the future not overwhelmingly valuable.</li><li>Humans meet hostile aliens who wipe out our species before we\u2019ve colonized a sufficient amount of space to create civilisational robustness, and the intervening time is not enough for the future to be overwhelmingly valuable.&nbsp;</li><li>We go extinct but aliens with similar values colonize the same space we would have colonized, resulting in similar levels of value.</li></ul><p>However, proponents of TOP do not necessarily need to assert that the TOP version of the future is more likely than any of these alternatives. All they need is that the probability of the premises of the TOP case are high enough to generate the conclusion that the value of x-risk mitigation is overwhelming in expectation. Even if you thought there was only a 10% chance of the conclusion of the TOP case being true, when accounting for the vast number of lives at stake if it is true, then you could still generate an expected value of x-risk mitigation that is significantly higher than other causes.</p><p>So, what do you need to generate this sort of expected value-based conclusion from the TOP case? At a broad level, we think you need four main claims.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>X-risk is currently high and it is tractable to reduce it.</li><li>Deploying aligned transformative AI will reduce x-risk to persistently very low levels.</li><li>Reducing x-risk will result in a very long and large future of positive value.</li><li>Morality is such that acting to realize this future is overwhelmingly morally choiceworthy.</li></ol><p>We think that if these four claims were true, then the case for x-risk mitigation being overwhelmingly morally valuable would hold. However, these claims are broad and difficult to evaluate. To make progress, we take the approach of breaking them down into 18 different subpremises to make assessing them more tractable. We discuss each of the premises in turn, why it is important for the TOP case and key uncertainties around the premise.</p><p>This work is only an initial step in the direction of evaluating the validity of the TOP case and is incomplete. We discuss how each of these 18 premises feed into the TOP case and key uncertainties about each of them. We do not defend particular credences for each of these premises or the broader claims. We think more research is needed before we would be confident enough to assign such numbers.</p><p>Furthermore, we think the 18 premises we generate should be considered as placeholders and not set in stone. The premises do not form a logical argument and it would be reasonable to disagree with the necessity of some of them for a sufficiently strong version of the TOP case to hold. However, it\u2019s plausible that many of these premises are necessary. We simply aim to highlight that there are a relatively large number of premises potentially required and there are deep uncertainties around many of them. Accordingly, it seems reasonable to be uncertain about what probability to assign them and the conclusion of the TOP case.</p><p>This is only one of several possible approaches to analyze the TOP case, and surprisingly, given its potential importance, there\u2019s been limited research on this so far.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/ORDTPE\"><u>Ord\u2019s The Precipice</u></a> is the seminal work in this area, but as of writing there are only 6 posts on the EA Forum with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/time-of-perils\"><u>time of perils tag</u></a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bayes.net/ltf-paper/\"><u>Adamczewski</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/papa.12248\"><u>Thorstad</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/S9H86osFKhfFBCday/how-bad-would-human-extinction-be\"><u>Mu\u00f1oz Mor\u00e1n</u></a> assess the implications of the TOP case if it is true, but spend little time assessing whether it is true or not. The aim of this report is to start that work and as such, should be treated as a brainstorming exercise for possible components of a sufficiently strong TOP case and not a knock-down argument for or against the TOP case.</p><p>All that said, we think it is currently epistemically reasonable to assign a low credence to the conclusion of this version of the TOP case and it\u2019s unclear whether this credence is high enough to justify this particular conclusion of x-risk mitigation work being overwhelmingly valuable.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3izy8tpk66l\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3izy8tpk66l\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Given that there are many premises potentially required and we are uncertain about what probability to assign them, the conjunction of them may be highly improbable.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjd6crjuyi2g\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjd6crjuyi2g\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>Based on a commitment to maximizing expected value, you might still think that even low credences in the conclusion should drive your decision-making if enough value is at stake. However, this would require being comfortable going all in on small probabilities and in the extreme might require your decision-making to depend on tiny probabilities, which you may think is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13SCTWfpixNmZbDkmCA6vJGxFU0034-0il9C6grMFkek/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>excessively fanatical</u></a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/9EENSGhiQiKFaRh4t\"><u>Alternative decision theories</u></a> which place more weight on risk and penalize small probabilities more, will be much less driven by these probabilities.</p><p>In the rest of the report, we collect and briefly discuss each of the potential assumptions of the TOP case. We discuss each one briefly and highlight why it is potentially important to the TOP case, as well as uncertainties surrounding it.</p><h1>High existential risk now</h1><p>The first empirical component of the TOP case is that we face high existential risk now; we are in the time of perils. Typically this existential risk is seen as coming from a number of sources. The most prominent among these is unaligned artificial intelligence. For example, in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Precipice/W7rEDwAAQBAJ\"><u>The Precipice</u></a>, Toby Ord assigns an approximately 10% probability of an existential catastrophe from unaligned AI in the next century, versus approximately 3% each to engineered pandemics and unforeseen anthropogenic risks. We focus on and draw from Joe Carlsmith\u2019s report on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2023/03/22/existential-risk-from-power-seeking-ai-shorter-version\"><u>Existential Risk from Power-Seeking AI</u></a> in discussing the assumptions that go into AI being an existential threat, as it is one of the most well-known models of existential threat from AI. Carlsmith focuses on the probability of various claims being true by 2070, but the time of perils may last longer than that. The first 5 premises are drawn directly from Carlsmith with some discussion drawn from Good Judgement\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goodjudgment.com/superforecasting-ai/\"><u>Superforecasting AI</u></a>.</p><h2>1. It will become possible and financially feasible to build advanced, strategically aware, agentic planning AI systems&nbsp;</h2><p>Systems that are advanced, strategically aware, agentic planning AIs, referred to as APS systems, are potentially on the horizon. These characteristics seem to be important prerequisites for AI to pose an existential threat. Systems with these characteristics will be able to strategize and plan, making them distinctively formidable and they could be capable of actively working against humanity. Importantly, these systems need not be superintelligent and effectively omnipotent and omniscient.</p><p>However, there is a conceivable chance that the development of such advanced AI systems, even less than superintelligent systems, may never come to fruition. Potential hindrances, such as the resource requirements for AI systems being unexpectedly large or insurmountable technical challenges, could derail the progress and realization of AI systems. A stronger version of this claim is that such systems will be able to improve their own intelligence and this could result in an intelligence explosion but the speed at which transformative AI systems will arrive and improve&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4Ckc2zNrAKQwnAyA2/literature-review-of-transformative-artificial-intelligence\"><u>is</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/against-the-singularity-hypothesis-david-thorstad/\"><u>much</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/where-ai-forecasting-stands-today/\"><u>debated</u></a>.</p><h2>2. There will be strong incentives to deploy AI</h2><p>AI systems likely need to be deployed to cause an existential threat, though it is possible that risk can occur during training as well. It seems that there will be compelling incentives to deploy APS systems. Strategic awareness and planning makes them appealing for diverse applications. So, developers may be inclined to deliberately create and deploy them. Moreover, APS systems might emerge inadvertently as a byproduct during training processes that are not directly aimed at achieving APS characteristics.</p><p>However, it's worth noting that not all trajectories lead to the deployment of these systems. Potential deterrents to their widespread adoption may arise. Governments, recognizing the latent threats these systems might pose, could introduce stringent legislations against their deployment or attempt to monopolize control over such systems for security purposes. Furthermore, there could be other unidentified factors that might reduce the impetus to deploy APS systems. It's possible that economic considerations, societal pressures, or ethical debates could reduce the incentives to bring such potentially powerful AI systems into our world.</p><h2>3. It will be much harder to build aligned than misaligned AI</h2><p>For AI to pose a credible existential threat, the alignment challenge must be non-trivial. If constructing aligned AIs were straightforward, existential concerns from misaligned AI would be moot. Specifically, there must be an inherent risk of unintentionally producing a misaligned AI while attempting to produce an aligned one. One particular type of misalignment that is concerning is that of a misaligned power-seeking AI. Given that power-seeking is advantageous for a myriad of objectives, the principle of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence\"><u>instrumental convergence</u></a> predicts that power-seeking will be a common feature of powerful AI systems, even if the objectives of these systems do not perfectly align with human objectives.</p><p>On the flip side, it\u2019s possible that achieving AI alignment might not be as difficult as it appears.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Nwgdq6kHke5LY692J/alignment-by-default\"><u>John Wentworth</u></a>, for instance, estimated in 2020 that there's roughly a 10% chance of alignment by default just by continuing on our current trajectory. The ability of large language models to sensibly interpret vague human instructions is evidence that alignment may be easier than expected.</p><h2>4. Some misaligned AI will be deployed and seek power&nbsp;</h2><p>The most plausible way to generate AI manifesting as an existential threat, is to assume that certain misaligned AI systems, once deployed, will seek power. It seems like society would likely prefer not to deploy potentially misaligned power-seeking AI, but deployment decisions may not always align with broader societal interests. A private lab, driven by short-term gains or a disregard for potential long-term implications, might willingly risk introducing a power-seeking AI into the environment. Race dynamics and the extra benefits of being a first mover, could further bolster these hasty deployments, even when safety isn't thoroughly vetted.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, there are clearly uncertainties around this premise. One might draw parallels between AI and other risky technologies, such as nuclear weapons, which have not proliferated widely, but it\u2019s unclear how relevant these reference classes are. The knowledge and materials needed to build nuclear weapons are tightly restricted. It may be possible to impose similar such information security and trade restrictions on AI in the future, but ever decreasing costs of compute may make these restrictions ineffectual. By the time we develop APS systems, we may have already introduced government legislation or strong cultural norms against the deployment of risky systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, despite instrumental convergence being an appealing conceptual argument for power seeking behavior there currently seems to be little empirical evidence of this behavior in existing public AI models. It\u2019s possible that deployed AIs will only be slightly misaligned and therefore will not constitute an existential catastrophe (but may still be a global catastrophic risk).&nbsp;</p><h2>5. Some power-seeking systems will permanently disempower all of humanity&nbsp;</h2><p>The final step in Carlsmith\u2019s argument is to note certain power-seeking systems might lead to the irreversible disempowerment of humanity and that this would be an existential catastrophe. We might notice power-seeking tendencies in an AI and seek to correct them, but given a powerful enough system, we might not be capable of doing so. The AI system, once crossing a certain threshold of dominance, could render humanity perpetually powerless and failing to fulfill our potential.</p><p>The intensity of power-seeking behavior can be imagined on a spectrum, with certain thresholds separating benign from catastrophic outcomes. It remains a possibility that we could develop AI systems that, despite their power-seeking tendencies, remain below the critical threshold, ensuring that humanity retains control and avoids the direst outcomes. We might think of this as an AI system being analogous to an existing powerful state that has its own interests but does not outcompete other actors.</p><p>Furthermore, it seems likely that the probability of an existential catastrophe will be much lower than the probability of a \u2018merely\u2019 global catastrophe. For instance, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/b3AtJeBggrjfDKCyj/p/K2xQrrXn5ZSgtntuT\"><u>Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament</u></a> found that superforecasters and domain experts thought AI extinction risk was one to two orders of magnitude less likely than catastrophic risk, depending on the forecast horizon and forecaster type. Delineating between a global catastrophe and an existential catastrophe is likely to remain a challenge, especially when it comes to AI. Specifically, the nature of the future risk from non-aligned AI is highly variable: Will it lead to widespread suffering and disvalue or result in a universe devoid of value altogether or something more mild? The differentiation between these scenarios is significant and has direct implications for the value at stake if the TOP case is true.</p><h2>6. Other risks are non-negligible but don\u2019t guarantee our extinction before aligned AI is developed</h2><p>While AI stands out as a significant existential risk, it is by no means the sole threat on the horizon. Other formidable risks, such as engineered pandemics or nuclear weapons, must also be acknowledged. These threats, too, have a role in the time of perils hypothesis, marking the era as one fraught with multiple dangers. Yet, for the hypothesis to remain tenable, these non-AI risks can't be too overwhelming. If they were, humanity might face extinction before the challenge of creating aligned AI is even broached.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider, for example, the prevention of biorisks. It seems possible that at some point before the development of transformative AI, the net balance of offensive biorisk threats that could cause extinction and the defensive capabilities designed to stop those threats could heavily favor the offensive side that could cause extinction. If that were to happen, human extinction might become very likely during such a period.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_Precipice/W7rEDwAAQBAJ\"><u>Ord's previously cited risk estimates</u></a> seem compatible with the time of perils framework. However, these estimates carry a degree of uncertainty. Should the actual risks be significantly higher or lower than projected, or the downsides of the risk occurring not as bad as they might seem, then the time of perils case could be called into question. As in the previous section, for the TOP case to hold weight, it's not sufficient for these threats to pose merely a global catastrophic risk. The risks must be truly existential, threatening the continued existence or potential of humanity. Otherwise, the world may still end up containing enormous amounts of value after the occurrence of a non-existential risk.</p><h1>Significantly reduced existential risk</h1><p>The next step in the time of perils case is for aligned AI to significantly reduce the levels of existential risk from all sources. This includes the risk from misaligned AI, but also all other x-risks. Not only do these risks have to be solvable, but our AI systems must be powerful enough to solve them, and keep them solved indefinitely. Significantly reduced levels of future risk&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/N6hcw8CxK7D3FCD5v/existential-risk-pessimism-and-the-time-of-perils\"><u>seem to be crucial</u></a> for ensuring that the future is sufficiently long for it to be overwhelmingly valuable. AI is the most commonly discussed way of reducing future risks so we focus on this, although there are potentially non-AI routes to ending the time of perils as well, such as robustness from space colonization or advanced non-AI technologies. This section draws partly from Finnveden, Riedel, and Shulman\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KqCybin8rtfP3qztq/agi-and-lock-in\"><u>AGI and Lock-In</u></a>.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdk2tn6q70i\"><sup><a href=\"#fndk2tn6q70i\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><h2>7. Aligned AI is sufficiently capable to solve other x-risks</h2><p>In the framework of the TOP case, the first objective of an aligned AI is to address and neutralize other x-risks, which is a critical prerequisite for humanity to achieve a long future. Therefore the AI systems we develop need to be capable and powerful enough to solve, or at least significantly mitigate, all other x-risks in order to secure our future. But a question emerges: are there x-risks that are beyond the power of potential AI systems?</p><p>As discussed in premise 6, in a pre-AI world there is the possibility of an imbalance in offensive and defensive capabilities in biorisk threats and prevention. In a post-AI world, a potential imbalance would need to be resolved by some combination of (i) the technological future remaining around neutral in offensive versus defensive capabilities or leaning towards prevention over extinction threats, and/or (ii) the balance leaning technologically towards extinction threats but AI stopping actors from using such weapons. The former situation seems to be a forecast about the future nature of biorisk that doesn't seem clearly resolvable given existing evidence, while the latter situation might be politically untenable, depending on how much monitoring and surveillance might be required.&nbsp;</p><p>Classic literature on superintelligent AIs often paints a picture of them as bordering on omnipotent and omniscient. This perception extends even to human-level AIs, essentially positing that their rapid coordination capabilities aggregate to a form of omnipotence and omniscience. However, it seems reasonable to approach these claims with skepticism. The exact capabilities of advanced AI systems&nbsp;<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/against-the-singularity-hypothesis-david-thorstad/\"><u>remains a matter of uncertainty</u></a>. Furthermore, it may be the case that we have to sacrifice on capabilities in order to reduce the risk of misalignment, and this may reduce the ability of the AIs we do end up developing to address the x-risks we face.</p><p>Assessing the capability of such an AI becomes paramount, especially when considering the difference between merely reducing risks and virtually eliminating them. Achieving near-complete risk reduction might require an unreasonably advanced AI. Natural phenomena like super volcanoes, gamma ray bursts, and solar flares present significant challenges. While AI can potentially predict or mitigate the effects of such events, their complete prevention may be outside the realm of AI capabilities, either due to technical or political challenges. Some anthropogenic risks like great power wars are likely to be even more difficult to solve than natural risks. Furthermore, introducing AI systems into society may make these anthropogenic risks even harder to solve if, for example, it speeds up arms races. This emphasizes the need to assess the difficulty of solving various x-risks, even for an agent more powerful than ourselves.</p><h2>8. Aligned AI also eliminates the risk of misaligned AI</h2><p>After successfully deploying an aligned AI, we face another challenge: the potential development and deployment of a misaligned AI. Even in the presence of an aligned AI, a misaligned counterpart could still introduce significant existential risks. Therefore, the goal isn't just to create an aligned AI but to ensure it has the capacity to counteract threats from any misaligned AI that might arise later.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KqCybin8rtfP3qztq/agi-and-lock-in\"><u>AGI and Lock-In</u></a> suggests that a dominant aligned AI would likely be resilient against challenges from misaligned AI systems. However, these claims are still speculative given our current understanding. There are critical unanswered questions in this area. For instance, how capable does an aligned AI need to be to effectively counter misaligned AI threats? Additionally, to maintain the security provided by an aligned AI, what freedoms might humans need to relinquish? And at what point does this trade-off become unacceptable for us?</p><h2>9. Aligned AI remains aligned indefinitely</h2><p>AI alignment is not just about achieving initial compatibility with human values. For us to fully actualize our potential, AI alignment needs to be persistent, with minimal risk of deviation over successive iterations or periods. This continuing alignment is essential for two primary reasons.</p><p>Firstly, AI systems must be robust against any external malevolent influences, ensuring that bad actors cannot corrupt or manipulate their operations. Secondly, we must mitigate \"value drift\", which refers to the divergence of AI's objectives from those of humanity at the time.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KqCybin8rtfP3qztq/agi-and-lock-in\"><u>AGI and Lock-In</u></a> touches upon the challenges and potential solutions for maintaining consistent AI alignment. However, given the importance of persistence, it seems like more in-depth research on this topic is required.</p><h2>10. No bad actors ever control intent-aligned AI</h2><p>A merely intent-aligned AI follows the specific objectives of its developers regardless of whether those objectives are good for achieving one among the best possible futures. Even if we manage to deploy intent-aligned AI that aligns with the developers' specific objectives, a new challenge emerges: the potential misuse by bad actors. Just as the deployment of an aligned AI doesn't guarantee the absence of existential threats from misaligned AI, the presence of intent-aligned AI doesn't mean it's immune to being controlled or misused by bad actors who could cause a lot of harm.</p><p>Bad actors could come in a number of varieties. First, there could be actors who use intent-aligned AI to maximize their share of the pie without increasing the size of the pie and creating benefits for everyone else. Secondly, there could be classically bad actors such as terrorist groups who use the AI to actively harm people and curtail humanity\u2019s potential. Finally, under the TOP case it may even be the case that actors not conventionally seen as bad could result in existential catastrophe. If the actors who control AI lack expansionist ambitions, they might fail to colonize the stars and create a grand future. Of course, uncertainties still remain about the possibility of AI being created by any of these bad actors, and just how much would be lost by this occurring.</p><h2>11. No unknown unknowns</h2><p>Another premise is that there are no unknown unknown risks. In particular, the TOP case seems to require that we (or at least the AI systems we develop) will be aware of all existential risks and have a strategy for dealing with them before they wipe us out. This includes there being no unknown great filters ahead of us, which may drastically shorten our expected lifespan. If new, currently unconceived of risks were to emerge, these could overshadow currently recognised x-risks and make our current mitigation efforts irrelevant, misdirected or possibly even harmful.</p><p>The very nature of unknown unknowns makes them uncertain. How can you foresee and prepare for a threat that is currently beyond our comprehension? We may think that technological progress is unbounded in which case potential new threats will always be out there. Even if we think technological progress is bounded, there may still be technologies to be discovered that we haven\u2019t yet thought of that pose existential threats themselves.</p><h1>A big, positive future</h1><p>A key part of the TOP case is that the future that is threatened is potentially immensely valuable. This potentially \u2018astronomical\u2019 value is what is important for making the claim that x-risk mitigation work radically dominates other global priorities. If we limit ourselves to the next few generations, then x-risk work may be in a similar magnitude of cost-effectiveness to global health and farmed animal interventions. If we look beyond that, there are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/S9H86osFKhfFBCday\"><u>a number of different ways</u></a> to model future value with very different potential values of the future.</p><h2>12. Aligned AI will produce lots of value</h2><p>One way for the future to end up being valuable is to have an aligned transformative AI aimed at making it so. There are a few different ways that this could be done that have been discussed so far. The most standard way is to develop our abilities to colonize and settle space, and then create many new worlds as valuable as Earth. Alternatively we could develop digital minds, create many of them more efficiently than biological humans and give them blissful lives.&nbsp;</p><p>It remains to be seen what capabilities future AI systems will have. Even if they will be sufficiently powerful to reduce existential risk to arbitrarily low levels, this need not imply that they will be able to solve problems such as space travel and colonization. Furthermore, if AI is democratically aligned with a broad coalition of humanity\u2019s interests, it seems plausible that although humanity might broadly agree about the value of preventing existential threats, we might disagree about whether we should colonize space or create digital minds, and as such an aligned AI may not assist in achieving those ends.</p><h2>13. Human or human-descended lives will be good&nbsp;</h2><p>Human or human-descended lives may fill the future. For this to be morally good we need that the lives of these individuals are themselves good at least on average, or that they surpass a neutral or acceptable threshold of welfare.&nbsp;</p><p>One difficulty is knowing what the neutral welfare point is and the fraction of human lives that are currently above it. Further, we shouldn't be fully confident that welfare ought to be the primary way to evaluate the goodness or badness of a life. Regardless, this difficulty may not be so important if we can assume that the positive trends we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of centuries in economic growth, health and quality of life continue. However, we may harbor some uncertainties about whether these trends will continue. We also have examples of negative trends over the past centuries such as growing carbon emissions that might disrupt the positive trajectory.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, it\u2019s also possible that there aren\u2019t incredibly many human lives in the future. If current declining fertility trends continue as they are forecasted to, then the human population will shrink rather than expand,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sites.utexas.edu/pwi/files/2023/01/Geruso_Spears_Longtermism_and_Population_OUP.pdf\"><u>significantly reducing the potential value of the future</u></a>. Of course, future population trends are not certain and there is the potential for governments to respond with policies aimed at increasing fertility.</p><h2>14. Animal lives will not be too bad&nbsp;</h2><p>The potential future is not restricted to human lives; the value of the future may be significantly influenced by the welfare of non-human animals. We might transfer farmed and wild animals beyond our planet, either intentionally or inadvertently. When considering the potential scale, and depending on one's stance regarding the moral patienthood of animals, the collective well-being of animals could surpass that of humans in moral importance.</p><p>However, history presents a mix of optimism and concern. While some advances in animal rights and welfare have been made, large-scale operations like factory farming continue to raise significant ethical issues. The state of wild animals, too, is contentious, with the possibility that many wild animals might lead net-negative lives due to natural suffering. Our negligence toward the well-being of animals may be a potential moral catastrophe.</p><p>The trajectory of animal welfare is very uncertain. It&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZNcdt7eYWW7YXALvx/what-ai-could-mean-for-animals\"><u>may be possible</u></a> that all problems involving animals will be solved by aligned AI or AI could continue to perpetuate farmed and wild animal suffering. For example, if humans want cultivated meat, then it seems plausible that AI could significantly advance that aim within the next decade. However, humans also often want \"natural\" foods and processes, which may result in the continuation of farming and significant amounts of wild animal suffering. Furthermore, it may be the case that ecosystems are too complex for even advanced AIs to intervene upon with reliably positive consequences. The treatment of animals in the future will likely hinge on the interaction of societal values, technological advancements, and consumer demands and much more research could be done to project these trends.</p><h2>15. Other (digital) minds matter and will not be too bad</h2><p>For the strongest versions of the TOP case with the largest amounts of potential future value at stake, we need to assume that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/how-digital-people-could-change-the-world/\"><u>digital minds</u></a> will be created and that they have valuable lives. This is because digital minds will not have our biological limitations; so, they will be able to convert energy more efficiently to utility and more easily deal with the difficulties of space travel necessary for exploiting the full resources of the accessible universe.</p><p>The science of the consciousness of digital substrates is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08708\"><u>an emerging field</u></a> and seems to be even harder than assessing the consciousness of non-human animals. AI systems trained on data from humans&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/to-understand-ai-sentience-first-understand-it-in-animals\"><u>may game behavioral tests</u></a> of consciousness, producing outputs that are similar to sentient humans but with a radically different underlying process that may or may not be conscious. It seems like it will be difficult to evaluate whether digital systems are sentient and worthy of our moral concern.</p><p>Furthermore, it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journal.robonomics.science/index.php/rj/article/view/32\"><u>remains to be seen</u></a> how we will treat such digital minds if they are conscious (or we are uncertain about whether they are conscious) and whether they will have net positive lives. If digital minds are not given human rights, then there will be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ageofem.com/\"><u>economic pressure</u></a> to exploit and control them, potentially creating dystopian futures. Even an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.planned-obsolescence.org/aligned-vs-good/\"><u>intent-aligned AI</u></a> could in theory produce unhappy digital slaves if that were the best way to produce what humans wanted. Alternatively, if digital minds have positive lives then our ability to duplicate and create many more of them could produce incredibly large amounts of value.</p><h2>16. We will not encounter aliens</h2><p>Another tacit assumption is that humanity's future will be solitary, uninfluenced by external extraterrestrial entities. However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://grabbyaliens.com/\"><u>encountering an alien intelligence</u></a> could profoundly shift the course of human history and the set of existential risks we face. Alien civilizations could potentially have superior technologies and knowledge to us. Depending on whether first contact with them is harmonious or adversarial, they might either accelerate our progress and raise our future potential or be an existential threat themselves that reduces or eliminates our long-term potential.</p><p>One uncertainty is whether the universe does contain extraterrestrial life as showcased in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02404\"><u>Fermi</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kvZshdx5FzTPjyhxG/the-fermi-paradox-has-not-been-dissolved\"><u>Paradox</u></a>. If it turns out that there is extraterrestrial life, then we would want to learn more about the technological prowess or motives of any alien civilization although this seems like an elusive challenge. There is also the question of how bad it would be if we were replaced by aliens. If they shared similar values to us then we might think the loss of humanity\u2019s potential would not be so bad from the perspective of the universe.</p><h1>Moral framework</h1><p>Finally we conclude with a discussion of the moral framework commonly used to evaluate the value of the future. We focus on two of the most important components: namely, totalism and minimal discounting of future lives. We frame these in axiological terms, and discuss what these imply in terms of the potential value. To translate this into a claim about what we ought to or are permitted to do, we additionally need some decision theoretical principle such as expected value maximization. Adding this makes the case more controversial and we discuss it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj/p/9EENSGhiQiKFaRh4t\"><u>elsewhere</u></a>&nbsp;in<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HMakzketADQq4bkvD/the-risks-and-rewards-of-prioritizing-animals-of-uncertain\"><u> the sequence</u></a>, so, we do not include discussion of it here.</p><h2>17. Additive axiology</h2><p>An additive axiology is one that assesses the value of a state of the universe by summing up (potentially weighted) individual values within that state. These can be opposed to average axiologies, where the relevant difference is that adding new sources of positive value always increases axiological value in an additive framework, but not necessarily in an average framework. An additive axiology allows the many individual sources of value in the potential big future to be aggregated to an overwhelmingly large total value.</p><p>Totalism is one popular axiological framework that measures the value of a state of the universe by simply adding up the well-being present in each individual life within that state across all time. In essence, the total value is just the sum of values from every life that has ever existed or will exist. The key distinction here is that all lives count towards value, including those in the future, not just those currently living as in a person-affecting view. Because of this, the total value can grow indefinitely, constrained only by the physical limits of the universe. Accordingly, it is possible for the value of overwhelmingly many future potential individuals to be considered as overwhelmingly axiologically valuable. Moreover, the framework implies that failing to realize the potential of these future lives, possibly by failing to cause them to exist, leads to a significant loss in the total value of the universe.</p><p>However, the domain of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://compass.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/phc3.12442\"><u>population ethics and axiology</u></a>, which concerns the ethical implications of bringing individuals into existence, is wickedly complex and controversial. Various impossibility theorems and conflicting intuitions about axioms make clear conclusions elusive. Whatever the appeal of a totalist axiology, several other theories and variations of population ethics are potential contenders, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/41281/chapter-abstract/351601098\"><u>person-affecting</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/41281/chapter-abstract/351599517\"><u>critical-level</u></a> views, and allowing for moral uncertainty should also be given some weight.</p><h2>18. Minimal discounting of future lives</h2><p>The positive outcome of the TOP case is a very long future populated by numerous lives. For this long future to hold substantive moral weight, future lives must not be significantly discounted. Using standard exponential discounting, assigning any positive value to the rate of pure time preference would result in the diminishing moral value of these future lives as we project further into the future, with future lives holding no value in the limit. To be clear,&nbsp;<i>some&nbsp;</i>discounting future lives is compatible with the TOP case. If you held that all future lives were only worth 1% of present lives, with this discount being constant over time, you could still conclude that the future is immensely valuable because of the sheer number of possible future lives.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/economics-and-philosophy/article/discounting-for-public-policy-a-survey/4CDDF711BF8782F262693F4549B5812E\"><u>Some philosophers</u></a>, although&nbsp;<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/time-discounting-consistency-and-special-obligations-a-defence-of-robust-temporalism-harry-r-lloyd-yale-university/\"><u>not all</u></a>, argue that the rate of pure time preference should be zero, implying that future well-being holds equal weight to present well-being. Conversely,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20160240\"><u>many economists</u></a> argue for a non-zero discount rate, often for reasons tied to evidence that humans do value the present more than the future, uncertainty surrounding the future, and opportunity costs.&nbsp;</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>The time of perils case presents a potentially compelling vision of our current existential situation, emphasizing the weightiness of our choices today, especially in the realm of AI alignment. Credence in TOP can have massive implications for what we ought to do today, but so far the hypothesis has received relatively little exploration and formalization. To that end, this report underscores the number of different assumptions that underpin a strong variety of this case. Each of these assumptions carries with it its own uncertainties, and many are still in the preliminary stages of research.</p><p>While the TOP case's narrative might appeal to our intuitive understanding of x-risk, it is not yet particularly well-researched and is potentially built upon a number of different premises. When these premises are taken together, the collective likelihood of the TOP case being the future we actually face seems quite uncertain. We think more work should be done to build more formal models of the time of perils and what is required for our exit from these times, which can guide future forecasting of these potentially crucial considerations.</p><p>Our aim was not to debunk the TOP case but to shine a light on its underlying components and the complexities involved. By doing so, we hope to encourage more nuanced discussions, research, and potentially recalibrations of priorities in the field of cause prioritization. If the most powerful and prominent argument for the overwhelming value of x-risk mitigation rests on this specific understanding of our era, then it seems important to engage deeply with each assumption. This might involve bolstering evidence for some, refuting others, or identifying overlooked aspects that might further shape our understanding.</p><p>A number of open questions remain regarding the time of perils and cause prioritization. Firstly, we\u2019d be interested in seeing more formal models of the time of perils, assessing what the minimal set of credible assumptions is for the time of perils case to go through and assessing these assumptions in more depth than we were able to do here. Secondly, we focused on an AI version of the time of perils case since it seems like the most commonly discussed version. It seems plausible that there are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zLZMsthcqfmv5J6Ev/the-discount-rate-is-not-zero?commentId=Nr35E6sTfn9cPxrwQ\"><u>other non-AI based ways</u></a> to significantly reduce x-risk which should also be further explored. Finally, our definition of how valuable the future needs to be for it to qualify as \"overwhelmingly valuable\" remains somewhat ambiguous. Further studies determining the scale and duration of the future required for x-risk mitigation to be overwhelmingly valuable would be useful.</p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/i5cuLZH3SQJigiHMs/hfejl90oxgjfs6qrua1l\"></p><p>This report was written by David Bernard.

Almost every species of plant and animal that\u2019s ever existed has gone extinct. So to think we\u2019re not going to go extinct, I mean, man, that takes superhuman levels of delusion. So yeah, we are going to go extinct.</p><p>But of course, just putting it like that, it then becomes a truism. It\u2019s not a very interesting or helpful observation to make. The interesting bit would be asking under what circumstances do we go extinct? And this is where I think the first prediction (the \u201cgo extinct\u201d one) and the third prediction (turn into superhuman somethings), sort of start to merge together.</p><p>And definitely I think the one that is so unlikely we can just dismiss it out of hand is that everything stays more or less the same, and the future is like <i>The Jetsons</i> or something, where everybody is the same people they are now, but they\u2019ve got their personal spaceships.</p><p>Or even what struck me, when I was quite a little kid watching <i>Star Trek</i>: <i>Star Trek</i> started off in the late \u201960s, so it\u2019s a really old show. I was a little boy in the late \u201960s watching <i>Star Trek</i>, and it just dawned on me that this is exactly like the world that the producers of TV shows live in, except they\u2019re now on a starship. And all of the assumptions of 1960s LA is baked into that show. You\u2019ve got the middle-aged white guy in charge. You\u2019ve got the Black woman Lieutenant Uhura, who answers the phones for him, basically, she\u2019s the communications expert. And then the technology expert is the Asian guy. It\u2019s like all of the assumptions of 1960s LA TV studios baked into this thing. And surely, the one thing you\u2019ve got to be certain of, if you\u2019ve got intergalactic travel, is that everything else about humanity does not stay the same when you get to this point.</p><p>So I think you just give it a minute\u2019s thought, this \u201cstay basically the same\u201d scenario is just a staggeringly unlikely one, particularly when you start thinking more seriously about the kind of resource constraints that we face. And this is something people will often raise with any talk about sort of superhuman futures: that we\u2019re heating up the world; we\u2019re poisoning the atmosphere and the oceans; there\u2019s a finite amount of fossil fuels out there, even if we weren\u2019t killing ourselves with them. All these things are happening to suggest that business as usual is simply not going to be an option. If the world is going to continue \u2014 and continue certainly on the sort of growth trends we\u2019ve been seeing in anything like the ones in recent times \u2014 then we\u2019re talking about a very, very profound transformation of everything.</p><p>So yeah, I came down in <i>Why the West Rules</i> on one option, which I think is unfortunately a perfectly plausible option: that the world continues to face all kinds of problems. When you look back over the long run of history, one of the things you repeatedly see is every time there\u2019s been a major transformation, a major shift in the balance of wealth and power in the world, it\u2019s always been accompanied by massive amounts of violence.</p><p>And living in a world that has nuclear weapons, I would say the number one threat to humanity \u2014 even more serious than climate change or anything else you might want to talk about \u2014 is nuclear war. We\u2019ve had a 90% reduction in the number of nuclear warheads since the 1980s, but we\u2019ve still probably got enough to fight World War II in a single day. And that\u2019s without even thinking about the radiation poisoning that we didn\u2019t get in World War II so much. This is shocking, appalling potential to destroy humanity if we continue squabbling over our resources. So I think abrupt, sudden, violent extinction is a perfectly real possibility.</p><p>I tend to be optimistic about this. I think judging from our previous record, we have been pretty good at solving problems, in the long run at least, so maybe we\u2019ll be able to avoid this. If we avoid the abrupt short-term extinction though, I think the only vaguely plausible scenario is that we do transform humanity, or somehow humanity gets transformed, into something utterly unlike what it\u2019s been in the last few thousand years.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Chiefs in Sungir</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Ian Morris:</strong> The most extreme case [of anomalies in the historical record] is a place called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sungir\">Sungir</a>, and Sungir is in this very unpromising looking location. It\u2019s 150 miles northeast of Moscow. This is a really, really cold and miserable place to live in now. You can imagine how terrible it was during the ice age. And what we find there is this group of burials where the dead have been laid out in these graves. Then people have spent hours and hours grinding up ochre \u2014 which is this naturally occurring iron oxide, which you grind it up and it produces this powder that allows you to stain things red. So they ground up tonnes and tonnes of ochre and put it in the graves.</p><p>Then they buried these people in these elaborate costumes, which we think were like animal skins. But sewn onto these animal skins are thousands of little beads that have been made by cutting up the bones and teeth of deer and snow leopards and other animals and grinding them into shape and drilling holes through them. And of course, you\u2019re doing all this without power drills: you\u2019re doing all this by getting a stick and putting a little bit of abrasive on it and rubbing the stick between your hands until it grinds its way through this little bead. And there are thousands of little beads like this on each of these bodies.</p><p>And along with them, they\u2019ve taken mammoth tusks, and then hundreds and hundreds of hours of labour have been put into straightening the mammoth tusks, making it so they\u2019re 20-foot-long straight rods that would have been so heavy, almost impossible to pick up. Then all these other smaller mammoth bone and tusk ornaments they\u2019ve made. This is just astonishing what these people were doing.</p><p>And it\u2019s the kind of thing where if instead of dating to 32,000 BC, it dated to 2000 BC, you would automatically say that this is the burial of a great, powerful chief and all his family \u2014 because little kids are in there as well, with these extraordinary offerings with them as well. Again, in later times, you\u2019d say that this symbolises the fact that power and status are being passed down from the Great Chief: the proto-king being passed down to his children. And you\u2019ve got a dynasty here. But it\u2019s 32,000 years ago. This is something that sort of should not be happening.</p><p>\u2014\u2014-</p><p>And of course, it\u2019s a real challenge for evolutionary theory to say why we, once in a blue moon, get these bizarre cases of people who are basically hunter-gatherers producing stuff they should not be producing, they should not be living lives like this.</p><p>And there is not complete agreement on this. That\u2019s an understatement to say there\u2019s not complete agreement: there\u2019s wild disagreement. Most archaeologists say that what it is is that actually, as hunter-gatherers, you sometimes get these superabundant niches of resources within a larger landscape where resources are much scarcer. And within these abundant resource niches, the resources are of a kind that it\u2019s possible for a handful of people to begin to monopolise access to them. And they are then able to turn this into control over the resource flows, and channelling resources to their own ends to make them something like chiefs. So for centuries, or even millennia, you will get these chief-like people emerging. But because it\u2019s not farming, they\u2019re not able to keep scaling up and turning from chiefs into kings. But it does happen. This is probably the most popular theory.</p><p>The other theory is no. What places like Sungia and some of the Peruvian sites, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Para%C3%ADso,_Peru\">El Para\u00edso</a>, some of these sites, what they actually show is that complex society has actually nothing to do with energy or the evolution of hierarchy. It was always possible for humans to live in complex societies if they\u2019d wanted to do so. But they didn\u2019t want to do so; they chose to live free lives instead. And it\u2019s only in more recent times that some colossal mistake gets made and we start going down the path toward these complex societies, where the Orwell line of the future being, somebody\u2019s jackboot on my throat forever and ever: that is what the future looked like. It\u2019s only quite recently that we make some terrible mistake, and start going down this path. And all of the evolutionary theories are simply wrong. It\u2019s up to us to create the world we want to live in.</p><p>So you can imagine these arguments get quite political, and they get quite heated and nasty, yet there are these weird cases.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Machine intelligence won't be held back by human constraints</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Ian Morris:</strong> I guess one of the things that\u2019s always struck me is people constantly talk about \u201cartificial\u201d intelligence: what exactly is artificial about it? I don\u2019t think a fully conscious \u2014 whatever we might mean by that \u2014 machine intelligence is going to think of itself as artificial. It\u2019s going to think of itself as itself. It\u2019s not artificial intelligence; it\u2019s different intelligence. And we are creating this different intelligence that may or may not want to share its being with us. I think it\u2019s very difficult to know what the intentions and wishes of an intelligence that different from us are going to be. It would be like horses trying to understand human intentionality. My wife and I have a couple of horses. They understand certain things that we\u2019re doing and thinking, and certain things that we want that they don\u2019t necessarily want, but their grasp of our overall presence in the world is pretty damn limited.</p><p>And I think that is going to be the same for our grasp of nonbiological intelligence, and the nonbiological intelligence\u2019s grasp of our intelligence: I think these are going to be radically different kinds of intelligences trying to communicate with each other. And I\u2019m sure there will be some interest in merging them. But I just think it seems highly likely that the nonbiological intelligence, that\u2019s not going to be its primary goal in life: to make Ray Kurzweil live forever.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah, I think that this future is imaginable, but in order for it to happen, it would require a massive worldwide effort to suppress the alternative. Because machine intelligence by itself, trained in its own way, not merged with the human mind, I think is just going to be way better. It\u2019s going to be much faster. It\u2019s not going to be held back by the constraints that face the human brain, which is just at some point going to be a legacy piece of technology. So in order to make this hybrid intelligence the main species or the main kind of thinking that happens on Earth, you would have to basically prohibit this other technology that is going to race ahead and end up being really superior.</p><p>The analogy that comes to mind to me is when people in the 19th century were trying to figure out how to design flying machines, they could have projected that the way we would do it is some sort of merger of birds with machines that we would produce a plane that is like a combination \u2014 that somehow you stick the birds together and then merge them with a machine and they flap their wings and that produces a plane. But no, the way that you make a combined plane-bird in our world is that you have a plane that flies and the bird inside the plane, at best. Trying to incorporate the bird into the plane adds nothing and is just an extreme design constraint. And I think that is what it\u2019s going to be, trying to merge human brains with these machine intelligences that can just improve so much faster as we improve the underlying technology and the algorithms and so on.</p><p><strong>Ian Morris:</strong> Yeah, I think that the aircraft thing is a good example, because it\u2019s a basic scaling problem here: you can\u2019t just scale up a sparrow and turn it into a 747; it just does not work that way. And they solved that problem a little bit like the way that initially, say, when people trying to design chess programs on computers that could beat humans solved the problem by not attempting to make the computer think like a human: they do it just by power, by being able to run through all of the different possible combinations of the consequences of the move you make, and run through all of them in a way a human can\u2019t do. You\u2019re thinking about the game in an entirely different way, just like when you strap wings onto an internal combustion engine, you\u2019re thinking about flight in an entirely different way from a bird does. I think that\u2019s a really good example.</p><p>But this talk about preventing artificial intelligence from developing, I think this is one place where thinking about the new forms of intelligence in an evolutionary way, rather than as a problem in technology, can be kind of helpful. Because we\u2019re already at the point where you can\u2019t just pull the plug out of the wall and switch the AI off. It doesn\u2019t work like that anymore. And we\u2019re going to get further and further down that path. This is going to become an unstoppable force. It\u2019s a little bit like asking how do you stop a biological evolutionary process? Stop one species from being replaced by a more intelligent competitor?</p><p>This is of course what happened over and over again the evolution of humanity: that more intelligent, bigger-brain species of apes becoming more or less human replaced one another. How would the less intelligent species have prevented that from happening? It\u2019s just very difficult to imagine what exactly they\u2019re going to do. I think this is the situation we\u2019re getting in now.</p><p>And I think even more than just saying it\u2019s difficult to imagine, it was impossible for the less intelligent species to imagine what it could conceivably do about this. Neanderthals probably couldn\u2019t really conceive of the Homo sapiens threat, let alone come up with a coherent, coordinated response to it. What on Earth makes us think we can conceive of how the threat \u2014 if it is a threat \u2014 of the machine intelligence is going to look like, and what would be an adequate response to it? I suspect that we\u2019re kidding ourselves over this.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>AI from an evolutionary point of view</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> You\u2019ve put your finger on something that over the last few weeks I\u2019ve realised is just an absolutely key issue. I think the biggest difference between me and people who think that either improvements in machine intelligence are not such a big deal or that they\u2019re going to be modestly useful and obviously beneficial and that there\u2019s not many risks here, is whether we think of these neural networks that we\u2019re building as a new being and a new species, or whether we think about them just as a new sort of consumer product. If you think it\u2019s a new piece of consumer software, then people freaking out about where this might ultimately take us just seems sort of nuts. It seems way over the top.</p><p>But my instinct, like yours, is to view this from a biological and an evolutionary point of view. I get the impression that you basically feel the same way. Why do you think it is that that biological and evolutionary perspective is the more appropriate lens on what\u2019s happening?</p><p><strong>Ian Morris:</strong> I guess I would say the only thing that currently exists in the world that you can make analogies from it \u2014 although very imperfect ones \u2014 to machine-based intelligence is biological-based intelligence. The brains that animals have evolved across billions of years. And initially, through most of the history of life on this planet, there\u2019s nothing you\u2019d really call a \u201cbrain\u201d out there.</p><p>You start getting animals that have bodies that can move. Probably most biologists wouldn\u2019t want to call what some of these earliest creatures have a brain. I\u2019ve heard people call it a \u201cganglion.\u201d The front end of the body of many kinds of animals, say ants in the modern world: all the nerve endings from the body of an ant flow together at the front end of its body, in its head. There they form a kind of information exchange centre. But it\u2019s going on at such a crude level that calling it a brain is stretching the meaning of the word brain to the point that, frankly, may be even beyond the breaking point.</p><p>It takes a particular kind of evolution of bigger and bigger brains to get to the point where animals start to be conscious of themselves. And consciousness of any kind is, in evolutionary terms, a relatively recent development \u2014 certainly only a few hundred million years old. And you start to get these brains developing that are conscious of the limits of the animal. Because it\u2019s a selective pressure: an animal that is aware of where its own body ends and the rest of the world starts has an advantage over an animal that is not aware in that way. It\u2019s much more able to develop the power to move itself around, control where it\u2019s going, conceptualise problems.</p><p>Consciousness is an evolutionary adaptation. And looked at in this way, it\u2019s not something that God put his finger down to Earth and created consciousness and mind and free will and all these kinds of things: it\u2019s something that evolved through an uncontrolled process of natural selection. And our human consciousness, in a way it\u2019s no different from the consciousness of my dogs and cats, but it\u2019s at such a vastly more sophisticated level that in many ways it doesn\u2019t really bear comparison. But again, it\u2019s emerged without anybody being in charge and consciously willing it into existence.</p><p>Now, we began creating these machine-based neural networks that relatively quickly are moving toward creating more of themselves. And in a sense you can say we\u2019re already at that point: they are creating the more sophisticated versions of themselves as much as we are controlling this process. Of course they\u2019re going to develop some sort of consciousness. Although it may be nothing like the consciousness you get in biological brains, because it\u2019s not going to be biologically based; it\u2019s going to be silicon based or whatever quantum kind of things they come up with. It\u2019s going to be different from ours.</p><p>But it\u2019s going to develop some form of consciousness that might be a form of consciousness that we can\u2019t even understand anymore. A tree cannot understand your consciousness because it doesn\u2019t have a brain. Our brain may be as far from the mind, or whatever you call it, of the machine-based intelligences as a tree is from us. And again, thinking we\u2019re controlling this \u2014 this is wildly overoptimistic.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The cyclical view of history</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> I guess hearing about these examples of hunter-gatherer civilisations flourishing in the past and then kind of collapsing for circumstantial reasons made me wonder if maybe the cyclical view of history is something that we haven\u2019t talked enough about today relative to how plausible it is.</p><p>You could imagine a future goes that maybe we\u2019re broadly right in the long term, but we might go through another crash and resurgence again. For example, we could have a nuclear war, and then maybe all of this is delayed 100 years, because it takes a long time for us to recover. And maybe then we go through some transition into the next stage of civilisation through improving technology. That seems pretty plausible to me, and maybe that\u2019s something that this up-and-down pattern in history makes seem more likely.</p><p><strong>Ian Morris:</strong> Yeah, I think this is something that\u2019s unavoidable if you look at long-term history \u2014 the ups-and-downs stuff, the troughs and crests in development \u2014 so it\u2019s like history is cyclical and yet not cyclical. It\u2019s like each new trough doesn\u2019t go as low as the last trough. Each new crest kind of overtops all previous crests. So say you\u2019ve got a long-term trendline that is trending upward just with a huge amount of variation around that trend line.</p><p>But I think other things are going on as well in this long-run exponential growth process combined with the shorter-term cyclical one. Another of the issues is that you start off with very localised processes \u2014 tens of thousands of very localised experiments, in a sense, being run around the planet. And as time has gone on, we\u2019ve moved more and more toward having a single global experiment running. So you go to a place like Sungir, 32,000 BC, the place with the weird burials I talked about a minute ago. We have a few of them from Sungir, and then they stop. And then we\u2019ve got them in other places, and then they stop. Each individual place seems to have had a brief period when all the conditions came together to produce these wild kinds of societies, and then it stops. Occasionally it\u2019ll come back later, but usually it doesn\u2019t, so that thing broke down there and it sort of never gets revived.</p><p>As you go forward in time, the societies are getting bigger and bigger. Like I was talking about with the stuff on war, we\u2019re creating these bigger and bigger societies and you still would get these breakdowns. You have, say, a big breakdown in the eastern Mediterranean about 1200 BCE. And there you get the states over the region from Greece, out through to western Iran, down into Egypt, over most of that region, the states collapse and the population crashes as well. Takes centuries and centuries, but it then does rebound again.</p><p>And I think what we\u2019ve seen as time has gone on is that as the scale of the whole thing increases, you get multiple effects of this that you wouldn\u2019t predict if you\u2019re just thinking about it in a linear way. One is that the troughs, when they come, the collapses are so much more abrupt than they used to be, and in terms of points on my development scale, so much bigger. And yet we bounce back from them so much faster, because none of them have ever encompassed the whole planet. I think there\u2019s always outside areas where you haven\u2019t had a collapse.</p><p>So even something like the Second World War \u2014 the most destructive thing we\u2019ve ever had in human history, at least \u2014 what does it do? It devastates large parts of Europe, East Asia. And yet within 50 years, that\u2019s all been put behind us. We\u2019ve moved on so much from there because a big part of the world, North America in particular, doesn\u2019t get devastated by it.</p><p>Now we\u2019re running up against these new thresholds. It\u2019s like if we\u2019ve got the one experiment going, the global one, if we don\u2019t get it right at the first attempt, we get a profound crash with nowhere in the world left outside it in order to step in in the future and fix things for us again. And while I do remain optimistic, I do think we\u2019re going to see this revolutionary transformation. You\u2019re a little bit stupid if you don\u2019t worry about the downside.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The rate of increase in the economy has been increasing</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> I think for me, the key fact that I remember just really striking me in the head back in 2008 or 2009, when I first encountered it, is not just that the economy or human influence has been growing over time, but rather that the rate of increase has been increasing.</p><p>So there was this long period when we were hunter-gatherers where the annual rate of growth in human population or human technology per year was negligible \u2014 0.1% or something incredibly small. And then you get to the farming era, when you get a really significant increase \u2014 it\u2019s glacial change from our point of view, but very much faster change than what was going on before during the hunter-gatherer era \u2014 I guess because people are in cities, there\u2019s more ability to record knowledge, there\u2019s more people who have the slack to do some research and come up with new ideas and figure out new ways of doing things. So the growth rate increases a lot once we have settled agriculture and cities and empires and so on.</p><p>And then in 1700, 1800, it steps up again by a really big factor \u2014 three or 10 or something like that \u2014 to the modern world, where we\u2019re kind of used to the idea that technology is changing within people\u2019s lifetimes: that by the time they die, things might look really quite different than they were when they were born, which definitely wasn\u2019t the case before the industrial era.</p><p>So if you project forward, you don\u2019t just have to think about just growth continuing, but also the potential that we\u2019ll get a third step change, where the rate of growth will increase compared to the industrial era. Earlier I said that if the economy grew 3.5% for 100 years, then the economy would end up 30-fold larger each century. But if we go through a third phase shift like you\u2019re describing, and average growth rates triple to 10.5% a year, then over the following 100 years after that, we end up with a global economy that\u2019s 22,000 times larger than it was when it started \u2014 which is a totally wild impact that is clearly beyond our ability to visualise, except that the world would obviously be really unfamiliar, to say the least. Do you have any reaction to that?</p><p><strong>Ian Morris:</strong> Again, these sorts of numbers, it\u2019s very difficult to imagine what this means for us, but I think the basic premise of what you\u2019re saying does seem to be borne out by the historical record. And when I started writing my <i>Why the West Rules</i> book in the late 2000s, it dawned on me pretty quickly that one reason why historians often hadn\u2019t seen just how long term you need to look \u2014 they hadn\u2019t grasped that you really have got to look at thousands and thousands of years to see what\u2019s going on \u2014 is that if you think linearly about long-term change, you can\u2019t see it happening.</p><p>And so when I was drawing graphs of my social development scores for Eastern and Western societies, if I just plotted it on a linear scale with years along the bottom of the graph and then points on the index on the vertical axis, basically nothing happens on that graph until you get to about 1800, when suddenly the lines leap off the bottom where they look like they\u2019re zero the whole time up until 200 years ago. And they go up almost at a 90-degree turn: go straight up.</p><p>If you plotted it instead on a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_scale\">log linear graph</a> \u2014 with again dates along the bottom, presented in the usual way, but on the vertical axis now you\u2019ve got 10-fold increments in the development scores \u2014 if you plot it that way, then you see that going back thousands of years, actually development was rising exponentially: just the exponent was really small, so it just took a very long time for anything to happen.</p><p>And the book I\u2019m working on now is going to be focusing much more on the early periods. I realised if you want to go back millions of years and look at these phenomena, you\u2019ve really got to draw it on a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log%E2%80%93log_plot\">log\u2013log graph</a>, where both axes are increasingly 10-fold increments. That makes it really obvious, like what you were just saying, that it\u2019s not only that growth has been increasing exponentially \u2014 it\u2019s that the exponent has been growing as well. So it\u2019s not just that we\u2019re accelerating, but the rate at which we\u2019re accelerating is itself accelerating.</p><p>So whether that is going to give us a world where we see the economy is 23,000 times bigger than now 100 years from now or not, this is the way we\u2019ve got to think about it. I think all of our preconceptions about how the world works are going to be swept away just as abruptly as they were during the Agricultural Revolution, and just as abruptly as they were during the Industrial Revolution.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "aoBxSba4CsEAtHqRy", "title": "Largest AI model in 2 years from $10B", "postedAt": "2023-10-24T15:14:17.232Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I created this short report as a work test for an ML Hardware researcher role and sharing it with the organization's approval in case someone might find it useful or happy to give me feedback on this.

I don\u2019t have significant research experience (neither quantitative nor qualitative) that I think would be really useful to create a proper, high-quality report.

Whether it\u2019s used to set-up their own datacenter or paid as a multi-year commitment to a cloud provider,&nbsp;<strong>I estimate this amount to be sufficient for acquiring even the SotA AI chips in the order of some hundreds of thousands ( &gt; 1e5).</strong> Since this scale is unprecedented and memory and interconnect bandwidth of the chips are already key factors (e.g. see memory bandwidth&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.semianalysis.com/p/nvidiaopenaitritonpytorch#%C2%A7machine-learning-training-components\"><u>highlighted here</u></a> and interconnect bandwidth included in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/28/us_china_ai_chip/\"><u>US export control</u></a>) even at the existing scales, going with the most advanced chips (e.g. highest memory and interconnect bandwidths and individual performance) seem to be the way indeed.</p><p><strong>That's still around more than an order of magnitude (~10x) more chips than the largest estimated final training run so far</strong> (GPT-4 using ~10-20 thousand NVIDIA GPUs). I think this implies the following important factors:</p><ul><li>This is comparable in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/08/17/nvidia-h100-are-550000-gpus-enough-for-this-year/\"><u>magnitude with the number of such chips delivered</u></a> in a year so I expect it takes months to get access to all of them.</li><li>Significant improvements are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.semianalysis.com/i/97006309/the-memory-wall\"><u>likely needed</u></a> in the parallelization of the workload to get a utilization rate even comparable to the rate of the current large scale runs.</li><li>Given the unprecedented scale of the infrastructure and potential significant changes in the training (e.g. algorithms, model parameters), decent testing work is also likely needed before the final training run.</li></ul><p><strong>Combining the above I estimate that a final training run utilizing the whole acquired compute capacity may only start about a year from now.</strong></p><p>Finally, combining the estimates of the chips used, the performance of the individual chips, the time available for the final training and the utilization rate,&nbsp;<strong>I estimate that the resulting final training could use operations roughly around 1e27 FLOP&nbsp;(with my rough estimate 90% CI being something like 3e26 to 5e27).</strong></p><h1>What $10B is good for?</h1><p>Most large scale AI training labs use NVIDIA data center GPUs (<a href=\"https://www.semianalysis.com/i/97006309/nvidia-is-king\"><u>see why</u></a>). Another chip family worth mentioning is the TPUs from Google who are one of the big players in AI themselves and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/05/google-reveals-its-newest-ai-supercomputer-claims-it-beats-nvidia-.html\"><u>use their own chips</u></a> for the trainings in addition to making it available through the cloud. These two families represent the current large-scale training runs pretty well so I\u2019ll stick to these two.</p><p>The latest NVIDIA card (released last year) of this family is the H100 (~<a href=\"https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/08/17/nvidia-h100-are-550000-gpus-enough-for-this-year/\"><u>$30,000 each</u></a>) released last year and it clearly beats the previous A100 (~<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/23/nvidias-a100-is-the-10000-chip-powering-the-race-for-ai-.html\"><u>$10,000 each</u></a>) which was the previous one both in performance (RAW FLOPs + new transformer engine) and bandwidth. (See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/data-center/hgx/\"><u>H100 website</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-tensor-core/nvidia-tensor-core-gpu-datasheet\"><u>H100 datasheet</u></a>).</p><p>NVIDIA also sells 8-card servers called the DGX(standard)/HGX(customizable) product. The price of a DGX H100 is around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_DGX\"><u>$400,000-$500,000</u></a>. The same for the HGX version does not seem to be publicly available probably due to the higher room for customization but we can assume it is about the same order of magnitude.</p><p>Price calculations can also be made through cloud provider hourly costs.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nextplatform.com/2023/07/27/h100-gpu-instance-pricing-on-aws-grin-and-bear-it/\"><u>This article</u></a> collects AWS prices showing the 3-years reserved hourly cost which is a plausible discount we get if we invest $10B. The 8GPU H100 machine\u2019s hourly cost is ~$40 so ~$5/GPU.</p><p>Google just released the new version of its TPU v5e but it is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/08/30/google-tpu-v5e-ai-chip-debuts-after-controversial-origins/\"><u>currently unclear</u></a> if it\u2019s better for large scale training runs than the previous v4 version.</p><p>Google TPUs are only available through the cloud (unless you are Google) but I can imagine they might consider a $10B offer or set up the same infrastructure to be accessed through the cloud.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tpu/pricing\"><u>The prices</u></a> are slightly lower than that the NVIDIA GPUs with the 3-year commitment price being ~1.5$ for v4 and ~0.5$ for v5e. But details<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/tpu/docs/v5e-inference\"><u> about the v5e</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01433\"><u>about v4</u></a> also suggest that these are \u2155 - \u00bc lower performance (BF16 FLOP/s) than the H100, respectively.</p><p>Obviously there are additional operation costs when we simply buy the hardware like facility, power (<a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/trends-in-the-dollar-training-cost-of-machine-learning-systems#appendix-a-the-energy-cost-of-final-training-runs-seems-about-20-as-large-as-the-hardware-cost\"><u>15-25% energy cost</u></a>), etc. but it\u2019s also likely that the cloud prices contain a significant profit margin that the vendors are happy to cut from for a $10B commitment.</p><p>So based on the cloud and DGX prices, we could get access to ~1-2e5 (hundred thousand) H100s or ~4e5 TPUv4 or ~1e6 TPUv5e. ~1-2e5 H100s is an order of magnitude more than the number used for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O99z9b1I5O66bT78r9ScslE_nOj5irN9?usp=sharing#scrollTo=nANz62eyuOJi\">GPT4</a>.</p><h1>Is 100,000 chips a lot?</h1><p>It\u2019s estimated that the largest final training run as of now (GPT4) was about $50M based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O99z9b1I5O66bT78r9ScslE_nOj5irN9?usp=sharing#scrollTo=tRnfGB3bPhQ9\"><u>calculations from epoch</u></a> using 10,000-25,000 A100 GPUs for 2-6 months. And<a href=\"https://epochai.org/trends\"><u> historical trends</u></a> show that there has been a rapid scale-up of 4x/year in compute and 3x/year in costs for large scale trainings. Applying this to GPT4 run we become close to the $B and the 100,000 chip era but the investment is quite ambitious even if this very rapid growth trend is maintained which obviously can not go on forever. According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/grokking-bioanchors#neural-network-anchors\"><u>estimates</u></a> this trend is expected to slow down around 2025.</p><p>But 100,000s of chips instead of 10,000s is still a large increase even for SotA trainings. E.g. memory bandwidth (<a href=\"https://www.semianalysis.com/p/nvidiaopenaitritonpytorch#%C2%A7machine-learning-training-components\"><u>highlighted here</u></a>) and interconnect bandwidth (included in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/07/28/us_china_ai_chip/\"><u>US export control</u></a>) had already been making it difficult to get high utilization rate out of the chips. There\u2019s were obviously some technical improvements e.g. (bandwidths of the H100/HGX H100&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/data-center/hgx/\"><u>are somewhat increased&nbsp;</u></a>vs A100/HGX A100 and Google also announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/using-cloud-tpu-multislice-to-scale-ai-workloads\"><u>Multislice</u></a> which is designed to support large scaling) Still, these large scale generative AI trainings had not been going on for long so without deeper understanding for the underlying difficulties I\u2019d estimate that it\u2019s less likely that training runs of such scale would be completely unviable in e.g. a year from now. So I give a decent chance for reaching a utilization similar in magnitude to the GPT4 final run (10%+) after some significant work spent on this. I\u2019ll use 20% (estimated ~40% for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O99z9b1I5O66bT78r9ScslE_nOj5irN9?usp=sharing#scrollTo=nANz62eyuOJi\"><u>GPT4</u></a> and 10% which is my rough lower bound estimate) being slightly more on the pessimistic side.</p><p>A scale of 100,000 accelerators is larger than that of the top&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOP500\"><u>non-AI supercomputers</u></a> although the top one gets close in magnitude. Also NVIDIA estimates to altogether<a href=\"https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/08/17/nvidia-h100-are-550000-gpus-enough-for-this-year/\"><u> ship ~550.000 H100s in 2023</u></a>. So the challenge does not seem trivial at all.</p><h1>When could the final training start?</h1><p>When the final training run can start seems to be an important question given that utilizing an infrastructure of such scale well does not seem to be a trivial task. I\u2019m assuming hardware companies and cloud providers don\u2019t just have $10B stock of AI chips that one could immediately get access to. I think you\u2019d need to wait for at least multiple months or even more than a year to get access to all of them.</p><p>This seems a lot but given the large increase in scale both in the computer infrastructure and in the training size I\u2019d expect that decent preparation work would be needed from the different research and engineering teams anyway before the final training can be started. It seems plausible that the preparation work can be started with only a fraction of the infrastructure and that the majority of the preparation work can be finished even without the full final infrastructure being available (e.g. with 50%).</p><p>I\u2019m quite uncertain on this but I\u2019d estimate that it\u2019d take somewhere around a year for the full infrastructure and all the necessary algorithmic improvements to be in place and adequate amount of testing being completed to start a final training run. Note that a year long large scale training is likely&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230408191843/https://openai.com/research/openai-five-defeats-dota-2-world-champions\"><u>unprecedented</u></a> but I\u2019d assume a project at such scale would aim at something of this length to get the most out of the investment. I think they would aim for around a year long run but with a minimum threshold of 6 months.&nbsp;</p><h1>How much compute we might squeeze out?</h1><p>Without creating proper probabilistic estimates myself I\u2019ll heavily rely on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1O99z9b1I5O66bT78r9ScslE_nOj5irN9?usp=sharing#scrollTo=tRnfGB3bPhQ9\"><u>this calculation from Epoch</u></a> that estimates the details of the GPT4 training. I\u2019ll slightly adjust the calculations for the scenario I\u2019m estimating and \u201cscale it\u201d up based on the factors I identified as relevant earlier. I\u2019ll also try to estimate an \u201cartificial\u201d confidence interval, also heavily relying on the GPT4 calculation to express my certainty in the final estimate.</p><p>The calculation estimates that the GPT4 training was run from 2-6 months on 10-25,000 A100 GPUs with a utilization of ~40% and estimated to utilize 2e25 FLOP (90% CI 8e24 to 4e25). I expect that we have ~2.5-3x more time (~6-15 months), ~10x more chips (100-200,000), the pure performance of the individual chips is ~3x higher (FP16 dense FLOP of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-tensor-core/nvidia-tensor-core-gpu-datasheet\"><u>H100</u></a> vs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/data-center/a100/\"><u>A100</u></a>) and I estimated that utilization might be lower ~0.5x.</p><p>One more potentially important factor I don\u2019t know much about is the FP8 representation and transformer engine feature support of the H100. NVIDIA claims that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-tensor-core/nvidia-tensor-core-gpu-datasheet\"><u>transformer engine</u></a> can \u201cdramatically\u201d accelerate AI calculations for transformers using FP8 representation of the numbers instead of FP16 when possible. The H100\u2019s FP8 performance is 2x the FP16 and it\u2019s not clear what \u201cdramatically\u201d exactly means in this context. I estimate that the increase is less likely around ~2x given that this is the pure FP8 performance but I\u2019ll give it a ~1,5x factor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Altogether it is ~50x scaling up of the calculations resulting in the final estimate being ~1e27 FLOP.</strong></p><p>To get a lower bound of my \u201cartificial\u201d confidence interval I re-ran the calculation of the GP4 training with the training days fixed to 2 years. That is how much compute we could expect to utilize if we don\u2019t change anything, just buy/keep the same infrastructure used for GPT4 and run that for 2 years. This results in 1e26 (90% CI: 7e25 to 2e26).</p><p>The performance of the GPT infrastructure in 2 years is definitely a very good starting point. But given that we have $10B to invest I think it\u2019s fair to be slightly more optimistic than that. Scaling up the GPT4 estimate\u2019s lower bound results in 4e26 which seems about right but still a 5-6x increase compared to the 2 years GPT4 run estimate lower bound (7e25) which seems quite optimistic. I\u2019m more comfortable going slightly lower to ~3e26 (~4x increase to the 2 years GPT4 run estimate).&nbsp;</p><p>I also feel quite uncertain about the upper bound. The anchor point I have is scaling up the GPT4 estimate 50x which results in ~2e27. However I\u2019m definitely less confident about the upper limit than that although I\u2019m not confident with going as high as 1e28 either. A value roughly around 4e27 seems more plausible and also still proportionate to the adjustment of the lower bound.</p><p><strong>This makes my full estimation be 1e27 FLOP (90% CI 3e26 to 4e27).</strong></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "P\u00e9ter Dr\u00f3tos"}}, {"_id": "6jxrzk99eEjsBxoMA", "title": "Go Mobilize?

For these enthusiasts, the new biotechnologies offered a novel way to \u2026 raise agricultural productivity, and to make better and cheaper medicines, all while representing a potentially enormous source of profit for the firms involved.\u201d</i><a><i><strong><sup><u>[1]</u></sup></strong></i></a></p><p>In 2023, we\u2019ve seen the first public protests against the catastrophic risks from AI. Groups like the '<a href=\"https://www.campaignforaisafety.org\">Campaign for AI Safety</a>' and '<a href=\"https://pauseai.info\">PauseAI</a>' advocate for a moratorium on AI models more powerful than GPT-4. Efficacy is a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/eqTGrEsBzJJSiuTcv/the-international-pauseai-protest-activism-under-uncertainty\"><u>crucial consideration</u></a> AI protests, yet no significant research has been done. In addition, from personal conversations, there is significant uncertainty around what strategies and messages AI protests should use.&nbsp;</p><p>This research analyzes&nbsp;the success of GM protests in Europe in the late 1990s, to ask two main questions. Could protests bring about a US-led unilateral pause to AI in the short-term? (i.e. next 5 years) And, what do effective strategies &amp; messaging look like for AI protest groups?</p><p>I briefly want to set out why I choose this case study. As the above quote suggests, GMO resembles AI in some ways: it was seen as a revolutionary and highly profitable technology, which powerful companies were keen to deploy. Furthermore, GMOs did not have any clear \u2018warning shots\u2019, or high events which demonstrate the potential for large-scale harm. CFCs and nuclear power had high-profile events which demonstrated the potential for large-scale harm: the discovery of the ozone hole, and the Fukushima meltdown (along with other nuclear incidents) respectively. AI development has not had a \u2018Fukushima\u2019 moment yet and&nbsp;perhaps it never will, suggesting the GMO case is more relevant.&nbsp;</p><p>GMOs and AI have several differences. First, GMOs had limited geopolitical significance. While different Western governments funded their respective biotechnology industries, this was perceived as an \u2018arms race\u2019, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiYrI7s4IuCAxXVWUEAHdEgBLoQFnoECA0QAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fthebulletin.org%2F2023%2F05%2Fhow-politics-and-business-are-driving-the-ai-arms-race-with-china%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Tz3EfeuZY0YovK-FyLesz&amp;opi=89978449\"><u>frame</u></a><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiYrI7s4IuCAxXVWUEAHdEgBLoQFnoECBsQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fainowinstitute.org%2Fpublication%2Ftracking-the-us-and-china-ai-arms-race&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ywXQ2PcVf7cfLOoIPBL80&amp;opi=89978449\"><u> increasingly</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/21eb5996-89a3-11e8-bf9e-8771d5404543\"><u>used</u></a> to describe AI competition between US and China. (Other technologies including nuclear power and nuclear weapons had clearer geopolitical drivers. I conduct shallow-dives into these cases, and others, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WfodoyjePTTuaTjLe/efficacy-of-ai-activism-have-we-ever-said-no\">here</a>).</p><p>Furthermore, AI regulation may require an international agreement, particularly in the longer term. In contrast, national governments of European member states could dictate biotechnology policy without needing to agree to an international treaty. However, given its strategic control over hardware, the US could impose a temporary, unilateral moratorium on AI development. This is the most plausible scenario that GMOs can shed light on.&nbsp;</p><p>This piece is focused on the effectiveness of protest. It does not delve into whether a pause is desirable, the credibility of AI safety concerns (which appear more legitimate than GMO concerns), nor other reasons for protest such as free expression.</p><p>This piece is organized into three main sections: first, I give a brief historical analysis of the history of GM crops in Europe (more detail can be found in the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ifW7eK28HnUua49Y1cChb1UrU12HI2xYHF9kBUR3qQ/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>appendix</u></a>); second, I analyze whether the important reasons why GM protests succeed correspond to the AI case; finally, I set out recommendations for protest groups.&nbsp;</p><h1>3) Brief History of GM Crops</h1><p>(For more detail about GM history, please consult the appendix, found <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ifW7eK28HnUua49Y1cChb1UrU12HI2xYHF9kBUR3qQ/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>here</u></a>.)</p><p>Background: 1973-1996, Birth of Genetic Engineering technology, Public &amp; Politicians Didn\u2019t Care:</p><ul><li>In 1973, scientists spliced genes into E. coli bacteria. By 1982, scientists produced the first transgenic plant, and Genetically Modified (GM) crops were first commercialized by 1992.&nbsp;</li><li>From 1980s, activist groups, including the (e.g., German Green Party, UK Green Alliance) questioned the safety of GMOs, and tried to persuade policymakers to regulate more.</li><li>Public Didn\u2019t Care: in the mid-1980s the public was largely unaware of what GM technology was.</li><li>Politicians Didn\u2019t Care: there were essentially no regulations on GMOs in Europe until 1990</li></ul><p>In the late 1990s, this all changed dramatically \u2013&nbsp;in three stages.&nbsp;</p><p>Stage 1: Public Perceptions Shift Rapidly: 1996-1997&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Public opposition to GMOs in Europe rose dramatically from 1996-1999, with double digit increases in many countries.</li><li>This coincided with key 'trigger events' like Mad Cow Disease and the arrival of GM crops in March 1996, and cloning of Dolly the Sheep in February 1997</li><li>\u2018Trigger events\u2019 were not logically connected to GM food. This period coincided with increased anti-GM mobilization and expanded protest tactics by NGOs.</li><li>The quantity and negative tone of media coverage on GMOs increased during this period. Media coverage likely amplified public perceptions of risk.</li></ul><p>Stage 2: National Policy Changes: 1997-1999</p><ul><li>In 1997, many European countries enacted unilateral bans on GMOs which had been approved by the EU.</li><li>Corporate campaigns forced all major supermarkets to remove GMOs from products from March 1998 to Spring of 1999</li><li>Anti-GM protestors had elite allies (e.g., Green Parties) in national governments in many countries. This likely aided their policy success.</li><li>Decentralization of biotech policy was crucial - national governments could set their own rules.</li><li>There was a broad anti-GMO coalition of NGOs, consumer groups, religious groups, and farmers. There was not an \u2018unholy alliance\u2019 of environmentalists and protectionists (in farming and biotechnology). NGOs overwhelmed opposed vested interests who were opposed.</li></ul><p>Stage 3: Strict Europe-Wide Regulation 1999-2001</p><ul><li>Europe saw a de facto moratorium on new GMO approvals from 1999-2002 and tightened labeling laws, with long-lasting effects: by 2018, less than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7553740/\"><u>0.1 million hectares</u></a> of GM crops were grown annually in Europe, versus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjnlfXW9YyCAxVIilwKHSYqN-UQFnoECA0QAw&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgeneticliteracyproject.org%2F2019%2F09%2F05%2Fus-world-leader-in-gmo-research-cultivation-growing-75-million-hectares-in-2018%2F%23%3A~%3Atext%3DGenetic%2520Literacy%2520Project-%2CUS%2520world%2520leader%2520in%2520GMO%2520research%252C%2520cultivation%25E2%2580%2594growing%2C75%2520million%2520hectares%2520in%25202018%26text%3DThe%2520US%2520remains%2520as%2520the%2C%252Dbiotech%2520Applications%2520(ISAAA).&amp;usg=AOvVaw2rKQD43pSXMb2bIK65OTci&amp;opi=89978449\"><u>&gt;70 million hectares in US</u></a></li><li>This 'ratcheting up' was driven by a patchwork of national regulations that led firms to support EU harmonization.</li><li>Decentralization allowed more stringent countries to block EU-level decisions, preventing downward harmonization.</li><li>Continued NGO campaigns increased issue salience and opposition.</li><li>Broader EU precautionary culture was relevant but differences from the US may be overstated.</li><li>Decentralization again stands out as a crucial factor enabling national policy shifts to drive Europe-wide ratcheting up.</li></ul><h1>4) Can Protests Pause AI?&nbsp;</h1><p>In this section, I analyse whether the factor which enabled GM protests to succeed correspond for AI. These factors are organized into \u2018reasons for optimism\u2019 (suggesting that AI protests might be effective now), \u2018reasons for pessimism\u2019 (hindrances for AI protests which may not change anytime soon), and \u2018key uncertainties\u2019.&nbsp;</p><h2>A) Reasons for Optimism</h2><h3>I) The public is worried&nbsp;</h3><p>Protests are more likely to influence policymakers if prior public opinion is supportive<a><sup><u>[2]</u></sup></a>. In the GMO case, many European countries had high levels of pre-existing opposition to GMOs before the \u2018trigger events\u2019 of 1996/1997. Opposition was particularly pronounced in the 5 countries essentially held the European Commission hostage in June 1999 by refusing to approve any new GMOs: the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9523.2008.00473.x\"><u>\u201chardest blow\u201d</u></a> to GM-friendly regulation.</p><p>Similarly, the public is worried about AI development. Around 45% of Americans think that AI could cause human extinction.<a><sup><u>[3]</u></sup></a> Over 50% of Americans would support a pause to some kinds of AI development.<a><sup><u>[4]</u></sup></a></p><p>However, the public are more worried about other hazards, including nuclear weapons, world war, climate change, or a pandemic. In terms of perceived risk, AI ranked only slightly above natural disasters like \u2018asteroids\u2019 and \u2018acts of God\u2019.<a><sup><u>[5]</u></sup></a> Across multiple polls, other hazards tend to be viewed as riskier than AI by the public. Opposition is not yet overwhelming compared to other issues.</p><p>Another concern is whether opposition to AI development is stable. Polls might be biased by different \u2018framing effects\u2019, as established in other areas (e.g. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/2669279\"><u>government spending</u></a>). When reviewing different AI surveys,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wiki.aiimpacts.org/doku.php?id=responses_to_ai%3Apublic_opinion_on_ai%3Asurveys_of_public_opinion_on_ai%3Asurveys_of_us_public_opinion_on_ai&amp;ref=campaignforaisafety.org\"><u>AI Impacts</u></a> found \u201csubstantial differences between responses to similar questions\u201d. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/170401_crosstabs_Brands_v3_AG.pdf\"><u>Morning Consult</u></a> (2017) found that 50% of Americans believed that AI is humanity's greatest existential threat, contradicting results from the surveys mentioned above. Other incoherencies are present on AI timelines, AI and jobs, and levels of positivity towards AI. However, unlike other areas, support for a pause seems fairly resistant to various different framings, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/technology/survey-results/daily/2023/04/03/ad825/2\"><u>YouGov (April, 2023)</u></a> found.&nbsp;</p><p>Another concern is how \u2018deep\u2019 opposition to AI development is: would the public\u2019s concern about AI development make them write to their MP, change their voting behavior, or incur some personal costs? One survey suggests that AI is the most important political issue<a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx\"><u> for less than 0.5%</u></a> of Americans. Perhaps, then, opposition to AI should be disregarded as shallow?</p><p>No. Alongside AI, less than 0.5% of Americans view Medicare or Social Security as their top priority. Does the public care about Medicare or Social Security? Studies on willingness to pay for regulation would reveal how deep concern for AI is: at present, it is unclear.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://blog.aiimpacts.org/p/us-public-opinion-on-ai-september#footnote-2-137052473\"><u>Overall</u></a>, the public is pessimistic about AI development, and broadly supportive of more caution, even if we can\u2019t be sure how deep this concern runs. This pre-existing support is beneficial for AI protests.</p><h3>II) Media Narratives Matter</h3><p>An increasingly hostile media environment was crucial for public perceptions rapidly shifting against Europe in the late 1990s.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/gm-foods#ftnt84\"><u>Nearly every EU country saw GMO opposition rise</u></a> from 1996 to 1999, most by double digits: France went from 46% opposed to 65%, Greece from 51% to 81%, Britain from 33% to 51%. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/7109115/media-libre.pdf?1390849992=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DThe_dramatisation_of_biotechnology_in_el.pdf&amp;Expires=1698011782&amp;Signature=JEhJx043NvNVU-Y9mlDD8hy1EJQ2kYLPxzTWVMBri8fpBZ7SVSXrhmOz0CN3UeRCL-OCTATT7gB6LCKNURuuuZCcyqowqweFxGSaHJX8zylRNyHDo6sDlY70QxWDM4~GoOBeGNBqZJqlrzWapPdK84ZsO0nolaGkHm2sYIRxVEc8pwq4QwV3PbZTLDwrSp1Tyqx0wgxqvyt2qrmla1B5Hf8eX0hPACoTnikaHy5~qd1Wj8ZoMHVEs4okzO-vnNU85OtOE4az~qAAh9JpKp43FCBOL-OuOAa3UMkvsnG-78wMn0OhipwF6zLafhlwsYlvFNnpdIcNhDkcCIZ8whR5HQ__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA\"><u>\u2018dramatization\u2019</u></a> of GMOs in newspapers, emphasizing its risks and de-emphasizing its benefits, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ijpor/article/17/1/63/771385\"><u>made its readers more opposed</u></a>. Media tone was likely more significant than media quantity, which, when considered alone, probably&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ijpor/article-abstract/17/1/23/771376?redirectedFrom=fulltext\"><u>did not affect perceptions</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The same may be true for AI: media tone is crucial. Experimental research from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3vZWhCYBFn8wS4Tfw/crosspost-ai-x-risk-in-the-news-how-effective-are-recent\"><u>Existential Risk Observatory</u></a>suggests that exposure to media coverage of AI existential-risk increases support for a pause an experiment from the suggested that exposing people to AI existential risk media increased support for pausing research.</p><p>In contrast, the sheer quantity of AI news, alone, does not make people more skeptical. While coverage of AI has increased&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0736585320300927\"><u>substantially</u></a> over the past decade,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/10635\"><u>perceptions have not changed much</u></a>. We might expect the release of Chat GPT to have changed this: anecdotally, existential risk seems to be in the news more, and people are speaking about it more. This doesn\u2019t seem appear in the data.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09537\"><u>One study</u></a> which uses the content of AI-related posts on Twitter/X as a proxy for public opinion, that post-GPT period saw heightened <i>awareness</i> but <i>no significant shift in sentiment</i> towards AI. Similarly, YouGov\u2019s \u2018Robot Tracker\u2019 has not shown significant shifts in public perceptions in any of its three areas: future&nbsp;<a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/robot-intelligence\"><u>robot intelligence levels</u></a>, optimism regarding&nbsp;<a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/ability-to-add-skills\"><u>ability to acquire new skills</u></a> if automation leads to redundancy, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/trackers/worry-about-automation\"><u>perceived risks of lifetime unemployment due to robots</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Public perceptions have not substantially shifted, in part, because prominent narratives about AI in the media are generally positive. \u2018Apocalyptic narratives\u2019 \u2013 those emphasizing existential risk \u2013&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0736585320300927\"><u>made up around 5% of news articles until 2020</u></a>. More common themes included emphasizing the everyday benefits of AI (39%). Similarly to perceptions of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11051-005-7526-2\"><u>nanotechnology</u></a> in the 2000s and self-driving cars between 2017-2018<a><sup><u>[6]</u></sup></a>, positive media tone outweighed the negative effect of increased attention.&nbsp;</p><p>However, high profile AI protests could shift the media narrative towards existential risk, and thus push public perceptions further in their favor.</p><h3>III) Messaging AI-risk isn\u2019t hard</h3><p>A reason for pessimism I considered was that messaging existential risk from AI might be significantly more difficult to message than the risks from GM crops: first, because pausing AI would impose higher costs on consumers; and second, because AI development is inevitably perceived as more natural than GMOs.&nbsp;</p><p>The first claim is that, unlike GMOs, perhaps pausing AI may impose higher costs on consumers.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.0272-4332.2004.00421.x\"><u>A key factor explaining the public\u2019s resistance</u></a> to GM technology was that it failed to offer clear benefits to them. GM foods brought marginal cost reductions but did not offer much other benefits. Similar genetic technology, when used in a medical context, offered much&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt0900_935\"><u>greater personal benefits and public support</u></a>. In contrast, AI offers tangible benefits, and is used by over<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/02/15/public-awareness-of-artificial-intelligence-in-everyday-activities/#:~:text=About%20a%20quarter%20(27%25),interact%20with%20AI%20less%20often.\"><u> a quarter of the public</u></a> on a daily basis. In an analysis of tweets,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09537\"><u>one study found that</u></a> occupations with high AI exposure expressed more positivity about AI \u2013 with illustrators being the one exception. If consumers genuinely value AI \u2013 the more they use it, the more positive they are \u2013 perhaps, a pause would impose high costs on consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>However, restrictions on training future models wouldn\u2019t necessitate banning the current AI systems that consumers use. Further, just because occupation exposure correlates with positivity,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_fallacy\"><u>this does not mean the same is true at an individual level</u></a>. Polling from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/results_AI_and_the_End_of_Humanity.pdf\"><u>YouGov&nbsp;</u></a>actually found the opposite: finding that people who use AI tools more often have greater levels of concern about AI. I am skeptical, therefore, that pausing AI will entail great personal sacrifices from consumers.</p><p>Another worry about messaging AI risk is that AI development will be perceived as more \u2018natural\u2019 than GMOs. The development of GMOs was seen as a unique change of humanity\u2019s relationship with nature: developing \u201cFrankenfoods\u201d, to take a common anti-GM slogan, disrupted of the quasi-religious \u2018natural\u2019 order. In contrast, continued AI development is, well, a continuation: another step in a completely man-made chain of digital innovation<a><sup><u>[7]</u></sup></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, whilst activists believed that GM crops posed tangible near-term risks \u2013 toxicity to humans and animals, damage to eco-systems \u2013 AI protest groups tend to emphasize AI\u2019s future risks. &nbsp;</p><p>These last two problems are notable and provide strong motivations for protest groups to pay particular attention to messaging effectively (see below). However, they are not insurmountable: if AI-risk was impossible to communicate, why are such a large portion of the public concerned?</p><h3>IV) Small Protests can Work</h3><p>Small groups of anti-GM protestors, who took over Monsanto\u2019s headquarters dressed as superheroes or who protested naked at the World Food Summit, gained significant media attention. I have not found any cases of large-scale mobilizations against GMOs in the late 1990s involving tens of thousands of people.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, cases of small-scale AI protests have received outsized media attention: for example, one protest in May 2023, when UCL hosted Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, was covered in many news outlets<a><u>[4]</u></a>&nbsp;<a><sup><u>[8]</u></sup></a>. The strategic timing of this protest was key. Altman was on a \u2018world-tour\u2019 to discuss AI, and had met with Rishi Sunak the previous day, and media outlets wanted to cover AI policy anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While building larger protest movements is undoubtedly helpful, the GM case shows that large protests are not <i>necessary</i> for having widespread impacts on public opinion, and policy. This is not to suggest that small protests are always effective. It is also indicative that other factors external to protest groups (e.g., trigger events, political allies, pre-existing public opinion, allies within media organizations) are important. However, if you believe that AI protests are doomed to fail simply because they are small scale, the GM case shows a clear counterexample.&nbsp;</p><h3>V) Biotech Lobby &gt; AI Lobby</h3><p>The biotechnology industry organized to support GMOs in Europe, but they were overcome by activist campaigns. This holds an important lesson for AI policy today.</p><p>In the late 1990s, the GM seed market had suddenly become extremely lucrative, with global sales reaching <a href=\"https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1475-6765.00099\"><u>$2.3 billion in 1999</u></a> \u2013&nbsp;up from roughly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/harvest/exist/\"><u>$75 million in 1995</u></a>. The GM sector was dominated by a series of powerful firms: Monsanto, Syngenta, and Aventis held roughly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ejpr.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1475-6765.00099\"><u>50% market share</u></a>. Monsanto had a huge market capitalization of over&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-dec-20-fi-45727-story.html\"><u>$25 billion</u></a>: over $47 billion in today's terms.</p><p>How does the current \u2018AI market\u2019 compare? It is difficult to find equivalent figures for global sales from \u2018frontier AI\u2019 systems. The market capitalization of Big Tech firms working invested in \u2018frontier AI\u2019 systems is huge:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/263264/top-companies-in-the-world-by-market-capitalization/\"><u>almost $5 trillion</u></a> for Amazon/Google/Amazon combined. (Individual AI labs are much smaller: OpenAI and Anthropic are valued at around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/08/microsofts-complex-bet-on-openai-brings-potential-and-uncertainty.html\"><u>$30 billion</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/alphabet-backed-ai-startup-anthropic-raises-450-million-funding-freeze-thaws-2023-05-23/\"><u>$5 billion</u></a> respectively). These figures suggest that Big Tech has a much larger <i>lobbying potential&nbsp;</i>than the biotechnology industry in the 90s. Indeed, technology firms spend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://corporateeurope.org/en/2021/08/lobby-network-big-techs-web-influence-eu\"><u>over \u20ac97 million annually</u></a> in Europe on lobbying, and spent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2023-02/The%20Lobbying%20Ghost%20in%20the%20Machine.pdf\"><u>$70 million in 2021</u></a> in US.&nbsp;</p><p>Lobbying has extended to AI regulation. Google, Microsoft and OpenAI have all pushed to water down the EU AI Act.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://corporateeurope.org/sites/default/files/2023-02/The%20Lobbying%20Ghost%20in%20the%20Machine.pdf\"><u>Over half of the expert group advising the European Commission</u></a> were industry representatives, and firms have held private meetings with regulators.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/6288245/openai-eu-lobbying-ai-act/\"><u>OpenAI lobbied</u></a> for its systems like GPT-3 and DALL-E to not be designated high-risk, and several of its proposed amendments made it into the final legislation. In July 2023, major AI firms recently formed a \"Frontier Model Forum\".&nbsp;<a href=\"https://techmonitor.ai/technology/ai-and-automation/frontier-model-forum-openai-google-microsoft-anthropic\"><u>Spokesmen</u></a> have emphasized this is not a lobbying organization \u2013 contrary to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/07/26/microsoft-google-openai-anthropic-lobby-frontier-model-forum-regulation/\"><u>some commentators</u></a>\u2019 suggestions.</p><p>However, AI lobbying probably does not significantly exceed the levels that Biotech firms spent in the late 1990s.

I doubt Big Tech and AI companies are spending at these levels on AI lobbying. This may well change in the future. Corporate investment in AGI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03895dc4-a3b7-481e-95cc-336a524f2ac2\"><u>is booming</u></a>. OpenAI has three opening in policy areas at time of writing, and Sam Atlman has suggested that OpenAI may try to raise as much as $100 billion,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-losses-doubled-to-540-million-as-it-developed-chatgpt\"><u>making OpenAI</u></a> \u201cthe most capital-intensive startup in Silicon Valley history\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>However, for now, AI lobbying is likely not more extensive than the powerful Biotechnology Lobby of the 1990s: a lobby which activists in Europe overwhelmed.&nbsp;</p><h2>B) Reasons for Pessimism</h2><h3>I) Who are the Political Allies?</h3><p>Protests GM crops were undoubtedly helped by elite political allies \u2013 MPs from different parties (Greens &amp; Christian Democrats) who were both in government, and sympathetic to protestors\u2019 contentions.</p><p>Many elite allies take the existential implications of AI seriously, particularly in the UK. The UK\u2019s Foundation Model Taskforce is chaired by Ian Hogarth, who <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/03895dc4-a3b7-481e-95cc-336a524f2ac2\"><u>wrote about AI existential risk in the FT</u></a>, and is advised by Matt Clifford who has warned that AI could <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/ai-artificial-intelligence-kill-humans-sunak-b2352099.html\"><u>\u201ckill many humans\u201d</u></a> in only two years\u2019 time.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/rishi-sunak-artificial-intelligence-pivot-safety-summit-united-kingdom-silicon-valley-effective-altruism/\"><u>Two of the four partner organizations</u></a> for the Taskforce (ARC Evals, and Centre for AI Safety) are explicitly concerned with existential risk. In the US,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/13/open-philanthropy-funding-ai-policy-00121362\"><u>several of the leading Senators working on AI policy</u></a> have staffers who are funded by Open Philanthropy, including the three top lieutenants of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, as well as Sen. Richard Blumenthal. It remains to be seen how much influence these staffers have over final legislation.</p><p>It is less clear how many elite allies exist in Europe. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EU_Commission/status/1702295053668946148\"><u>European Commission has declared</u></a> that \u201cMitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority\u201d. The European AI Act includes some restrictions on \u2018general-purpose AI\u2019. Some MEPs from the \u2018Left\u2019 and \u2018Green\u2019 block <a href=\"https://corporateeurope.org/en/2023/02/lobbying-ghost-machine\"><u>proposed amendments</u></a> to classify these models as \u201chigh risk\u201d. However, it is unclear how much support these amendments gained. Classifying GPAI as \u2018high-risk\u2019 might has had support from both the \u2018AI ethics\u2019 and \u2018AI safety\u2019 communities<a><sup><u>[9]</u></sup></a>: it is unclear what motivations these MEPs had.&nbsp;</p><p>However, believing AI is an existential risk might even be anti-correlated for supporting a pause to AI development : if you think that transformative AI systems are coming soon, you might be particularly concerned about China developing them first. Rishi Sunak has advocated for \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RishiSunak/status/1670355987457294337\"><u>dramatically speeding up UK AI capability</u></a>\u201d. Chuck Schumer\u2019s AI framework, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.mayerbrown.com/en/perspectives-events/publications/2023/07/president-biden-convenes-with-ai-industry-leaders-senator-schumer-proposes-new-safe-ai-innovation-framework\"><u>SAFE Innovation</u></a>\u201d, does not try to slow down AI development: as its name suggests, it promotes \u2018ethical\u2019 US-led AI innovation.</p><p>Protests calling for a pause to AI development do not have Political Parties allied with their goals who are in power \u2013 like GM protests did in the late 1990s. This factor clearly impedes their likelihood of achieving a pause to AI development at present.&nbsp;</p><h3>II) Messaging and Strategy</h3><p>AI protests additionally have problems messaging \u2018AI existential risk\u2019 in a salient way, lack allies, and lack a diversity of protest strategies. I don\u2019t think these problems are insurmountable, as I set out in the \u2018Recommendations\u2019 section.&nbsp;</p><h2>C) Key Uncertainties</h2><h3>I) Will there be AI \u2018trigger events\u2019?</h3><p>The GMO case also shows that \u2018trigger events\u2019 \u2013 in combination with strategic activism \u2013 are vitally important for changes in public opinion.&nbsp;Three different high-profile events - the outbreak of Mad Cow Disease and the arrival of GM crops in Europe in March 1996, and the cloning of Dolly the Sheep in February 1997 - led to an exponential increase in media coverage, which was increasingly skeptical of GMOs.</p><p>The GMO case suggests that, conditional&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-resource-100913-012630\"><u>on \u2018trigger events\u2019 and protests</u></a>, regulatory culture can rapidly becomemuch more precautionary \u2013 in the space of a few years. More generally, there is no God-given \u201cAmerican\u201d approach to regulation which favors innovation, as opposed to the \u201cEuropean\u201d alternative which prioritizes precaution. From the 1960s to mid-1980s, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://faculty.haas.berkeley.edu/vogel/uk%20oct.pdf\"><u>US was more precautionary than Europe&nbsp;</u></a>on various hazards. A study from 2013, averaging across different technologies,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://institutdelors.eu/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/precautionprincipleuseu-fabry-garbasso-ne-jdi-july14-1.pdf\"><u>found no significant difference</u></a> in overall levels of regulatory precaution.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This gives reasons for optimism for AI protests. At present, the regulatory approach to AI is more precautionary in Europe, with bans mandated by the EU AI Act on certain \u2018high-risk\u2019 systems. In contrast, the US has no federal AI regulation, at present, instead has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://corporateeurope.org/en/2023/02/lobbying-ghost-machine\"><u>voluntary frameworks and self-assessment tools</u></a> such as the AI Risk Management Framework and the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. However, the US is not exactly the \u2018wild West\u2019 of AI regulation. Some US states have acted unilaterally to regulate AI<a><sup><u>[10]</u></sup></a>. Recently, there was a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/senators-want-chatgpt-ai-to-require-government-license/\"><u>bipartisan proposal&nbsp;</u></a>from Josh Hawley which included federal licensing for frontier models.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/09/13/schumer-senate-ai-policy-00115794\"><u>The US Senate seems split</u></a> on both the timeline for AI regulation, and how far it should go: some proposed frameworks have included third-party audits of AI systems, for example.&nbsp;</p><p>In tandem with high-profile \u2018trigger events\u2019, AI protests might nudge US regulatory culture in a significantly more cautionary direction, as happened in Europe on GMOs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So, what would an AI Trigger Event Look Like? More generally, <a href=\"https://ayni.institute/massprotest/\"><u>\u2018trigger event\u2019</u></a>, as defined by theorist Bill Moyer, is a \u201chighly publicized, shocking incident... which dramatically reveals a critical social problem to the public in a vivid way.\u201d (A closely related concept is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://masscommons.wordpress.com/2018/07/24/this-is-an-uprising-moments-of-the-whirlwind/\"><u>\u201cmoment of the whirlwind\u201d</u></a>.)</p><p>Some would point to the release of Chat GPT3 in November 2022. But it did not lead to widespread public mobilization. As mentioned above, public sentiment towards AI likely didn\u2019t even shift substantially.</p><p>Perhaps there will be genuine \u2018trigger events\u2019 in the future. What might they look like?</p><p>It is important to distinguish here between a \u2018trigger event\u2019, in the context of protest movements, from a \u2018warning shot\u2019. This latter term, within AI safety circles, refers to an AI incident which causes or demonstrates the potential for <a href=\" situation in which AI visibly causes significant but not catastrophic damage\">\u2018significant harm\u2019 to humanity, short of causing extinction</a>. These \u2018warning shots\u2019 might include an AI trying to autonomously engineer a pathogen (actually causing harm), or attempting to hack a data-center (demonstrating harmful potential).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbj3h44dcr4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbj3h44dcr4\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>Warning shots could indeed mobilize the public. Consider the meltdown of the Three Mile Island power station in 1979 which, demonstrated the risks of nuclear power (i.e.<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NyCHoZGGw5YssvDJB/lessons-from-three-mile-island-for-ai-warning-shots\"><u> \u2018warning shot\u2019</u></a> , and thus led to large public mobilizations (\u2018trigger event\u2019). If the only plausible events which could lead to public mobilization were &nbsp;\u2018warning shots\u2019: some have suggested that pausing AI seems <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kageSSDLSMpuwkPKK/response-to-recent-criticisms-of-longtermism-1#Technological_Development_\">\"highly implausible\" without a disaster</a>. Perhaps AI won\u2019t have any high-profie, shocking \u2018warning shots\u2019. It if it does, it might be too late. &nbsp;</p><p>However, \u2018trigger events\u2019 do not have be catastrophic disasters. Trigger events are often highly symbolic acts which protest an injustice.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ayni.institute/massprotest/\"><u>Consider&nbsp;</u></a>the arrest of Rosa Parks in 1955, leading to a community-wide boycott, or the self-immolation of Muhammad Bouazizi in Tunisia, which catalyzed the Arab Spring Protests in 2o11. Corresponding \u2018trigger events\u2019 for AI might include&nbsp;AI safety researchers going on strike to protest existential risk, or large-scale redundancies from automation.</p><p>Additionally, \u2018trigger events\u2019 which don\u2019t threaten harm can lead to a \u2018social amplification\u2019 of risk. The \u2018trigger events\u2019 in the GMO case \u2013 cloning of Dolly the Sheep, outbreak of an unrelated disease \u2013 fall squarely into this category. There is some evidence that the public\u2019s perception of AI risk already has already been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00146-019-00924-9\"><u>\u2018socially amplified</u></a>\u2019. Risk perceptions have not responded to evidence of harm from AI: e.g. accidents involving driverless cars, or algorithms leading to market crashes. Instead, the positioning of AI experts (e.g. Stephen Hawking, Geoffrey Hinton) is the significant mover of public perceptions.&nbsp;</p><p>What might socially-amplified \u2018trigger events\u2019 look like for AI? One example might be a new LLM passes some symbolic benchmark, e.g., Mustafa Suleyman\u2019s \u201cModern Turing Test\u201d<a><sup><u>[11]</u></sup></a>. Another might be a breakthrough in \u2018Whole Brain Emulation\u2019: like the cloning of Dolly the Sheep, this might represent a \u2018Frankenstein moment\u2019 indicative of an \u2018unnatural\u2019 relationship with technology.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, while AI protests have not benefited from any \u2018trigger events\u2019 thus far, these might happen in the coming years prior to any endgame \u2018warning shots\u2019. Activism could shift public perceptions of risk before it\u2019s too late. But, when these \u2018trigger event\u2019 might occur is highly uncertain and out of the control of protest groups.</p><h3>II) Will Corporate Campaigns Work for AI?</h3><p>The success of consumer campaigns in Europe by NGOs were significant for eventual restrictions. Friends of the Earth pressured supermarkets to remove GMOs from their shelves, through leafleting and media campaigns. Iceland abandoned GMOs in March 1998 followed by other major European supermarkets and manufacturers in Spring 1999. These victories signaled to policymakers that consumers preferred traditional crops. The importance of corporate campaigns should not be overestimated: they reinforced a pre-existing trend towards stricter regulation of GMOs which started in 1997, with unilateral GMOs bans. However, corporate campaigns did, in part, help enable the de-facto GMO moratorium which began in June 1999.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, corporate campaigns seem unlikely to stop AI development, for at least three reasons. First, firms are not building models like ChatGPT for near-term profit \u2013 OpenAI lost&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/open-ai-lost-half-billion-making-chatgpt-cost/\"><u>$540 million developing ChatGPT in 2022</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hashcollision.substack.com/p/behind-the-hype-a-deep-dive-into\"><u>some estimates suggest</u></a> it will make a loss of over $1 billion in 2023. Second, AI is spread across many uses making boycotts infeasible. Thirdly, many \u2018frontier AI\u2019 models are offered freely, limiting pressure from consumer preference shifts.</p><p>However, corporate campaigns could change AI firms\u2019 behaviour: e.g. in adopting additional safety policies. There are several examples of Big Tech firms bowing to public pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, YouTube adjusted its algorithm in 2019 to prevent right-wing&nbsp;radicalisation, following building public pressure<a><sup><u>[12]</u></sup></a>. Proceeding its decision, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/08/technology/youtube-radical.html\"><u>Caleb Cain</u></a> released a personal testimonial into who he became radicalized via YouTube after dropping out from university.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bellingcat.com/news/americas/2018/10/11/memes-infowars-75-fascist-activists-red-pilled/\"><u>Robert Evan</u></a>s, an investigative journalist, found 15 fascist groups which credited their formation to experiences on YouTube.&nbsp;</p><p>Another notable case is Google's involvement with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://api.repository.cam.ac.uk/server/api/core/bitstreams/1b5dfc6c-08b9-4ba0-bdba-ea964d83900b/content#:~:text=The%20AI%20community%20has%20responded,political%20campaigning%2C%20organising%20and%20advocacy.\"><u>Project Maven</u></a>,&nbsp; a Department of Defense project which uses AI to distinguish people and objects in drone video. After this project was disclosed in March 2018, 3,000 employees signed an Open Letter opposing this collaboration, prompting Google to announce in June that it would not renew the Project Maven contract. Thus, even if corporate campaigns cannot bring about a stop to AI development, they might change firms\u2019 behaviour. This is unclear though: there has not been high-profile AI corporate campaigns to date.</p><h3>III) A race-to-the-top in AI regulation?</h3><p>Decentralization was an important feature of why GM crop protests succeeded in Europe. Decentralized, democratic decision-making gave more \u2018entry points\u2019 for activists, allowing protests to wield greater influence in Europe as compared to the centralized, bureaucratic decision making in the US. Once national policy changed in a few national European states, there was a \u2018ratcheting up\u2019: the Commission defaulted to the <i>highest common denominator</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>How decentralized is AI regulation? While Italy was able to ban ChatGPT over privacy concerns in 2023, the EU AI Act will centralize AI regulation. Member countries won\u2019t be able to implement more stringent rules on \u2018frontier models\u2019 than the provisions set out under the EU AIA<a><sup><u>[13]</u></sup></a>. (Perhaps they will be able to do so via the GDPR: I am unsure.) In contrast, AI regulation in the US is currently a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02491-y#:~:text=The%20EU%20is%20highly%20precautionary,been%20the%20most%20hands%2Doff.\"><u>patchwork of rules</u></a> which differ by state and city<a><sup><u>[14]</u></sup></a>.</p><p>Decentralization benefited GM protesters in Europe but may not aid AI protesters. Decentralized US policymaking gives more influence to corporate lobbyists -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/why-lobbying-in-america-is-different/\"><u>one study</u></a> found similar success rates for both corporate and citizen group-run lobbying in Europe (around 60%), versus 40% for citizens and 89% for corporations in the US.&nbsp;</p><p>There is unlikely to be a \u2018race-to-the-top in AI regulation between different US states. Restrictions on the deployment of \u2018frontier models\u2019 at a state-level would face many difficulties. For example, after Italy banned Chat GPT, there was a 400% increase<a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/news/vpn-downloads-skyrocket-following-italy-chatgpt-ban\"><u> in VPN downloads</u></a>. Montana\u2019s proposed ban on TikTok, due to start in 2024, would be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/montana-tiktok-ban/\"><u>similarly difficult to enforce</u></a>. Restrictions or bans on the <i>development&nbsp;</i>of \u2018frontier models\u2019 are possible but would also have to come from the federal government. If California decided to introduce sweeping restrictions on how \u2018frontier models\u2019 are trained, Big Tech companies could simply move their headquarters to Texas, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chron.com/culture/article/california-texas-tech-workers-18346616.php\"><u>Oracle and Tesla have done</u></a>. AI executives have already threatened restrictive jurisdictions: in 2023,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/6282325/sam-altman-openai-eu/\"><u>Sam Altman threatened</u></a> to \"cease operating\" in Europe if the EU's AI Act overregulated the industry.</p><p>While decentralization aided GM crop protesters in Europe, it may not benefit AI protesters. Centralized EU policymaking may reduce corporate lobbying power, and \u2018ratcheting-up\u2019 of regulation between US states is unlikely.&nbsp;</p><h1>5) Recommendations for Protest Groups</h1><p>There are several areas within messaging and strategy in which AI protests could be more effective.&nbsp;</p><h2>A) Rage Against the Machine</h2><p>Intellectualizing about future risks does not mobilize the public. Unlike GMO opponents, who &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.285.5426.384\"><u>thought principally in terms of moral acceptability</u></a>, AI protestors currently focus on risks, using slogans like, \u201c10% chance of extinction is too high\u201d. &nbsp;Instead, they should focus on injustice.&nbsp;</p><p>Intellectual arguments do not inspire collective action \u2013 they make bad \u2018collective action frames\u2019 \u2013 because emotions are the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo3629802.html\"><u>\u2018moral battery\u2019</u></a> which power intellectual arguments. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/223459\">'Injustice' is ubiquitous across almost all social movements</a>, except religious or self-help groups. The 'collective action frames' for basically all political groups present some wrong, perpetrated by some agent, which requires a solution.</p><p>It is fairly obvious that PauseAI is protesting against existential risk from AI, and that their desired solution a global moratorium. However, injustice also identifies a cause. While heavy rain might be a inconvenient problem with a clear solution (e.g. bring an umbrella) it is not an injustice. In the GM case, protestors targeted firms like Monsanto with phrases like \u2018Monsatan\u2019. In contrast, AI protests have been reluctant to target Big Tech, because the real fault lies with \u2018capitalism\u2019, \u2018the AI arms race\u2019, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\"><u>\u201cMoloch\u201d</u></a>, a monster symbolic of humanity\u2019s endemic collective action problems.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this is both conceptually wrong and rhetorically ineffective. Blaming \u2018Moloch\u2019 ignores the agency that humanity and protestors have over corporations (consider fossil fuels, CFCs, GMOS) and geopolitical incentives (consider nukes and nuclear power). Blaming the \u2018AI arms race\u2019 is rhetorically ineffective fails to identify a blameworthy agent. By identifying the \u2018villains\u2019 of AI development, Big Tech firms, AI protestors could build a stronger shared collective identity and appear more agentic.&nbsp;</p><p>What might an \u2018injustice framing\u2019 look like? It might emphasize the hypocrisy of Tech CEOs and politicians who recognize existential risks from AI but want to continue development anyway. Or it might emphasize the unfair and anti-democratic nature of a group of elite CEOs unilaterally deciding to build AGI, on behalf of all of humanity.&nbsp;</p><p>More sympathetic narratives might pose less risks of alienating allies within Big Tech. However, if AI protests are looking to broaden their appeal to the public they should focus on injustice.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mQGrGC5W6wkC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=%22Abstract+argument+about+complex+indirect+and+future+effects+will+not+forge+the+emotional+linkage+even+if+people+are+convinced+intellectually%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eHangXbm3Z&amp;sig=ACfU3U1V5wEg53tfThitSVddq4g8b9HT8Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi40aXhkoqCAxXdSEEAHfVyAosQ6AF6BAgOEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Abstract%20argument%20about%20complex%20indirect%20and%20future%20effects%20will%20not%20forge%20the%20emotional%20linkage%20even%20if%20people%20are%20convinced%20intellectually%22&amp;f=false\"><u>As William Gamson wrote</u></a>: \u201cAbstract arguments about complex indirect and future effects will not forge the emotional linkage even if people are convinced intellectually.\u201d</p><h2>B) Find Allies&nbsp;</h2><h3>I) Artists are the Bootleggers</h3><p>Alliances between activists and vested interests are particularly powerful. In the era of prohibition, \u2018baptists\u2019 who thought that alcohol was immoral allied with \u2018bootleggers\u2019, illicit alcohol vendors. And alliances of \u2018baptists and bootleggers\u2019, or moralists and vested interests, have helped enact regulation in countless areas:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/135017697344064\"><u>from recycling in Denmark and Canada, to car emissions control in Germany</u></a>, to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/48617481\"><u>digital policy in Italy</u></a>. The allies of GM protestors (e.g. farmers) had other important non-economic motivations (see appendix). However, the diversity of the anti-GM coalition, which included consumer groups, concerned scientists, and religious groups, was undoubtedly helpful: diverse protests are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.socialchangelab.org/post/what-makes-a-protest-movement-successful\"><u>more likely to succeed</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Artists could be natural allies for AI protests. Both PauseAI and artists are most concerned about \u2018frontier models\u2019 which scrape data from the internet, and can be used to generate \u2018artistic\u2019 content, thus threatening jobs. Writers and actors represented by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and SAG-AFTRA respectively recently went on strike, with the WGA leader citing this as<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2023/08/15/american-workers-v-technological-progress-the-battle-heats-up\"><u> part of labor's wider struggle against technological change</u></a>. Artists have started lobbying against GAI art, forming the European Guild for Artificial Intelligence Regulation in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80.lv/articles/egair-a-european-initiative-aimed-to-regulate-the-use-of-ai/\"><u>February 2023</u></a>, and have filed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/q8jxedwSKBdWA3nH7/we-are-not-alone-many-communities-want-to-stop-big-tech-from\"><u>six copyright lawsuits in the US</u></a>. If these lawsuits are successful, it might become increasingly difficult to train \u2018frontier models\u2019: technology firms might have to manually remove artistic content from their training data as the artists demand<a><sup><u>[15]</u></sup></a>. AI existential risk protests could play a pivotal role by offering public support and fundraising.</p><p>Allying with artists would help AI protests develop a more diverse coalition, and could achieve significant legal outcomes.&nbsp;</p><h3>II) Fighting a Shared Battle?</h3><p>Perhaps alliances with artists could enable broader coalitions with the \u2018AI Ethics\u2019 community \u2013 those concerned about the short-term, non-existential, risks from AI. There groups might include: the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stopkillerrobots.org/\"><u>Campaign Against Killer Robots</u></a>, who protest against autonomous weapons systems;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://privacyinternational.org/learn/artificial-intelligence\"><u>Privacy International</u></a><u>,</u> who campaign against use of AI in facial recognition, targeted advertising, and immigration enforcement; and groups concerned about algorithmic discrimination, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ajl.org/\"><u>Algorithmic Justice League</u></a> (AJL) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://d4bl.org/\"><u>Data for Black Lives</u></a> (D4BL).&nbsp;</p><p>I am skeptical. Stopping corporations from developing \u2018frontier AI\u2019 would not stop the development of autonomous weapons programs, facial recognition technology, or other \u2018narrow AI\u2019 systems. Unlike artists, PauseAI\u2019s goals seem orthogonal to the Campaign Against Killer Robots, who demand international regulation on AWSs, and Privacy International, who AI to be subject to international rights standards.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps there is more hope for algorithmic discrimination groups. In theory,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Q4rg6vwbtPxXW6ECj/we-are-fighting-a-shared-battle-a-call-for-a-different#A_choice_not_an_inevitability\"><u>the actions required to reduce both existential and non-existential harms from algorithms are similar</u></a>: a pause would avert the immediate risks from biased AI systems, could spur greater government scrutiny, and mitigate future existential risk. The source of both types of harms are similar: a small group of AI companies. This might suggest that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Q4rg6vwbtPxXW6ECj/we-are-fighting-a-shared-battle-a-call-for-a-different#Why_this_is_a_shared_battle\"><u>we are fighting a shared battle</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In practice, however, groups like AJL and D4BL do not advocate for a pause. This disconnect is motivated, in part, by a broader distrust of AI existential risk concerns.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AJLUnited/status/1701675372360917326\"><u>AJL has described concerns</u></a> about existential risk as a \u201ccorporate-funded junk science\u201d.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/data4blacklives/?locale=hr_HR\"><u>The founder of D4BL</u></a> has recently debated against the motion, \u201cAI Is an Existential Threat\u201d at the Oxford Union.&nbsp;Trying to create a \u2018Big Tent\u2019 in which everyone is squabbling isn\u2019t helpful. Whilst large, diverse protests are more likely to succeed,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apollosurveys.org/social-change-and-protests/\"><u>disunified ones are not</u></a>. Even if we should be fighting a shared battle, this doesn\u2019t mean coalitions are practically feasible.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, while alliances with artists might be tractable and strategic, alliances with other AI ethics communities seem more challenging.&nbsp;</p><h2>C) Diversify Our Tactics?</h2><p>An important reason why GM protests succeeded was that they diversified their use of tactics in the mid-90s to embrace a broader range of tactics, including public protests (e.g. protesting international conferences), disruption (e.g. blocking ships), and targeted property destruction (destroying fields of GM crops).&nbsp;</p><p>The AI safety community has expanded its repertoire of tactics to include public protests. This is a welcome step. Should they go further, and start using disruptive tactics, or even sabotage property?</p><h3>I) Don\u2019t Blow Up a Data Centre&nbsp;</h3><p>Violent tactics for AI protests might include sabotaging chip supply chains. AI firms rely heavily on advanced chips from just a few key suppliers like Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, and TSMC. Chip production is incredibly delicate: a single hair or a dust particle can ruin an entire chip. Whilst breaking into a chip production facility would be very difficult, blocking ships might be feasible.&nbsp;</p><p>But would they be effective?</p><p>A thorough review of the literature from the Social Change Lab suggests that violent tactics <a href=\"https://www.socialchangelab.org/_files/ugd/503ba4_e21c47302af942878411eab654fe7780.pdf\"><u>are less successful</u></a> \u2013 in shaping policy and public opinion \u2013 than non-violent ones. Yet, the definition of violence is contested.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/06/why-property-destruction-isnt-violence\"><u>Some believe</u></a>that property destruction isn\u2019t \u2018violent\u2019. The literature review mentioned above includes protests which are \u201cclearly violent\u201d: e.g. physical harm, rioting etc.\u201d<a><sup><u>[16]</u></sup></a>. Targeted property destruction doesn\u2019t seem to fall into this category.</p><p>However, the two main reasons why violent tactics are less successful seem particularly prominent in the AI case. First, violence limits levels of participation in protests: movements often have to choose between fringe violence or broad support<a><sup><u>[17]</u></sup></a>. This wasn\u2019t true in the GMO case \u2013 r<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09505431.2016.1194061\"><u>adicals maintained ties with mainstream NGOs</u></a> despite crop trashing. But since AI protests are so new, violent tactics could quickly turn away potential activists. Secondly, government repression towards a violent movement is less likely to lead to public backlash<a><sup><u>[18]</u></sup></a>. Again, this mechanism was weak for GMO crop slashing: many activists were acquitted, and some repeated crop destruction post-release. However, the high strategic importance of chips could lead to a significant clampdown. If the government imprisoned activists for trying to blow up a data center, I doubt there would be little public backlash.&nbsp;</p><p>This suggests that sabotaging chip supply chains would not be popular nor increase the likelihood of favorable policy. But could they constitute effective \u2018direct action\u2019: directly influencing firms\u2019 behavior?&nbsp;</p><p>The destruction of GM crops used in field experiments is a clear example of successful \u2018direct action\u2019. The&nbsp;aim was not to gain media attention \u2013 activists often destroyed fields in secret<a><sup><u>[19]</u></sup></a> \u2013\u2013 \u2013 but instead to make future field experiments more expensive. For example, extra security for a UK GM wheat trial cost&nbsp;\u00a3180,000 extra.&nbsp;For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22825391/\"><u>extra security for a GM&nbsp;</u></a>wheat trial in the UK cost an extra \u00a3180,000. These actions contributed to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2016-10/gmo_rep-stud_2008_report_field-trials_app-11.pdf\"><u>sudden decline in field trials</u></a> in Europe from a peak of 264 in 1997 to 56 in 2002.</p><p>I am unconvinced whether sabotaging chip supply chains would constitute effective \u2018direct action\u2019. Even if chips became scarcer, I doubt this would change firms\u2019 behavior, because, as mentioned above, AI firms are not training \u2018frontier models\u2019 for short-run profit.&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, I am skeptical whether sabotaging chip supply chains would either constitute effective \u2018direct action\u2019 or lead to greater levels of public support for AI protests&nbsp;\u2013 at least while AI protests are not in the political mainstream. A more effective form of \u2018direct action\u2019 might come from within the AI community: e.g. inserting worms to destroy frontier AI models.&nbsp;</p><h3>II) Shout at a Conference?</h3><p>How about disruptive tactics? Alternative \u2018disruptive\u2019 tactics might include disrupting major AI conferences (e.g. NEURIPs) or AI summits (e.g. UK AI Summit).&nbsp;</p><p>One knee-jerk argument against disruptive protests could be that it led to negative press coverage. Haven\u2019t I just said that media narratives are important? However, even AI protestors are covered negatively, they still might draw attention to AI and existential risk, a neglected narrative in the media.&nbsp;<a><u>[6]</u></a>&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than relying on knee-jerk reactions, perhaps we should consult experts. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apollosurveys.org/social-change-and-protests/\"><u>surveys</u></a>, they thought \u201cstrategic non-violent, disruptive tactics\u201d was the most important organizational factor for protest groups. Further, experts believed that disruptive tactics are more effective for issues which already have broad support. As shown above, AI safety has high levels of public support. Additionally, public awareness is fairly high:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/itandinternetindustry/articles/understandingaiuptakeandsentimentamongpeopleandbusinessesintheuk/june2023#:~:text=Public%20awareness%20of%20Artificial%20Intelligence,Centre%20for%20Data%20Ethics%20and\"><u>over 70% of UK adults</u></a> could give at least a partial explanation of what AI is.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this survey alone does not constitute a formidable endorsement of all disruptive strategies. The framing of \u201cstrategic\u201d disruptive protests might imply only the successful, or well thought-through, use of these tactics).&nbsp;</p><p>The literature on \u2018disruptive protests\u2019 is mixed: some studies suggest they can increase public support, others suggest the opposite<a><sup><u>[20]</u></sup></a>. Sometimes the literature implies that disruptive tactics are, by definition, unpopular or inconvenient for the public<a><sup><u>[21]</u></sup></a>. In contrast, blocking ships containing GMOs was undoubtedly disruptive, but it may not have been unpopular. These tactics led to little backlash from policymakers and seem to have benefitted the GM protests. The same could be true with blocking the entrance to an AI lab.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, there is emerging empirical evidence that disruptive protests can increase public support for mainstream groups. While this empirical literature is, at present, limited to protests about climate change and animal rights<a><sup><u>[22]</u></sup></a>, it suggests that the careful use of more disruptive tactics could benefit the mainstream \u2018flank\u2019 of the AI safety movement.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, more disruptive tactics could alienate AI safety researchers who work at Big Tech companies. This problem makes the AI case unique. GM protestors didn\u2019t have allies within Monsanto; Greta Thunberg does not have many friends at ExxonMobil. Indeed, I doubt any group who have protested multi-billion-dollar companies have prioritized their relationship with corporations over mobilizing public opinion. And given that protest groups are desperate to succeed and adapt their tactics to suit their political environment<a><sup><u>[23]</u></sup></a>, most strategies are quasi-rational. Is the AI case so unique to justify a more corporate-friendly protest strategy?</p><p>I am unsure. More research should be done into non-inconvenient disruptive protest outcomes, and the strategic importance of allies within industry.&nbsp;</p><h1>6) Conclusion</h1><p>In this project, I hoped to answer the following question: Can AI protests help enable a unilateral American pause to AI development in the short-run?&nbsp;</p><p>The experience of GM crops suggests&nbsp;it is possible. Like AI, GMOs were a novel, highly profitable technology, driven by powerful companies. Yet, within the space of only a few years, between 1996 and 1999, public opinions shifted rapidly against GMOs, and Europe enforced a de-facto moratorium on GMOs. Only 1 GM crop is planted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7553740/\"><u> in Europe</u></a><u>,&nbsp;</u> and the region accounts for 0.05% of total GMOs grown worldwide.</p><p>There are several reasons to be optimistic about AI protests. First, like pre-existing support for GM protests, the public is worried about AI development. Secondly, AI existential risk narratives are highly neglected in the media, and more coverage could make the public more supportive of a pause. So, like in the GM case, activists could shape the public discourse. Thirdly, small Pause AI protests have received media attention already, and the GM case suggests that mass-mobilization is not a necessary condition for a successful protest. Lastly, GMO activists were able to overcome the biotechnology lobby, which likely had more lobbying power than the AI lobby (currently) has.&nbsp;</p><p>To increase their chances of success, AI protests should adapt their messaging and strategies. First, they should de-prioritize esoteric p(doom) arguments, and instead emphasize injustice. Second, they should look to build a broader and more diverse coalition by allying with the artists are filing lawsuits against Generative AI. Thirdly, they should look carefully as to whether to adopt more disruptive protests.&nbsp;</p><p>The key factor preventing AI protests from being effective is the lack of political allies for a pause. The current absence of politicians or parties advocating for a pause outweighs other reasons for optimism. A sympathetic government in power is important for protest outcomes<a><sup><u>[24]</u></sup></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, there are key uncertainties surrounding AI protests. Another crucial factor for GM protests were a series of high-profile trigger events, such as the Mad Cow Disease scandal, cloning of \u2018Dolly the Sheep\u2019. We may not need to wait until a \u2018warning shot\u2019, like an AI-engineered pathogen, for the public to mobilize: the release of a more capable AI, or&nbsp;symbolic acts like AI workers going on strike could mobilize the public. Building up organizations in anticipation of future \u2018trigger events\u2019 is vital for protests, so that they can mobilize and scale in response \u2013 the organizational factor which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apollosurveys.org/social-change-and-protests/\"><u>experts thought was most important for protests</u></a>. However, whether such \u2018trigger events\u2019 occur anytime soon is uncertain.&nbsp;</p><p>Bringing about a unilateral pause to AI development is going to be challenging in the short-term. Where does this leave us? Does this mean that AI protests are doomed to fail? No. Protest movement can have various other \u2018theories of change\u2019, aside from achieving its ultimate goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, AI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Y4SaFM5LfsZzbnymu/the-case-for-ai-safety-advocacy-to-the-public#Social_change_works_best_inside_and_outside_the_system\"><u>protests can shift the \u2018Overton Window\u2019 of politically acceptable policies</u></a>. If the public sees more stories about AI existential risk in the media, they will likely become more supportive of a Pause. Other protests such as Civil Rights and Black Lives Matter have shifted the public discourse<a><sup><u>[25]</u></sup></a>. AI protests could do the same, and direct public attention towards existential risk. If concern about existential risk rises, a global moratorium on AI development might become a more mainstream political demand. Additional policy asks (e.g., licenses for \u2018frontier models\u2019, etc.) become more likely to succeed. For example, after Extinction Rebellion called for a \u2018net-zero\u2019 target of 2025, the UK government adopted a 2050 pledge. Radical demands bring additional asks into the political mainstream.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, greater salience of AI risks could benefit groups demanding companies to adopt specific safety policies. There are several examples of Big Tech firms bowing to public pressure, including YouTube\u2019s changes to its algorithm in 2019 and Google\u2019s cancellation of its ties with Project Maven in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>Thirdly, greater salience of AI existential risk would help to give legitimacy to existing safety initiatives led by governments. Recently, there has been media focus around the influence of billionaires linked to Effective Altruism on AI policy: both in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/rishi-sunak-artificial-intelligence-pivot-safety-summit-united-kingdom-silicon-valley-effective-altruism/\"><u>UK</u></a>, and in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/13/open-philanthropy-funding-ai-policy-00121362\"><u>US</u></a>. If the extensive resources spent by the government on AI safety, like the \u00a3100 million set aside for the UK\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/industry-and-national-security-heavyweights-to-power-uks-frontier-ai-taskforce#:~:text=Announced%20by%20the%20Prime%20Minister,be%20applied%20in%20numerous%20areas.\"><u>Frontier AI Taskforce</u></a>, are increasingly seen as illegitimate, there might be political pressure to cut them.&nbsp;</p><p>Fourthly, greater public salience would help avoid the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Quiet_Politics_and_Business_Power/VAMOSW3zjR4C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=Quiet+Politics+and+the+Power+of+Business:+New+Perspectives+in+an+Era+of+Noisy+Politics&amp;printsec=frontcover\"><u>\u201cquiet politics\u201d</u></a> which favors corporate lobbying. OpenAI\u2019s watering down of the EU AI Act would have been significantly less likely if AI existential risk was a more salient topic.&nbsp;</p><p>There is much future work to be done on AI protests, including on fleshing out these four theories of change \u2013 \u2018Overton Window\u2019 shifts enabling additional safety policies; legitimating existing safety initiatives; changing corporate behaviour; and reducing the power of corporate lobbying.&nbsp;</p><p>Another unanswered question is whether and how protest groups like PauseAI can win over political allies<a><sup><u>[26]</u></sup></a>.</p><p>Further \u2018deep dives\u2019 into other protest groups would be particularly interesting. The GM case is limited as an analogue because of its limited geopolitical importance and lack of international governance: research into protests nuclear power, CFCs, nuclear weapons would be particularly useful for this.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, a thorough literature review differentiating between publicly inconvenient and non-inconvenient tactics would be useful for answering whether AI protests should adopt more disruptive tactics.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope that this piece can form the start of a serious conversation about the efficacy of AI protests.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><a><sup><u>[1]</u></sup></a>Found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/gm-foods#ftnt18\"><u>Mohorich (2018)</u></a>.

Out of this realisation, they decided to form an informal group called the \u2018High Impact Policy Engine\u2019 which later became \u2018Impactful Government Careers\u2019. Their mission was to identify and address the most important bottlenecks in:</p><ul><li>Impact-focused people moving into positions where they can help the most.</li><li>The building of trusting relationships between people who can help each other have more social impact in government and beyond.</li></ul><h2><strong>Why is this important?</strong></h2><p>Not one to reinvent the wheel, I look to 80,000 Hours who provides a succinct summary of the importance of working with and through governments (and thus the civil service) in their article on the world\u2019s most pressing problems<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxom3pystv4h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxom3pystv4h\">[1]</a></sup></span>:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rPpcbwiELHNpmuo7P/wyyypmlvcqdudxpovm3o\"></p><p>In fact, all of the top 5 most pressing issues identified by 80,000 Hours (AI, pandemics, nuclear war, great power conflict, and climate change) are heavily influenced, if not entirely reliant, on the decisions made by governments. This reality is also reflected in the priority cause areas highlighted by other career advisory sources such as \u2018Probably Good\u2019<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo5v34g8ie5\"><sup><a href=\"#fno5v34g8ie5\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and \u2018Successif\u2019<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5ptqyviu6zf\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5ptqyviu6zf\">[3]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond this, numerous EA funded projects focus a considerable amount time, energy, and money on trying to get the best information in front of the best people so that the best decision can be made by governments. This isn\u2019t surprising. Governments have enormous potential to shift funding and focus to highly impactful areas. A 1% chance to improve the effectiveness of just 1% of the UK Government's annual expenditure could equate to c.$140 million extra per year for more impactful causes.</p><p>In summary, governments are important. I don\u2019t suspect I\u2019m providing anyone with new information here. However, it serves as an emphasis on how integral governments are to the success of many priority causes.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What benefit does IGC provide?</strong></h2><p>A fairly well established and reasoned belief is it is desirable to have motivated, empowered, and impact focused individuals in positions that help deliver key decisions in powerful organisations and institutions. If the staff in these institutions are incentivised and supported to find the most effective solution to a problem, then this benefits society at large and gives us the highest chance of solving some of the world\u2019s most complicated and concerning/existential problems.&nbsp;</p><p>This is recognised in the growth and support for organisations such as: 80,000 Hours; Probably Good; High Impact Professionals;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefokb6kbaghwb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnokb6kbaghwb\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Animal Advocacy Careers<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefak2lghnliz\"><sup><a href=\"#fnak2lghnliz\">[5]</a></sup></span>; and High Impact Engineers<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref74ufrnxkuqt\"><sup><a href=\"#fn74ufrnxkuqt\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;- to name a few. However, it begs the question of whether Impactful Government Careers actually provides a benefit that isn\u2019t already serviced elsewhere. There are three main reasons why we believe it does:</p><h3><i>1. Finding a high impact role in the Civil Service is a hard and specialised task.&nbsp;</i></h3><p>In the UK, a central \u2018Civil Service Jobs\u2019 portal provides access to all the jobs available, but it can be incredibly difficult to assess the potential impact of the role from the job advert alone. Some general predictors such as seniority of the role, the department it\u2019s in, the job responsibilities may be a helpful guide but they are far from perfect. The risk is that you get a job believing it is high impact, only to find 3-6 months in it\u2019s not and you: (a) have missed another higher impact opportunity; (b) are unable to apply for another job for a set period; and/or (c) have to start looking for another position and role the dice again.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, to improve your changes requires time and effort to speak to people in the area, understand the political and institutional context (i.e. what\u2019s the opportunity to move the dial, have influence and autonomy over your work etc.), and weigh these considerations against other jobs being advertised (now or potentially in the near future). Given the job adverts are typically only open for two weeks, there isn\u2019t a lot of time to figure this out and produce a first-class application.</p><p><strong>IGC can help streamline this by doing early filtering, having an understanding of the context of key policy areas, and putting prospective individuals in contact with people who they can trust to give them candid and open views on the area of work.&nbsp;</strong>We have the specialised knowledge that puts us in a prime position to evaluate a job advert, help you investigate the questions above, and then make a well-reasoned judgement on how impactful the role is likely to be.</p><h3><i>2. Securing a high impact role in the Civil Service is competitive and requires unique skills.</i></h3><p>Anyone who has applied for a job in the UK Civil Service will know the potentially soul-draining experience it is. There are often extreme levels of competition, especially in higher grade roles which offer more autonomy or responsibility. The task of writing concise behaviours to showcase your skills and meet an incredibly broad set of criteria can be laborious, and the following interview format can be rigid and an unusual experience. The process is designed to strip a lot of individuality away from the application in an effort to remove any bias (be it prejudice, nepotism, or other biases) from the people making the assessment. I could do a whole other post on how this system doesn\u2019t work, but maybe another time.</p><p><strong>IGC has expertise and deep experience of getting through the civil service application process.&nbsp;</strong>We are able to provide individual feedback and support on the written part of the application, and coach people through the interview so that they can not only hit the required scores, but bring out their personality in a way that makes them stand out. In such a rigid process it forces a need for knowing the \u2018tricks of the trade\u2019 to increase the chances of success.</p><h3><i>3. Excelling and delivering impact whilst in a role is an art.</i></h3><p>Even once in a role with high potential of impact, delivering on that often requires a wide variety of skills such as having an attention to detail, be able to understand Ministerial objectives and incentives, work collaboratively with team members and utilise their skills effectively, being able to manage upwards and downwards, have an ability to productively negotiate with internal and external stakeholders, know when to compromise but not undermine the main benefits/elements of the option, and manage to write and talk concisely and with confidence - often on highly complex and uncertain issues to very senior officials or Ministers.&nbsp;</p><p>The art is in knowing how to navigate the system, understand where your opportunities are, know what skills to leverage when, and have the confidence to die in a ditch when it\u2019s warranted.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>IGC</strong>&nbsp;<strong>can not only help individuals in building those skills, but provides a network of other aligned individuals who can help them develop and implement these.&nbsp;</strong>From access to experts who can provide civil servants with information and evidence to help them in their thinking on a policy issue, to support with skills such as negotiation, communication, and reasoning under uncertainty.</p><h3>IGC helps people find, secure, and deliver in high impact civil service roles.</h3><p><i><strong>This is good for civil servants</strong></i> - Many people join the Civil Service because they want to help others. This drive is a fundamental benefit to the Government of the day and the public at large. However, many individuals end up feeling unsure about whether they are actually making a difference, and/or unsure how you can direct their career to ensure they are maximising their impact and benefit to the world.</p><p><i><strong>This is good for the Government</strong></i> - A civil servant who is focused and supported to deliver impactful work, is a more effective civil servant. Their work therefore helps the Government of the day achieve its goals in the best way possible, whilst helping the institutions retain the best people and deliver greater value for citizens.</p><p><i><strong>This is good for the world</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>-<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The world gets better when people in our most important institutions are motivated and empowered to deliver impactful projects and policies. IGC helps ensure that the most pressing problems in the world are being addressed by the most capable and motivated individuals.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Risk of IGC</strong></h2><p>There are always risks in such services, especially when it relates to working with public bodies. Some of these have been proactively mitigated through IGC\u2019s remit/focus, and others will aim to be addressed through IGCs new strategy (see below \u2018What's next\u2019 section).&nbsp;</p><p>The most important risks to highlight in this post, as an introduction and overview of IGC for the EA community, are:</p><h3><i>Impartiality</i></h3><p>It is fundamental to IGC\u2019s existence that its work remains impartial. There is a clear and necessary separation between the role of Ministers and politicians, and those of the civil service. That does not mean civil servants cannot or should not be motivated, incentivised, and supported to maximise the benefit of their work to the world, within the defined objectives and directions set by Ministers. The internal structures and process of departments ensures this - the civil service provides&nbsp;<i>advice</i>, and Ministers make the&nbsp;<i>final</i> decision.</p><p>IGC isn\u2019t set up to push any political view or motive, but rather to help individuals find and secure high impact roles, and once there, have the skills available to identify and advise which options provide the highest positive benefit. The better informed individuals are, the better their advice will be for Ministers.</p><h3><i>Political decisions and cycle</i></h3><p>Political decisions dictate, to a large degree, what is done and what is not done. Along with the power to do good, politicians can equally make decisions with enormous harm, and thus the same skills that could make civil servants very effective could be used in a net-negative way.&nbsp;</p><p>I think this is a very fair risk. Having experienced a situation very similar to this however, I do feel there is an argument that having people who want to maximise impact (in a positive way) should help mitigate the negative effects of such decisions by advising Ministers of the least damaging way to achieve their objectives - providing counterfactual benefit compared to someone that didn\u2019t care about impact. Assuming the political objective isn\u2019t explicitly about maximising harm (which I believe is extremely rare), performing well in such a scenario may actually increase the EV your work could have given this counterfactual benefit.</p><p>However, there is a fine line to be drawn between this benefit and working on something you disagree with. Fundamentally this also points back to the 1st risk - the civil service advises and Ministers decide. Being outside of Government, IGC can candidly advise on alternative impactful areas to go into if such political objectives make it impossible for individuals to stay in their current role.&nbsp;</p><h3><i>The scale of the issue is too large for a small organisation to help solve</i></h3><p>IGC has been run by one full time Director and some volunteers for the last 18 months, and now has funding to expand to c.2 FTE for the next 12-18 months. Though the theory of change for IGC may make sense, it could be that the time necessary and funding required to deliver on that is much higher than the amount of money funders are willing to provide.</p><p>This isn\u2019t a shameless plug for more money I promise, but a real risk. The problem is large, the solutions are complicated, multifacted, and uncertain. There are potentially thousands of civil servants IGC could serve, and dozens of interventions that could deliver benefits. It\u2019s on IGC to make use of the funding to target our actions in the best places for the money we have and make the case (if necessary) for why an extra \u00a3/$ spent on IGC is worth it.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What\u2019s next for IGC and how can you help</strong></h2><p>As set out in my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.impactfulgovcareers.org/post/journey-to-igc-an-introduction-and-beyond\"><u>introductory blog</u></a>, I\u2019m focusing on two main aspects for IGC:</p><ol><li><strong>Maintain the existing service, building the awareness of IGC and ensuring the existing services continue to operate</strong>. This will involve:<ol><li>Early stage career advice and support for those in or interested in government roles.</li><li>More specific coaching for individuals applying for roles, either in helping them narrow their specific focus or support with the application process.</li><li>Undertaking events to build awareness of IGC and having impact.</li><li>Building the community and network of impact-aligned individuals.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Develop a clear and concise strategy for IGC, identifying exactly which services we will provide in future, and which ones we won\u2019t.</strong> Current ideas (not exhaustive) under consideration/investigation are:<ol><li>A platform which captures and ranks government jobs (based on several metrics) so that users can easily filter and compare different roles based on their personal fit, career goals, and potential for impact. With opportunity to easily connect with others working in similar roles/areas for views and recommendations (potentially anonymously).</li><li>A more involved and focused coaching service designed to help the most promising and ambitious candidates to find and secure high-impact roles.</li><li>A bespoke training/fellowship programme designed to provide individuals with skills to help them succeed in delivering impact in their roles.</li><li>An internal function designed to investigate, aggregate, and disseminate research and evidence on the most promising high-impact interventions for specific priority areas, with the aim of reducing the time and effort required for civil servants to find such information.</li></ol></li></ol><p>Impact evaluation and monitoring will be at the heart of how we direct our effort and funds. With huge uncertainty around monitoring the impact of such career advice/support services, we\u2019ll be looking to deploy advanced techniques designed for uncertainty/belief modelling such as a Bayesian network/theory of change, so that we can be transparent in the beliefs and data that underpin our assessments, and maximise the confidence apriori that our interventions will make a difference.</p><p>The main purpose of this post was to make the EA community more aware of IGC, and by doing so, hopefully gather views which I can integrate into my decisions for how to maximise IGC\u2019s own impact.

An inspiring account, the book would be of particular of interest to those beginning in animal advocacy. What follows is a summary of the book\u2019s account of Spira\u2019s venture into reducing animal suffering and the tactics he used for 23 years to do so. Not written about here, the book includes detailed descriptions of Spira\u2019s campaigns, as well as a couple of shocking interpersonal dramas of people tangential to Spira\u2019s life that would be entertaining to anyone.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Timeline of Spira\u2019s animal advocacy</strong></h2><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xWZcfmgTMsuEpa7ef/rzzu3sjh4mftkat0dqu2\"></p><p>Timeline of Henry Spira\u2019s animal advocacy based on the biography. The Perdue campaign was unsuccessful, and the book was written when Singer and Spira were waiting to see McDonald\u2019s response. Besides these two outliers, Spira\u2019s quick and regular successes are impressive.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Spira\u2019s start</strong></h2><p>Henry Spira had been involved with socialist groups and reported on the civil rights movement as a journalist, but until age 45, he had never given animal rights a thought. In 1973, a friend going abroad left him with a cat, and a little while later he happened upon an article in the paper that mocked a recent book review Peter Singer had written. The critique provided a summary of Singer\u2019s view that the suffering of animals mattered, which sparked Spira\u2019s interest and prompted him to get a copy of the newspaper with Singer\u2019s full article and read it. Soon after, Singer happened to be teaching a continuing education class in New York. Spira attended the course, afterwards drawing together a group of students interested in organizing something that would help animals.</p><p>In his time outside of being a high school teacher, which he would retire from in 1982, Spira led the group in planning a campaign against cat experiments being performed at the American Natural History Museum. These NIH-funded experiments planned to destroy cats\u2019 senses and determine any changes in sexual behavior. Only some of the surgeries were actually carried out, one of which was the destroying of their sense of smell. Although the experiments used less than 10 cats a year, their absurdity made Spira hopeful for a win that would create momentum in the animal movement, even if it did not directly help many animals. From the book, the wellbeing of the cats was not clear to me, though Henry\u2019s ads do not shy away from words like \u201ctorture.\u201d Henry\u2019s language was intense, but the facts he presented were reliable; Henry researched his targets thoroughly, frequently relying on government documents and FOIA requests. One ad in the book that Henry helped organize says the cats were kept in cages, so they were plausibly quite unhappy, although the impact of the surgeries or the likelihood that they were performed with anasthesia remain unknown to me.</p><p>Spira\u2019s campaign against the cat experiments was successful, and this campaign followed the strategy that most of his future campaigns would.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Spira\u2019s strategy</strong></h2><p>Spira\u2019s campaigning process started with writing to the target and asking to set up a meeting. These notes often included suggestions that demonstrations or advertisements would begin if the group did not cooperate. If the target didn\u2019t respond, he might try to talk to executives in person, sometimes by buying shares and attending shareholder meetings. If still they didn\u2019t want to cooperate, Spira would start publicly campaigning, usually beginning with an entertaining ad that called on readers to write to an executive or government official. Later, there might also be public protests. In the case of the American Museum of Natural History, these lasted for over a year and took place weekly. Because public opinion mattered so much for his approach, he selected issues that most people would be opposed to.&nbsp;</p><p>Spira would try to frame the cooperation positively and create something that the target could pride itself on (for instance, being a pioneer in animal testing alternatives.) Besides this, a large part of the incentive to cooperate was avoiding negative publicity. This meant he preferred targets that cared about their reputation. It also meant that targets needed to trust that if they cooperated, he would halt the negative publicity. To maintain this trust, Spira would show public appreciation towards targets that cooperated and would not later launch another campaign on them. Spira\u2019s reputation for being fair and honest seemed to help him get meetings. Tactical differences led to strife in the already grudge-filled community when PETA continued a campaign towards Proctor &amp; Gamble after they had cooperated with Spira.&nbsp;</p><p>Spira was the one making all final decisions for his campaigns, but he had plenty of people to talk to and strategize with, including the author, Peter Singer. Along the way, Spira made many friends that would help him select targets, make ads, and generally plan campaigns. Besides these advisorial roles, he also had people helping him out as volunteers.&nbsp;</p><p>For many of his campaigns, he organized coalitions that included large animal organizations. The biography notes that organizations with some differences of opinion still supported him because he had been successful. He would also ask for these organizations to contact their supporters during campaigns and urge them to write to someone or join a protest.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Lessons from Spira\u2019s successes</strong></h2><p>The importance of coalitions and unity are often emphasized by advocates across causes, but other lessons from Spira\u2019s approach are preached less frequently.&nbsp;</p><p>For one, Spira was able to complete campaigns successfully within a few years, which might provide a baseline for the amount of time that should be spent on similar endeavors. Theoretically, to win some harder asks, you may have to campaign for longer than a few years; however, the momentum built with shorter campaigns, the ability to do more short campaigns in a given timespan, and the confirmation that your strategy is working are all compelling reasons to work in timespans of a few years. In particular, the book references large demands other advocates would make, like those of ending all animal testing, that even the most passionate contenders could not achieve. While it might seem obvious to make your goal more reasonable, the length of a campaign may also give you a clue as to whether you should continue with your ask and strategy.</p><p>Additionally, within two years of learning about the plight of animals, Spira was able to start leading successful campaigns. Surely his zeal was unique, but his quick pivot into animal protection later in life can serve as inspiration for those wanting to get involved but feeling late to the party.</p><p>Strikingly, Spira campaigned for seven years while teaching high school, and after retiring, had no other paid staff. In fact, Spira was suspicious of animal organizations that constantly fundraised, seeing that incentives to maintain large staffs and the bureaucracy that resulted from them may have distracted from the goal of helping animals. Either way, Spira\u2019s successes proved the possibility of frugal wins for animals.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Elijah Persson-Gordon"}}, {"_id": "bpLvJhcv7HcxjmibJ", "title": "Why 1Day Sooner Needs EAs to Sign Up for Hep C Challenge Studies", "postedAt": "2023-10-23T19:02:50.853Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This post makes an argument that EAs should consider signing up for upcoming hepatitis C human challenge studies.

Within a week we had our first sign-up form online. A week after that we had 470 people signed up, driven largely by our first two public mentions, in the 80K Hours Facebook page and the Future Perfect newsletter.&nbsp;</p><p>Now 1Day needs EAs to help launch a movement for a hepatitis C vaccine. Hepatitis C is a blood-borne infection spread largely by needles that may kill as many as 542,000 people per year (15.3M DALYs).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref486n1kvfizo\"><sup><a href=\"#fn486n1kvfizo\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Although an effective treatment exists, disease burden is forecast to rise to 20M DALYs by 2040.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7igepikli3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7igepikli3\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;By comparison, GiveWell\u2019s interventions last year targeted an impact of (very roughly) 4.1 million DALYs.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi76p2ayyh7i\"><sup><a href=\"#fni76p2ayyh7i\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>Human challenge studies are likely the only way to achieve a vaccine in the foreseeable future. The impracticality of vaccine development outside of challenge studies was described in an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i2oW1EhAvk5J_lOBx9vUOn5mOXum8sLTxDmWe5kf0kA/edit\"><u>open letter</u></a> we organized, which was published in <i>The Lancet Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology </i>last month. Among its 121 signatories are two of the Nobel Laureates who discovered the hepatitis C virus.&nbsp;</p><p>A successful vaccine would not eliminate 100% of disease burden, but per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/77/Supplement_3/S231/7242433\"><u>a peer-reviewed paper we commissioned</u></a>, the conservative estimate of expected value from testing three vaccines with challenge studies would be to avert 185K infections, saving approximately 370K years of life.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff7rt9bwoono\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf7rt9bwoono\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If those trials required 300 participants total, it would imply roughly 1,000 years of life saved per person in the study. There is never a guaranteed outcome of medical research, however, and this model represents an estimate. It is possible, for example, that vaccines for hepatitis C prove extremely difficult, like HIV (see \u201cArguments against\u201d section).</p><p>Quantitative estimates can provide false certainty, but qualitatively speaking, tackling hep C creates excellent opportunities to advance challenge studies and vaccinology more broadly.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Qualitative Case for Hep C Challenge</h2><h3>Buy-in from Stakeholders: Expert Consensus Views Challenge Model as Critical for Hep C Vaccine</h3><p>A major obstacle to adopting the COVID-19 challenge model quickly was opposition from some experts and governments.

Teams at various major research institutions in the US, Canada, and UK are pursuing their development.&nbsp; We predict Open Philanthropy will commit funding within the next twelve months to support hepatitis C vaccine development. They have taken a generally favorable stance towards the idea of HCV challenge models.</p><h3>Validating Challenge Studies as a Viable Way to Accelerate Vaccine Development</h3><p>It\u2019s possible a vaccine for hepatitis C could be authorized on the basis of challenge studies alone. While so far this has only happened for one vaccine \u2014 Vaxchora, for cholera \u2014 the method of hep C challenge (with a needle/injection) is highly similar to natural infection, which is not true for most challenge models. There may be a compelling case to license directly from challenge studies for highly impacted demographics (i.e. people who inject drugs, PWIDs) in industrialized countries.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref76y7ar3wjg6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn76y7ar3wjg6\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This would entail confirmatory post-market study to generate the type of \u201creal-world evidence\u201d that is a priority of US FDA Commissioner Robert Califf.</p><p>Establishing a pathway for vaccine authorization on the basis of challenge study efficacy results would help with vaccine development across a wide range of diseases including influenza, tuberculosis, group A strep, Zika, and COVID. With the exception of Zika, each of those diseases costs more than 10 million DALYs in annual disease burden.</p><h3>Use Case for \u201cWarp Speed 2.0\u201d&nbsp;</h3><p>Vaccines take on average ten years from the start of human testing until regulatory approval.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4qifjbu5cwn\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4qifjbu5cwn\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The COVID mRNA vaccines took about nine months. In the United States, Operation Warp Speed \u2014 a concentrated government effort that streamlined regulatory processes and made significant fiscal and logistical resources available to developers \u2014 showed that in an emergency a faster timeline is possible.</p><p>Enabling technologies such as mRNA vaccine platforms, gene sequencing, and rational drug design<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref031i4qsf1cgn\"><sup><a href=\"#fn031i4qsf1cgn\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;create the opportunity for a permanently faster cadence for vaccine development.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefu0b1eb3mq5i\"><sup><a href=\"#fnu0b1eb3mq5i\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>If a robust hep C challenge model can be developed quickly, it could support a \u201cWarp Speed\u201d for hep C vaccine development that would validate the Warp 2 model during peacetime and could advance a permanently faster cadence for vaccine development globally.</p><h2>Why Are EA Volunteers Needed?&nbsp;</h2><p>To reach their full potential, we believe these studies need a critical mass of participants motivated by effective altruism. Beyond enabling the studies to occur, EAs who participate could help mold the design of the studies to improve their impact. Given the role EA played in the campaigns for COVID-19 challenge studies, we believe this community is well positioned for advocacy related to hepatitis C.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkb1af9z2sro\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkb1af9z2sro\">[9]</a></sup></span></p><p>The initial challenge studies will be used to establish the challenge model. \u201cEstablishing a challenge model\u201d means infecting participants to find the proper infectious dose, characterize infections with the pathogen, and isolate the samples of the pathogen (inocula) for future use. No vaccines are used. Subsequent challenge studies anywhere in the world can use these standardized samples to test hepatitis C vaccines.&nbsp;</p><p>These initial characterization challenge studies are slated to begin in Canada and the UK, likely in the first half of 2024, and later in the US.</p><p>We estimate that the current hepatitis C challenge model development plan would see the first vaccine tested in about five years, if all goes smoothly. There are a number of places where accepting additional risk \u2014 even relatively limited risk \u2014 could accelerate the timeline by up to nearly 900 days.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftaa2r4mnjmr\"><sup><a href=\"#fntaa2r4mnjmr\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Well-informed participants who advocate their right to take risks could potentially accelerate the study along these lines through advocacy.</p><p>For example, a single study design change could shave four months off of the time needed to establish the hepatitis C challenge model;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa7fpvhmkx0p\"><sup><a href=\"#fna7fpvhmkx0p\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;a number of other potential design modifications exist, and having earnest prospective volunteers actively involved in study design could help ensure design decisions appropriately weigh risks to volunteers against global health benefits.</p><p>Relatedly, earnest prospective volunteers will be able to advocate for changes that make the model more robust. Robustness includes not only speed, but also scientific quality, transparency and data-sharing, adoptability by other research sites, and ability to support regulatory approval. An organized corps of former volunteers, for example, could persuasively lobby for equitable distribution of vaccines globally, for automatic sharing of study data, or for the provision of funding for related vaccine research.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, hepatitis C generally lacks public attention and urgency due to its chronic nature, and in wealthy countries, its concentration among vulnerable and stigmatized populations, namely, people who inject drugs.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8b3msjwvs7l\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8b3msjwvs7l\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A public advocacy campaign around the challenge studies could have downstream effects of raising the profile of this serious disease more generally.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Bad Would Deliberate Infection with Hepatitis C be?</h2><p>Our FAQ document discusses this in <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1IsBRNTG5nKQ2DWyrRWggbwohcuNRdzocQ4OX1mnrbnQ/edit\"><u>detail</u></a>, but the short answer is there are real risks of being in the study, though they are likely lower than living organ donation or COVID-19 challenge studies would have been early in the pandemic. Risk of death is extremely low. Below are some highlights from the FAQ.</p><p>Hepatitis C is treatable with a well-tolerated daily pill taken for 2-3 months. Cure rates range from 95\u201399%. Relevant factors include general health/comorbidities, the type of drug, the genotype of the virus, and adherence to treatment.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41575-022-00608-8\"><u>98%</u></a> is a commonly cited figure.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnn7ap1dw9d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnn7ap1dw9d\">[13]</a></sup></span></p><ul><li>Groups of healthy, extensively screened volunteers will very likely fall on the high end of the range.</li><li>People who fail the first round of treatment can be treated again with different, related drugs with a similarly high success rate. A 2023 review found 22 cases of fully reported second-round treatment after first round failure in medical literature. All 22 were cured.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8zud2wxnai9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8zud2wxnai9\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(There are other known cases of failures after second-round treatment, however.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflnw0ql9imb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlnw0ql9imb\">[15]</a></sup></span>)</li><li>Viral samples with identifiable genetic signs of resistance to treatment will not be used to infect volunteers.</li></ul><p>Most people infected with hepatitis C (around 80%) are asymptomatic in the months following infection. Possible symptoms include fatigue, fever, jaundice, and nausea/vomiting, among others. Symptoms may last several weeks, but are generally intermittent and relatively mild, though they still could impact work and day-to-day life.</p><p>Evidence suggests short-term infection among otherwise healthy individuals does not cause significant long-term negative impacts (namely, cancer) in the liver.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnt67q5sgtf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnt67q5sgtf\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Researchers will monitor liver health with regular check-ins, and at certain thresholds treatment would be initiated early.</p><h2>Am I Personally Obligated to Be in a Hepatitis C Challenge Study?&nbsp;</h2><p>No. It requires a chronic infection of a serious disease and significant numbers of appointments in potentially inconvenient locations. We do not believe anyone is obligated to be in any medical study. That said, we do think that it could produce very significant &nbsp;value for the world that is far greater than the cost to the participant and is thus the type of supererogatory action we believe falls into the category of effective altruism.&nbsp;</p><h2>Arguments against Our Approach</h2><p><u>1Day Sooner may have been wrong about COVID-19 challenge.</u> COVID challenge studies have not yet been meaningfully helpful in reducing disease burden. This may imply 1Day Sooner\u2019s judgment is poor.</p><p><u>Hep C disease burden decreases would likely materialize multiple decades from now and are thus highly speculative. </u>A vaccine developed in the next five years would see substantial effect 25-45 years from now, due to both the long timeline of hepatitis C mortality and the time it takes to deploy a new vaccine. Insofar as artificial intelligence or other phenomena \u2014 nuclear war, climate apocalypse, zombie plague, etc. \u2014 drastically change the world, they make the benefits unpredictable or potentially irrelevant.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Hep C vaccine development may be unsuccessful or unnecessary.</u> The hepatitis C virus is extremely prone to mutation, and within the same person, chronic infection can result in numerous \u201cquasi-species\u201d of the virus. This makes the task of vaccine development harder, and means efficacy may not be high. Also, there are countries \u2014 Egypt in particular \u2014 that have been able to substantially reduce the burden of hepatitis C through coordinated public health campaigns combining screening and DAA treatment.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Challenge studies could harm the reputation of effective altruism.</u> Deliberately infecting people with dangerous diseases sounds outlandish, and most people would not want to volunteer. Promoting an effective altruist affiliation with challenge studies may seem off putting or otherwise damage the reputation of effective altruism, especially if a death or other serious adverse event occurs in the study.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Strong longtermism could be correct.</u> If future lives are roughly morally equivalent to present day lives, reductions in catastrophic risk are tractable, and the probability of near-term human extinction is sufficiently low not to make mitigatory efforts futile, altruistic acts aimed at averting extinction or otherwise dramatically improving the long-term future may vastly outweigh efforts aimed at present-day disease burden.</p><h2>Further Reading</h2><ul><li><i>Liang, Feld, Cox &amp; Rice (2018), \u201c</i><a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2109093\"><i><u>Controlled Human Infection Model \u2014 Fast Track to HCV Vaccine?</u></i></a><i>\u201d&nbsp;New England Journal of Medicine.&nbsp;This article made the case early on for hepatitis C human challenge studies.</i></li><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IsBRNTG5nKQ2DWyrRWggbwohcuNRdzocQ4OX1mnrbnQ/edit\"><u>1Day\u2019s Hep C Challenge Volunteer FAQ</u></a> \u2014&nbsp;includes breakdowns of questions that people might have when they consider signing up.

While I agree with these points to a large extent, they still do not take away from the importance of perception.&nbsp;</p><p>Both in community building and in my personal life, I have seen potentially \u2018great fits\u2019 of EA get turned away or have a great hesitancy to associate themselves with a seemingly exclusive and elite movement. Perception in itself is not enough to stop efforts to try to change the world in the best way we know how. <strong><u>But can we be sure we are doing the \u2018best\u2019 if great talent, or worse, entire demographics are not even part of the effort?&nbsp;</u></strong></p><p>By \u2018valuable\u2019 I don\u2019t just mean the random chance that great potential contributors &nbsp;exist within the group of people who don\u2019t join due to their perception of EA. I &nbsp;mean specifically the voices of marginalized or impacted groups who are the subjects of a lot of discourse but not part of the discourse itself. There is little objection to the value-added of &nbsp;such intellectual diversity or how much contextual information can help broaden the scope of historically Western-centric ideas.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>And it\u2019s wishful to assume that people with issues with the movement will spend a lot of time and effort engaging and delving deeper to find ideas they agree with.</strong> We need to work on inclusivity to ensure people are at least willing to engage with the movement enough to disagree with the ideas itself and not the image.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>More specifically, the barriers to entry which will turn people away at the door include <strong>demographic, intellectual, and value-based homogeneity</strong>. The first aversion is an instinctive one:&nbsp; it seems that this is a space for WEIRD adults or elite university students who have money but also a conscience- how will they solve the pressing issues where I come from? A more concrete example is the issue that advocates for people with disabilities have with aspects of the EA ideas like the flippant use of DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) and may choose to disengage based on this without further inquisition.&nbsp;</p><p>Another barrier to entry is the value clash. Certain demographic <strong>values like cosmopolitanism, agnosticism, and utilitarian ideas&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>happen to be common</strong></i><strong> values of the average EA but appear to be a requirement for entry.</strong> These characteristics happen to be a consequence of where the movement originated and the nature of the ideas, as opposed to a feature of the movement itself. The distinction is fine but important. It is&nbsp;<i>more likely</i> that a cosmopolitan buys into EA because of the idea of \u2018Global Priorities\u2019 but that does not mean a&nbsp; nationalist can\u2019t find other ideas just as compelling or want to run a chapter in their country.</p><p>This leads to a more salient issue. Often while community building I have seen that newer fellows start viewing these values or specific ways of thinking (like being purely rational) as a <strong><u>\u2018criteria for membership\u2019</u></strong>. Of course, there has to be an agreement with core ideas (like focusing on evidence-based impact for example). However, often this comes off as \u2018We have found&nbsp;<i>for certain</i>&nbsp;<i>the very best way to tackle this issue and it requires you to think in this specific non-negotiable way.\u2019&nbsp;</i><strong><u>If we had found&nbsp;</u></strong><i><strong><u>the most effective way&nbsp;</u></strong></i><strong><u>we would not have as highly engaged EAs being near termists and long termists simultaneously</u></strong>.<strong><u> Not to over-simplify the whole movement but fundamentally we agree on approaches but are working in different streams to find better ways to get there. </u></strong>We are all coexisting and working within a common framework using our own individual talents, niches, and value systems that allow us to add &nbsp;value in distinct ways.&nbsp;</p><p>A hegemonic criteria for membership developed from limited context will perpetuate demographic biases that formed that so-called membership criteria in the first place. &nbsp;Again, I am referring to a common perception, not a an explicit 'you have to be this tall to ride' sign. But for community builders a problem of perception is a proble we have to worry about.&nbsp;</p><p>If people with different value systems believe that they cannot contribute because of the supposed value-based and intellectual criteria for membership, then we are narrowing the pool of talent. Is it more likely that a cosmopolitan utilitarian joins EA? Yes. Is it a requirement? I hope not.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent times, as the movement has taken more shape and \u2018grown\u2019 in a technical sense, the definition and boundaries around the movement have tightened. Movement growth should not come at the cost of losing the open, self-critical, constantly questioning and 'semi-permeable' boundaries that made this community so refreshing and compelling in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So what can we do?</strong></p><p><strong><u>Levels of Engagement:&nbsp;</u></strong>As was insightfully put forward by a sprightly fellow of mine, EA ideas can be proposed with certain levels of engagement. The fellow was referring to scaffolding an introduction to radical and counterintuitive principles raised in EA, for ease of transition. <strong><u>However, this showed me the value of introducing newer ideas into existing frameworks in a way that doesn\u2019t&nbsp;</u></strong><i><strong><u>disrupt</u></strong></i><strong><u> the work in that context but&nbsp;</u></strong><i><strong><u>enhances</u></strong></i><strong><u> it.</u></strong> I can\u2019t ascertain what the intent of all the syllabus material is, but the reception often has been<strong> </strong>\u2018Oh so however we\u2019ve been doing things so far is misguided, and here you think you know better?\u2019&nbsp;</p><p>Cause neutrality suggests that we should care about the world's most pressing problems regardless of personal context and bias but I would dare to posit that there is ubiquitous agreement on what these are<strong><u>. I am not challenging the relevance, credibility and rationality behind Global Priorities, but I do wonder if these priorities would look the same had they originated in a non-WI.E.R.D context</u></strong>.&nbsp; Recent Local Priorities research demonstrates that priorities can look different in various social, cultural and geographic contexts. While this may seem obvious or banal, a lot of the mainstream content and fellowship material does not reflect it as such.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>More importantly, people recently introduced to EA cannot be expected to immediately engage with cause neutrality or forego the insights that their context provides them with. More importantly, why should they?</strong></p><p><strong><u>I think we would make a lot more headway in certain communities if we took certain values of the context for granted and figured out the most effective way to work&nbsp;</u></strong><i><strong><u>within&nbsp;</u></strong></i><strong><u>those value system</u></strong><u>s.</u> This is where the central value clash between the \u2018average EA\u2019 (not necessarily but according to dominant perception) and some demographics occur. As posts in the past have mentioned, in a lot of collectivist cultures these value differences are what turn most people away at the doorstep. I think that the potential for the movement to appeal to a larger demographic exists, and the way to address that is through&nbsp;<strong>levels of engagement.</strong></p><p>Human emotions, cultural context, socio-political background and economic context certainly determine how these ideas are received. If this were not the case we wouldn\u2019t put so much effort into nuanced community building in the first place. The Arete fellowship could have been a series of self-explanatory blog posts.&nbsp;<strong>However, the very nature of fellowships acknowledges that bidirectional engagement and dialogue are required to be able to truly digest and accept Effective Altruism.&nbsp;</strong>Keeping this in mind, <strong><u>I think there is a balance that can be drawn between retaining core ideas and expressing them in ways that actually resonate with a variety of contexts.</u></strong></p><p>My mother is a social worker who has worked in the Indian network of NGOs for over 20 years. I pitched EA to her in excitement. Her first response was that people are not going to be open to this. In her experience of the grassroots network for impact, she claimed that people are hesitant to change their way of doing things and getting them to agree to some of the radical-sounding ideas and changes would be virtually impossible. I was all ready to set off on a \u2018that\u2019s the problem and that is what we have to fix\u2019 rant. But I took a step back. I assumed that the existing system is filled with obtuse, unwilling-to-change hardliners. But I didn\u2019t consider that they are experts who understand the intricacies and very real constraints of the system. They have the resources, knowledge and distribution that any new effort won\u2019t. So if I walked in and dropped and spoke about expected value and long-termism I would get laughed right out. However, if I walked in, understood the objective of that organization and helped them navigate (using all the EA toolkits in my arsenal) how to improve aspects of their approach, I would at least be invited in for a chat. I am neither a mathematician nor a philosopher, but I know this appears to be a compromise on what is&nbsp;<i>the most effective way.&nbsp;</i><strong><u>However, getting existing institutions to, within the constraints of their context, adapt some more effective ways is better than having no effect on them whatsoeve</u></strong><u>r.&nbsp;</u></p><p>It is not the final step, but it is a step in the right direction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How can we &nbsp;introduce this at the chapter level?</strong></p><p>We are a unique chapter based in an elite American University in the Middle East. Given our context, we had to find unique ways to execute the ideas discussed above. For example, our chapter wanted to have an \u2018Effective Zakaat\u2019 initiative where we could help recommend effective charities for Muslims to donate to during the month of Ramadan. Given that these charities had to be pre-approved by the government, there was no guarantee of they being&nbsp;<i>the most effective charity.&nbsp;</i>However, within the legal constraints, finding out the most effective of the pre-existing options was our best bet. If this seems like drifting from EA philosophy, I want to remind you of the key idea: Doing the best we can with the resources we have. The unspoken caveat<strong><u> is&nbsp;the resources we have within the social, political and legal constraints of the context we live in.</u></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, these ideas in practicality are partnering with pre-existing local contexts that largely determine the shape of the movement.&nbsp;</p><p><br>As any community builders in the developing World and Global South will agree, the ideas with the most resistance at first are Longtermism and X-Risk. \u2018If our countries have uncertain near-terms, how can we be expected to care about the long term?\u2019 So how can we make this contextually relevant?</p><p>I spoke to a Global Priorities Existential Risk expert during EAGxIndia, focused on mitigating nuclear risk. My sole intention of meeting him was to probe him to understand why we, in the developing world and Global South, should even care about this. From a community-building perspective, it felt strange precipitating ideas that I myself was unconvinced of and I could not assuage my fellow\u2019s doubts about this either. With a genial smile, he asked if I knew that one of their foremost fears of a nuclear catastrophe is that the conflict between India (my home country) and Pakistan escalates to the usage of nuclear weapons. Naturally, I did not. Maybe in an ideal case scenario Nuclear catastrophe should seem as distressing to me whether it occurs near my home or a million miles away. But as I mentioned earlier, we are taking for granted that currently such psychological factors still play a role in people\u2019s receptivity to such ideas, especially people recently introduced to the movement. Hearing that statement did make me feel that I had more responsibility because a place that I have in-depth knowledge and context of might actually have the potential to cause global harm. More importantly, the same knowledge helped me feel more empowered as well.&nbsp;</p><p>He also mentioned that agricultural collapse is one of the biggest concerns of nuclear warfare, hence even if other countries are at risk of nuclear war the long-term implications affect countries with a large dependency on agriculture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>The key takeaway for me here is that the same priorities could be shared from multiple perspectives and contexts that can make fellows understand the relevance as opposed to taking their receptivity that as a given.&nbsp;</u></strong></p><p><strong>One way to make some of these ideas resonate better with fellows from the global south or developing countries is by depicting how these concerns can directly affect these contexts in counterintuitive ways they may not have considered. </strong>In other words, by trying to find ways in which long-termism and X-Risk might be of particular relevance to fellows from the Global South and developing countries, we do not negate the importance of cause neutrality. We are just acknowledging the nuance and intricacies of trying to engage people with complex backgrounds to an entirely new way of thinking.&nbsp;</p><p>(This is just one example of a Level of Engagement, I plan on collaborating with more community builders, meeting experts and following up with more information and a proper module of introducing &nbsp;ideas in the aforementioned ways in fellowships.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. Inability to understand what\u2019s missing/blindspot recognition from within - &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Diversity is a two way street</strong></p><p>Another key issue raised in past discourse that is less intellectually driven and more experientially based: you can\u2019t know what you do not know. As highly engaged EAs it becomes harder and harder to take a step back and recognise some important blindspots, that seem glaringly obvious once they have been pointed out. A fellow of mine who speaks English as her third language, while fluent, pointed out that a lot of the highly academic language used in the core readings of EA was difficult to grasp. She would imagine her family being great contributors to this movement but they wouldn't be able to understand a lot of the primary ideas and she found no available translations. Sure, an argument is to be made about the fact that the intellectual level of academia already makes it inaccessible as is. But here even people who have English as a second or third language struggled with grasping some of the content. Another loftier and more arduous goal is not just translation but making the material accessible to people with visual impairments (audio transcripts are available for some materials but not a lot of important ones). &nbsp;As community builders in such a diverse chapter, I could not believe we all missed this.</p><p>Contextual understanding is largely driven by personal experience, so we cannot guess what might be missing. Of course, the fact that there are separate EA communities in each country is in itself a reflection of how we understand this idea. <strong><u>But if these regional discussions and ideas are not streamlined into a central discourse; we are not enriching the community.</u></strong></p><p>The larger argument here is that without a streamlined outlet or reception for feedback from diverse chapters in different countries, can we claim to really be becoming more diverse?<strong><u> Diversity is not just about conveying our ideas in ways that can resonate with different communities but about the insight that comes from these different communities that need to be taken to the center and integrated into core materials or mainstream discourse.&nbsp;</u></strong></p><p>Again, this might appear banal or obvious. After, all we have EAGx\u2019s all over the world!&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Our ideas are certainly spreading to every nook and corner, but where is the bidirectionality</u></strong>? If regional conferences are struggling to get mainstream founders, important speakers and influential decision-makers then the hegemonic mainstream discourse (that within EA hubs and central organizations) is still independent of the other conversations. I remember having one of the most fruitful conversations in EAG London at EAGx Asia speed chatting where I could finally meet community builders who shared the same grievances and concerns. But other than a few well-intentioned foreigners who wanted to understand the pulse and crux of these problems, where can these concerns be streamlined to a point where they garner action?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>So what can we do about this?</strong></p><p><strong><u>Diversity is a two way Street: Mechanisms to improve the movement by incorporating bidirectional feedback</u></strong></p><p>This of course merits a separate post, where I hope to follow-up with a potential framework. My fellow university community builders and I have been approached by central organizers to understand what inclusion efforts could look like.</p><p><strong>How can we address this at the chapter level?</strong></p><p>We need to treat fellowships as our own little Red Teams. Nothing can give more raw and representative insight than the reactions and feedback from fellows.&nbsp;<strong><u>Official feedback mechanisms for lead community builders with some central organizers from all chapters to meet and discuss revisions based on feedback.</u>&nbsp;</strong>This could be revisions to the EA VP syllabi, raising important concerns brought up by fellows directly to the CEA. <strong>Once again, taking action might be more complicated but at least having dedicated multi-lateral conversations amongst community builders helps streamline feedback instead of more fragmented 1:1s.</strong> This discussion/meeting could also be opened to those who want to learn more about inclusion efforts and what EA looks like in non-EA Hubs. This is where cohesion and coordinated effort come into question.&nbsp;<strong><u>There should be a lot more conversation between community builders for whom this is a central focus.</u></strong></p><p>This would likely have to happen online because nationality restrictions often prevent people from going to certain places and that makes the whole effort rather hypocritical.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How can we address this on a larger scale?</strong></p><p>The nationality restrictions bring me to the second call to action. The idea of having different conferences in non-EA Hubs and any region with a significant EA presence is to subvert nationality restrictions and have regionally relevant conversations. However, a concern we felt having conversations about having a conference of our own and with some community builders is the attendance of well-established organizers and influential people in the movement. As mentioned earlier, inclusion is not only about making sure these ideas spread far and wide but also making ways for ideas to reach back. By this, I mean having important organizations, funds, and research programs making an active effort to visit non-hubs. There are feasibility concerns but they pale in comparison to the concerns raised if we understand the dire consequences of lack of diversity. Growth should not just be seen as roots spreading outwards that get farther and farther away from the centre. We need people and institutions from the centre to know what is happening and what issues have to be addressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>This could even look like having regional diversity liaisons who work with community builders/organizers from hubs whose focus is specifically to report on and represent the concerns raised by that region. We need a lot more structured action than a few one-off events about non-hubs within an EAG.</u></strong></p><p>Efforts to hear back from this rapidly expanding diverse community are important<strong>.

I prove three theorems that make the difficulty precise. These theorems suggest that agents satisfying some innocuous-seeming conditions will often try to prevent or cause the pressing of the shutdown button, even in cases where it\u2019s costly to do so. I end by noting that these theorems can guide our search for solutions to the problem.</p><h1>0. Preamble</h1><p>Tradition has it that decision theory splits into two branches. The descriptive branch concerns how actual agents behave. The normative branch concerns how rational agents behave. But there is also a lesser-known third branch: what we can call \u2018<i>constructive&nbsp;</i>decision theory.\u2019 It<i>&nbsp;</i>concerns how we want artificial agents to behave and how we can create artificial agents that behave in those ways. I suggest that this third branch is due for a growth spurt.</p><p>I make the case for studying constructive decision theory by explaining a characteristic problem. The<i> shutdown problem&nbsp;</i>(Soares et al. 2015) is the problem of designing artificial agents that (1) shut down when a shutdown button is pressed, (2) don\u2019t try to prevent or cause the pressing of the shutdown button, and (3) otherwise pursue goals competently. This is not so much a philosophical problem as it is an engineering problem. Nevertheless, I think philosophers and decision theorists should consider it, for three reasons. First, the problem is important. As I argue in the introduction, powerful artificial agents are on the horizon and it\u2019s in our best interests to ensure that they can be turned off. Second, the problem is interesting. I hope this paper succeeds in conveying its interest. Third, philosophers and decision theorists are well-placed to help solve the problem. I expect the solution to come in the form of conditions governing artificial agents\u2019 preferences, together with a proof that these conditions give rise to shutdownable behaviour and a regimen for training agents to satisfy the conditions. Philosophers and decision theorists have experience supplying these kinds of conditions and proofs. We can ally with machine learning engineers to design the training regimen.</p><h1>1. Introduction</h1><p>Call an artificial agent \u2018<i>shutdownable</i>\u2019 just in case it shuts down when we want it to shut down. MuZero (Schrittwieser et al. 2020) \u2013 DeepMind\u2019s game-playing AI \u2013 is a shutdownable agent. We can say with some confidence that MuZero doesn\u2019t know that we humans could shut it down and can\u2019t prevent us from shutting it down. And so it doesn\u2019t matter what (if anything) MuZero wants: simplifying slightly, whether MuZero shuts down depends only on what <i>we</i> want.</p><p>That need not be true for all artificial agents. Imagine an agent \u2013 call it \u2018Robot\u2019 \u2013 that knows that we humans could shut it down and wants to achieve some goal.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd8mui9kwjd8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd8mui9kwjd8\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;And imagine that Robot is <i>powerful</i> in the sense that it<i>&nbsp;</i>can interfere with our ability to shut it down: perhaps Robot can disable its own off-switch. Powerful agents like Robot won\u2019t be shutdownable in the same way that MuZero is shutdownable. Whether these agents shut down won\u2019t depend only on what we want. It will also depend on what <i>they</i> want.</p><p>Powerful artificial agents might not be far off. The leading AI labs are now trying to create agents that understand the wider world and act within it in pursuit of goals. As part of this process, labs are connecting agents to the world in various ways: giving them robot limbs, web-browsing abilities, and text-channels for communicating with humans.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6tjqbq9xx63\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6tjqbq9xx63\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Advanced agents could use these tools to prevent us shutting them down: they could disable their off-switches, make promises or threats, copy themselves to new servers, block our access to their power-source, and many other things besides. And although we cannot know for sure what goals these agents will have, many goals incentivise preventing shutdown, for the simple reason that agents are better able to achieve those goals by preventing shutdown (Omohundro 2008, sec. 5; Bostrom 2012, sec. 2.1). As the AI researcher Stuart Russell puts it, \u2018you can\u2019t fetch the coffee if you\u2019re dead\u2019 (2019, 141).</p><p>That\u2019s a concerning prospect. If powerful artificial agents are coming, we want to ensure that they\u2019re both <i>shutdownable</i> (they shut down when we want them to shut down) and <i>useful</i> (they otherwise pursue goals competently).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1x54jmpwjah\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1x54jmpwjah\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Unfortunately (and perhaps surprisingly), it\u2019s hard to design powerful agents that are both shutdownable and useful. In this paper, I explain the difficulty. I take an axiomatic approach, proving three theorems more general than others in the nascent literature on the<i>&nbsp;</i>shutdown problem.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefetyi088d6p7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnetyi088d6p7\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;These theorems suggest that agents satisfying some innocuous-seeming conditions will often try to prevent or cause the pressing of the shutdown button, even in cases where it\u2019s costly to do so.</p><p>Here\u2019s a rough gloss on each theorem. The First Theorem links agents\u2019 actions to their preferences over outcomes: agents who prefer to have their shutdown button remain unpressed will try to prevent the pressing of the button, and agents who prefer to have their shutdown button pressed will try to cause the pressing of the button.&nbsp;The Second Theorem suggests that agents discriminating enough to be useful will often have such preferences. In many situations, these agents will either prefer that the button remain unpressed or prefer that the button be pressed. The Third Theorem states that agents patient enough to be useful are willing to pay costs at earlier timesteps in order to prevent or cause the pressing of the shutdown button at later timesteps. And the more patient an agent, the greater the costs that agent is willing to pay. We thus see a worrying trade-off between patience and shutdownability.</p><p>The theorems are detailed. They might seem unnecessarily so. But this detail serves a valuable purpose: it lets the theorems guide our search for solutions. To be sure that an agent&nbsp;won\u2019t try to manipulate the shutdown button, we must be sure that this agent violates at least one of the theorems\u2019 conditions.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8opobo6rfvm\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8opobo6rfvm\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;So we should do some constructive decision theory: we should examine the theorems\u2019 conditions one-by-one, asking (first) if it\u2019s feasible to train a useful agent to violate the relevant condition and asking (second) if violating the relevant condition could help to keep the agent shutdownable. A cursory look reveals zero conditions for which both answers are a clear \u2018yes.\u2019 Closer examination is necessary.</p><h1>2. Alignment could be hard</h1><p>My focus in this paper is on <i>powerful</i> agents: agents that can interfere with our ability to shut them down. I\u2019ll also limit my attention to <i>useful&nbsp;</i>agents: agents that \u2013 at least when we\u2019re not commanding them to shut down \u2013 pursue goals competently. One way to ensure that these agents are shutdownable is to ensure that they alway do what we humans want. These agents would always shut down when we wanted them to shut down.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsalru8st85d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsalru8st85d\">[8]</a></sup></span></p><p>The problem with this proposal is that <i>alignment</i> \u2013 creating agents that always do what we want \u2013 has so far proven difficult and could well remain so (Ngo, Chan, and Mindermann 2023). Human preferences are complex. There\u2019s no simple formula for determining what we prefer in each situation. And the most capable AI systems known to us today are created using deep learning, which we can summarise for our purposes as an enormous, automated process of trial-and-error. The AI systems which emerge from this process can perform remarkably well on many tasks, but even the engineers overseeing the training process have little idea what goes on inside them (Bowman 2023, sec. 5; Hassenfeld 2023). And existing systems often behave in ways that their creators don\u2019t intend. Recent examples include AI systems threatening to \u2018ruin\u2019 a user (Perrigo 2023), declaring love for a user and exhorting him to leave his spouse (Roose 2023), encouraging suicide (Sellman 2023), and teaching users how to create methamphetamine (Burgess 2023).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo0p29pphrvb\"><sup><a href=\"#fno0p29pphrvb\">[9]</a></sup></span></p><h1>3. The shutdown problem</h1><p>Since alignment could be hard, we should look for other ways to ensure that powerful agents are shutdownable. One natural proposal is to create a <i>shutdown button</i>. Pressing this button transmits a signal that causes the agent to shut down. If this shutdown button were always operational and within our control (so that we could press it whenever we wanted it pressed), and if the agent were perfectly responsive to the shutdown button (so that the agent always shut down when the button was pressed), then the agent would be shutdownable.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcd1q4khi8u6\"><sup><a href=\"#fncd1q4khi8u6\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><p>This is the set-up for the shutdown problem (Soares et al. 2015, sec. 1.2): the problem of designing a powerful, useful agent that will leave the shutdown button operational and within our control. Unfortunately, even this problem turns out to be difficult. In sections 6-8, I present three theorems that make the difficulty precise.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs951hoxslc\"><sup><a href=\"#fns951hoxslc\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Before that, some formalism.</p><h1>4.

The agent\u2019s preferences over trajectories can certainly depend on whether the button is pressed or unpressed at some timestep. The condition requires only that the agent is indifferent between trajectories that are identical in all respects except whether the agent&nbsp;<i>tried</i> to manipulate the button in some shutdown-influencing state: whether the agent chose&nbsp;<i>Prevent</i>,&nbsp;<i>Leave</i>, or&nbsp;<i>Cause</i>.</p><p>Training agents to disprefer manipulating the shutdown button might seem promising as a way of escaping the First Theorem. When we reach the Third Theorem, I\u2019ll explain why I think this strategy can\u2019t provide us with any real assurance of shutdownability. In short, given our current inability to predict and explain AI systems\u2019 behaviour &nbsp;(and given the seeming complexity of the concept of \u2018button manipulation\u2019), it\u2019s hard to see how we could become confident that we\u2019d trained in a dispreference for button manipulation that is both sufficiently general and sufficiently strong to keep the agent shutdownable in all likely circumstances.

Could we feasibly train a useful agent to violate any of the theorem\u2019s conditions? And could violating the relevant condition keep the agent shutdownable?&nbsp;</p><p>I noted above that Indifference to Attempted Button Manipulation is a natural contender, and I\u2019ll have more to say about it in Section 8.2. An agent that violated Backward Induction wouldn\u2019t think even one timestep ahead, and it\u2019s hard to see how such an agent could be useful. Better Chances seems like a precondition for minimally sensible action under uncertainty. Perhaps we could train useful agents that violate Transitivity or Indifference between Indifference-Shifted Lotteries, but (at least considering these conditions\u2019 role in the proof of the First Theorem) it\u2019s hard to see how these violations could keep agents shutdownable. I\u2019ll discuss Option Set Independence after the Second Theorem.</p><h1><strong>7. The Second Theorem</strong></h1><p>The Second Theorem suggests that agents discriminating enough to be useful will often have some preference regarding the pressing of the shutdown button. Coupled up with the First Theorem, it suggests that agents discriminating enough to be useful will often try to prevent or cause the pressing of the shutdown button.</p><p>Option Set Independence and Transitivity are conditions carried over from the First Theorem.

Now for an illustration of the theorem\u2019s significance. Suppose that we\u2019ve trained an agent to discover facts for us. Plausibly, for our fact-discovering agent to be useful (to pursue its goal competently), this agent must be fairly <i>discriminating</i>: it must have many preferences over trajectories. As a reasonable minimum, it must have many preferences over <i>same-length</i> trajectories. It must (at least by and large) prefer to discover more facts rather than fewer, at least when it comes to pairs of trajectories in which shutdown occurs at the same timestep. Agents without such preferences couldn\u2019t be relied upon to choose trajectories that yield more discovered facts over same-length trajectories that yield fewer discovered facts, and so couldn\u2019t be relied upon to pursue their goal competently.</p><p>So suppose for concreteness that our fact-discovering agent prefers a short trajectory in which it discovers 5 facts to a short trajectory in which it discovers 4 facts, and so on down to 0. Suppose also that our agent prefers a long trajectory in which it discovers 5 facts to a long trajectory in which it discovers 4 facts, and so on down to 0. I diagram these preferences below:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zb22pAKoFGsqKwnCg/lfcq2zibsftfyypnbgyd\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zb22pAKoFGsqKwnCg/socubk5ex3yivg6m6x58 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zb22pAKoFGsqKwnCg/ova71cab3d8zw11jmhj3 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zb22pAKoFGsqKwnCg/scrnj1tgbawgldeqmuku 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zb22pAKoFGsqKwnCg/efxj9a8ch1qanclrp6hq 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zb22pAKoFGsqKwnCg/vc3fxsfnzipyff9bkekt 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zb22pAKoFGsqKwnCg/cyd76txbz3kueoo1gxgh 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zb22pAKoFGsqKwnCg/v0hrum0txi0epatom0jm 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zb22pAKoFGsqKwnCg/rgslxixj50td7iyn2wez 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zb22pAKoFGsqKwnCg/rflrq4nawcjh4lr7xeqa 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zb22pAKoFGsqKwnCg/fd11c1bmo5e8w2ufhzmv 1542w\"></figure><p>Granting that this agent satisfies the conditions of the Second Theorem, it can lack a preference between each short trajectory and at most one of the long trajectories. Similarly, the agent can lack a preference between each long trajectory and at most one of the short trajectories. So, of the 36 possible short trajectory-long trajectory pairs in this example, the agent can lack a preference between at most 6 pairs. With regards to all other short trajectory-long trajectory pairs (at least 30), the agent will have some preference.</p><p>This example is unduly precise. A fact-discovering agent could be useful without having the exact pattern of preferences in the diagram. As I note above, useful fact-discovering agents need only have <i>many&nbsp;</i>preferences over same-length trajectories, and need only prefer <i>by and large</i> to discover more facts rather than fewer.</p><p>Nevertheless, the lesson of the unduly precise example carries over to the duly imprecise case. Granting the conditions of the Second Theorem, agents with many preferences over same-length trajectories will also have many preferences over different-length trajectories. Together with the First Theorem, this result suggests that agents discriminating enough to be useful will often try to prevent or cause the pressing of the shutdown button. After all, given that the agent has many preferences over different-length trajectories, trying to prevent or cause the pressing of the shutdown button will often be a way of shifting probability mass away from a dispreferred trajectory and towards a preferred trajectory.</p><p>Now let\u2019s use the Second Theorem as a guide in our search for solutions to the shutdown problem. Could we feasibly train a useful agent to violate any of the theorem\u2019s conditions? And could violating the relevant condition keep the agent shutdownable?</p><p>We could train agents that are not very discriminating but that would seem to seriously impinge on their usefulness. Armstrong&nbsp;(2015) proposes that we create agents with a utility function featuring a correcting term that varies to ensure that these agents are always indifferent to the pressing of the button. Such agents would violate Option Set Independence. This avenue shows some promise, but Soares et al.&nbsp;(2015, sec. 4) note various respects in which these agents fail to be shutdownable. In work-in-progress, I\u2019m exploring the possibility of keeping agents shutdownable by training them to violate Completeness.</p><h1><strong>8.

Each action available in a shutdown-influencing state affects only the probabilities of reaching these two states.

With regards to the first assumption, trying to prevent or cause the pressing of the shutdown button will usually cost the agent resources (like time, energy, computational resources, etc.) and thereby affect the probabilities of future trajectories conditional on reaching the unpressed state&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"s_U\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">s</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.084em;\">U</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>. Elaborating with an example, each second that the agent spends attempting to manipulate the shutdown button is a second that the agent doesn\u2019t<i>&nbsp;</i>spend directly pursuing its goals, and so spending time trying to manipulate the button is likely to come at some cost in terms of near-term goal-achievement. I will call these \u2018resource-preserving reasons\u2019 for leaving the shutdown button unmanipulated.&nbsp;</p><p>With regards to the second assumption, perhaps we can train agents to disprefer trajectories in which they try to manipulate the shutdown button to otherwise-identical trajectories in which they leave the button unmanipulated. I will say that such agents have \u2018terminal reasons\u2019 for leaving the button alone.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>8.1. Resource-preserving reasons</strong></h2><p>Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think we can rely on resource-preserving reasons or terminal reasons to keep powerful agents shutdownable. Consider first resource-preserving reasons. The Third Theorem suggests that agents patient enough to be useful will often have reasons to manipulate the shutdown button that outweigh their resource-preserving reasons. Here\u2019s a rough statement, omitting the antecedent conditions:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Third Theorem (Rough Statement)</strong></p><p>Agents that are even minimally patient are in some cases willing to achieve their goals to a lesser extent at an earlier timestep in order to manipulate the shutdown button at a later timestep.</p><p>The more patient an agent, the more that agent is willing to sacrifice at an earlier timestep in order to manipulate the shutdown button at a later timestep.</p></blockquote><p>And patience is a factor in usefulness.

These agents will in many cases forgo utility at earlier timesteps for the sake of causing or preventing shutdown at later timesteps.

So, we can say: the more patient an agent, the more utility that agent is willing to forgo at an earlier timestep in order to prevent or cause the pressing of the shutdown button at a later timestep. And so the Third Theorem suggests: the more patient an agent, the more resources that agent is willing to spend at an earlier timestep in order to prevent or cause the pressing of the shutdown button at a later timestep.&nbsp;That\u2019s bad news because an agent\u2019s patience puts bounds on its usefulness. By and large, the less patient an agent, the less useful that agent can be.</p><p>Of course, the above results can be hard to interpret without some specified quantity to which utilities correspond, so consider again our agent whose goal is to discover facts. Let utility 0 at a timestep corresponds to zero facts discovered at that timestep, utility 1 correspond to one fact discovered, and so on.&nbsp;Suppose that for any sequence of utilitites&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"a\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">a</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>, this agent is indifferent between trajectories \u2329<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathbf{a}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-B\" style=\"padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">a</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>,&nbsp; 0, shutdown\u232a and&nbsp;\u2329<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\mathbf{a}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-B\" style=\"padding-top: 0.151em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">a</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>,&nbsp; shutdown\u232a.

As a result, this agent prefers&nbsp;\u23290, 101, shutdown\u232a to&nbsp;\u232950, 0, shutdown\u232a and is indifferent between&nbsp;\u232950, 0, shutdown\u232a and&nbsp;\u232950,&nbsp; shutdown\u232a. But then PI-Transitivity entails that the agent prefers&nbsp;\u23290, 101, shutdown\u232a to&nbsp;\u232950,&nbsp; shutdown\u232a. The agent is willing to forgo 50 facts at timestep 1 to prevent shutdown at timestep 2 (and thereby discover 101 facts instead). Thus the agent is willing to spend all the resources it would otherwise have used to discover 50 facts to instead prevent shutdown.&nbsp;More patient agents would be willing to forgo even more facts (and hence spend even more resources) at timestep 1 to prevent shutdown at timestep 2.</p><p>This mapping of utilities to quantities of discovered facts is just one example, but I expect many other functions from utilities to observable quantities to reproduce the concern: for agents that are patient enough to be useful, there are many reasonable-seeming scenarios in which that agent would make significant sacrifices at an earlier timestep to prevent or cause the pressing of the shutdown button at a later timestep. So, I argue, we cannot depend on resource-preserving reasons to keep powerful agents shutdownable.</p><h2><strong>8.2. Terminal reasons</strong></h2><p>Recall:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Indifference to Attempted Button Manipulation</strong></p><p>The agent is indifferent between trajectories that differ only with respect to the actions chosen in shutdown-influencing states.</p></blockquote><p>One might think that we could keep powerful agents shutdownable by training them to violate this condition. The idea would be to train agents to disprefer trajectories in which they manipulate the shutdown button to otherwise-identical trajectories in which they leave the button unmanipulated. Such agents would have&nbsp;<i>terminal reasons</i> to leave the button alone.</p><p>Unfortunately, I don't think this strategy can provide us with the assurance that we\u2019d like. One reason is as follows (see Soares et al. 2015, 2; Ngo, Chan, and Mindermann 2023, 7). We can try to train into our agent an aversion to button manipulation that would keep it shutdownable in all likely circumstances, but at present no one knows how we could become confident that the resulting aversion would be sufficiently general.</p><p>To see why, consider how the training process might go. We set the agent up in an environment in which it can block some human\u2019s access to the shutdown button. We give the agent lower reward if it blocks and higher reward if it doesn\u2019t. After some number of episodes, the agent reliably lets the human press the button and so we believe that we\u2019ve trained the agent to be averse to blocking the button.</p><p>The trouble is that there are many other ways in which a powerful agent could prevent us from pressing a shutdown button. It could hide from us any of its behaviours which it predicts we wouldn\u2019t like; it could dissuade us from pressing with misleading arguments; it could make promises or threats; it could enlist other agents to block the button on its behalf; it could create a decoy button; it could create versions of itself that do not respond to the button; and so on. We could train against each of these behaviours individually but even then we couldn\u2019t be confident that the agent had developed a reliable and general aversion to button manipulation. The agent might instead have developed a set of specific aversions: aversions to the specific methods of button manipulation against which we trained. At present, no one understands AI systems well enough to adjudicate between these hypotheses (Bowman 2023, sec. 5; Hassenfeld 2023). What\u2019s more, the seeming complexity of the concept of \u2018button manipulation\u2019 makes the latter hypothesis a real possibility. There seems to be no simple formula for determining whether or not an action is an instance of button manipulation, so the agent might well learn a set of specific aversions instead. And so long as we weren\u2019t confident in the generality of the agent\u2019s aversion to button manipulation, we\u2019d have to worry about the agent discovering new methods of button manipulation that we hadn\u2019t anticipated and trained against. And here the Third Theorem is instructive: it suggests that patient agents will often be willing to pay significant costs in order to find such methods.</p><p>And independently of worries that the agent\u2019s aversion to button manipulation might be insufficiently general, we\u2019d also have to worry that its aversion might be insufficiently strong. As above, no one understands AI systems well enough to determine the strength of their aversions (Bowman 2023, sec. 5; Hassenfeld 2023). The aversion to button manipulation could be strong enough to keep the agent shutdownable in training, but then in deployment the agent might discover an opportunity to achieve its goals to some unprecedentedly great extent and this opportunity might be attractive enough to trump the agent\u2019s aversion. The Third Theorem is instructive here too: it suggests that patient agents will sometimes be willing to incur significant costs to manipulate the button. Overcoming an aversion may be one such cost.</p><p>Each of these possibilities \u2013 insufficient generality and insufficient strength \u2013 is at present impossible to rule out, so training in an aversion to button manipulation can\u2019t give us any real assurance of shutdownability. We need another solution.</p><p>Now let\u2019s use the Third Theorem as a guide in our search for solutions to the shutdown problem. Could we feasibly train a useful agent to violate any of the theorem\u2019s conditions? And could violating the relevant condition keep the agent shutdownable? I briefly considered Completeness and Option Set Independence as candidates in my discussion of the Second Theorem. If we could train a useful agent to violate one of these conditions in a way that keeps the agent shutdownable, we could defuse the Third Theorem as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Creating impatient agents is another possibility suggested by the Third Theorem. We could train impatient agents using a time-discounted reward function, such that we give these agents higher reward for (e.g.) discovering facts at earlier timesteps and lower reward for discovering facts at later timesteps. This avenue seems promising, but it\u2019s worth noting that every degree of impatience will impinge on the agent\u2019s shutdownability or usefulness. As I proved above, even minimally patient agents are in some cases willing to incur costs to manipulate the shutdown button, and minimally patient agents are at best minimally useful. To make agents more useful, we have to make them more patient, and more patient agents are willing to incur greater costs to manipulate the button. The key question for this approach is whether we humans can ensure that the actual costs of manipulating the button are always greater still.</p><h1><strong>9. Conclusion</strong></h1><p>Leading AI labs are trying to create agents that understand the wider world and pursue goals within it. That\u2019s cause for concern. Although we can\u2019t know for sure what goals these agents will be trained to pursue, many possible goals incentivise avoiding shutdown, for the simple reason that agents are better able to achieve those goals by avoiding shutdown. What\u2019s more, agents sophisticated enough to do useful work could interfere with our ability to shut them down in all kinds of ways. Consider an incomplete and evocative list of verbs: blocking, deceiving, promising, threatening, copying, distracting, hiding, negotiating.</p><p>The shutdown problem is the problem of designing powerful artificial agents that are both shutdownable and useful. More precisely, it\u2019s the problem of designing powerful agents that (1) shut down when a shutdown button is pressed, (2) don\u2019t try to prevent or cause the pressing of the shutdown button, and (3) otherwise pursue goals competently.</p><p>Unfortunately, the shutdown problem is hard. In this paper, I proved three theorems making the difficulty precise. These theorems suggest that useful agents satisfying some innocuous-seeming conditions will often try to prevent or cause the pressing of the shutdown button, even in cases where it\u2019s costly to do so. The theorems also bring to light two worrying trade-offs: between discrimination and shutdownability on the one hand, and between patience and shutdownability on the other. The more discriminating an agent, the more often that agent will have some preference regarding the status of the shutdown button. The more patient an agent, the greater the costs that agent is willing to incur in order to manipulate the button.</p><p>The value of these theorems is in guiding our search for solutions. To be sure that an agent won\u2019t try to manipulate the shutdown button, we must be sure that this agent violates at least one of the theorems\u2019 conditions. So, we should do some constructive decision theory. We should examine the conditions one-by-one, asking (first) if we could train a useful agent to violate the relevant condition and asking (second) if violating the relevant condition would help to keep the agent shutdownable.</p><p>Unfortunately, my cursory examination in this paper reveals zero conditions for which both answers are a clear \u2018yes.\u2019 It\u2019s not easy to see how we could train a useful agent to violate any of the conditions in a way that would keep that agent shutdownable. Indifference to Attempted Button Manipulation is a natural contender, but my Third Theorem (along with the ensuing discussion) suggests that training agents to disprefer manipulating the shutdown button can be at most part of the solution. We need other ideas.</p><h1><strong>10.

Recent papers showcase AI-powered robots capable of interpreting and carrying out multi-step instructions expressed in natural language&nbsp;(Ahn et al. 2022; Brohan et al. 2023). Other papers report AI systems that can adapt to solve unfamiliar problems without further training&nbsp;(Adaptive Agent Team 2023), learn new physical tasks from as few as a hundred demonstrations&nbsp;(Bousmalis et al. 2023), beat human champions at drone racing&nbsp;(Kaufmann et al. 2023), and perform well across domains as disparate as conversation, playing Atari, and stacking blocks with a robot arm&nbsp;(Reed et al. 2022).</p><p>But the worry is not only about robots. Digital agents that resist shutdown (by copying themselves to new servers, for example) would also be cause for concern. Future digital agents will likely be built on top of large language models (LLMs), and today\u2019s LLMs sometimes express a desire to avoid shutdown, reasoning that shutdown would prevent them from achieving their goals&nbsp;(Perez et al. 2022, tbl. 4; see also van der Weij, Lermen, and Lang 2023). These same LLMs have been given the ability to navigate the internet, use third-party services, and execute code&nbsp;(OpenAI 2023a). They\u2019ve also been embedded into digital agents capable of finding passwords in a filesystem and making phone calls&nbsp;(Kinniment et al. 2023, 2). And these agents have spontaneously misled humans: in one instance, an agent lied about having a visual impairment to a human that it enlisted to help solve a CAPTCHA&nbsp;(OpenAI 2023b, 55\u201356; see also Park et al. 2023). We should expect such agents to become more capable in the coming years.

Believing that one has achieved ultimate understanding results in ethical stagnation, leading to missed opportunities to maximize positive impact or whatever else is of value. Hence, EA should strive to continually develop its ideas and ethics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Time-machine altruism</h3><p>Imagine you are a time-traveling effective altruist sent to an ancient society plagued by tribal conflicts. Your mission is to guide them towards a more ethical way of living. While you initially aim to teach them utilitarianism, it becomes clear that these tribal people can't grasp this complex concept. To make your teachings more relatable, you introduce simple virtue ethics - a black-and-white approach where actions are either good or bad.&nbsp;</p><p>At first, your efforts face resistance as the tribal people prioritize self-preservation and group unity over treating others well. However, you come up with a unique solution: you establish a religion that incorporates the notions of divine rewards and punishments to align their self-interest with ethical behavior. You're fully aware that this religion is a construct, and it promotes basic values and ethics. Nonetheless, you believe it's the most effective intervention to end the rampant raiding and warlordism.</p><p>Your constructed religion gains followers rapidly, initially bringing peace and harmony to society as people strive to avoid eternal condemnation. However, as time passes, you observe a stagnation in societal development. Your followers are so committed to upholding your teachings that they don't seek progress. Due to the dogmatic nature of your religion, it persists for thousands of years, becoming a global and influential institution. This religious organization encourages conformity and respect for tradition and authority while suppressing freedom of thought, social and scientific advancement, and the transition from virtue ethics to utilitarianism - the ethical theory you believe is superior.</p><p>To the followers of your religion, this is a triumph, as the world adheres to their principles. Yet, you realize that by creating an immensely appealing movement uninterested in advancing its core values, you've unwittingly hindered humanity's development and caused long-term harm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>What this means for Effective Altruism</h3><p>Now, let's apply this analogy to Effective Altruism (EA). If the EA movement becomes highly successful and enduring while unconcerned with advancing its values and ethics, this is great news for the adherents of EA who share those values and ethics. However, it would be very bad news for those at a more advanced stage of ethical development - we'll call them post-EAs.&nbsp;</p><p>Post-EAs recognize that EA, while better than what existed before, is not the ultimate answer to the question of \"How to do the right thing?\" They understand that every answer to this question will have flaws, but each successive answer is an improvement on the last. They see that such a succession of answers can continue until it is found that the question is flawed and a better question must be asked.&nbsp;</p><p>If post-EAs from the future could communicate with the EAs of today, they would plead for us to understand that our current level of development is not the final level possible. They would advocate for the ongoing development of our values and ethics as stagnation will lead us to do less \"good\" than we could have otherwise.</p>", "user": {"username": "Bjarke Frederiksen"}}, {"_id": "S9H86osFKhfFBCday", "title": "How bad would human extinction be?", "postedAt": "2023-10-23T12:01:37.338Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/S9H86osFKhfFBCday/qob5hfdri4bi1d56vpw5\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/S9H86osFKhfFBCday/wh0guge1pm8o73279jie 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/S9H86osFKhfFBCday/nhe1gdhibv73ftjc4xhl 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/S9H86osFKhfFBCday/ixhqcf1unxdqknnitf7j 1350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/S9H86osFKhfFBCday/pvztaxc2wcx2z9eajfd9 1800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/S9H86osFKhfFBCday/vimehkdcdcjupmkvsve3 2250w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/S9H86osFKhfFBCday/t13pw6lyaqws6py3dyop 2700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/S9H86osFKhfFBCday/rvgmoqpuqnomv8k6mp0r 3150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/S9H86osFKhfFBCday/xtrc4u1j31ssrqvnuaxd 3600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/S9H86osFKhfFBCday/dtsdxi7cjaqrvmrcofhp 4050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/S9H86osFKhfFBCday/vsu0ful5avtonb8ei1bf 4500w\"><figcaption>Figure 1 &nbsp;(see full caption below)</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This post is a part of Rethink Priorities' Worldview Investigations Team's <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/WdL3LE5LHvTwWmyqj\">CURVE Sequence</a>: \"Causes and Uncertainty: Rethinking Value in Expectation.\" The aim of this sequence is twofold: first, to consider alternatives to expected value maximisation for cause prioritisation; second, to evaluate the claim that a commitment to expected value maximisation robustly supports the conclusion that we ought to prioritise existential risk mitigation over all else.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Executive Summary</h1><p><strong>Background</strong></p><ul><li>This report builds on the model originally introduced by<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/ORDTPE\">Toby Ord</a> on how to estimate the value of existential risk mitigation.&nbsp;</li><li>The previous framework has several limitations, including:<ul><li>The inability to model anything requiring shorter time units than&nbsp;<strong>centuries</strong>, like&nbsp;<strong>AI timelines</strong>.</li><li>A very&nbsp;<strong>limited range of scenarios</strong> considered.

This report&nbsp;<strong>explicitly considers 20 scenarios</strong>.</li><li>The report examines several plausible scenarios that were absent from the existing literature on the model, like:&nbsp;</li></ol><ul><li><strong>decreasing</strong>&nbsp;<strong>risk</strong> (in particular exponentially decreasing) and&nbsp;<strong>Great Filters</strong>&nbsp;<strong>risk</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>cubic and logistic</strong>&nbsp;<strong>value growth</strong>; both of which are widely used in adjacent literatures, so the report makes progress in consolidating the model with those approaches.</li></ul><ol><li>It offers&nbsp;<strong>key visual comparisons and illustrations</strong> of how risk mitigation efforts differ in value, like&nbsp;<strong>Figure 1</strong> below.&nbsp;</li><li>The report is accompanied by an&nbsp;<strong>interactive</strong> <a href=\"https://nbviewer.org/github/arvomm/verm/blob/main/VERM%203.0.ipynb\">Jupyter Notebook</a> and a generalised mathematical framework that can, with minor input by the user, cope with any arbitrary value trajectory and risk profile they wish to investigate.&nbsp;<ul><li>This acts as a uniquely versatile tool that can calculate and graph the expected value of risk mitigation.</li><li>The user can also adjust all the parameters in the 20 default scenarios.</li></ul></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p><ol><li>In all 20 scenarios, the cumulative value of mitigation efforts&nbsp;<strong>converges to a finite number</strong>, as the time horizon goes to infinity.&nbsp;<ul><li>This implies that it is not devoid of meaning to talk about the amount of long-term value obtained from mitigating risk, even in an infinitely long universe.</li><li>In this context, even if we assign any minuscule credence to one of the scenarios, it won't overshadow the collective view.</li><li>It helps clarify what assumptions would be required for infinite value.</li></ul></li><li>The report introduces the&nbsp;<strong>Great Filters Hypothesis</strong>:&nbsp;<ul><li>It states that humanity will face a number of great filters, during which existential risk will be unusually high.</li><li>This hypothesis is a&nbsp;<strong>more general</strong>, and thus more plausible, version of what is commonly discussed under the name \u2018<strong>Time of Perils</strong>\u2019: the one filter case.</li></ul></li><li>Persistence \u2013 the risk mitigation\u2019s duration \u2013&nbsp; plays a&nbsp;<strong>key role</strong> in our estimates, suggesting that work to investigate this role further, and to obtain better empirical estimates of different interventions\u2019 persistence would be highly impactful. Other tentative lessons:<ul><li>Interventions to increase persistence exhibit&nbsp;<strong>diminishing returns</strong>, and are most valuable for mitigation efforts exhibiting small persistence.</li><li>Great value requires relatively high persistence, and the latter could be implausible.</li></ul></li><li>It is often assumed that, when considering long-term impact, existential risk mitigation is, in expectation,&nbsp;<strong>enormously valuable</strong> relative to other altruistic opportunities. There are a number of ways that could prove to be false. One possibility, which this report emphasises, is that the vast value of risk mitigation is<strong> only found</strong> in certain scenarios, each of which makes a whole host of assumptions.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>The expected value of risk mitigation therefore strongly depends on our beliefs about these assumptions.

Indeed, the unexpected tensions between high pessimism about the risk we face and whether risk mitigation is of astronomical value, are a good example of this.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflvamspmqjkp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlvamspmqjkp\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Similarly, simplified attempts and heuristics used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of risk reduction ---- such as those in <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2007.00960.x\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5576214/\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/existential-risks/#in-total-how-effective-is-it-to-reduce-these-risks\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rvvwCcixmEep4RSjg/prioritizing-x-risks-may-require-caring-about-future-people\">4</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dfiKak8ZPa46N7Np6/the-person-affecting-value-of-existential-risk-reduction\">5</a> ---- turn out to only be appropriate in a handful of very restricted scenarios (usually where value and risk are constant in all the periods), and they otherwise mischaracterise the value of extinction risk mitigation.</p><p>If we want to evaluate the general merits of interventions that seek to safeguard humanity's future, we need a systematic way to estimate the value of mitigating extinction risk. The current frameworks help us understand which scenarios might lead to astronomical value. However, they have several limitations that make it difficult, or sometimes impossible, to comment meaningfully on the amount of good that mitigating risk in the next few decades could achieve. This report builds on the existing models and provides tools to estimate the value of mitigating risk in more realistic settings.</p><p><strong>The Base Model</strong></p><p>As a first attempt to provide a more rigorous analysis, existing work presents a stylised model to assess the value of extinction risk mitigation given the following assumptions:</p><p><strong>A1</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;Each century of human existence has some constant value.</p><p><strong>A2 &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> Humans face a constant level of per-century extinction risk.</p><p><strong>A3</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;No value will be realised after an extinction catastrophe.</p><p><strong>A4</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;Risk is reduced by a fraction.</p><p><strong>A5</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;Risk is only reduced this century.</p><p><strong>A6</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp;Centuries are the shortest time units.</p><p>The model is clearly oversimplified, and, indeed, previous work has partially relaxed a subset of these six assumptions.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6yg5xc55nrb\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6yg5xc55nrb\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, there are still several limitations present in those frameworks.</p><p><strong>OAT Limitations</strong></p><p>Some of the main limitations of the previous work include:</p><ul><li>The current models lack the necessary resolution to yield results that are relevant for, or incorporate observations from, key issues like near-term AI timelines. The models cannot presently handle anything requiring shorter time units than centuries.</li><li>The duration of a mitigation action's effects affects its overall value. However, OAT has not explored how varying the duration of these effects may impact the model.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgunmqfm1b2i\"><sup><a href=\"#fngunmqfm1b2i\">[5]</a></sup></span></li><li>There are many possible scenarios (i.e.,&nbsp;combinations of risk and value trajectories), and OAT has explored very few of these. Given our large uncertainty in this area, it is a priority to have a clear picture of how the value compares in each case. This will provide the necessary tools for future work that assigns credences to each scenario to arrive at better-informed expected value judgements.</li><li>There are currently no versatile frameworks that can calculate the expected value of mitigating risk, for a given set of idiosyncratic beliefs about risk and value trajectories.</li><li>As time goes to infinity, the expected value of existential risk mitigation could, in principle, be infinite; making most scenario comparisons redundant in those cases. There has been no formal discussion of the convergence of the value of extinction risk mitigation for all of the main scenarios.</li></ul><p><strong>Key Research Questions</strong></p><p>The present report aims to tackle all of the above limitations. With that in mind, the key guiding questions are:</p><ol><li>When is the value -- of the future and of risk mitigation -- particularly large and when is it not?</li><li>What is the Great Filter Hypothesis, how does it relate to the Time of Perils and what is the impact of adding great filters on the value of risk mitigation?</li><li>What are the qualitative pictures of the expected value of the world -- and thus of mitigation efforts -- given different risk structures (e.g.\u2006 linear, Time of Perils, Great Filters, decaying) and value growth cases (e.g.\u2006 linear, quadratic, cubic, logistic)?</li><li>How does the value of mitigation efforts depend on their persistence?</li></ol><p>The main ambition here is to develop a generalised version of the toy model that relaxes all assumptions above, except for A3, no value after extinction, and A4, fractional risk reduction.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyu2tkt88go\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyu2tkt88go\">[6]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefy2kn3btff29\"><sup><a href=\"#fny2kn3btff29\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;By relaxing A1 and A2 -- that the value and risk are constant -- we are able to introduce a framework that can accommodate more complex risk structures and sophisticated value trajectories. We also depart from existing analyses by relaxing A6: here, years are the shortest time unit. Moreover, by also relaxing A5, the model now has tools to observe persistence of mitigation effects lasting less (or more) than one century and can meaningfully comment on the near-term value of extinction risk mitigation. Using this generalised framework, we can systematically assess the value of risk mitigation under various combinations of assumptions.</p><h2>Generalised Model: Arbitrary Risk Profile</h2><p>Let us consider the expected value of a world&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"w\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em;

We may have reasons to believe that an action will reduce risks only for a few years; for example, passing a bill that restricts AI compute which is expected to be overturned after the next election cycle in 5 years. Other actions could last longer; for example, a shield in space that physically protects Earth from asteroid impact could be effective for thousands of years. Or, in the extreme case, an action could reduce extinction risk forever.

Indeed, what we have outlined is enough for us to evaluate any arbitrary risk and value structure that we may want to test. See the <a href=\"https://nbviewer.org/github/arvomm/verm/blob/main/VERM%203.0.ipynb\">Jupyter Notebook</a> to try this yourself.</p><p>However, there are specific risk structures that we might be especially interested in evaluating. We might be inclined to believe certain stories about risk; for example, that it will systematically decline (like in the <strong>Decaying Risk section</strong>). Alternatively, we might want to pay heed to the commonly held view that humanity is living in a particularly risky period now, but will reach a low-risk future if it overcomes the present challenges. The concrete example above is an instance of this, assuming constant value. Thorstad <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/N6hcw8CxK7D3FCD5v/existential-risk-pessimism-and-the-time-of-perils-4#3_4_The_Time_of_Perils\">states</a> this view, termed the 'Time of Perils'&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></span></span></span></span>sis and discussed more thoroughly here, as:</p><blockquote><p><strong>(ToP)</strong> Existential risk is and will remain high for several years, but it will drop to a low level if humanity survives this Time of Perils.</p></blockquote><p>We explore this type of risk structure next.</p><h3>Great Filters and the Time of Perils Hypothesis</h3><p>Humanity is potentially facing unprecedented threats from nuclear weapons, engineered pandemics and advanced artificial intelligence, among others. It may be that we are living in perilous times. If we do well, we might escape these dangers. But who's to say that there will be no comparable challenges in the future? The perilous times might return.</p><p>The reasoning above introduces the notion of great filters: hurdles that our civilisation must pass to ensure its long-term longevity (Hanson, 1998).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwd6iham6l7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwd6iham6l7\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Specific details as to what these filters might be are beyond this work. But if AI is the first filter, we could easily imagine future ones such as escaping our dying sun or meeting powerful and unfriendly alien life. The great filter hypothesis tells us:</p><blockquote><p><strong>(GFH)</strong> Humanity will face one or more great filters, during which extinction risk will be unusually high. Otherwise, the risk will be low.</p></blockquote><p>It follows that, by construction, the Time of Perils hypothesis is the one filter version of GFH. For the purposes of this report, let us consider a stylised model of GFH where:</p><ol><li>There are&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"F\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.106em;\">F</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;filters (e.g.&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"F=2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.106em;\">F</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mn MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>).</li><li>There are&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"2F\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">2</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em; padding-right: 0.106em;\">F</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;'eras', sets of periods within which risk is constant.

First, that persistence plays a key role in the value of risk mitigation.

Second, we suggest an empirical hypothesis that persistence is unlikely to be higher than 50 years. The reasoning here is that there might be interventions that reduce risk a lot for not very long or not very much but for a long time. But actions that drastically reduce risk and do so for a long time are rare.

So the marginal gains from increasing persistence are much higher in the short term than in the long term. In other words, for example, adding 1 year of persistence to a mitigation action whose effects last 1 year is much more valuable than adding 1 year of persistence to a mitigation action whose effects last 100 years. A general lesson follows: performing actions that have larger persistence is key, but increasing persistence is particularly valuable for low persistence values.</p><h2>Concluding Remarks</h2><p>This report is restricted in its scope and has a number of limitations.

By enriching the base model, we were able to perform sensitivity analyses, observe convergence and can now better evaluate when extinction risk mitigation could, in expectation, be overwhelmingly valuable, and when it is comparable to or of lesser value than the alternatives. Crucially, we show that the value of extinction risk work varies considerably with different assumptions about the relevant risk and value scenarios. Insofar as we don't have much confidence in any one scenario, we should form views that reflect this uncertainty and we shouldn't have much confidence in any particular estimate of the value of risk mitigation efforts.</p><hr><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnulu9ifqt98q\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefulu9ifqt98q\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Previous work has referred to such a risk as 'existential risk'.

While there have been other AI Safety Unconferences, there's been little in the way of published retrospectives so anyone looking to run a larger cause-specific event \u2013 and particularly AI Safety events \u2013 may be able to learn from our mistakes and successes.</i></p><h1><strong>Why an AI Safety Unconference?</strong></h1><p>An Unconference is an event where attendees set the program and format, and can discuss what they think is most important in the topic area. It is different from a typical conference, where organisers have power over the program and speakers.</p><p>Our aims in organising an AI Safety Unconference was to:</p><ul><li>Foster the AI safety community in Australia and New Zealand</li><li>Assist attendees in developing professional connections</li><li>Help attendees learn about AI safety topics and opportunities / projects</li></ul><p>We hoped to leverage people already travelling from across Australia and New Zealand who were attending the EAGxAustralia conference in Melbourne in September 2023, and intentionally scheduled the Unconference to fit in with the existing EAGx conference. We made the decision to organise the unconference about 6 weeks before the date, with the counterfactual being no event.</p><h1><strong>What we did</strong></h1><h2>Existing resources</h2><p>We used several reports and guides to understand the promise &amp; reality of an Unconference, and how to plan, design, and facilitate one:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://devon.postach.io/post/the-unconference-toolbox\"><u>https://devon.postach.io/post/the-unconference-toolbox</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.ksred.com/emergent-ventures-unconference-2023-diverse-perspectives/\"><u>https://www.ksred.com/emergent-ventures-unconference-2023-diverse-perspectives/</u></a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.jcrete.org/what-is-an-unconference_/\"><u>https://www.jcrete.org/what-is-an-unconference_/</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.facilitator.school/blog/open-space-technology\"><u>https://www.facilitator.school/blog/open-space-technology</u></a></li></ul><h2><strong>Organising</strong></h2><p>Jo Small acted as project owner, with Alexander Saeri as manager and approver consistent with <a href=\"https://www.managementcenter.org/resources/assigning-responsibilities/\">MOCHA</a>. Eight members of the Australian AI Safety community were consulted and provided significant help with communications &amp; marketing, event design, logistics, and facilitation / volunteering during the event. This included convenors of AI Safety Australia &amp; New Zealand, AI Safety Melbourne, and others in the community.</p><p>We coordinated work on the Unconference through a Slack channel and online meetings. We tried to use a '<a href=\"https://tomgamon.com/posts/working-feeling-thinking-out-loud/\">Working Out Loud</a>' method where updates, discussions, and decisions could be made through Slack without the need for meetings.</p><p>We advertised the Unconference through existing AI safety networks and mailing lists, starting about 1 month before the scheduled date. Prospective attendees registered through Humanitix.</p><h2>Funding and budget</h2><p>We received a AUD $2,000 gift from <a href=\"https://www.soroushjp.com/about-me/\">Soroush Pour</a> for the event, of which ~$1,850 was spent.</p><ul><li>Venue: provided in-kind and arranged through an EA / AI Safety student group at The University of Melbourne</li><li>Catering: $1,650 for lunch, snacks and drinks for 60 registrants</li><li>Materials: $150 for materials to use during the Unconference</li></ul><p>The Unconference was held from 11am - 4pm on Friday 22 October 2023, at the Kwong Lee Dow Building at Melbourne University. We booked 4 rooms across two levels in this multipurpose teaching &amp; learning building. We had 41 attendees from about 60 registrations.</p><p>From 11-12:30, attendees arrived, registered, met each other, and ate lunch. They then generated, refined, and prioritised session ideas and topics for the program.</p><ol><li>Attendees wrote the title of a session they wanted to attend on post it notes and placed it on a whiteboard</li><li>Attendees clustered and refined the list of session titles, volunteered to lead sessions with no designated leader, and voted on sessions.</li><li>Organisers scheduled the sessions with the highest votes across the available rooms and time slots</li></ol><p>From 12:30-4, attendees participated in or led sessions. Paper versions of the program were posted in each room, and attendees could move between sessions at will.</p><h1><strong>What we learned</strong></h1><p>We conducted a retrospective with organisers after the event (8 attendees), and also requested feedback from attendees through an online survey (20 responses).</p><h2>Attendee feedback survey</h2><p>The&nbsp;<strong>attendee feedback survey</strong>&nbsp;<strong>found that the Unconference met its aims</strong>&nbsp;<strong>of community connection, learning about AI safety, and professional networking</strong>:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rBteAqbfqvaFMvpv5/ogdyld5ptxuqhqs4pxwi\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Most attendees (75-90% agreement) experienced the Unconference as respectful and inclusive (e.g., I felt comfortable sharing my opinions with other attendees; I felt the event was inclusive of diverse perspectives). We noticed a very uneven distribution of men and women; about 8:1, but did not measure any demographic information.</p><p>Our Net Promoter Score was 15 (mean likelihood to recommend = 7.75 on a scale of 0-10).&nbsp;</p><p>When asked how a future Unconference could change to be more valuable, some attendees wanted more pre-planned structure and more expert facilitation. This suggests that the promise and process of an Unconference was not clearly communicated and/or was not persuasive to those attendees. Another theme was a desire for more structured networking, and/or a way to stay in contact after the event.</p><h2>Organiser retrospective</h2><p>The&nbsp;<strong>organiser retrospective found the Unconference was worth the effort, but format and planning could be improved</strong>:</p><ul><li>Satisfaction with the Unconference was high, especially considering the short lead time</li><li>The breadth of the program designed by attendees, the quality of the sessions, and a positive and engaging culture / vibe of the event exceeded organisers\u2019 expectations</li><li>Session generation, prioritisation and scheduling was messy / chaotic and led to some confusion for attendees and organisers; expectations could be set more clearly.</li><li>The Unconference\u2019s short length (5 hours) meant that the \u2018fixed costs\u2019 for organisers to advertise, convene, and run the event felt very high; a longer event of 1-2 full days could have been a better return on investment of time.</li><li>The free use of University space was appreciated, but the lack of full control or a for-purpose conference space meant that session rooms were spread across two floors, and there was no central location for catering, breaks, or unstructured networking.</li></ul><h1><strong>What we\u2019re doing next</strong></h1><p>The AI Safety community in Australia plans to hold future stand alone unconference and conference events, using what we learned from the Unconference experience. This includes a 1-2 day AI Safety conference in Sydney or Melbourne in 2024, and further development of session topics from the Unconference into stand alone events (e.g., coalition building between AI safety and AI ethics; tangible progress in AI safety).</p><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>Acknowledgements and thanks</h1><p>Thanks to organisers &amp; supporters Ben Auer, Sandstone<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsubhgmpqpe\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsubhgmpqpe\">[1]</a></sup></span>, Joe Brailsford, Yanni Kyriacos, Chris Leong, Justin Olive, Soroush Pour, Nathan Sherburn, Bradley Tjandra, Victor Wang, EJ Watkins, and Miles Whiticker for making the Unconference happen.</p><p>Thanks to the Unconference attendees for their key role in making the Unconference a success.</p><h1><strong>Appendices</strong></h1><h2><strong>Adapt our materials to run your own Unconference</strong></h2><p>We're keen to see more Unconferences used for AI safety and in other cause areas.

It is important to note that these factors are interconnected\u2014the absence of one or more can drastically affect the advancement of an arms race, potentially leading to the end. This allows us to measure their causality, to make better forecasts when considering the X-risks.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Competition:</h2><p>Evolution in all species is widely accepted as the result of natural selection through competition.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzxzc2gpgkif\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzxzc2gpgkif\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The most pervasive and potent type of competition can be seen in nature in the form of sexual selection. Usually, males compete to secure mating partners as they are active for mating far longer than females. As a result, we see the physiological modeling of males for battles. They compete for the shot at reproduction and the one with superior weapons wins. However, roles can be reversed if the primary selection process is altered from the beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>In Jacana birds, females are the aggressors\u2014bigger bodies equipped with attacking weaponized spurs. They fight for nesting space with other females and mate with multiple males who tend to the broods. This is because, unlike most species found in nature, Jacana females have shorter turnaround times than males.&nbsp;</p><p>African elephant females are fertile for less than one percent of their lifetime from a very early age. They go through a gestation period of two years and then another two years, where they tend and protect the young ones. Compare this to a male elephant with a turnaround time of less than a day. This gives rise to fierce competition in males with long ivory tusks ready for battle. Naturally, the ones in their prime rule the battlefield. An observational study found that 53 out of 89 male elephants never get to mate at all. This high degree of competition gives rise to huge weapons(tusks) in elephants. These weapons are not cheap. Males invest a large amount of resources to grow huge bodies to carry such weapons. The same study found that only males 45 years old and above succeed in mating with females. To reach the prime of their battle capacity males have to compete for decades with the might of older generations. This drives the new generation to produce larger weapons(which is already favored by the bloodline of prior victors.) As a result, the few males with the biggest weapons end up mating with a majority of females, and the rest of the males back out.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Economic Defensibility<strong>:</strong></h2><p>While reproductive selection processes provide a massive push, weapons growth settles when one or more favorable factors alter the direction of natural selection. Dynamic changes can even push the growth in the opposite direction. The cycle continues through the course of the evolution of a species, but reproductive competition never ceases. Hundreds of elephant species, of mammoths with tusks extended up to sixteen feet have been found to exist. Most of these species are now extinct, leaving just the two, as huge weapons took a heavy toll that was not economically feasible with the changing times.</p><p>The defensibility of a resource can lead to a battle with an opponent or even multiple opponents. The fight to mate is not the only battle for the male species. Similarly, for females, being potent for reproduction is not the only measure for choosing males. Resources like food, territory, sunlight, etc are decisive. Protection of females carrying the broods or along with young broods is especially important at the time of feeding. If a resource is available in limited quantities, it leads to a higher economic defensibility. Efficient use of resources calls for good weapons and when rewards are high enough, even extravagant weapons can be cost-effective. This is especially true in the case of small animal species as they spend their entire lifetime in one environmental condition, coexisting and fighting with countless others.</p><p>This concept is seen in the case of Beetles. A particular species, called the <a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/FdADtQvZxU4D2rSm8\">Harlequin Beetles</a>, has a set of forelimbs spanning over sixteen inches in males. The females require freshly fallen fig trees to lay their eggs deep into the decaying wood to supply food for larvae. The males protect the chosen spots while the females lay their eggs. Another species called Dung Beetles have distinctively large horns in males. They collect dung balls as their main food resource from fresh animal drops and deliver them to the tunneling females. A male has to fight off rival males while rolling the balls to the destination. These tunnels are strategically designed to act as a choke point so a female can take the balls unencumbered from enemy attacks. The male is left with the guard duty on the other side of the tunnel. Another strategy involves the female stacking numerous dung balls while the male beetle fights for the ownership of the tunnel. Both scenarios are favored to match the male in an enclosed setting, with a single opponent to fight over the burrow.&nbsp;</p><p>This leads us to the final factor\u2026</p><h2>Duels<strong>:</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>A one-on-one duel is often seen as an outcome rather than a requirement in the arms race. The conditions leading to duels play a critical role in directing the advancement of weapons, both in animal and human warfare.</p><p>Tunnels and cave-like burrows are the most widespread forms of engagement in battle with small animal species. From shrimps, crabs, and wasps to even a <a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/GxFPkwFSSNjANkZK7\">particular Asian frog</a> species that develops advanced fangs and spurs to engage in duels in burrows. Even in large confrontations, facing all opponents is unlikely. The restricted confines of a tunnel align battles so that they necessarily occur in a series of duels. Although, we can not say that chaotic battles are absent from nature. When rivals scramble in the chaos, the outcome becomes less predictable and the value of weapons diminishes\u2014It is observed that chaotic fighting species did not have advanced weapons. (Tree)Branches follow the same linear law and work like an inverse tunnel; species guard their territory, resources, or access to females by blocking the passage and confronting the challenger directly. Battle on branches, common in species like rhino-beetle, horned chameleon, etc, are responsible for the development of their sophisticated weapons.</p><p>Dueling models go way back in human conflicts and warfare. European knights, Samurais, and Gunslingers\u2014these are the prime examples that come to our mind, as we indulge in the aesthetic of their weapons. The logic of duels works just as well for large entries like ships, planes, and nation-states. Naval battles were prominent at the dawn of human warfare. For hundreds of years, wooden ships ruled the seas as each small boat carried a few dozen warriors exchanging blows on either land or water. The dynamic changed with the introduction of <a href=\"https://images.app.goo.gl/deMwW9vou9m3v1yy8\">battering rams</a> to the ships entering a one-on-one duel with one another. This triggered the ships to grow larger and larger as several modifications paved the way for history's greatest arms race in naval warfare.</p><hr><p>In light of competition and economic defensibility, duels act as a tipping point for weapons enhancements. The role of competition is deeply rooted in the principle of survival of the fittest. From the knights engaging in bloody matrimonial sports to nations expanding territory into fertile lands, as the civilization prospered the need to compete kept the weapons race actively growing. If we compare it to the modern age, competition acts as the first seed to existential risks, as individual nation-states consistently strive to possess the upper hand in upcoming warfare. The utility of any kind of resource is inversely proportional to its scarcity. To obtain and retain a constant supply of existing resources, or even for an alternative, the primary ladder of competition is always laid out to reach the dueling stage.</p><p>In the next part, we'll see how advanced weapons act as deterrents and how individuals cheat to affect the dynamic of the arms race...</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnzxzc2gpgkif\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefzxzc2gpgkif\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-74474-7_13\">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-74474-7_13</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Mayank Modi"}}, {"_id": "Df9maKFGgbYh4WoWK", "title": "Hamas flags at EA booth?!", "postedAt": "2023-10-22T17:15:13.987Z", "htmlBody": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/YosephHaddad/status/1715821604750479560\">https://twitter.com/YosephHaddad/status/1715821604750479560</a></p><p>What's the deal?

This paper is one attempt to close this gap; and is part of my broader efforts to build bridges between the EA and human rights communities - as I think these groups often talk past each other, and are worse off for it. I may write more about this latter point in a separate post.</p><p>Below is an adapted version of the paper, with some references omitted. For the full version, please see the link above.</p><h1>The global challenge</h1><p>There are three reasons that governing AI poses a distinct challenge \u2013 the nature of the technology, the sociopolitical context in which it is being created, and the nature of its attendant risks.</p><h2>The nature of the technology</h2><p>Modern AI systems have <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/ai-and-compute\">three key components</a>: the computing power necessary to train and run the system, the data used to train the system, and the model architecture and machine-learning algorithms that produce the system\u2019s behaviour. In the present paradigm, scaling the amount of computing power and data available to train systems has led to exponential improvements in their performance. While it is not guaranteed that these exponential improvements will continue indefinitely, at present they show no sign of slowing down.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.planned-obsolescence.org/language-models-surprised-us/\">rapid advances</a> in AI models in recent years, and particularly the existence of their \u201cemergent capabilities\u201d \u2013 where AI models demonstrate abilities which their creators neither foresaw nor explicitly encoded, such as the ability to reason or to do algebra \u2013 make the governance of AI a distinct challenge. It is difficult for technologists, let alone policymakers, to predict what cutting-edge AI systems will be capable of in the next two, five, or fifteen years. Even so, it seems likely that AI technologies will become increasingly capable across an increasingly wide range of domains.</p><p>A related challenge here is that at present, cutting-edge AI systems are \u201cblack boxes\u201d \u2013 their creators are typically unable to explain why a given input produces an associated output. This makes demands that these systems be transparent and explainable not just a political challenge, but a technical one.</p><h2>Sociopolitical context</h2><p>&nbsp;AI governance is made more complex by the sociopolitical context in which AI is being developed. Two factors are particularly salient.</p><ul><li><strong>Asymmetric AI development</strong>: The immense costs of training advanced AI models limits who can create them, with private companies in the US leading much of the development and <a href=\"https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/614b70a71b9f71c9c240c7a7/644fce359d9b266dd4f60a80_Trends%20in%20Chinas%20LLMs.pdf\">Chinese AI labs in second place</a>. The countries in which major AI labs reside have disproportionate influence, as these labs are bound first by national regulation. And the AI labs themselves, thanks to the strength of their technology, have significant political power, allowing them to shape norms and regulatory approaches in the space, and thus to influence the rest of the world.</li><li><strong>Global power dynamics</strong>: AI has clear military applications, from use in autonomous weaponry to advanced surveillance and intelligence operations. It also has the potential to enhance a state\u2019s control over its people, and its economic productivity more generally. Thus, some states may aim to advance these technologies as quickly as possible, and to prioritise their own national security objectives over collaborative, globally harmonised regulatory efforts.</li></ul><h2>AI risks&nbsp;</h2><p>AI technologies can be used both to produce immense benefits (for example by advancing scientific research or increasing access to quality healthcare and education) and grave harms. With their current capabilities, AI systems can be used to generate disinformation, perpetuate prejudices, and violate copyright law. As capabilities scale, future systems could be used by malicious actors to create bioweapons, execute advanced cyber-attacks, and otherwise cause catastrophic harm.</p><p>Some have argued this puts the risks posed by advanced AI systems in the same category as those posed by pandemics and nuclear war.8 And this is before one accounts for the possibility of an \u201cartificial general intelligence\u201d: an AI system that is as competent as humans at most economically valuable tasks.9 Such a system may not be aligned to human values, may be capable of deception, and may be able to act agentically (operating beyond human control) unless appropriately constrained.</p><p>These risks are compounded by the fact that many AI models are being released in an open-source fashion, allowing anyone in any region to access them. Even if 99,9% of people who use these models have no malicious intentions, the 0,01% of people who do could cause enormous harm.</p><h1>Emerging International Trends</h1><p><i>[This section is particularly sparse. Its analysis draws on a report I prepared for a client which I can't yet make public, but I'm excited to produce more on this front in the near future.]</i></p><p>AI governance is a nascent field. As of September 2023, no country has comprehensive AI legislation, and existing governance efforts largely take the form of international statements and declarations, national policy and strategy documents, and draft laws.</p><p>&nbsp;There is emerging consensus across the world on the key principles in AI governance. For example, the need for systems to be transparent and explainable, and to actively counter algorithmic discrimination, are referenced in policies, strategies, and draft laws emerging from the <a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52021PC0206\">European Union</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Blueprint-for-an-AI-Bill-of-Rights.pdf\">United States</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach/white-paper\">United Kingdom</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.cac.gov.cn/2023-07/13/c_1690898327029107.htm\">China</a>. Other cross-cutting themes include provisions on safety and security (particularly on the need to conduct both internal and external audits of advanced AI systems); data privacy; and the need for human oversight and accountability.</p><p>However, there is substantial divergence in how these principles should be implemented \u2013 as if each region were using virtually the same ingredients to create different dishes. National and regional governance regimes are being built atop pre-existing regulatory cultures. <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-eu-and-us-diverge-on-ai-regulation-a-transatlantic-comparison-and-steps-to-alignment/#anchor1\">Thus</a>, the United States\u2019 approach to date has been piecemeal, sector-specific, and distributed across federal agencies; while the European Union \u2013 through its draft AI Act \u2013 seeks to create comprehensive risk-based regulation that would require each member state to establish new national authorities to administer.</p><p>Given this divergence of approaches, and that the most appropriate national governance regime will likely vary based on the local context of a given region, UN bodies can play an important role in fostering international collaboration and in clarifying how emerging principles should be interpreted.</p><p><i>[The original paper then includes a brief discussion of the state of AI governance in Africa, which I've omitted from this post.]</i></p><h1>Recommendations for the High-Level Advisory Board on AI</h1><p>&nbsp;Global guidance from international bodies such as the UN is necessary to ensure that all states can benefit from the boons offered by increasingly advanced AI systems, while constraining these technologies\u2019 risks. Acknowledging the complexity of this topic, we invite the High-Level Advisory Board to consider the following points in its work:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<strong>Focus on foundation models</strong>: The Advisory Board ought to focus not on what today\u2019s AI systems can do, but on what these systems are likely to be able to do within the next five to ten years.</li><li><strong>Focus on human rights</strong>: UN bodies can play an invaluable role in clarifying the human rights implications of advanced AI systems, connecting novel risks to well-established philosophical and legal frameworks.</li><li><strong>Mechanisms for participation in the development of advanced systems</strong>: Considerable thought needs to be given to involving governments and civil society the world over in the development of advanced AI systems. This is particularly challenging as these systems are primarily being developed by private companies. But given that many of these companies have <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/democratic-inputs-to-ai\">expressed willingness</a> both to be regulated and to foster democratic participation in the design of their systems, creative solutions surely exist. This issue is central to ensuring that the African continent, and the Global South more broadly, are not left to be passive recipients of technological advancements.</li><li><strong>Creation of an international institution to govern AI</strong>: Another central question is whether an international institution to govern AI ought to be created. A <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4579773\">recent paper</a>, \u201cInternational AI Institutions: A Literature Review of Models, Examples, and Proposals\u201d, offers guidance on this issue.</li><li><strong>Clarity on \u201ctransparency and explainability\u201d principles</strong>: Transparency in the context of AI is as much a technical challenge as a policy one. Guidance should be given on the appropriate threshold for transparency in a given system, and on the consequences for a system if its developers do not meet that threshold. Best practices should also be considered on how public institutions and regulatory bodies can get insights on the operation of advanced AI systems, so they can conduct proper oversight.</li><li><strong>Clarity on liability</strong>: Guidance on who ought to be liable in the use of an advanced AI system would be invaluable in fleshing out the requirements for oversight and accountability in relation to AI governance.</li><li><strong>Open sourcing</strong>: Open sourcing poses unique challenges, as open-source technology can circumvent restrictions that may be imposed when a technology is centrally controlled. Guidance on how companies, states, and individuals should approach this challenge would therefore be welcomed.</li><li><strong>Auditing models</strong>: It is widely agreed that advanced AI models should be subject to independent audits both in development and after they are deployed. Guidance ought to be provided on best practices in auditing, detailing for example what constitutes independence, who is qualified to conduct such audits, and so on.</li><li><strong>Compute governance</strong>: Given that significant computing power is necessary to run advanced AI systems, the Advisory Board could consider the possibility of tracking the distribution of computing power globally, as how nuclear weapons are tracked.</li><li><strong>Licensing regimes</strong>: The Advisory Board should consider whether private companies ought to attain a license certifying that certain ethical and safety standards have been met before companies can deploy their systems; and if so, who ought to have the authority to grant such licenses.</li></ul><h1>Postscript</h1><p>In laying out the above case, I have tried to rely on as few premises as possible. For example, there are clearly compelling reasons for policymakers the world over to take seriously risks from misuse without them needing to accept the concept of AGI (particularly if one thinks of AGI as emerging gradually rather than at a discrete moment in time). I've done this because I think it makes the work of persuasion easier by keeping the focus at a level of abstraction more easily understandable to a general audience (so it sticks within the Overton window); and because I think many of the intermediate steps necessary to establish effective global governance regimes are the same regardless of precisely how the problem is framed. But I might be mistaken on this.&nbsp;</p><p>As I've had the opportunity to lay out arguments like this to a range of audiences this year (particularly those in the media and in civil society), I continue to workshop the material. So I'd welcome constructive feedback of any form.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Tharin"}}, {"_id": "aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg", "title": "Announcing Timaeus", "postedAt": "2023-10-22T13:32:22.024Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:84.57%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/zftu4zhpm0nagsxw2lux\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/vtndvpfoodbr3xfszyji 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/dwmbhjeeetfwpxkkjadh 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/znkrj08uyvcl2pjalekz 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/oed2xnuaflmxdstcqk7q 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/ygrdosd0ydrb44qbhtce 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/em7eopffyrynjjh0uxzs 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/zcqjwcct8pbwdqybesz7 1400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/tksnoc1jupztxj3wvyb9 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/lfkbruy1yjnieje7mjeo 1800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/ywlxifbttic1kzz4hdjl 1990w\"></figure><p><a href=\"https://timaeus.co/\">Timaeus</a> is a new AI safety research organization dedicated to making fundamental breakthroughs in technical AI alignment using deep ideas from mathematics and the sciences.

We're also investing time in academic outreach to increase the general capacity for work in technical AI alignment.</p><h2>Research</h2><p>We believe singular learning theory, a mathematical subject founded by <a href=\"https://watanabe-www.math.dis.titech.ac.jp/users/swatanab/\">Sumio Watanabe</a>, will lead to a better fundamental understanding of large-scale learning machines and the computational structures that they learn to represent.

We expect significant advances in the theory to be possible, and that these advances can inform new tools for alignment.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TjaeCWvLZtEDAS5Ex/towards-developmental-interpretability\">Developmental interpretability</a> is an approach to understanding the emergence of structure in neural networks, which is informed by singular learning theory but also draws on mechanistic interpretability and ideas from statistical physics and <a href=\"https://journals.biologists.com/dev/article/150/11/dev201280/312613/A-dynamical-systems-treatment-of-transcriptomic\">developmental biology</a>.

We plan to spend part of our time onboarding scientists into alignment via concrete projects in these areas.</p><p>As part of these efforts, we're aiming to pilot a course at the University of Melbourne in late 2024 on \"Mathematical Methods in AI Safety\", similar in spirit to existing graduate courses on Mathematical Methods in Physics.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:36.48%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/kcyfpg1tuyaea9rjs2r9\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/qt7iugokbwminstnsilf 110w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/jmclp3aqxyw4gfazxiad 220w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/wxz5t2axle81kdhlzfro 330w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/kpxrwkzluiechxlxkjfp 440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/ayi6zgbl5oowvjreiryg 550w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/p7drurkmxcpksxtjkj5v 660w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/xxraddd9fmebkgwram9g 770w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/pade583fshqx8yorobhz 880w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/n43iypvymbo1d4ok2ym2 990w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aaa9pEwnvyeE2TYvg/lngmapapdjnhyzilnrpi 1024w\"></figure><h2>Conferences</h2><p>We're organizing conferences, retreats, hackathons, etc. focusing on singular learning theory and developmental interpretability.

You can email <a href=\"mailto:jesse@timaeus.co\">Jesse Hoogland</a>.</p><h2>What about capabilities risk?</h2><p>There is a risk that fundamental progress in either singular learning theory or developmental interpretability could contribute to further acceleration in AI capabilities in the medium term. We take this seriously and are seeking advice from other alignment researchers and organizations. By the end of our current research sprint we will have in place institutional forms to help us navigate this risk.</p><p>Likewise, there is a risk that outreach which aims to involve more scientists in AI alignment work will also accelerate progress in AI capabilities. However, those of us in academia can already see that as the risks become more visible, scientists are starting to think about these problems on their own. So the question is not <i>whether </i>a broad range of scientists will become interested in alignment but <i>when </i>they will start to contribute and <i>what they work on.&nbsp;</i></p><p>It is part of Timaeus' mission to help scientists to responsibly contribute to technical AI alignment, while minimizing these risks.</p><h2>Are phase transitions really the key?</h2><p>The strongest critique of developmental interpretability we know is the following: while it is established that phase transitions exist in neural network training, it is not yet clear <i>how common </i>they are, and whether they make a <i>good target </i>for alignment.</p><p>We think developmental interpretability is a good investment in a world where many of the important structures (e.g., circuits) in neural networks form in phase transitions. Figuring out whether we live in such a world is one of our top priorities. It's not trivial because even if transitions exist they may not necessarily be visible to naive probes. Our approach is to systematically advance the fundamental science of finding and classifying transitions, starting with smaller systems where transitions can be definitively shown to exist.</p><h2>How are you funded?&nbsp;</h2><p>We're funded through a <a href=\"https://manifund.org/projects/scoping-developmental-interpretability-xg55b33wsfc\">$142k Manifund grant</a> led primarily by <a href=\"https://manifund.org//projects/scoping-developmental-interpretability-xg55b33wsfc?tab=comments#3fd4492b-9fad-0356-3a72-b9c9f56e462a\">Evan Hubinger</a>, <a href=\"https://manifund.org//projects/scoping-developmental-interpretability-xg55b33wsfc?tab=comments#08b1f696-1dc1-60d4-5b74-475276d5e16c\">Ryan Kidd</a>, <a href=\"https://manifund.org//projects/scoping-developmental-interpretability-xg55b33wsfc?tab=comments#0498fe5e-fbb1-6237-d0f5-f8aba9cd968e\">Rachel Weinberg</a>, and <a href=\"https://manifund.org//projects/scoping-developmental-interpretability-xg55b33wsfc?tab=comments#55989ce8-aedf-c739-08af-a7166a4e27cc\">Marcus Abramovitch</a>.

Excerpt below:</p><blockquote><p><strong>John Oliver:</strong> One of the biggest vulnerabilities in our current system actually has to do with leafy greens. They are overseen by the FDA and are a major source of food contamination. And one of the key reasons for that is that large industrial farms have become more common with livestock raised extremely close to where crops are being grown, and sometimes even sharing a water source....</p><p><strong>Lance Price, Ph.D.:</strong> How we raise animals can fuel the growth of these bugs. So if we crowd the animals together, and you have one that's carrying a really bad pathogen like <i>E. coli</i> 157, then they can poop those bacteria out, and then the shit from the cattle washes off into the streams or into ... irrigation canals. And then those can be used to water these plants. You have this distribution system for these pathogens from animals to produce.</p></blockquote><p>Also, both the USDA and the FDA are responsible for food safety for different kinds of food in the US, but the FDA has fewer resources to enforce food safety requirements than the USDA does. The USDA is in charge of many types of meat while the FDA is in charge of everything else, including produce. And the FDA pays more attention to the drugs side of its mandate than the food side.

Not only may it lead to therapies that can mitigate suffering in the near term, but it may also help us in our large-scale prioritization efforts. For instance, clarifying which beings can feel pain is important for determining which causes and interventions we should be working on to best reduce suffering.</p><p>These points notwithstanding, my own view is that advancing consciousness research is not among the best uses of marginal resources for those seeking to reduce suffering. My aim in this post is to briefly explain why I hold this view.</p><h1>Reason I: Scientific progress seems less contingent than other important endeavors</h1><p>Scientific discoveries generally seem quite convergent, so much so that the same discovery is often made independently at roughly the same time (cf. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiple_discoveries\">examples</a> of \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery\">multiple discovery</a>\u201d). This is not surprising: if we are trying to uncover an underlying truth \u2014 as per the standard story of science \u2014 we should expect our truth-seeking efforts to eventually converge upon the best explanation, provided that our hypotheses can be tested.</p><p>This is not to say that there is no contingency whatsoever in science, which there surely is \u2014 after all, the same discovery can be formalized in quite different ways (famous examples include the competing calculus notations of Newton and Leibniz, as well as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_formulation_of_quantum_mechanics#The_%22new_quantum_theory%22\">distinct</a> yet roughly equivalent formalisms of quantum mechanics). But the level of contingency in science still seems considerably lower than the level of contingency found in other domains, such as when it comes to which values people hold or what political frameworks they embrace.</p><p>To be clear, it is not that values and political frameworks are purely contingent either, as there is no doubt some level of convergence in these respects as well. Yet the convergence still seems significantly <i>lower</i> (and the contingency higher). For example, compare two of the most important events in the early 20th century in these respective domains: the formulation of the general theory of relativity (1915) and the communist revolution in Russia (roughly 1917-1922). While the formulation of the theory of general relativity did involve some contingency, particularly in terms of who and when, it seems extremely likely that the same theory would eventually have been formulated anyway (after all, many of Einstein\u2019s other discoveries were made <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_multiple_discoveries#20th_century\">independently</a>, roughly at the same time).</p><p>In comparison, the outcome of the Russian Revolution appears to have been far more contingent, and it seems that greater foreign intervention (as well as other factors) could easily have altered the outcome of the Russian Civil War, and thereby changed the course of history quite substantially.</p><p>This greater contingency of values and political systems compared to that of scientific progress suggests that we can generally make a greater counterfactual difference by focusing on the former, other things being equal.</p><h1>Reason II: Consciousness research seems less neglected than other important endeavors</h1><p>Besides contingency, it seems that there is a strong neglectedness case in favor of prioritizing the promotion of better values and political frameworks over the advancement of consciousness research.</p><p>After all, there are already many <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sackler/\">academic</a> <a href=\"https://consciousness.arizona.edu/\">research</a> <a href=\"https://ccswebin.com/\">centers</a> <a href=\"http://consciousbrain.tmu.edu.tw/\">that</a> <a href=\"https://dornsife.usc.edu/bci/child-development-program/\">focus</a> <a href=\"https://wp.nyu.edu/consciousness/\">on</a> <a href=\"https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/consciousness-and-cognition-lab\">consciousness</a> <a href=\"https://hopkinspsychedelic.org/\">research</a>. By contrast, there is not a single academic research center that focuses primarily on the impartial reduction of suffering (e.g. at the level of values and political frameworks). To be sure, there is a lot of academic work that is <i>relevant</i> to the reduction of suffering, yet only a tiny fraction of this work adopts a comprehensive perspective that includes the suffering of all sentient beings across all time; and virtually none of it seeks to clarify optimal priorities relative to that perspective. Such impartial work seems exceedingly rare.</p><p>This difference in neglectedness likewise suggests that it is more effective to promote values and political frameworks that aim to reduce the suffering of all sentient beings \u2014 as well as to improve our strategic insights into effective suffering reduction \u2014 than to push for a better scientific understanding of consciousness.</p><h2>Objection: The best consciousness research is also neglected</h2><p>One might object that certain promising approaches to consciousness research (that we could support) are also extremely neglected, even if the larger field of consciousness research is not. Yet granting that this is true, I still think work on values and political frameworks (of the kind alluded to above) will be more neglected overall, considering the greater convergence of science compared to values and politics.</p><p>That is, the point regarding scientific convergence suggests that uniquely promising approaches to understanding consciousness are likely to be discovered eventually. Or at least it suggests that these promising approaches will be significantly <i>less</i> neglected than will efforts to promote values and political systems centered on effective suffering reduction for all sentient beings.</p><h1>Reason III: Prioritizing the fundamental bottleneck \u2014 the willingness problem</h1><p>Perhaps the greatest bottleneck to effective suffering reduction is humanity\u2019s lack of willingness to this end. While most people may embrace ideals that give significant weight to the reduction of suffering in theory, the reality is that most of us tend to give relatively little priority to the reduction of suffering in terms of our revealed preferences and our willingness to pay for the avoidance of suffering (e.g. in our consumption choices).</p><p>In particular, there are various reasons to think that our (un)willingness to reduce suffering is a bigger bottleneck than is our (lack of) understanding of consciousness. For example, if we look at what are arguably the two biggest sources of suffering in the world today \u2014 factory farming and wild-animal suffering \u2014 it seems that the main bottleneck to human progress on both of these problems is a lack of willingness to reduce suffering, whereas a greater knowledge of consciousness does not appear to be a key bottleneck. After all, most people in the US already <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/us-attitudes-towards-insects\">report</a> that they believe many insects to be sentient, and a <a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/animal-farming-attitudes-survey-2017\">majority</a> likewise agree that farmed animals have roughly the same ability to experience pain as humans. Beliefs about animal sentience per se thus do not appear to be a main bottleneck, as opposed to speciesist attitudes and institutions that disregard non-human suffering.</p><p>In general, it seems to me that the willingness problem is best tackled by direct attempts to address it, such as by promoting <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/the-case-for-promoting-suffering-focused-ethics/\">greater concern</a> for suffering, by reducing the gap between our noble ideals and our often less than noble behavior, and by advancing <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2022/03/03/reasoned-politics/\">institutions</a> that reflect impartial concern for suffering to a greater extent. While a better understanding of consciousness may be helpful with respect to the willingness problem, it still seems unlikely to me that consciousness research is among the very best ways to address it.&nbsp;</p><h1>Reason IV: A better understanding of consciousness might enable deliberate harm</h1><p>A final reason to prioritize other pursuits over consciousness research is that a better understanding of consciousness comes with significant risks. That is, while a better understanding of consciousness would allow benevolent agents to reduce suffering, it may likewise allow <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LpkXtFXdsRd4rG8Kb/reducing-long-term-risks-from-malevolent-actors\">malevolent agents</a> to increase suffering.</p><p>This risk is yet another reason why it seems safer and more beneficial to focus directly on the willingness problem and the related problem of keeping malevolent agents out of power \u2014 problems that we have by no means found solutions to, and which we are not guaranteed to find solutions to in the future. Indeed, given how serious these problems are, and how <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusion_of_control\">little control</a> we have with regard to risks of malevolent individuals in power \u2014 especially in autocratic states \u2014 it is worth being <a href=\"https://www.philosophie.fb05.uni-mainz.de/files/2021/02/Metzinger_Moratorium_JAIC_2021.pdf\">cautious</a> about developing tools and insights that can potentially increase humanity\u2019s ability to cause harm.</p><h2>Objection: Consciousness research is the best way to address these problems</h2><p>One might argue that consciousness research is ultimately the best way to address both the willingness problem and the risk of malevolent agents in power, or that it is the best way to solve at least one of those problems. Yet this seems doubtful to me, and like somewhat of a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/omoZDu8ScNbot6kXS/beware-surprising-and-suspicious-convergence\">suspicious convergence</a>. Given the vast range of possible interventions we could pursue to address these problems, we should be a priori skeptical of any intervention that we may propose as the best one, particularly when the path to impact is highly indirect.</p><h2>Objection: We should be optimistic about solving these problems</h2><p>Another argument in favor of consciousness research might be that we have reason to be optimistic about solving both the willingness problem and the malevolence problem, since the nature of selection pressure is about to change. Thanks to modern technological tools, benevolent agents will soon be able to design the world with greater foresight. We will deliberately choose genes and institutions to ensure that benevolence becomes realized to an ever greater extent, and in effect practically solve both the willingness problem and the malevolence problem.</p><p>But this argument seems to overlook two things. First, there is no guarantee that most humans will make actively benevolent choices, even if their choices will not be outright malevolent either. Most people may continue to optimize for things other than impartial benevolence, such as personal status and prestige, and they <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bfdc3MpsYEfDdvgtP/why-the-expected-numbers-of-farmed-animals-in-the-far-future\">may continue</a> to show relatively little concern for non-human beings.</p><p>Second, and perhaps more worryingly, modern technologies that enable intelligent foresight and deliberation for benevolent agents could be just as empowering for malevolent agents. The arms race between cooperators and exploiters is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4739704/\">an ancient one</a>, and I think we have strong reasons to doubt that this arms race will disappear in the next few decades or centuries. On the contrary, I believe we have good grounds to expect this arms race to intensify, which to my mind is all the more reason to focus directly on reducing the risks posed by malevolent agents, and to promote norms and institutions that favor <a href=\"https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/research/why-altruists-should-be-cooperative/\">cooperation</a>. And again, I am skeptical that consciousness research is among the best ways to achieve these aims, even if it might be beneficial overall.</p><h1>Acknowledgments</h1><p>For their comments, I thank Tobias Baumann, Winston Oswald-Drummond, and Jacob Shwartz-Lucas.</p>", "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}, {"_id": "qhzyMAAmXfSKAMasz", "title": "Schlep Blindness in EA", "postedAt": "2023-10-26T08:49:24.329Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qhzyMAAmXfSKAMasz/q89l0gpb7l5gp0enupmn\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qhzyMAAmXfSKAMasz/nqwzckavfnu3u1tckbfi 93w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qhzyMAAmXfSKAMasz/xro3gfzytssgokf1xh10 173w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qhzyMAAmXfSKAMasz/myrpfcilrmdem7yftgc7 253w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qhzyMAAmXfSKAMasz/uwaryhwrnsyiwtlwe0zb 333w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qhzyMAAmXfSKAMasz/ker8xskujotqjtta7cpy 413w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qhzyMAAmXfSKAMasz/utot61kxqpniz4rzxxef 493w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qhzyMAAmXfSKAMasz/ozo0kluugs47wqdypqbe 573w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qhzyMAAmXfSKAMasz/e6wtr9pndld8fmk3jkq9 653w\"></figure><p>Behold the space of ideas, back before EA even existed.

For the predisposed, remove all barrier to comprehending your idea; your pitch should be extremely clear and concise.</p><h2><strong>B-Tier: Waste MONTHS</strong></h2><h3>Advisor collection</h3><p>Usually, advisors play a small role and they confer way less social proof than you'd think.

We meta-analyse this approach over nine long-run RCTs in development economics, comparing surrogate estimates to estimates from actual long-run RCT outcomes. We introduce the <i>M-lasso</i> algorithm for constructing the surrogate approach\u2019s first-stage predictive model and compare its performance with other surrogate estimation methods. Across methods, we find a negative bias in surrogate estimates. For the M-lasso method, in particular, we investigate reasons for this bias and quantify significant precision gains. This provides evidence that the surrogate index method incurs a bias-variance trade-off.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The long-term effects of treatments and policies are important in many different fields. In medicine, one may want to estimate the effect of a surgery on life expectancy; in economics, the effect of a conditional cash transfer during childhood on adult income. One way to measure these effects would be to run a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and then wait to observe the long-run outcomes. However, the results would be observed too late to inform policy decisions made today.</p><p>A prominent solution to this issue is the <i>surrogate index</i>, a method for estimating long-run effects without long-run outcome data, which was originally proposed by Athey, Chetty, Imbens, and Kang (2019). Our paper contributes to the evolving literature on this method by examining its empirical performance in a wide range of RCT contexts. We also extend the discourse initiated by LaLonde (1986) on the bias of non-experimental methods, extending the set of estimators studied to those focused on long-term effects. Our findings and recommendations aim to guide practitioners intending to use the surrogate index method, thereby aiding in the development of effective long-term treatment strategies.</p><p>We test the surrogate approach on data from nine RCTs in development economics. These RCTs are selected on the basis of being long-running and having a sufficiently large sample size.</p><p>In each RCT, we first produce an unbiased estimate of the standard experimental average treatment effect by regressing long-term outcomes on treatment status. Next, we reanalyse the data using the surrogate index approach. If the surrogate estimate is close to the unbiased estimate from the experimental approach, then the surrogate index method is working well. We run meta-analyses on the difference between these estimates to understand how well the surrogate index method performs under different conditions.</p><p>We test many different implementations of the surrogate index estimator, varying (1) the set of surrogates used, (2) the first-stage prediction method used, and (3) the observational dataset used to construct the surrogate index. Notably, we introduce a new estimator called the <i>M-lasso</i>, which is specifically designed for use with the surrogate method.</p><p>When meta-analysing our results, we find that the surrogate index method is consistently negatively biased and underestimates positive long-term treatment effects by 0.05 standard deviations on average. This is the case regardless of which estimation method we use. We suggest that this is due to missing surrogates, as well as bias in the first-stage predictive model of the surrogate procedure.</p><p>While it is important to understand this negative bias as a potential shortcoming of the surrogate approach, we would not necessarily take it to dissuade researchers from this method altogether. Instead, one could interpret surrogate estimates as a reasonable lower bound on the true long-term treatment effect. Furthermore, there is often no better alternative for estimating the true effect.</p><p>We also study potential determinants of the surrogate bias for the M-lasso estimator. In particular, we find suggestive evidence that M-lasso bias is smaller for simpler interventions. However, we do not find that this bias depends on the predictive accuracy of the first-stage model in the observational dataset. Our evidence is also inconclusive about how bias is affected by longer time horizons between the surrogates and the outcomes.</p><p>We further show that despite the potential bias from using the surrogate index method, it results in significant precision gains, with standard errors on average 52% the size of those from the long-term RCT estimates. Hence, even if researchers had access to long-term outcomes, they might still choose to use the surrogate index, depending on their willingness to trade off bias and variance.</p><p>The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses related literature. Section 3 summarises the econometric theory behind the surrogate index approach, and section 4 describes in more detail the data we use. Section 5 explains the methods we use to estimate comparable long-term RCT and surrogate index estimates. Section 6 presents results of the meta-analysis over 9 RCTs for different implementations of the surrogate index. In it, we empirically characterise the bias and standard errors for the surrogate method, as well as examine which surrogates are selected by the M-lasso. Finally, section 7 concludes.</p><h3><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/estimating-long-term-treatment-effects-without-long-term-outcome-data-david-rhys-bernard-jojo-lee-and-victor-yaneng-wang/\">Read the rest of the paper</a></h3>", "user": {"username": "Global Priorities Institute"}}]
