I'd like to see more careful discussion of this -- perhaps with posts on this forum laying out a clear case for various different causes.

My focus on this concrete question partly stems from being concerned with the issue I presented at the weekend away talk: I was going to give several thousand pounds to charity that year, so needed to hear a specific alternative that was better than AMF. I also find it helpful to discuss the more tractable issue of choosing between specific charities first, where one can look at things like track record.

Movements, religions and groups of people in general seem really prone to schisms, even when they have a pretty well defined view, so it seems like disagreements leading to people falling out could be one of the big risks effective altruism faces, given the diversity of views and the emphasis on finding the very best thing. I like your emphasis on epistemic modesty and creating a collaborative culture. I also like your suggestion of forum posts carefully stating the case for different causes. Hopefully if we succeed in making a collaborative culture, that will help both at avoiding those kinds of posts being felt as an attack, and preventing comments on them from getting too vehement, which will make writers happier to post them. </p>\n<p>One thing it might be nice to see more of is people writing about and defending different causes than the ones they usually do. I think most people interested in effective altruism think that there are many causes that are really effective, and focus on a particular one either because it seems probably even more effective than the others, or just because they can\u2019t do everything. It would be really nice for that to be more evident outside of informal discussions, for example in the posts people write. It seems difficult to do that, partly because it might seem obvious, and partly because it\u2019s boring to talk about things that the people in the discussion already agree on. Yet that makes it easy, at least from a distance, to get the impression that people barely agree, and for people to feel confrontational towards each other.</p>\n<p>I wonder if it might even be good to avoid too much asking people \u2018what cause do you support?\u2019. A question like that feels like it creates an expectation that people pin their colours to a particular mast, which could create a confrontational rather than collaborative atmosphere.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Michelle_Hutchinson"}}, {"_id": "2txjbESZ8q5tkzdNA", "postedAt": "2014-09-23T23:42:33.006Z", "postId": "ZqiGXrqLQg2ocFGQk", "htmlBody": "<p>There's an interesting question related to this which is: Suppose Alice will work well as an EA as long as she believes she is fighting for global poverty now.

Should Bob try to persuade Alice of the importance of X-risk?\nI say no.

So, for example, if a person is known for talking about and defending animal causes, they could spend some time also writing about and defending xrisk or poverty.
