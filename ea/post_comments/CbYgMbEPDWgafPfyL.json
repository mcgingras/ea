In terms of scale, aging undoubtedly is by far the largest (100,000 people die from age-related diseases every single day, not to mention the psychological toll that aging causes). Aging is also quite neglected - very few researchers focus on trying to reverse it. Tractability is of course a concern here, but I think this point is a bit nuanced. Achieving a full and total cure for aging would clearly be quite hard. But what about a partial cure? What about a therapy that made 70 year olds feel and act like they were 50, and with an additional 20 years of life expectancy? Such a treatment may be much more tractable. At least a large part of aging seems to be due to several common mechanisms (such as DNA damage, accumulation of senescent cells, etc), and reversing some of these mechanisms (such as by restoring DNA, clearing the body of senescent cells, etc) might allow for such a treatment.

Celiac disease could be an interesting case study: it was hugely mysterious (and hugely underdiagnosed) until (1) we got a decent IgG screen, and (2) we started to understand how gut permeability works.</p>\n<p>I'd also suggest that you may be a little too cynical about alternative medicine; there's a huge amount of snake-oil there, but alternative medicine is also highly heterogeneous, exploring a lot of the possibility space.

Mainstream medicine is also not particularly known for immediately finding these pearls and synthesizing them back into the medical literature, so I think it's also plausible that a viable way to make progress on this problem is to survey what alt-med thinks it knows about ME, filter the bs out, and see if there's anything left that can help mainstream medicine understand what ME is and what general class of treatments might help.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "MikeJohnson"}}, {"_id": "oua8yT7Ld7fpRApRf", "postedAt": "2018-02-19T17:35:13.910Z", "postId": "CbYgMbEPDWgafPfyL", "htmlBody": "<p>All great points, thanks!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "rdFuNa6TrMvbbbYa9", "user": {"username": "JanPaul123"}}, {"_id": "ajr9HHfLZqrTx7T8X", "postedAt": "2018-02-20T03:50:07.677Z", "postId": "CbYgMbEPDWgafPfyL", "htmlBody": "<p>I think the general scientific consensus is that it's a physiological condition.
