I really make no claims about what I want to see less of.

This was also a concern because, other than passing mentions of good value lock-in and trajectory changes in literature, I haven\u2019t seen examples of work pursued for these reasons.</p><p>Regardless, I think that theoretically, longtermism could espouse these views. However, my reflections really come from the actual work being done in the longtermist space, which I can call here longtermism in practise (I refer here to the kinds of work I see being supported by longtermist organisations). My solution space at the moment is quite significantly influenced by the ideas put forward by <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/32430/chapter-abstract/268752370?redirectedFrom=fulltext\">Iason Gabriel and Brian McElwee</a> when discussing the missing middle problem. In brief, they attempt to show that EA (in the general sense as to include Longtermism) tends to focus on low-value/high-confidence low-impact interventions (picking the low hanging fruits) such as vaccinations on the one hand and high-value/low-confidence (x-risk and GCR work) on the other hand. They point out that interventions in the medium-value/medium-confidence band could potentially help us tackle more problems, including ones that would contribute to systemic change. Some examples of this work would include the <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/immigration-policy/\">immigration policy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/criminal-justice-reform/\">criminal justice reform</a> work supported by Open Phil which seem to be the only interventions pursued in EA under this band (although perhaps some animal welfare work could fall here). Such interventions, I argue, should be more actively sought out and funded by longtermists because of their potential impact on not only improving the lives of current or near-future generations but also setting a positive trajectory for their descendants. I think that the availability of funding for such medium-value/medium-confidence interventions (for example, in tackling poverty or racial and gender inequality, etc.) would incentivize the best minds to explore these issues more and provide more robust proposals for interventions. I also think this is where my call to make it easier to make a case for certain interventions tackling systemic problems would apply to both EA and Longtermism recognising that work here will necessarily have numerous benefits for current generations but is keenly focused on the long view, where it will have the highest returns.</p><p>On your last concern, I acknowledge that for many of the problems I specifically highlighted, there is a high chance that most of their most promising interventions are not neglected at all, which is part of the reason I think we might gain more if we review the methodology we use as well. Without seriously considering this particular point, I think that the importance of these interventions (how many lives they may potentially positively affect and for how long) could be argued in place of the emphasis on neglectedness. There might also be other interventions in these areas that may have high returns but are less popularised or explored. Regardless of the robustness of my rough suggestions here, I think encouraging more work here makes it easier to hear of and support more (and better quality) proposed interventions on these issues.</p>", "parentCommentId": "8PWvxRtM37Q7yQYmv", "user": {"username": "NatKiilu"}}, {"_id": "bWeRgqvBMrefQJYXe", "postedAt": "2023-08-23T08:22:22.404Z", "postId": "2rRsjdrL9BEWC3d7C", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for your thoughtful comment, &amp; thanks for providing some more explicit/concrete examples of the kind of thing you'd like to see more of \u2014 that was really helpful!</p>\n<p>(And I hadn't read that article you linked before, or thought about the \"missing middle\" as a frame \u2014 thanks!)</p>\n<p>I think I'm now more confident that I disagree with the argument you've laid out here.</p>\n<p>The main reason is that I disagree with your claim that we'd be able to do more good by reviewing our methodology &amp; de-emphasising neglectedness.</p>\n<p>I basically just think neglectedness is really important for what I'm trying to do when I'm trying to do good.</p>\n<p>I think there are really compelling arguments for working on e.g. immigration policy and criminal justice reform, that are going to appeal to a much broader audience than the one on this Forum.

I also reckon that part of the work under good value lock-in will inevitably involve working on many systemic problems even if the difference will lie in the approach we take. Ultimately though my argument is hinged on whether we should as a community find it acceptable to ignore these issues while proclaiming we want to do the most good we can (and for the most number of people).
