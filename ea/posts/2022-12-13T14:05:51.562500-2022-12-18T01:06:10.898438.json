Their grant request was subsequently put on hold.</p>\n<p>Other members of the international community have echoed the advice in different forms, to the point where the organisers feel upset and disheartened.</p>\n<p>This dynamic challenges the local organisers' expertise and awareness of the situation of their local community. On a meta-level, this (together with my previous impressions of the topic) suggests to me that the community might need to tone down EA branding promotion in support of doing area-specific work.</p>\n<p>They have also been encouraged to move to the main EA hubs to gain legitimacy and experience. While this seems hard to fix, it saddens me that there is so little support for capable people who want to develop their career locally.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I am aware of people outside the Spanish-speaking community who have been encouraged to pursue area-specific projects in LatAm, despite lacking experience in the area or local knowledge. This hinders the intellectual independence of small communities and discourages local efforts. Even though I am glad that this work is being done, this might be a symptom of systematic misprioritization.</p>\n<p>All in all, these are isolated issues and probably better explained by miscommunication and differences in judgement. However, I believe we should have a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TaBJqDMJtEH68Hhfw/ea-should-blurt\">lower bar for raising critiques</a> and be more transparent about them \u2014 this is my targeted contribution to move the culture of EA in that direction.</p>\n<p>There is a deeper conversation to be had about the relationship between the international EA community and EA in LatAm and Low and Middle-Income Countries in general. It is not my place to host that conversation, though I hope that by speaking up and seeing the reaction from the community I can help others feel more confident bringing up the issues that worry them.</p>\n<p>As a takeaway, please do not discourage young professionals from pursuing area-specific work, and seek feedback from local organizers about their community\u2019s needs. I also want to stress that grassroots efforts led by dedicated professionals are disproportionately more likely to succeed.</p>\n<p><em>Thank you to Agust\u00edn Covarrubias, Laura Gonz\u00e1lez, Claudette Salinas, Michelle Bruno, Sandra Malag\u00f3n, \u00c1ngela Aristiz\u00e1bal, Pablo Stafforini and Catherine Low for feedback and help editing the post.</em></p>\n", "user": {"username": "Jsevillamol"}}, {"_id": "3M7iL4cb3LJjj7zNp", "title": "Effective altruism is worse than traditional philanthropy in the way it excludes the extreme poor in the global south.", "postedAt": "2022-12-17T14:44:01.279Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Interesting article from Anthony Kalulu from Uganda.</p>\n<p>It argues that EA recommended charities have very little impact in the average poor in Uganda.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if you randomly asked one of the people who themselves live in abject poverty, there is no chance that they will mention one of EA\u2019s supported \u201ceffective\u201d charities, as having impacted their lives more than the work of traditional global antipoverty agencies. No. That\u2019s out of question.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Anthony argues too that EA solutions are not persistent</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you visited a truly impoverished country like Uganda, you will quickly notice that many of the things that effective altruists call \u201ceffective\u201d \u2014 from mosquito nets, to $100 business grants that are provided to groups of 3 people \u2014 are the same short-term, disposable solutions that have not only kept their recipients in abject poverty, but also, they are the very kind of solutions that often disappear the same day their proponents exit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that the solutions implemented do not match the communities needs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In my region of Busoga, Uganda\u2019s most impoverished region, we have one [well-funded] international charity which is among those described by the EA movement as being \u201ceffective\u201d. That charity is also working with rural poor farmers here, principally on maize.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the thing is: every household in our region that depends on maize, lives in chronic extreme poverty, and has lived in chronic poverty for eternity. Neither the effective charity nor the other big antipoverty agencies that came before it, have changed this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By contrast, those farmers who are growing crops like sugarcane, no charity or antipoverty agency has ever supported them. But today, every village in our region that you visit, is covered with sugarcane. It is also the same with many other crops (rice, tomatoes, water melon etc) that are at least providing rural farmers with some tangible income.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The  solution advocated by Anthony through the article are grassroots organizations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the name of being \u201ceffective\u201d, EA has instead indoctrinated its followers to strictly support a small, select list of charities that have been labelled \u201cmost effective\u201d by the movement\u2019s own charity raters like GiveWell, Giving What We Can, The Life You Can Save etc, of which the named charities, right now, are all western.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But that is the very ingredient that makes traditional philanthropy a sector that keeps the world\u2019s extreme poor on the sidelines. And by consolidating itself as a movement that completely never supports grassroots organizations directly, EA has proved to be more of a blockade to those of us who live in ultra poverty, even more than traditional philanthropy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What can we do to help improve this situation?</p>\n<p>Here is a brainstorming of some ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Seek feedback and listen to local though leaders, and invite them to participate in the global conversation about eradicating poverty</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Conduct third-party surveys of the intended beneficiaries of poverty relief. So far the only instrument of this kind I've seen is GiveDirectly's program.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are a charity working in eg Uganda, try promoting your hiring rounds among your beneficiaries and their surrounding communities</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lead, together with local EA organizers, incubation programs of grassroot and effective efforts</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Try to identify the best local grassroot efforts to support. This might be tricky because these efforts are usually not scalable, so spending $100k on a study might be pointless when the org only has capacity to absorb $50k. Maybe we could study better the effects of a grassroot support foundation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Train and support local EA organizers to run talent identification and nurturing programs, like localized versions of Carreras con Impacto</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Which of these seem better?

For posts in the upper left-hand corner of the chart, however, we\u2019ll see that a few people will find them extremely useful, but each of these people will only give a strong upvote at most.

I am more sympathetic to the mass media scepticism this argument also brings about.</p><p>I explain why having an \"official presence\"<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffbaesmut9n9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfbaesmut9n9\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;on social media is important using the Fidelity Model. Social media is an important communications model, even if social media itself is low-fidelity.</p><h2>The Fidelity Model</h2><p><i>I am taking this from the original post, so as to keep our arguments clear and consistent.</i></p><blockquote><h3>Definition</h3><p><strong>Fidelity</strong> The key term in this model is \"fidelity.\" Therefore it will be useful to define this term. By fidelity [the original author has] in mind nothing more than the classic <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/fidelity\">dictionary definition</a> of \"adherence to fact or detail\" or \"accuracy; exactness.\"</p><p>As an example, imagine I am shooting a movie on an old camera. If the image captured by the camera causes it to seem as though I am wearing a blue shirt when actually my shirt is red, then the image captured by the camera is low fidelity.</p></blockquote><h3>The problem</h3><p>With reference to <a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Play-the-Telephone-Game\">The Telephone Game</a>, the author of the original argument accepts that \"EA\" ideas and arguments are nuanced and worries that some methods of communication require that the nuance be stripped back in order to be easily communicable.</p><blockquote><p><i>When the context gets stripped away, those who receive the ideas leave with something that's similar to effective altruism, but different. Thus, when we hear the EA message repeated back to us, we get sentences like \"EA is about earning all the money you can and donating it to GiveWell charities\" or \"EAs only care about interventions that are supported by randomized controlled trials.\" To a certain extent we can influence the sentences we get back by being more clever about how we frame our ideas, but it seems unlikely that framing can do all the work.</i></p></blockquote><h3>How we get to social media scepticism</h3><p>Very few people who use social media believe it to be a high-fidelity information exchange space. Platforms like Twitter, with low character counts and a norm towards fast-paced argument threads, are particularly bad at fostering nuanced debate.</p><p>EA ideas are nuanced, and when they aren't covered with that nuance in mind, it <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/31/join-wall-street-save-the-world/\">tends</a> <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2334682/Young-professionals-joining-Wall-Street-save-world.html\">to end quite badly</a>. It is difficult to communicate with nuance and retain it throughout social sharing chains, so, if you aren't careful, the idea you set out to communicate isn't the one that makes it to the audience.</p><blockquote><p>An example of an extremely low fidelity method of communicating EA would be during a heated political discussion on Twitter.</p><p>Given Twitter's character limit you can neither explore many ideas nor explore the ideas in any depth, nor get much useful feedback, and since politics is a very bad environment for updating, this would fail all four components <i>[of the fidelity model]</i>.</p></blockquote><p>Because it is difficult to do well and the consequences of doing it poorly are potentially severe, many perfectly reasonable people believe that social media should not be used to communicate complex, nuanced ideas.</p><p>On the surface, the trade-off between the benefits of doing it well (some people engaging positively, albeit for a limited time) and the disadvantages of getting it wrong (attracting bad faith critics, reputation damage, negative mass media coverage) appears to make not doing it better than trying to do it well.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why I think this is a mistake</h2><p>I will start by saying I broadly agree with the Fidelity Model.</p><p>Higher-fidelity modes of communication, like one-on-one in-person discussions and books/podcasts, should always form the backbone of the EA communications model. They are a better way of communicating complex ideas.</p><p><strong>While Twitter threads are a personal favourite communication means of mine, I don't regard them as high-fidelity</strong>. I regard them as a low-barrier-to-entry, fast-exchange model of communication that helps me get complex ideas in front of people who wouldn't otherwise consume them in the form of a blog post or journal article. They are also a fairly efficient means, once you know what you're doing, to get ideas in front of people within your own niche who would not otherwise give your ideas credence. I've had some luck influencing decisions this way.</p><p>I do not believe that social media is a high-fidelity space for information exchange; rather, I believe that there are higher-fidelity ways to do it and that not doing it at all in an \"official\" capacity <strong>creates a vacuum within which low-fidelity exchanges thrive and brand reputations go to die</strong>.</p><h3>The Awareness/Inclination Model</h3><p>The original argument for the Fidelity Model references Owen Cotton-Barratt's 2015 CEA working paper on the Awareness/Inclination Model.</p><blockquote><p>Owen Cotton-Barratt <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/MovementGrowth.pdf\">has developed a model of movement growth</a> called the Awareness/Inclination Model according to which we can compress knowledge of EA into two dimensions: how much they know about the ideas (awareness) and how favorably they feel, or would feel, towards the ideas (inclination). One implication of this model is that increasing awareness without increasing inclination can cause increased adoption of the ideas in the short term but <strong>at the expense of decreasing the total potential number of people that might adopt the ideas in the future </strong>(given some assumptions).</p><p>Given the assumption that many people would respond favorably to EA ideas if they understood them, it seems plausible that low fidelity mechanisms for spreading EA ideas increase the probability that we increase awareness for the ideas without increasing inclination. Articles like \"Join Wall Street. Save the world.\" may be doing a good job of increasing awareness without doing a good job of increasing inclination (as some <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?ref=opinion\">criticisms of the piece</a> suggests) and thus may be decreasing the maximum number of people that might adopt the ideas in the future.</p></blockquote><p>Again, I believe this argument is broadly correct, and we apply similar approaches within the political and social media for social change spaces.</p><p>What I do not believe is that social media scepticism, specifically the sort that leads organisations not to invest in \"official\" or movement-building social media, ought to follow from such an argument.</p><p><strong>Social media can be a high-awareness space</strong>. It is a low-cost, low-effort alternative to traditional communications in a high-contagion communications environment. Because of the triangulation approach social media platforms like Facebook use to suggest content and map social connections, it is relatively easy for an idea that reaches Person A to reach Persons B, C, D, E, and F, who hold similar views or outlooks on the world.</p><p>This is why smart politicians make good use of social media: It does a fairly good job of finding people like your supporters in important ways and giving them your message.</p><p><strong>Social media can also be a place where inclination is shaped</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h3>The dangers of meeting 'Almost you'</h3><p>Those of us who have been active in relatively tight-knit communities will be familiar with this experience.</p><p>You meet someone at an event who knows you through someone else and has a very different impression of you from that person than you'd have liked to start out on.</p><p>Could be overly positive. Could be overly negative. Could just be slightly off in some important way.</p><p>They know a kind of uncanny valley \"almost you,\" and then, if you're lucky, they update their picture of you as they get to know you.</p><ul><li>If their \"almost you\" is wildly good, they may find themselves <strong>jaded and frustrated</strong> by the real you.</li><li>If \"almost you\" is missing crucial aspects of who you are, you may <strong>miss out on really useful connections and valuable personal relationships</strong> built on shared interests and perspectives neither of you knows you share.</li><li>If \"almost you\" is particularly bad, they might <strong>not attempt to get to know you at all</strong>.</li></ul><p><strong>The same thing can happen with arguments:</strong> When you become a trusted source of information in a tight-knit community, people making similar arguments or trying to convince others of things will often refer to you and your arguments in doing so.</p><p>If you're lucky, they do this in a high-fidelity way. They're more likely to do it in a way that makes it seem like you agree with them by missing out on important nuances. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23500014/effective-altruism-sam-bankman-fried-ftx-crypto\">This also ends incredibly, incredibly badly</a>.</p><h3>Why doing social media - right - is the answer</h3><p>Social media, for all its vast expanse, is in many ways a tight-knit community.</p><p>You will not build a useful level of inclination towards your movement if it is based on a series of low-fidelity \"almost you\" impressions gleaned from someone who knows someone who knows you or from people using your arguments as justification for their own.</p><p>This is why being present as the \"real you\" and conveying your own position are so important. Particularly in high-contagion spaces like social media, where ideas travel fast.</p><p><strong>Just ask Elon Musk how reputations are built and destroyed on social media.</strong> You can have some control over the reputation you build by putting those building blocks in place yourself. That is, again with the Elon Musk example, a double-edged sword.</p><p>Either you shape that inclination by framing the arguments the way you want to and responding in a contextual fashion to emerging arguments, or someone else will attempt to do it for you.</p><p><strong>Someone else, even if well-intentioned, is unlikely to convey the ideas the way you would and with the same sense of fidelity.</strong> They're working off of an interpretation of what you said and believe, a copy, which may be very good or may have missed the point entirely. You have no control over this and shouldn't. That's not how idea exchange works online.</p><p><strong>What you do have control over is whether or not you put your best foot forward.</strong> Whether or not you frame your own arguments online, Whether you produce the highest-fidelity content possible under less-than-ideal conditions, or whether you leave that gap - a vacuum - for anyone else to fill.</p><p>This is why I am so concerned by the lack of \"official,\" for lack of a better word, EA communications in short-form social media settings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnfbaesmut9n9\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreffbaesmut9n9\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><strong>I need a better term for this</strong>, so as not to seem exclusionary of lots of the really good stuff already going on.

I have no problem with its presentation, rough draft or whatever.</p>\n<p>I think EA's don't quantify much or very well, but claim to update their knowledge in a quantifiable sense,  basically offering a bogus description of what they do when learning, and also providing a cultish social ritual for how they do it, with the occasional addition of increasing their desire for betting behaviors as a part of the exercise of their epistemology, or emphasizing the importance of specific ideas of the future, as needed. I explain this below. Here I am referring to quantifying probabilistic uncertainty, rather than other uses of mathematics.</p>\n<p>Perspectives on how or why EA's quantify beliefs and decisions include:</p>\n<p>One - The tendency for EA's to \"update\" or quantify various kinds of beliefs has a structure that I have seen before, in a different group of people. I am familiar with this suspension of disbelief around discussion of mental mechanisms and the commitment to a group dynamic of offering each other communication rituals specific to the in-group during conversation with other members. The communication rituals address and reify a false idea of how a mental mechanism works, and lends an aura to the interaction, as though it is something special, earned, or developed through practice. It's something you find in any in-group or cult.  The EA updating ritual is a ritual. You have a discussion. You want to \"update, \" given that they made you feel convinced. You let them know that you will \"update\" on the new information. \"People updated after event X\", \"I  haven't updated on this in awhile but then I found this information from you\", EA's make assertions like that. You know to discuss your updating with people who will understand what you mean, and appreciate it.</p>\n<p>Two - There is another perspective on it, the perspective that EA's are sometimes quantifying their feelings of doubt or uncertainty or conviction wrt beliefs. I find this perspective appealing as an interpretation of EA's acting in good faith to \"update\" or quantify beliefs or decisions. Good introspection will let you notice degrees or shades of feeling level or intensity. Your certainty can indeed increase and decrease. It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, however, that feelings do not align with our conscious knowledge. Thus our usual awareness of our \"irrational\" feelings. Measuring feeling intensity is important to make them more accessible to your way of thinking, whatever awareness, insight, or trigger that they represent. Rather than an all-or-nothing phenomenon, feelings become more nuanced and granular, as their level of intensity gets measured and labeled. However, while feelings might tell you something about what you believe in the moment, they don't always tell you what you should believe based on facts or evidence.</p>\n<p><strong>CAUTION:</strong> Typically, feelings are influenced by motives or beliefs in ways that the person with feelings cannot control when trying to \"think clearly\". That is a good reason to use external cognitive aids (for example, a written list of evidence or a pros and cons write-up) for some kinds of argument analysis and decision-making because otherwise your feelings would filter out some of what you need to consciously consider.</p>\n<p>Three - There's a perspective that EA's are actually betting addicts, and that their ethics and philosophy reflect an unconscious commitment to their risk-seeking behavior. To the extent that that is true, you would expect to see a lot of betting behavior among EA's, and I don't have strong evidence of that. Most EA's seem committed to career interests, not betting. However, the presence of the metaphors of betting in EA epistemics is alarming. Words like \"casinos\", \"cashing out\", \"odds\", show up in most discussions, and serious debates apparently require betting money to resolve. \"Updating\" from this perspective is like updating a bookie's betting odds, and the EA is the bookie or the bettor.</p>\n<p>Four - <strong>EDIT:</strong> I almost forgot this perspective, though it is one I've held for a while. By the prediction of existential risk with specific probabilities, EA's emphasize the outcome or its contrary. For example, EA's emphasize a path into the future that is ambiguous with respect to the consequences of developing AGI. Supposedly, AGI either threaten our existence or guarantee a bright one for us. There's a chance of each outcome. By selecting a specific probability for one, it or its contrary can be emphasized. Does AGI safety require desperate work or are AGI going to bring prosperity and happiness to everybody? Seems like either way your AGI research job is vital. In the case of Climate Destruction, on the other hand, the consensus among EA's is that its odds of causing an existential crisis are quite low. Instead, EA's emphasize a contrary interpretation of our current path into the future: a status quo approach of economic development and free markets leading to technological utopia, provided AGI safety concerns are solved. Since the estimated probability of a climate apocalypse is not testable, nor requires any real proof, the choice of number simply lends emphasis to a worldview or agenda. In the case of Climate Destruction, a crisis whose presence threatens the status quo of economic, social, and business development, the agenda is to maintain cash flow and the worldview is one that the wealthy hold. The choice of message about Climate Destruction simply reflects that self-serving behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> EA's do mention tail risks going up, and sometimes mention climate change as a tail risk. Discussing tail risks seems to be another way of claiming that \"Yeah, we're on the right path but it's getting more risky to stay on it!\" With respect to AGI harming everyone and climate destruction causing an apocalypse, I am scared of both and believe neither's contrary deserves following an ambiguous path towards it. Our current path is the wrong path.</p>\n<p>Those are a few critical perspectives on EA updating. Speaking for myself, I prefer a categorical statement of belief followed by learning to constrain the belief to contexts in which it is not contradicted. If there are no such contexts, I move on. There are more and less efficient methods to constrain a belief. However, by \"belief\", I mean something that I find tolerable to assert as part of a conscious deliberation about what belongs in my ontology, or a conscious investigation of truths about the world. Murkier beliefs that I hold are found somewhere in my unconscious, as intuitions or heuristics or nagging feelings, where they typically remain, surfacing every so often to clear my head or irritate me a bit, lol.</p>\n<p><strong>TIP:</strong> I have been trying to rid my own self-talk of the cultural tick of referring to possibilities and probabilities when what I mean are plausible ideas (plausibilities, haha) and matches to contexts. I don't necessarily recommend it to you unless you would like some \"deprogramming.\" An alternative term than \"context\" is \"schema\", \"prototype\", or \"situation\". Contexts have variations or nuances in specific instances, and the more a specific instance varies from some prototypical form, the more the word \"ignorance\" describes my knowledge about it. \"Ignorance\", not \"uncertainty\". If you want to explicitly quantify <em>less</em>, you can try out what I'm doing. For example, you could answer the question, \"How should I constrain my belief about this topic?\" or the question, \"How similar is this context to any that I compare it to? What are the differences?\"</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Noah Scales"}}, {"_id": "2XFxKpRAqNErajF88", "title": "The Rules of Rescue - out now!", "postedAt": "2022-12-17T09:02:06.976Z", "htmlBody": "<p>My book\u2014<i>The Rules of Rescue</i>\u2014is officially out!

Perhaps you have some really cool half-finished google docs that you never quite got around to finishing and publishing.&nbsp;</p><p>It\u2019s a funny thing though, about writing being like exercise.

That my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tEDXpFgsHsm5T8sWz/app-and-book-recommendations-for-people-who-want-to-be\"><u>recommendations</u></a> were helping people, whether it be making them happier or making them higher impact, or sometimes, if I was lucky, both.</p><p><strong>To help myself (and perhaps you) remember this and all the other reasons to write, I\u2019ve decided to write about all the reasons I have to write.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Reading the list will inspire me and hopefully others. Publishing it will publicly commit me to writing, which will make it more likely. Even better, it could potentially re-inspire some people, perhaps you, to start writing for the forums again. Or maybe even it\u2019ll get you excited to try your hand at writing publicly, even though you\u2019ve never done it before.</p><h1>Epistemic status: motivational</h1><p><strong>Epistemic status: motivational. An explanation of my personal experience</strong> that doesn\u2019t generalize to all people<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>This isn\u2019t meant to be a nuanced look into the pros and cons of writing.&nbsp;</p><p>It\u2019s meant to inspire a subset of the population (and myself!) to write more. None of this applies to all writing or all people. It\u2019s meant more as a manifesto rather than a research piece.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, this is the EA Forum, so feel free to debate the merits and demerits of writing in the comments.</p><p>Now, with all that hedging out of the way, here\u2019s a giant list of reasons why you, the community, and myself should write.&nbsp;</p><h1>Some reasons to write</h1><p>The reasons to write fall broadly into three categories: enjoyment, capacity building, and impact.&nbsp;</p><h2>Enjoyment and other personal benefits</h2><p>Writing can be personally gratifying in so many ways.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Moments of inspiration. </strong>Sometimes you\u2019re really excited about what you\u2019re writing, and the words just pour out of you. It can be a really peak experience.</li><li><strong>Art. </strong>If you have a part of you that craves the artist\u2019s life, you can&nbsp;<i>have&nbsp;</i>some of that through writing, without having to quit your day job. It can sometimes feel like being an EA is antithetical to being artistic, but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dAbs7w4J4iNm89DjP/why-fun-writing-can-save-lives-the-case-for-it-being-high\"><u>writing is a great way to combine a seeking of truth with a seeking of beauty</u></a>.</li><li><strong>The world is your material</strong>. It changes the way you interact with the world. You\u2019re always on the lookout for little snippets of an idea really well put. You have great conversations and that\u2019s grist for the mill. It\u2019s like being on a lifelong treasure hunt, with little hits of dopamine splashed throughout the day.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sweet sweet internet points.</strong> In George Orwell\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/\"><u>\u201cWhy I Write\u201d essay</u></a>, the first reason he lists is egoism. And he wrote that before the internet! You can only imagine how much George would have loved Twitter and the EA Forum.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Romantic.&nbsp;</strong>There\u2019s something romantic about writing, be it in a cafe or in a park, or in your favorite writing nook. To be a writer feels like being an explorer or a gentleman scholar - a role straight out of a novel.</li><li><strong>Coming up with little flourishes is fun.&nbsp;</strong>There\u2019s a pleasure in finding exactly the right turn of phrase that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dAbs7w4J4iNm89DjP/why-fun-writing-can-save-lives-the-case-for-it-being-high\"><u>makes the idea both beautiful&nbsp;</u><i><u>and&nbsp;</u></i><u>make sense</u></a>.</li><li><strong>Feelings of pride.</strong> Sometimes you write an article you\u2019re really satisfied with, which feels outstanding.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Identity of a writer.</strong> Having the identity of a writer has a certain romantic appeal. You kind of feel like a writer in Paris. To be a writer for a cause is even better, like Tolstoy or the journalist in Blood Diamond.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Short self-contained projects.&nbsp;</strong>So often what you\u2019re working on takes ages till it\u2019s done, or it\u2019s never really done. Endless to-do lists are the norm. But with writing posts, there\u2019s a very clear start and finish, and it can take as little as a morning to finish. There is something deeply rewarding about this, where the finish line is always so close.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Writing in beautiful places. </strong>There's something meditative about taking your computer somewhere and working in a beautiful place, whether at a perfectly decorated cafe or out in nature.</li><li><strong>Seeing people apply your ideas.</strong>&nbsp;It's so gratifying to see somebody actually implement one of your ideas.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>More people agree with you. </strong>This is high impact if you happen to be less wrong than the average person you\u2019re changing the mind of, but I\u2019m listing it under personal enjoyment as a separate point from the impact. It\u2019s&nbsp;<i>nice</i> when people agree with your (obviously correct and superior) views.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Getting thank you comments and DMs</strong>. I mean, this is the EA Forum, so there\u2019s always going to be criticism and debate, but there are also often some really motivating comments saying thank you or complimenting your work.&nbsp;</li></ol><h2>Capacity building</h2><ol><li><strong>Learning&nbsp;</strong>and other ways it helps you come to the truth:<ol><li><strong>Remembering,&nbsp;via two mechanisms:</strong><ol><li><strong>Like taking notes.</strong>&nbsp;Writing things down helps you remember them, like taking notes in class. The act of writing them down helps solidify them in your brain.</li><li><strong>Reference. </strong>You can use your old writing for reference.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Understanding.&nbsp;</strong>One of the best ways to truly understand something is to teach it to somebody else, and that\u2019s exactly what the best writing is: teaching.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Uncovering blind spots. </strong>Trying to write about a topic is one of the best ways to reveal the areas you don\u2019t actually understand.</li><li><strong>Thinking more clearly.</strong> Putting your thoughts on paper forces you to make things explicit. I do some of my best thinking in a google document.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>New ideas.</strong> Often writing leads to you having new ideas.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/req5rnPrW89tBg3vb/steelman-solitaire-how-to-take-playing-devil-s-advocate-to\"><u>Steelman solitaire</u></a> is also really good for that.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Finding relevant information. </strong>A common response to posts will be for people to share relevant articles, which will help you have a better view of things.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Getting feedback from the world.&nbsp;</strong>What\u2019s the best way to get people to give you feedback? Post something wrong on the internet and wait for the comments. (Tip: see the comment section as the \"debate section\". This re-frame can turn you from feeling defensive to feeling interested.)</li></ol></li><li><strong>\u2191Reputation.&nbsp;</strong>People will know about you and like some of your work. This leads to all sorts of things, like increasing your ability to:<ol><li><strong>Get a job.</strong> If you have an online presence, people are more likely to hire you. You get to showcase your talents and knowledge at scale.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fundraise.&nbsp;</strong>The key to fundraising is credibly signaling that you can be trusted to turn money into impact. Making good content can be a hard-to-fake indicator of competence and show that you have aligned values and epistemics.</li><li><strong>Hire people.</strong> I don\u2019t know about you, but I'm much more likely to want to work for someone whose work I've already read and enjoyed.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Get people\u2019s time to discuss an idea. </strong>If you\u2019d like to discuss an idea with somebody in the community, they\u2019re far more likely to say yes if they already \u201cknow\u201d you a little from your writing. Public writing is like scaled-up, passive networking.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><h2>Impact and other benefits to the world</h2><ol><li><strong>Improve the conclusions of the community.&nbsp;</strong>This then improves&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JTZTBienqWEAjGDRv/listen-to-more-ea-content-with-the-nonlinear-library#:~:text=An%20EA%20koan,have%20any%20impact\"><u>their actions, leading to impact</u></a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Improve conclusions&nbsp;<u>at scale</u>. </strong>Most of the time if you have a good idea, you only maybe persuade a few of your friends. If you write, dozens or hundreds of people will read it.</li><li><strong>Motivate action.&nbsp;</strong>Very often reading a well-reasoned blog post is what spurs people to action. Write about potentially high-impact activities and it might mobilize a&nbsp;<i>lot</i> of people.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Improve your own conclusions\u2192 impact&nbsp;</strong>(see Learning section)</li><li><strong>Help others directly.</strong> A lot of writing helps the reader directly. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BfTW9jmDzujYkhjAb/you-are-probably-underestimating-how-good-self-love-can-be\"><u>this post on self-love</u></a> contributed to my overcoming impostor syndrome and increased my self-acceptance a&nbsp;<i>ton</i>.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>I could go on, but after reading all of these reasons, I\u2019m excited to finish an essay I\u2019ve had in a Google Doc draft for forever.</p><p>I hope this also inspires you to dust off an old blog or start a new one.

EAforum is, however, the perfect place to trade strategies for cutting costs and saving money.</p><p>I've met some people who were recently funded to start a group house in a rural town in Vermont to do AI safety work and other x-risk work, since rents in Vermont are incredibly low, which makes it one of the most cost-effective places in the US to research existential risk. Ultimately, the goal is that people with smaller and smaller amounts of savings could take a sabbatical to a Vermont group house and do research for free for 2-10 years, without working full-time or even part-time at some random software engineering job.</p><p>The main problem here is network effects. I don't remember the details, but they will have to drive at least 3 hours to Boston once a month (and probably more like 5-6 hours). Otherwise, they will be effectively alone in the middle of nowhere, totally dependent on the internet to exchange and verify ideas with other EA-minded people (and all the risks entailed by filtering most of your human connection through the internet).&nbsp;</p><p>The main problem with the Vermont group house is that there's currently only three of them. If there were ten really smart people in Vermont researching existential risk, then it would be easier to handle the isolation with, say, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/X79Rc5cA5mSWBexnd/shoulder-advisors-101\">shoulder advisors</a>. Plus, if it were up to me, they'd be in rural Virginia (or parts of West Virginia) 5-6 hours away from Washington, D.C., not Boston, although the people who picked Vermont and funded it might know things I don't (disclaimer: they had the idea first, not me, I only discovered the brilliance behind it after meeting a Vermont person).</p><p>Ultimately, though, it's obviously better for EA-affiliated people to be located within the metropolitan areas of San Francisco, New York, Boston, Washington D.C., and London. New people and new conversations are the lifeblood of any organization and endeavor. But the reality of the situation is that we don't live <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvA4j8pGYG4xtaTkw/i-m-from-a-parallel-earth-with-much-higher-coordination-ama\">the kind of world</a> where all the people at MIRI get tech-worker salaries, just because they should; that money has to come from someone, and the human tendency to refuse to seriously think about contingencies just because they're \"unthinkably horrible\" is the entire reason why a bunch of hobbyists from SF are humanity's first line of defense in the first place. We could <i>absolutely</i> end up in a situation where MIRI needs to relocate from Berkeley to rural Vermont.</p><p>So right now seems like the perfect time to start exchanging tips for saving money, setting up group houses in the best possible places, and the prioritization tradeoffs between scenarios where everyone becomes much poorer (e.g. from a second Cold War or a 2008-style economic megafailure upending economic status quos far further than anything in 2020 or 2022) and scenarios where current living conditions are maintained.

I agree. I think the EA community could benefit from the creation of subgroups based on identity and affinity to make a wider variety of humans feel welcome, heard, and safe, and to reduce ideological bias.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you agree that there is a diversity issue in EA, the top half of this post may not contain new information for you. Feel free to jump down to the <strong>Proposal to help mitigate diversity issues</strong> section below.</p><h1>Background</h1><p>As someone new to being involved with EA, I find myself asking myself this question:</p><p><i>EA\u2019s ideas about how to do good seem unique and unconventional (e.g. longtermism). Are they this way as a result of uniquely clear and farsighted thinking, or a result of being out of touch with reality?</i></p><p>It\u2019s hard for me to answer this question with confidence. Lack of ideological (and demographic) diversity is a means by which the latter possibility (that EAs have an unusually biased view of reality) could manifest.</p><h2>Signs of a diversity problem</h2><h3>Demographic uniformity</h3><ul><li>communities that are whiter and more male than the broader population</li><li>lack of older members</li><li>members seem to be disproportionately from wealthy backgrounds</li><li>members disproportionately college grads/phds from elite universities<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>Ideological uniformity</h3><ul><li>bias toward solving problems via debate (in which the winner is often viewed as more right than the loser, even if loser has valuable information to add)</li><li>wide variation in upvotes/response rates on EA forum. Unpopular topics/views sometimes get little attention and receive little feedback on EA forum</li><li>a natural tendency to believe ideas presented with those who have high status within the group over ideas</li><li>use of quantitative estimation to create a false sense of precision when discussing uncertain events</li><li>bias towards ideas that are largely unpopular in society, and even among many altruists, like utilitarianism, longtermism, and technocratic utopianism</li><li>some topics like AI alignment are frequently featured in EA forums, whereas similar topics like AI ethics are rarely seen (possibly more due to ideological divides more than pure utility)</li><li>bias towards problems with technology-oriented solutions (AI alignment) and against problems with human-oriented solutions (politics, racism)</li></ul><h1>Proposal to help mitigate diversity issues</h1><ul><li>Encourage and facilitate the creation of subgroups based on affinity/identity, where populations in the minority can have a majority voice</li><li>Conferences where speakers from these subgroups are featured</li><li>Add info to subforums page about these different groups, for observability</li><li>Encourage people to tag forum posts with all relevant affinity/identity groups, so it\u2019s possible to view breakdowns by group.

E.g.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rFpfW2ndHSX7ERWLH/simplify-ea-pitches-to-holy-shit-x-risk\"><u>Neel Nanda</u></a> argues that if you believe the key claims of \"there is a &gt;=1% chance of AI causing x-risk and &gt;=0.1% chance of bio causing x-risk in my lifetime\" this is enough to justify the core action relevant points of EA.</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hJDid3goqqRAE6hFN/my-most-likely-reason-to-die-young-is-ai-x-risk\"><u>AISafetyIsNotLongtermist</u></a> argues that the chance of the author dying prematurely because of AI x-risk is sufficiently high (~41%, conditional on their death in the subsequent 30 years) that the pitch for reducing this risk need not appeal to longtermism.</li></ul><p>The generalised argument, which I\u2019ll call \u201cx-risk is high\u201d, is fairly simple:</p><ul><li>1) X-risk this century is, or could very plausibly be, very high (&gt;10%)</li><li>2) X-risk is high enough that it matters to people alive today - e.g. it could result in their premature death.</li><li>3) The above is sufficient to motivate people to take high-priority paths to reduce x-risk. We don\u2019t need to emphasise anything else, including the philosophical case for the importance of the long-run future.</li></ul><p>I think this argument holds up. However,<strong> I think that outlining the case for longtermism (and EA principles, more broadly) is better for building a community of people who will reliably choose the highest-priority actions and paths to do the most good and that this is better for the world and keeping x-risk low in the long-run</strong>. Here are three counterpoints to only using \u201cx-risk is high\u201d:</p><h3>Our situation could change</h3><p>Trivially, if we successfully reduce x-risk or, after further examination, determine that overall x-risk is much lower than we thought, \u201cx-risk is high\u201d loses its force. If top talent, policymakers or funders convinced by \u201cx-risk is high\u201d learn that x-risk this century is actually much lower, they might move away from these issues. This would be bad because any non-negligible amount of x-risk is still unsustainably high&nbsp;<i>from a longtermist perspective</i>.</p><h3>Our priorities could change</h3><p>In the early 2010s, the EA movement was much more focused on funding effective global health charities. What if, at that time, EAs decided to stop explaining the core principles of EA, and instead made the following argument \u201ceffective charities are effective\u201d?</p><ul><li>Effective charities are, or could very plausible be, very effective.</li><li>Effective charities are effective enough that donating to them is a clear and enormous opportunity to do good.</li><li>The above is sufficient to motivate people to take high-priority paths, like earning to give. We don\u2019t need to emphasise anything else, including the case for effective altruism.</li></ul><p>This argument is probably different in important respects to \u201cx-risk is high\u201d, but illustrates how the EA movement could have \u201clocked in\u201d their approach to doing good if they made this argument.&nbsp;<strong>If we started using \u201ceffective charities are effective\u201d instead of explaining the core principles of EA, it might have taken a lot longer for the EA movement to identify x-risks as a top priority.</strong></p><p>Our priorities may change again, such that \u201cx-risk is high\u201d starts to look na\u00efve. We can imagine some scenarios where this is the case: for example, we might learn that promoting economic growth, accelerating key technologies or ensuring global peace are more effective longtermist interventions than directly reducing x-risk.&nbsp;</p><h3>We lose what makes EA distinctive</h3><p><i>(I\u2019m least certain about this argument to the point where I think it's more likely to be wrong than right but #draftamnesty)</i></p><p>Other movements make similar arguments to \u201cx-risk is high\u201d. Extinction Rebellion, a climate activist group, regularly draws attention to the risks the planet faces as a result of climate change in order to motivate political activism. The group has had limited success (at most, by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/25/extinction-rebellion-assessing-the-impact\"><u>introducing more ambitious climate targets</u></a> to the conversation) and has also attracted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/climate-crisis-doom\"><u>criticism</u></a> for overstating the risks of climate change.</p><p>I think \u201cx-risk is high\u201d is much more robust than arguments that claim that climate change will imminently destroy life on earth. But other people might not notice the difference. I worry that by (only) using \u201cx-risk is high\u201d, we risk being dismissed as alarmists. This would be wrong, and I\u2019m sympathetic to the idea that both the EA movement and XR should sound the alarm because we are collectively failing to respond to all of these issues quickly enough. But if we don\u2019t paint a more robust case than \u201cx-risk is high\u201d, that criticism could become more potent.</p><h3>Takeaway</h3><p>Outlining the case for longtermism and explaining how longtermism implies that x-risk should be a top priority even if x-risk is low is a much more robust strategy:</p><ul><li>If we successfully reduce x-risk or, after further examination, determine that overall x-risk is much lower than we thought, it\u2019s still clear that we should prioritise reducing x-risk.</li><li>If other actions beyond directly reducing x-risk become top priority, those convinced by the case for longtermism are more likely to pivot appropriately. Moreover, if longtermism itself proves to be less robust than we thought, those convinced by the core principles of EA are more likely to pivot appropriately too.</li><li>EA retains the intellectual rigour that has gotten us to where we are now, and that rigour is on display. I think this rigour is the reason we attract many smart people to high-priority paths (though I\u2019m unsure of this).</li></ul><p><i>My thanks to Lizka for running the Draft Amnesty Day and prompting me to share this draft.</i></p>", "user": {"username": "OllieBase"}}, {"_id": "jgsFfsDPzjdjbPhB6", "title": "Concerns over EA\u2019s possible neglect of experts", "postedAt": "2022-12-16T22:10:48.849Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"table\" style=\"height:194.375px;width:682px\"><table style=\"border:1px double rgb(179, 179, 179)\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 178, 241);border:0.99609pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>This is a&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vHogKj87ZBLgN8TpQ/today-is-draft-amnesty-day-december-16-18\"><strong><u>Draft Amnesty Day</u></strong></a><strong> draft.&nbsp;</strong>That means it\u2019s not polished, it\u2019s probably not up to my standards, the ideas are not thought out, I haven\u2019t checked everything, and it's unfinished.

Humbird has a PhD in chemical engineering and has extensive career experience in process engineering and techno-economic analysis, including the provision of consultancy services. In short, he seems like a great choice to carry out this research.</p><p>Another example I am pleased by is Will MacAskill as author of <i>What We Owe the Future. </i>I cannot think of a better author of this book. Will is a respected philosopher, and a central figure in the EA movement. This book outlines the philosophical argument for longtermism, a key school of thought within EA. Boy am I happy that Will wrote this book.</p><p>Other examples I was planning to write up:</p><ul><li><a href=\"chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.openphilanthropy.org/wp-content/uploads/Modeling-the-human-trajectory-2.pdf\">Modeling the Human Trajectory - David Roodman</a><ul><li>Roodman seems qualified to deliver this research.</li></ul></li><li>Wild Animal Initiative research such as <a href=\"https://www.wildanimalinitiative.org/blog/restoration-ecology-synergy\">this</a><ul><li>I like that they collaborated with <a href=\"https://cafnr.missouri.edu/person/samniqueka-joi-weaver-halsey/\">Samniqueka J.

I have no doubt that the report is high-quality and that Ajeya is very intelligent. However, this is a very technical subject and, beyond having a bachelor\u2019s degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, I don\u2019t see why Ajeya would be the first choice to write this report. Why wouldn\u2019t Open Phil have commissioned an expert in AI development / computational neuroscience etc. to write this report, similar to what they did with David Humbird (see above)? Ajeya\u2019s report had Paul Christiano and Dario Amodei as advisors, which is good, but advisors generally have limited input. Wouldn\u2019t it have been better to have an expert as first author?</p><p>All the above applies to <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/how-much-computational-power-does-it-take-to-match-the-human-brain/\">another Open Phil AI report</a>, this time written by Joe Carlsmith.

This program has successfully incubated EA groups, identified and mentored talented candidates, and built an especially cost-effective pipeline for discovering and supporting talent. The programs so far costed $90k in total, and through them, ~8 participants have counterfactually changed their professional careers and/or obtained grants from EA orgs, while ~25 students became involved in local or university EA groups.</p><p>Next year, the program needs $200k in funding to continue operating as a hybrid (virtual and in-person) program. They expect to escalate to 20 getting grants or jobs from EA orgs, and 120 students involved in EA groups.</p><p>If you think this is something you or your organization could fund, I encourage you to reach out to Sandra Malag\u00f3n (<a href=\"mailto:malagon.sandralz@gmail.com\"><u>malagon.sandralz@gmail.com</u></a>).</p><p>(disclaimer: I am currently in a relationship with Sandra Malag\u00f3n)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Supporting EA M\u00e9xico</h3><p>EA M\u00e9xico is a fast-growing community and budding hub. I am currently participating in the EA M\u00e9xico fellowship, which is the most diverse and healthy EA environment I have participated in. I believe there is a chance to support an ongoing and impactful community \u2014 M\u00e9xico is already a place favoured for organizations\u2019 retreats, Russian refugees and EA remote workers because of its open borders, low living costs and friendly culture.</p><p>Currently, the project is waiting for grant application results to continue in 2023. If approved, you can help the organizers by 1) donating your time to organize 1-1s and talks for the community, 2) including them in international events relevant to community building and 3) considering visiting or organizing your next team retreat in Ciudad de Mexico. Please reach out to Claudette Salinas (<a href=\"mailto:claudette@carrerasconimpacto.org\"><u>claudette@carrerasconimpacto.org</u></a>) and Michelle Bruno (<a href=\"mailto:michelle.bruno@carrerasconimpacto.org\"><u>michelle.bruno@carrerasconimpacto.org</u></a>) if you could help them in their journey.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Supporting the Sentinel system in Guatemala</h3><p>Sentinel is a biosecurity system that aims to set up regional infrastructure and diagnostic technologies to empower first responders with the information they need to be prepared for new pandemics.This initiative is intended to be achieved by deploying point-of-care diagnostics and sequencing technologies in LATAM, training regional professionals and connecting them through an information system called CommCare. They were counting on funding from the FTX Future Fund to get their program started in Guatemala for the next one and a half years of operations.</p><p>I am hardly an expert and cannot vouch for its cost-effectiveness. Still, this project seems net good to me, several dedicated members from the Spanish-Speaking EA community are involved, and I would encourage people to take a closer look and consider funding it.</p><p>If you want to support Sentinel, I encourage you to reach out to Paulina Paiz (<a href=\"mailto:paulinap@sas.upenn.edu\"><u>paulinap@sas.upenn.edu</u></a>).<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Supporting Riesgos Catastr\u00f3ficos Globales</h3><p><a href=\"https://riesgoscatastroficosglobales.com/\"><u>Riesgos Catastr\u00f3ficos Globales</u></a> (RCGs) is an organization promoting public initiatives to foresee, prevent and mitigate GCRs in Spanish-Speaking countries.&nbsp;</p><p>(disclaimer: I am one of the founding members and part of their board)</p><p>We conducted a pilot program in Spain, that led to us writing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/75jxFHAYpJphbLpwa/takeaways-from-our-interviews-of-spanish-civil-protection\"><u>a report about public risk management</u></a> and signing a collaboration agreement with the Madrid city hall. In the future, we want to prioritize M\u00e9xico, Colombia, and Chile as countries with potential for similar programs.</p><p>We currently have funding to support our operations in the next three months. We are seeking $733k in funding to cover the operations of 2023, and a fiscal sponsorship agreement. If you can provide either, I encourage you to contact&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:info@riesgoscatastroficosglobales.com\"><u>info@riesgoscatastroficosglobales.com</u></a> or directly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/jsevillamol\"><u>to me</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I think this is a good opportunity to scout out some potential cost-effective projects in Latin America and Spain. Some avenues of work I am keen on exploring are: 1) the role of tropical countries for food security in the event of a nuclear war or supervolcanic eruption, 2) better biosecurity networks through LatAm and 3) the role of Spain as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://portal.mineco.gob.es/es-es/comunicacion/Paginas/agencia-espa%C3%B1ola-de-supervisi%C3%B3n-de-inteligencia-artificial.aspx\"><u>testbed for AI regulation</u></a> in Europe.</p><p>Furthermore, I believe this could be a great opportunity to skill up talent in Spanish-Speaking countries. The Spanish-Speaking community is regularly finding highly promising individuals eager to take on early career jobs to prove their mettle, and we believe initiatives like these can help with their career development.</p><p>We are also currently hiring for research, policy, management, and operations roles. If you are a Spanish-Speaker who could be a good fit for either of these roles, please have a look at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://riesgoscatastroficosglobales.com/trabajos\"><u>our careers page</u></a>.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>The Spanish-Speaking EA community is well-positioned to discover, nurture and employ talent to tackle some of the most important problems in the world.</p><p>But to get there, they need support.

We have many conversations about how to do that. In the course of those conversations, we've slowly pushed forward a cultural understanding of \"how do we form correct beliefs?\" We call that understanding \u201cepistemics.\u201d</p><p>I want to make a few, hopefully-useful observations around this general space. If you haven\u2019t read much about epistemics before, I hope it serves as an accessible introduction. If you\u2019re an old hand, I hope it communicates this frame I\u2019ve found useful.</p><h2>I Why is this hard?</h2><p>Most of the time, figuring out what's true is easy. When was this bridge built? Look it up on Wikipedia (more on that later). When it's not easy, it's often best to just use the tools someone else has already developed.</p><p>The situations where you really start needing to attack the problem are when:</p><ul><li>The tools you're used to are inadequate for the task at hand, or</li><li>You and a collaborator disagree on how to figure out what's true.</li></ul><p>Once that happens, I claim most people just get really confused. It's like, what the heck is going on? This makes no sense / my collaborator makes no sense. People give up, or can form really deep impasses with those around them. Even if you're fortunate enough to notice the issue for what it is, it can seem really hard to resolve. I think this is what happened when a lot of my friends and I were only half-convinced of AI risk.</p><p>How the f**k are you supposed to weigh \"we literally have an RCT here\" versus, \"this other thing would be big if true\"? Many people find the answer obvious, but unfortunately not the same way. I hope at least some point in your life you\u2019ve viewed it as a hard problem.</p><p>Then, just when you and your best friend have figured out how to weigh evidence between yourselves, there comes a whole lot of other people. Many new complications arise when this is done as a community:</p><ul><li>Not all the participants are able to get complete information, or evaluate all the arguments</li><li>Some participants are probably smarter than others</li><li>Some participants are probably acting adversarially, or with some level of own-view favoring-bias</li></ul><h2>II All project-oriented communities do this</h2><p>Maybe you\u2019ve heard people talk recently about epistemics, and it\u2019s felt like a fuzzy concept. I hope that presenting the ways in which a bunch of different communities go about forming beliefs.</p><p><strong>Wikipedia</strong></p><p>As we\u2019ve already mentioned, Wikipedia has some outstanding epistemics. What\u2019s really useful for us here is that they\u2019ve written&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research\"><u>it down</u></a>. You can see the way that it's meant for Wikipedia\u2019s particular situation and how it needs to be legible to outsiders and extremely resilient to adversarial action.</p><p><strong>Science</strong></p><p>You can observe humanity making a huge leap forward by improving its epistemics in one important domain. Our species went from just being completely wrong about just about everything in the natural world, to methodically making progress in our understanding. That progress has compounded over time to completely transform the world. It's interesting the note that wasn't obvious with those epistemics should be at first. Are thought experiments valid scientific evidence? And in the soft sciences the epistemics are still controversial.</p><p>Some might claim that science has figured it all out. But what\u2019s the scientific way to predict who you should pick to lead your company? To make most decisions that humans make there is simply too little high quality data.</p><p><strong>Medicine</strong></p><p>Perhaps even more so than science, medicine is extremely conservative in its epistemics. There are so many actors involved who would love to take desperate people\u2019s money, and the medical system has drawn a clear bright line between what\u2019s well understood to work, and what\u2019s not. But it might be too conservative in quickly changing situations. People from different epistemic cultures were extremely frustrated by health authorities' slowness in promoting mask usage during the pandemic for example.</p><p><strong>Journalism</strong></p><p>News companies are allegedly in the business about helping me learn things that are true. My impression is that they have standards for what sources and origins of information are considered reliable enough for print. They also have historically done their best to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2020/07/16/how-objectivity-in-journalism-became-a-matter-of-opinion\"><u>differentiate</u></a> between reporting facts about the world and offering interpretation. For facts I only need to trust that the journalist is honest, whereas for interpretations, I have to trust their judgement.</p><p><strong>Social justice activists</strong></p><p>You can view one of the central tenants of this culture as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-epistemology/#FemiStanTheo\"><u>epistemic position</u></a>. They heavily prioritize personal experience as a strong predictor about whether someone has true beliefs about the topic under discussion.</p><p><strong>Business</strong></p><p>My impression is that business tends to value truth statements that can be measured. Unlike in science, the metrics do not need to be super-strongly validated. If I had to guess, it would be that this provides a coordination mechanism that is objective. It might be off the mark, but if everyone is pulling in the same direction, and the metric is at least somewhat reasonable, they should make progress towards their true goal.</p><h2>III Why it matters</h2><p>Thinking about epistemics has made me notice the occasions when I make arguments that are in support of my side but that only work because I\u2019m incorporating evidence that I don\u2019t think I should, or excluding evidence that I\u2019d otherwise endorse including. It\u2019s&nbsp;<i>hard</i> to do this project well. But having beliefs that converge on the truth is completely critical for the goals we\u2019d like to achieve. Not all of the possible epistemic strategies that we can adopt will do equally well at this goal.</p><p>In a world full of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stafforini.com/blog/bostrom/\"><u>crucial considerations</u></a>, we need all the help we can get not to miss any.</p>", "user": {"username": "jpaddison"}}, {"_id": "xGTcoL4rJsxGuDLFy", "title": "Concrete actionable policies relevant to AI safety (written 2019)", "postedAt": "2022-12-16T18:41:50.020Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"table\" style=\"height:194.364px;width:682px\"><table style=\"border:1px double rgb(179, 179, 179)\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 178, 241);border:0.99609pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>This is a&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vHogKj87ZBLgN8TpQ/today-is-draft-amnesty-day-december-16-18\"><strong><u>Draft Amnesty Day</u></strong></a><strong> draft.&nbsp;</strong>That means it\u2019s not polished, it\u2019s probably not up to my standards, the ideas are not thought out, and I haven\u2019t checked everything.

The question of how serious these risks are is not discussed here.</p><p><strong>Aim.</strong></p><p>This paper makes the case that there are concrete policies that can be implemented now by governments that would help mitigate TAI risks, and to set out a number of such policies. This could be used if opportunities arise to engage sympathetic policy makers on AI risks.</p><p><strong>Scope.</strong></p><p>This paper is focused only domestic AI safety policy, those that could be implemented by a single country and do not require international agreement. The policies come from examining what can be learned about AI safety policy from best practice in civil nuclear safety policy in the UK context. The policy suggestions are therefore within a UK policy context, although are hopefully general enough to be applicable in other countries as well.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Key recommendations for government</h3><ul><li><strong>Support more long term thinking in policy and politics</strong> through improvements to culture, processes, and accountability mechanisms. There are numerous policies that could do this, they are mapped out&nbsp;<s>here</s> [<i>Link redacted. Maybe see </i><a href=\"https://www.appgfuturegenerations.com/research\"><i>here</i></a><i> instead</i>].</li><li><strong>Improve the general processes for identifying mitigating and planning for future risks</strong>. Assessments of catastrophic risks should go out at least 20 years and pick up on emerging risks. Responsibility should be assigned to consider what mitigation, and preparation is needed for each risk. For a more detailed breakdown of suggested policies see draft CSER paper&nbsp;<s>here</s>&nbsp;[<i>Redacted</i>] (in future will be at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gcrpolicy.com/\">www.gcrpolicy.com</a>).</li><li><strong>Improve the ability of government to draw on technical and scientific expertise</strong>. For example, improve hiring processes and retention for staff with a technical background in government, facilitate secondments between government and academia, etc. Some of the mechanism the UK government has used to bring in scientific expertise are set out <s>here</s>&nbsp;[<i>Redacted</i>].</li><li><strong>Civil Servants should be researching policy issues around ethics and technology and AI</strong>. This could be facilitated through the development of an internal government think tank with a mix of staff from policy and technical backgrounds and the mandate to and capacity to look at high level questions connected to tech, ethics and AI, including TAI.

Potentially an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that can do tasks of any type or even an Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) that is smarter than humans as we are to animals. This concept is borrowed from and explored in depth in Professor Allan Dafoe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/GovAIAgenda.pdf\">AI Governance: A Research Agenda</a>. Experts predicts a 50% chance that high-level AI will be developed around 2040-2050<a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a>.</p><p><strong>TAI risks</strong>. This paper is focused on what policies could be adopted now that could mitigate some of the tail end risks associated with TAI, in particular the risk of TAI being misused by bad actors or the risk of an ASI that is not controllable or aligned with human goals. Both of these situations could be potentially existential risks for humanity.&nbsp; For the purpose of this paper this topic is referred to as \u201cAI safety policy\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Background to AI policy</h2><p>The growth of AI has captured the attention of corporates, the media, the public and state actors. States keen to bring AI start-ups and innovative research to their shores and reap the potential economic and societal benefits. This has led many states from China to Tunisia to adopt AI policies or national AI strategies.<a href=\"#_edn1\">[i]</a> These strategies cover topics such as supporting the AI industry, developing or capturing AI skills, improving digital infrastructure, funding R&amp;D, data use, safeguarding public data, AI use by government and AI regulation. In each case these strategies sit alongside work on related topics such as supporting the tech industry, software regulation, privacy and data use.</p><p>Within this process states have recognised the need to understand and prepare for the sociological, economic, ethical and legal implications that may stem from the widespread adoption of AI technology. There has been minimal action at the state level to address the implications of TAI.</p><p>The UK context</p><p>So far in the UK the Government has:</p><ul><li>Founded an <strong>Office for AI</strong>. This office will be implementing the priorities mentioned in the UK\u2019s Industrial Strategy: building a workforce with machine learning skills, growing the AI sector and supporting businesses to use AI<a href=\"#_edn2\">[ii]</a>. The office will also act as a secretariat to an <strong>AI Council</strong>.<a href=\"#_edn3\">[iii]</a></li><li>Founded the <strong>Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation</strong> (CEDI). CDEI is an internal government think tank considering issues around data, tech, ai and ethics. A centre for ethics is perhaps what the government creates when it is not yet sure what regulation is needed.</li><li><strong>Encouraging AI adoption</strong> in specific areas of policy including defence<a href=\"#_edn4\">[iv]</a> transport<a href=\"#_edn5\">[v]</a> (with the Centre for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles) and healthcare<a href=\"#_edn6\">[vi]</a></li><li><strong>Supporting AI research</strong> through the Turing Institute.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The policy context</h2><p>AI policy making sit within a wider context. It is important to remember that a government\u2019s policies on AI will be driven largely by the more general approach a government takes to business data and technology policy. Similarly, AI safety policy will sit within the context of wider AI policy.&nbsp; (It is possible AI policy will sit under defence rather than business but this does not appear to be the current trend).</p><p>It is also helpful to distinguish two kids of AI safety policy a government can adopt</p><ul><li><strong>Domestic policy</strong>. The policies a concerned government could unilaterally implement to ensure that the implications of AI are well manged within their country</li><li><strong>International policy</strong>. Any actions a state takes to ensure that AI safety best practice is adopted by other states and international institutions. For example, negotiating international treaties.</li></ul><p>This paper focuses on domestic AI safety policy</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td

I don\u2019t think that governments need to directly or explicitly recognise AI existential risks. What I do think is that any polices introduced such as regulations need to be robust to future worlds where various extreme AI risks become a possibility. This could be done by mapping out the short term AI societal risks and the range of possible long term AI risks and mapping across and ensuring the categorisation of and ways of responding to short term risks is not likely to pose barriers in any future more extreme risk scenarios.</i>]&nbsp;</p><p>Governments could recognise the implications that future technologies and global trends might have and recognise that some emerging technologies, such as the AI, biotech or geoengineering, may pose threat of catastrophic and potentially existential scale. Such recognition should be based as much as possible on a comprehensive scientific understanding of the subjects at hand and ideally informed public debate.</p><p>Recognition of a policy area or potential risk should be followed by assigning responsibility for mitigating and preparing for the risk to a Minister, Department, or position. That responsible political figure would be accountable to the public should doubts arise as to the policy or safety regime in place and they or their Department would be the point of contact for concerned parties.</p><p>Factors that affect how likely a country is to recognise and assign responsibility for a risk include: academic consensus, recognition of the risk by other countries, clear actions that can be taken after a risk is recognised, public and pressure group concern, political ideology and political will. It is worth noting that there is currently a lack of academic and expert consensus on the risks of TAI. From a policy perspective it is not clear that it would currently be sensible for a Government to recognise TAI risks.</p><p>Moving away from nuclear safety best practice, another government</p><p>The UK has a number of Horizon scanning processes spread across departments that look into future trends. It is likely that CDEI will be looking into the future trends associated with AI.</p><p>Risks are manged by the Cabinet Office. They collate risk into the National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies<a href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]</a>. The register risks that \u201chave at least a 1 in 20,000 chance of occurring in the UK in the next five years\u201d<a href=\"#_edn7\">[vii]</a>. These risks are then distributed to relevant departments and the such that the Secretary of State of that department is responsible for risk mitigation and emergency preparedness policy. For example, the risk of a radiological release from a nuclear site is the responsibility of the Secretary of State of the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy and staff in that department ensure that satisfactory polices are in place. There is also a separate occasional National Security Risk Assessment carried out by the MoD.<a href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]</a></p><p><strong><u>Recommendations</u></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Support more long term thinking in policy and politics</strong> through improvements to culture, processes, and accountability mechanisms.

There should also be a strategy to handle risks that are shared across national borders to avoid tragedy of the commons type conundrums whereby self-interested states behave to the detriment of the general good.<a href=\"#_edn8\">[viii]</a> If an improved processes recognises risks from TAI then this should be included on the National Risk Register and <strong>responsibility for TAI risk assigned to a Secretary of State</strong> for a relevant Department, most likely the Secretary of State for Digital Culture Media and Sport (DCMS).</li></ul><p>Additionally, academics concerned about AI safety should be looking to build or demonstrate academic consensus regarding the scale of AI risks, as without this it is unclear the extent to which good policy decision making processes should be picking up on these risks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Research</h2><p>[<i><strong><u>Update 2022</u></strong>:&nbsp;Less keen on this one. I would still support government funding to work on AI governance and ethics and maybe also on technical safety and misuse risk, but would worry about government AI funding fueling capabilities.

This would have an added benefit of helping to boost the UK\u2019s AI skill base.</p><p>Government officials are rarely experts in particular areas, but they do make up a large body of the expertise in policymaking, statecraft, international relations, and so forth. For good AI policy to be developed it is imperative that civil servants are directed to work on AI policy issues.</p><p>It is also important that there are good relationships between civil servants and academic experts.

Bodies such as CDEI should also ensure there are open communication streams between policymakers and technical researchers and the third sector.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Record</h2><p>[<i><strong><u>Update 2022</u></strong>:&nbsp;Seems like a nice to have but not a key ask]</i></p><p><strong><u>Best practice &amp; existing precedent</u></strong></p><p>In nuclear safety, when a serious nuclear or radiological problem occurs, countries will rate this event on the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale (INES) and if it is serious enough (and does not threaten national security to do so) the country will report the event to the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) Unified System for Information Exchange in Incidents and Emergencies (USIE). The event details are shared globally by the Nuclear Events Web-based System (NEWS). There are also strong working relationships between nuclear operators (and regulators) in different countries. So when evidence of a malfunction was discovered in a nuclear power plant in the UK it quickly became apparent that a plant in the US had dealt with similar issues and the lessons from that plan could be applied to the UK.</p><p>In cybersecurity there are various vulnerability disclosure processes in place to ensure rapid information sharing and appropriate responses from corporate actors. Governments have played a role in developing these processes and ensuring best practice even across international boundaries, for example the Dutch Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Guidelines.</p><p>There have been numerous reports of AI systems behaving unexpectedly and unpredictably.<a href=\"#_ftn15\">[15]</a> Whilst this is not necessarily problematic for games of Go, it may lead to danger should it occur at a large scale, or in scenarios where human lives are at risk (e.g. self-driving cars) or in the development of TAI.&nbsp; Technical AI safety researchers are already looking into setting up honeypots<a href=\"#_ftn16\">[16]</a> to help identify unusual behaviour by advanced AIs. It could be useful to ensure that information on unexpected behaviour is shared across AI labs.</p><p>No data sharing system for AI safety currently exists. Such as system could be set up unilaterally by a state or non-state actor, although international agreement would be ideal to ensure it\u2019s use.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Recommendation</u></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Develop a system for recording and sharing data relevant to AI safety&nbsp;</strong>(similar to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www-news.iaea.org/AboutNews.aspx\">NEWS</a>).&nbsp; Work with industry and academia to generate guidelines about and mechanisms for information sharing, for example covering when information should be shared, shared through private channels or made public.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Resilience: AI defence and safety</h2><p>[<i><strong><u>Update 2022</u></strong>:&nbsp;Not at the stage where I think there is much to do here yet, except maybe general support for research and projects aimed at civilizational resilience and recovery.]</i></p><p>In 1961, \u201ca bomber was flying over North Carolina, when it lost a wing, and two of its nuclear bombs fell to the ground [\u2026]. One of the bombs broke on impact after its parachute failed. The other landed unharmed, but five of its six safety devices also failed.

This means that a system is protected by a series of independent layers of defensive mechanisms (or \u2018fail-safes\u2019) such that if one mechanism fails, another will already be in place to protect against unexpected failures. To prevent TAI safety risks, AI researchers are already looking at how they can institute fail-safes.&nbsp;</p><p>Governments have capabilities and expertise in defence, security and cyber security. One way the Government can help find more fail-safes to help defend against AI risks is to increase the space in which we are looking for options: ideas such as manual internet/electricity shut-offs, or investments in general computer security to complicate the creation of botnets, should be studied further.&nbsp;<a href=\"#_ftn18\">[18]</a></p><p>As well as ASI safety concerns there may be a host of policy political and governance issues that could arise very rapidly from the development of TAI that, further down the line, it may be helpful for governments to prepare for.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Recommendation</u></strong></p><p>Further down the line the Government and the MoD may want engage with AI safety researchers to put in place additional layers defence in depth and other measures to mitigate risks and support the resilience to shocks from the potential development of TAI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Safeguarding</h2><p>[<i><strong><u>Update 2022</u></strong>:&nbsp;No strong views on this.

In practice in the UK this mean security clearances for staff in sensitive positions and high fences and the armed Civil Nuclear Constabulary at nuclear sites.</p><p>There is significant consensus that the misuse of AI, especially TAI by hostile actors poses a significant threat to global security. As such government\u2019s who have industries that are developing AI should look to protect these AI assets from hostile actors who might use them for nefarious ends. Government defence and security capabilities should be used to support the cybersecurity of researchers and academics working on AI who might lack the ability to defend the code they develop from malicious threats. Government could also provide background personnel checks on individuals to make sure they are not influenceable by outside forces (or eventually by an AGI itself).</p><p><strong><u>Recommendation</u></strong></p><p>The government should consider if the UK has high risk AI assets and if so look to protect those assets: for example, by requiring and providing security clearances for staff at Deepmind and by MoD or the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) ensuring that DeepMind has excellent cybersecurity protection.</p><p>+ supply chain&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Regulation</h1><p>[<i><strong><u>Update 2022</u></strong>:&nbsp;I am still very very keen on AI regulatory policy, if we can do it well. I think we can construct a world whereby there are skilled risk aware actors (regulators) who can step in at an emergency crunch point to pull the plug but otherwise do minimal except support safety work, prevent AI misuse, have some oversight and ensure AI companies have good governance structures. I think this world would be great. I think the community of people concerned about AI should be thinking much more about this.</i>]</p><p>Based largely on memory but mostly draws from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/resources/safety-standards/search\">International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s (IAEA) Safety Standards</a>, in particular&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/Pub1713web-70795870.pdf\">Governmental, Legal and Regulatory Framework for Safety, General Safety Requirements Part 1</a></p><h2>Regulate</h2><p>There is a lot written by governments and academics on best practice in regulation. Within the UK Government best practice is set out in the Regulators Code<a href=\"#_ftn20\">[20]</a> and more recently the work of the Regulatory Futures Review<a href=\"#_ftn21\">[21]</a>. For the uninitiated, Annex A looks to dispel some of the preconceptions about regulation. Including dispelling the ideas that regulation means having a detailed rulebook, being a burden on industry, watching everything industry does, enforcing rules using legal powers and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>In the UK the nuclear Regulator is the Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR). The (ONR) is responsible for regulation of the UK\u2019s nuclear industry. They are required under the Energy Act to ensure nuclear safety, conventional safety, security and safeguarding on civil nuclear sites. They are an arm\u2019s length Government body that reports to Parliament and are 97% funded by fees charged to dutyholders (nuclear sites). They use outcome focused regulation and dutyholders need to demonstrate that they are meeting the licence conditions, but the way they meet them is up to the dutyholder. The ONR are comprised of a body of experts, known as inspectors, who tend to have considerable experience in the nuclear industry. Inspectors monitor actions of dutyholders inspections, site self-reporting and site safety cases or other independent reports. The inspectors have a good relationship with the sites and 90 of the time soft enforcement (eg. a quick constructive conversation) is sufficient to address an issue. There is a separate regulator for Defence sites, the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator (DNSR).</p><p>Another example of best practice UK regulation is the acclaimed Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).</p><p>Drawing from best practice in regulation and especially from nuclear industry we can draw a number of conclusions about what good regulation of AI should look like.</p><p>Ideally the remit of an AI regulator should include:</p><ul><li><strong>Regulating the responsible use of tech by the tech industry</strong>. Regulators function well when they have a good relationship with the industry they are regulating. For example, the ONR regulates conventional health and safety as well as nuclear safety. This helps the regulator build a single point of contact relationship with industry. Even more importantly this allows inspectors to infer conclusions about the likelihood of serious safety incidents (eg. in the development of TAI) from the likelihood of minor incidents and infractions.</li><li><strong>Regulating the use of tech by government including by the military.</strong></li><li><strong>Other responsibilities.&nbsp;</strong>They should<strong>&nbsp;</strong>ensure the safeguarding of cyber commercial assets (discussed above), ensure reporting and data sharing (discussed above) and have a responsibility to support economic growth and support the development of tech and AI skills.</li></ul><p>The rules should be:</p><ul><li><strong>Outcome focused. </strong>Companies should be able to demonstrate the safe and ethical in any way they wish. For example, a driverless car company does not need to show it can meet specific criteria (eg. can the AI recognise humans) only that it is safe (if used it will not lead to casualties).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Based on high level principles</strong></li><li><strong>Consider corporate structures and safety culture.&nbsp;</strong>For example make it clear that responsibility needs to be assigned at senior levels and that Directors can be held legally responsible for problems. Make t clear that responsible indiviauls need to be suitably quliaifed and experienced.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>This tech regulator should be set up such that it is:</p><ul><li><strong>Staffed by technical experts at the top of their fields.</strong> There should be a set of inspectors each of whom can generally inspect most situations but each with a unique high level specialisation.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Able to use powers but in practice use them rarely</strong>. Inspectors should have powers (to access site, seize evidence, issue improvement notices, take to court) to but look to avoid using them as much as possible where soft influence will suffice.</li><li><strong>Independent from government.&nbsp;</strong>They should be an arm\u2019s length body like the Bank of England or the ONR. In the UK they should report directly to Parliament. If it is not too much of a burden on industry, they should be funded by a levy on industry rather than by government.</li><li><strong>Sampling and permissioning focused.&nbsp;</strong>Inspectors should not look at everything a company does. In most cases inspectors should look at random samples of projects and code. The regulator may want to set out that in certain specified extreme cases where the risks or ethical implications are unclear (eg introducing driverless cars on public roads) the company should ask for permission first and demonstrate that they are safe.</li><li><strong>Proportionate. </strong>The amount of regulation must be proportionate to the risk and not an undue burden on industry. Potentially a regulatory sandbox with lighter rules should exist to support small-scale innovation.</li><li><strong>Horizon scanning.&nbsp;</strong>The regulator should think long term and be able to adapt to an ever-changing technological environment.</li></ul><p><strong><u>Recommendation</u></strong></p><p>The UK Government should set up a regulator in the form of a well-funded independent body of technical experts is given very high-level goals to ensure the safe and ethical behaviour of the technology industry (similar to HEFA or the ONR).</p><p>+ Put in place whistleblowing mechanisms</p><p>+ Look also at the corporate structures and how responsibility is assigned to individuals within the organisations&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Concluding thoughts&nbsp;</h1><h2>Recommendations</h2><p>In the UK context</p><p>The paper recognises the positive steps that the UK Government has made to date in particular:</p><ul><li>Civil Servants should be researching policy issues around ethics and technology and AI. (This is already happening sufficiently within CDEI).</li><li>it <strong>Recognises</strong> emerging risks that may occur more than 5 years in the future but where action now might be useful. The relevant Ministers should be assigned <strong>Responsibility</strong> to address any additional risks</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>International agreements</h2><p>The author of this paper is not an expert in international treaties, or international security mechanisms but it certainly seems likely that international policy and the international stage has a role to play in ensuring that if TAI is developed the transition goes well for humanity.</p><p>In the first instance regulatory expertise is often shared and developing a good regulatory system in the UK will pave the way for good AI regulation globally.</p><p>Additionally, international agreements could be reached on the ethical use of AI (an idea suggested by former UK digital and culture secretary Matt Hancock<a href=\"#_ftn22\">[22]</a>), on the development of AI weapons, on international safeguarding and non-proliferation processes and on the right level of international data sharing and reporting of errors. Potentially even an international body for sharing regulator best practice could be set up similar to the IAEA.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Moving forwards</h2><p>That said, there may not be much choice. Governments are already discussing these issues, creating specialised statutory bodies, and providing finance to early stage projects. And all it needs now is for a serious event, which could be a massive cyber-attack using a machine learning algorithm, or could be the hacking of a self-driving car to murder a person, and the public may start shouting for regulation. It would be good to have the above policy suggestions at hand for when that happens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Annex A&nbsp;: introduction to Regulation</h1><p>For the uninitiated, Annex A looks to dispel some of the preconceptions about regulation. Including:</p><ol><li><strong>Regulators are a part of Government.&nbsp;</strong>There is a scale from total industry self-regulation to government run regulators. Most regulatory bodies have some degree of independence from government and the Regulatory Futures Review recommended that government regulators be funded by dutyholders (the bodies being regulated) rather than government grants.</li><li><strong>Regulation does not mean having a detailed rulebook</strong>. Best practice is to have outcome focused regulations and to allow the dutyholders to work out how to achieve the outcomes.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Regulation does not mean being a burden on industry</strong>. Having a body of experts check that a system is safe provides a benefit to the dutyholder. Furthermore, a regulator may have a secondary responsibility to support industry growth. More perversely big corporates may like regulation as it keeps smaller organisations out of the market.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Enforcing regulation does not mean watching everything industry does</strong>. Dutyholders may self-report. Inspectors might only go to sites if they already expect there is a problem, or may use sampling methods to test the waters and look for evidence of poor process or risk taking.</li><li><strong>Enforcing regulation does not mean using legal powers</strong>. Although they will have legal enforcement powers, most of the work of a regulator is to keep dutyholders within the law without having to resort to legal powers.</li><li><strong>Regulation does not mean letting government off the hook</strong>. Regulators can have oversight of Government activities as well as corporate activities.</li><li><strong>Different regulators specialise in different topics or type of risk.&nbsp;</strong>This is somewhat true, and certainly topic expertise is important. But more important is the relationship formed with dutyholders, and different regulators regulate different parts of industry / government.

It doesn\u2019t say how exactly good is meant to be done. More importantly, it doesn\u2019t specify precisely what \u201cgood\u201d is. It implies it is in some way ordinal, in the sense that there is such a thing as \u201cthe most good.\u201d This naturally lends itself to utilitarian ideas of the good, though it doesn\u2019t seem to prescribe a particular kind of utilitarianism (e.g. hedonistic utilitarianism). However, the original goal is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/\"><u>still the stated goal</u></a>.</p><h1><strong>The mesa objectives</strong></h1><p>The inspecificity in the goal of effective altruism has led the movement to try to fill in the blanks. Some went and massively scaled up funding for malaria nets. Some took high-paying jobs in order to donate their money (more on this later). Some, believing more than others in the conviction that the welfare of non-human animals should be included in \u201cthe good,\u201d worked to end factory farming. Others, believing in the importance of future generations and the possibility of existential risks, tried to reduce AI risk.</p><p>Thus, each person involved in EA might give you a slightly different answer when asked what \u201cthe good\u201d actually is. EA has thus developed intrasystem goals, subgoals which support the main goal but aren\u2019t exactly the same by virtue of being more specific.</p><h1><a href=\"https://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/ai_drives_final.pdf\"><strong><u>The basic EA drives</u></strong></a></h1><p><i>EA wants to self-improve</i>: A very large part of the EA movement, from the very beginning, has been focused on criticisms and improvements. In fact,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Fx8pWSLKGwuqsfuRQ/pre-announcing-a-contest-for-critiques-and-red-teaming\"><u>EA expends resources looking for good criticisms so it can improve.</u></a></p><p><i>EA wants to be rational:&nbsp;</i>Peter Singer did not talk about rationality techniques, but the current iteration of EA does. Having more accurate beliefs, and acting on those beliefs in a way which achieves your objectives, can help to more effectively pursue goals (whether or not the rationality movement achieves this is a different question).</p><p><i>EA will try to preserve its utility function:&nbsp;</i>There are many people in the world who do not believe there is such a thing as maximizing good, or believe that EA should pay more attention to specific politically-popular priorities. Some argue that doing good is about reducing inequality or want to focus specifically on climate change. EA tends to actively attempt to shut these people down if they are attempting to gain power in the movement, because they are a threat to its utility function. If too many were let in, EA would fail by its current goal.</p><p><i>EAs will try to prevent counterfeit utility:&nbsp;</i>EA tends to stress that metrics are not everything, especially more recently. People talk frequently about how DALYs are just a directional tool rather than the absolute good. EAs tend to have an obsession with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\"><u>Goodhart\u2019s Law</u></a> and attempt to avoid falling into its trap.</p><p><i>EA will be self-protective:&nbsp;</i>EA is under attack from various angles, and people are very aware of how their actions will destroy or preserve EA as a movement. EA is attempting to defend itself from these attacks, through, for example, media attention.</p><p><i>EA will want to acquire resources and use them efficiently:&nbsp;</i>The very premise of EA was about using limited resources efficiently. Very soon after that, people realized that they could do more if they acquired resources themselves. One of the largest EA funders founded a company specifically for the purpose of acquiring billions of dollars so that he could give it away. Millions are spent annually to recruit more talent into the EA pipeline.</p><h1><strong>EA is planning and strategically-aware</strong></h1><p>EA constantly thinks about how developments now will affect the movement in the future, and understands that there are adversaries (e.g. political adversaries) that need to be reckoned with. It is acutely aware of itself and its strategic position.</p><h1><strong>EA is power-seeking</strong></h1><p>In addition to acquiring money, EA attempts to acquire power. Many of its recommendations involve getting into high places, like important AI labs or roles in government. It focuses on elite universities, in no small part because the students who attend them are more likely to have influence in the future.</p><p>In a particularly obvious example, EA has gotten involved in politics, and spent tens of millions on a congressional race.</p><h1><strong>EA is deceptive</strong></h1><p>Community builder EAs (and intro fellowship syllabi) often start with the \u201cless weird\u201d parts first when introducing EA to new members, even if the individuals or collectives organizing things believe the \u201cmore weird\u201d parts are more important. There is an idea that starting with the \u201cweirder\u201d parts would turn people off who could end up having large impacts. This is instrumentally convergent deceptive behavior, and group members do not even have to be intentionally deceptive for it to emerge.</p><h1><strong>Could EA be misaligned?</strong></h1><p><i>Strong longtermism&nbsp;</i>is a proxy objective for effective altruism. It states that \u201cgood\u201d is overwhelmingly in the far future, such that it\u2019s possible to simply ignore the effects of your actions on the first 1000 years after now. Specifically, it argues for increasing the expected value of the utility of the far future. Many who originally self-identified as effective altruists now identify as longtermists, such that it can be reasonably said that the fuzzy goal of \u201cdoing good\u201d has been replaced with a more specific proxy objective.</p><p>As such, the longtermism movement is a mesa-optimizer produced by effective altruism that does not try to optimize the original objective but a proxy for it. See for instance <a href=\"https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/sam-bankman-fried/\">this interview with Sam Bankman-Fried</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>COWEN:&nbsp;</strong>Should a Benthamite be risk-neutral with regard to social welfare?</p><p><strong>BANKMAN-FRIED:&nbsp;</strong>Yes,&nbsp;<i>that</i> I feel very strongly about.</p><p><strong>COWEN:&nbsp;</strong>Okay, but let\u2019s say there\u2019s a game: 51 percent, you double the Earth out somewhere else; 49 percent, it all disappears. Would you play that game? And would you keep on playing that, double or nothing?</p><p><strong>BANKMAN-FRIED:&nbsp;</strong>With one caveat. Let me give the caveat first, just to be a party pooper, which is, I\u2019m assuming these are noninteracting universes. Is that right? Because to the extent they\u2019re in the same universe, then maybe duplicating doesn\u2019t actually double the value because maybe they would have colonized the other one anyway, eventually.</p><p><strong>COWEN:&nbsp;</strong>But holding all that constant, you\u2019re actually getting two Earths, but you\u2019re risking a 49 percent chance of it all disappearing.</p><p><strong>BANKMAN-FRIED:&nbsp;</strong>Again, I feel compelled to say caveats here, like, \u201cHow do you really know that\u2019s what\u2019s happening?\u201d Blah, blah, blah, whatever. But that aside, take the pure hypothetical.</p><p><strong>COWEN:&nbsp;</strong>Then you keep on playing the game. So, what\u2019s the chance we\u2019re left with anything? Don\u2019t I just St. Petersburg paradox you into nonexistence?</p><p><strong>BANKMAN-FRIED:&nbsp;</strong>Well, not necessarily. Maybe you St. Petersburg paradox into an&nbsp;<i>enormously</i> valuable existence. That\u2019s the other option.</p></blockquote><p>If you ask most, including I suspect many EAs, whether they would like a theoretically-omnipotent SBF to do this, they would probably say no. How has the question of \u201chow can we do the most good?\u201d been answered by \u201cit\u2019s desirable to have a vanishingly small probability of an astronomical number of people if the expected value calculations work out?\u201d It is absurd on its face: perhaps even as absurd as tiling the universe with paperclips.</p><p>Currently, SBF has no magic button. Instead, he is working mainly on projects that reduce existential risk. This is firmly in the territory of \u201ctrying to do as much good as possible\u201d in that an existential catastrophe seems plausibly very very bad under multiple proxies for \u201cthe good.\u201d In-distribution, I am happy with strong longtermism.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefge2c901g0zg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnge2c901g0zg\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>However, say we have a distributional shift, and somebody gets a chance to push the metaphorical button. Can we be so confident that the proxy objective set forth by longtermism is really robust to gaming? Can we unequivocally claim that effective altruism does not give rise to misaligned mesa-optimizers?</p><p>I don\u2019t think we can.</p><hr><h1><strong>How can we rein in the mesa-objective?</strong></h1><p>We don\u2019t have a failsafe way of doing this, just as we don\u2019t with AI. However, there are some ideas that seem like they could work well:</p><ul><li>Oversight by other strong agents: Having organizations and people specifically focusing on trying to do the most good, that oversee what others in EA are doing and push back against fanatical attempts to game various proxies for good. This is a good use for red teaming.</li><li>Value clarification: Continued attempts to philosophically interrogate the proxies for good that we care about and determine how to make them gradually less flawed. For instance, investigations of flaws with expected value and longtermism in general as a theory of action.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Just as EA exhibits every one of the hallmarks of an optimizer, it also has already been working on the solutions. In fact, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/T975ydo3mx8onH3iS/ea-is-about-maximization-and-maximization-is-perilous\">pushback against fanaticism</a> and <a href=\"https://www.williammacaskill.com/info-moral-uncertainty\">work on value clarification</a> seem central to the EA movement. So perhaps we have a chance to rein in mesa-objectives.</p><h1><strong>Implication: strengthen \u201cquestion EA\u201d as a watchdog?</strong></h1><p>Effective altruism, as defined as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FpjQMYQmS3rWewZ83/effective-altruism-is-a-question-not-an-ideology\"><u>a \u201cquestion\u201d</u></a> and community rather than a creed, appears pretty good at poking at the problems with fanatical longtermism while still allowing it to be a very useful proxy for doing good. However, this could be threatened by longtermist-specific community building efforts that specifically attempt to get people to become longtermists. By this I don\u2019t mean efforts pointed at the reduction of specific existential risks, or a vague concern about the importance of the future, but rather efforts at spreading strong longtermism in general.</p><p>If we want EA to continue to serve as a powerful value clarification and oversight agent, we are going to need to make sure it is strong and resists efforts by subagents to proxy game. This requires question EA to be stronger than, or at least evenly matched with, its subagents.</p><p>EA is amorphous and less clearly defined than many possible subgoals, and some will say this is a fault. When considered in the context of misaligned optimizers, I think it is precisely that messiness that is essential.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnge2c901g0zg\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefge2c901g0zg\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Reminder: this was written prior to the FTX collapse.

The summary was written by Rhys Southan.</i></p><p>For consequentialists, the outcomes that follow from our actions fully determine the moral value of our actions. Actions are right to the extent they bring about good outcomes and wrong to the extent they bring about bad outcomes. If, as many philosophers believe (Greaves &amp; MacAskill, 2021), the best outcomes we can bring about involve improving the long-run future for sentient life, this is what consequentialists are morally required to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Non-consequentialists think the outcomes of our actions matter morally but are not <i>all </i>that matter morally. Respecting moral constraints such as not lying is also important. Many assume this gives non-consequentialists moral flexibility. Non-consequentialists who think improving the long-run future is the best thing they could do, do not necessarily believe it is what they are morally obligated to do. They can devote their lives to improving the long-run future if they want, but they do not have to.&nbsp;</p><p>In \u201cThe Paralysis Argument,\u201d MacAskill and Mogensen dispute this alleged moral flexibility of non-consequentialism. They argue that non-consequentialists must either stay paralysed, alter some core aspects of their understanding of morality, or join consequentialists in improving the long-run future.</p><h2><strong>Six assumptions that lead to the paralysis requirement</strong></h2><p>How do non-consequentialists find themselves choosing between death and essentially behaving as if they were consequentialists? Let us first consider why non-consequentialism might entail the impermissibility of almost any actions we might take. This results from a combination of non-consequentialist beliefs, inconvenient moral claims that non-consequentialists may not be able to avoid, and empirical claims:</p><h3>1. Doctrine of Doing and Allowing</h3><p>Non-consequentialists believe it is morally worse to do harm than to merely allow harm of the same magnitude. For instance, it is morally worse to knock someone into a lake who then drowns than it is to let someone drown when they are not in the lake because of you.</p><h3>2. Harm-benefit asymmetry</h3><p>Non-consequentialists believe it is more wrong to do harm of a certain magnitude than it is right to bring about benefits of the same or even somewhat greater magnitude. For instance, it is wrong for an ambulance to run over one person to save two lives. This means non-consequentialists cannot offset the wrong of a harm they do by bringing about a benefit of a similar magnitude.</p><h3>3. Symmetry of doing and allowing benefits</h3><p>Unlike with harms, allowing benefits is as morally good as making it the case that someone benefits. For instance, if we could allow Ava to save Bree by using the last vial of a drug, or we could use the vial ourselves to save Zoe, we do not have a strong moral reason to save Zoe ourselves rather than allow Ava to save Bree. This is not necessarily an \u2018official\u2019 non-consequentialist stance, but it is compatible with non-consequentialism and more intuitive than an asymmetry in doing and allowing benefits.</p><h3>4. The moral importance of our actions is primarily determined by their indirect long-run effects</h3><p>We bring about an inconceivably large number of indirect effects through our everyday actions. For instance, driving to the grocery store can significantly alter the next billion years (Greaves 2016). Most obviously, by changing traffic conditions and affecting the schedules and thoughts of strangers, driving affects when other people have sex and conceive children. Since our identities are determined by which particular sperm fertilises which particular egg and sperms especially are in flux, changing when people have sex alters the identity of the children people have, which determines which grandchildren, great-grandchildren and so on will populate the future (Parfit 1984). The particular people who exist in the far future would not exist if we hadn\u2019t acted precisely as we did, and each of them will create numerous harms and benefits\u2014all of which are traceable back to our actions which were necessary conditions of their existence, making their effects our effects. We have \u201cdone\u201d this outrageously large cascade of harms and benefits and are morally complicit in it. Furthermore, these indirect effects are far more morally significant than our direct or immediate effects, just by sheer numbers alone.</p><p>Non-consequentialists might want to resist that having some causal responsibility for distant indirect effects equates to moral liability for those effects, and so deny that our indirect effects are morally important. After all, the processes by which these effects come about are complicated, inscrutable, and facilitated by the voluntary actions of other agents. MacAskill and Mogensen propose different ways of raising such objections and conclude they all fail. Non-consequentialists must either accept the vast moral importance of our indirect effects or offer a stronger counter-argument than those that MacAskill and Mogensen consider.</p><h3>5. We cannot assume our everyday actions cause significantly more benefit than harm</h3><p>We cannot predict the long-run value of the indirect effects our actions bring about. Sometimes we can foresee some of the more immediate indirect effects, but we quickly lose track of even these as they ripple on, and since all our actions potentially echo through the end of time, most indirect effects are unforeseeable. It is safe to assume these include both benefits and harms, but we have no reason to believe the indirect effects of our everyday actions produce more benefit than harm.</p><h3>6. We allow far-future outcomes rather than do them when we enter a state of voluntary \u201cparalysis\u201d</h3><p>We can avoid causal and thus moral responsibility for the value of the far future if we freeze in place until we die from a lack of sustenance. Non-consequentialists might counter that going into voluntary paralysis does not allow us to fully dodge causal chains that extend throughout the far future, and so does not count as merely allowing future outcomes. MacAskill and Mogensen are sceptical of this objection but concede there may be some better strategy for allowing future outcomes other than paralysis. However, they suspect any such strategy will be about as undesirable as voluntary paralysis.</p><h2><strong>Why these assumptions require non-consequentialists to stop moving</strong></h2><p>By moving around, we make ourselves morally liable for the value of the far future by actively contributing to causal chains linked to a vast number of morally significant harms and benefits (4). We have no basis for thinking the benefits of our everyday activities significantly outweigh their harms since we do not know what most of our indirect effects are (5). Even if we arbitrarily assumed the indirect effects of our everyday actions were a bit more beneficial than harmful overall, this would not help, because causing slightly more benefits than harms is morally worse than causing nothing at all (2). That we cannot know whether anyone\u2019s voluntary paralysis reduces or increases future harms compared with their going about their everyday lives also does not help. The problem is, there is no moral upside to doing rather than allowing benefits (3) while there is significant moral downside to doing rather than allowing harms (1). So, even if future harms and benefits are identical in expectation whether we participate in causal chains or not, non-consequentialists are obliged to allow the harms and benefits of the far future rather than help cause them. The surest way to accomplish this is to move as little as possible until succumbing (6).</p><h2><strong>Escaping paralysis by improving the long-run future</strong></h2><p>MacAskill and Mogensen offer non-consequentialists an alternative to voluntary paralysis if they accept two final claims.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A. Doing both harms and benefits can be at least as moral as doing nothing when &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the benefits outweigh the harms by enough</p><p>The harm-benefit asymmetry does not ban non-consequentialists from doing any amount of harm whatsoever for any amount of benefit whatsoever.

The rightmost plot shows the absolute increase in utility.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:1800px\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671208227/mirroredImages/boxF7ZL5zLieFLCtv/wzwkt9oayy7tglhsbojt.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Main model, easy<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefssxf53peoz8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnssxf53peoz8\">[3]</a></sup></span></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:1810px\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671208227/mirroredImages/boxF7ZL5zLieFLCtv/epdo9xfmejb7qhzwcy7g.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Main model, medium<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcwl364qwxbo\"><sup><a href=\"#fncwl364qwxbo\">[4]</a></sup></span></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:1810px\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671208227/mirroredImages/boxF7ZL5zLieFLCtv/yb6mp4oo2bdatj3zvkl0.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Main model, hard<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm50jfe7af7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm50jfe7af7\">[5]</a></sup></span></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:1800px\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671208227/mirroredImages/boxF7ZL5zLieFLCtv/ckboiaapo8kg3tdwhbjg.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Alternate model, easy<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref53c4d5oy76\"><sup><a href=\"#fn53c4d5oy76\">[6]</a></sup></span></figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:1800px\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671208227/mirroredImages/boxF7ZL5zLieFLCtv/cjcdpkgjcmjg3v2vghme.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Alternate model, medium<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0t8ah2gxe5if\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0t8ah2gxe5if\">[7]</a></sup></span></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:1810px\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671208227/mirroredImages/boxF7ZL5zLieFLCtv/ztv2y85p4ufmpgvky6uf.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>Alternate model, hard<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhurtu0mihdd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhurtu0mihdd\">[8]</a></sup></span></figcaption></figure><p>Both the main and alternate model show that:</p><ul><li>The greatest gains are achievable in the <i>hard </i>case where we are highly confident in short timelines but mistaken.

That it wasn't already on the forum (afaict) also contributed to its inclusion here.</p></blockquote><p>Due to concerns about copyright, I'm excerpting the post besides the summary and disclaimer, but I recommend reading the whole piece.&nbsp;</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is a major donator to the Effective Altruism ecosystem and has pledged to eventually donate his entire fortune to causes aligned with Effective Altruism.&nbsp;</p><p>By relying heavily on ultra-wealthy individuals like Sam Bankman-Fried for funding, the Effective Altruism community is incentivized to accept political stances and moral judgments based on their alignment with the interests of its wealthy donators, instead of relying on a careful and rational examination of the quality and merits of these ideas. Yet, the Effective Altruism community does not appear to recognize that this creates potential conflicts with its stated mission of doing the most good by adhering to high standards of rationality and critical thought.</p><p>In practice, Sam Bankman-Fried has enjoyed highly-favourable coverage from 80,000 Hours, an important actor in the Effective Altruism ecosystem. Given his donations to Effective Altruism, 80,000 Hours is, almost by definition, in a conflict of interest when it comes to communicating about Sam Bankman-Fried and his professional activities. This raises obvious questions regarding the trustworthiness of 80,000 Hours\u2019 coverage of Sam Bankman-Fried and of topics his interests are linked with (quantitative trading, cryptocurrency, the FTX firm\u2026).</p><p>In this post, I argue that the Effective Altruism movement has failed to identify and publicize its own potential conflicts of interests. This failure reflects poorly on the quality of the standards the Effective Altruism movement holds itself to. Therefore, I invite outsiders and Effective Altruists alike to keep a healthy level of skepticism in mind when examining areas of the discourse and action of the Effective Altruism community that are susceptible to be affected by incentives conflicting with its stated mission. These incentives are not just financial in nature, they can also be linked to influence, prestige, or even emerge from personal friendships or other social dynamics. The Effective Altruism movement is not above being influenced by such incentives, and it seems urgent that it acts to minimize conflicts of interest.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Introduction \u2014 Cryptocurrency is not neutral (neither morally nor politically)</h1><p>... Cryptocurrency is not simply an attempt to provide a set of technical solutions to improve existing currency systems. It is an attempt to replace existing monetary institutions by a new political system, it is therefore political at its core...</p><p>My point here is not to debate on the virtues of the societal model promoted by cryptocurrency actors, but rather to convince readers unfamiliar with the cryptocurrency industry that it is deeply infused with political ideology and is certainly not a purely-technological response to a technical problem. The cryptocurrency response to monetary policy questions manifests a specific worldview accompanied by a specific set of moral values.</p><h1>EA\u2019s reliance on funding from the cryptocurrency industry</h1><p>...These incentives are not just monetary. As the crypto industry grows and SBF gains in wealth, influence and prestige, EA benefits by receiving more funding but also by extending its own area of influence and its prestige. On the contrary, attacks on the image of SBF, FTX and even crypto as a whole carry the risk of tarnishing EA\u2019s reputation. Were SBF to be involved in an ethical or legal scandal (whether in his personal or profesional life), the EA ecosystem would inevitably be damaged as well. As a result, the EA community has an incentive to protect SBF\u2019s reputation, to counter critics against him from the outside and to stifle critics from the inside of the community (this incentive can act between EA members, by voiced criticisms being ignored, downplayed, treated with defiance, but can even act via self-censorship, conscious or not).</p><h1>How EA views cryptocurrency</h1><p>...Given that the adoption of cryptocurrency has massive political implications for the future of our societies and carries with it very strong ideological foundations, it should, at first glance, seem slightly surprising that the EA community does not visibly engage critically with this topic on a deeper political level. But this is not as surprising when considering EA\u2019s reliance on crypto wealth for funding. As explained above, the EA community is powerfully primed to view cryptocurrency positively, if only by the direct financial benefits it collects from the industry. Moreover, the incentives at play are likely effective inhibitors of contrarian views (notably by means of self-censorship)...</p><h1>EA\u2019s ineffective mechanisms to protect itself against conflicts of interest</h1><p>... EA <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/ceas-guiding-principles\">claims</a> to aim to do \u201cthe most good\u201d using the tools of rationality and critical thinking. So what does the EA ecosystem do to mitigate the risk that EA members act according to bias-inducing incentives?</p><p>As far as I can tell, the systemic safeguards against conflicts of interests in the EA ecosystem are very limited...</p><p>These two main forms of promotion of debates (internal forums and invitations to criticisms) are not nearly sufficient as mechanisms to prevent the establishment of conflicts of interests. Yet, they appear to be the only ones the Effective Altruism community relies on.</p><h1>Conflicts of interest need to be addressed whether they have real effects or not</h1><p>...Fundamentally, the problem I want to highlight is not even whether the EA ecosystem is effectively influenced by the incentives it is subject to. These incentives exist, and are left unchecked. This is the primary issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether these incentives have actual effects on EA is almost secondary to the fact that EA seems to be unable to recognize, publicize and mitigate its engagement in conflicts of interest... For EA, incentives like the ones related to SBF are in direct conflict with EA\u2019s stated mission of \u201cusing <strong>evidence </strong>and <strong>reason</strong> to figure out how to benefit others as much as possible\u201d (quote from the <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/ceas-guiding-principles\">Centre For Effective Altruism</a>).</p><h1>What should EA do?</h1><p>It appears clear that EA does not consider itself to be at any real risk of falling prey to conflicts of interests. This seems to be the only way to explain the blind spot EA suffers from when it comes to recognizing its incentives associated with relying on donations from tech bilionaires, as obvious as these may be in the particular case of donations by SBF.</p><p><strong>Identifying and publicizing obvious sources of potential conflicts of interests</strong></p><p>A necessary (but non sufficient) first step would be to acknowledge existing incentive and recognize their potential effects...</p><p>I will briefly address a counter-argument that could be made along the lines of: \u201cSBF\u2019s profile in 80,000 Hours clearly mentions SBF\u2019s contributions to EA-aligned causes. Therefore EA is transparent about its funding, therefore EA does not suffer from issues of undisclosed conflicts of interests.\u201d Indeed, SBF\u2019s contributions are mentioned at length in EA publications. But I have seen no instance where this contribution was listed as a sign of potential conflict of interest. On the contrary, SBF is framed as a prime example of Earning to Give, he is presented as an example to follow, a person to admire, to take inspiration from and to be grateful to, which does nothing to warn against potential conflicts of interest.</p><p><strong>Going further</strong></p><p>It seems crucial that EA, if it values independence of thought and critical thinking, should engage in an in-depth examination of the role that incentives are allowed to play in the organization...</p><p>Publicizing existing conflicts of interest achieves little if not accompanied by a significant effort to understand how conflicts of interest are allowed to appear, how to minimize their potential effects, how to strengthen counterpowers within the organization to foster accountability, how to prevent EA from becoming more conflicted and instead reduce the number and strength of exisiting conflicts of interest.</p><p>There is a clear trade-off between 1) expanding the available resources of a non-profit organization and 2) protecting said organization from potential conflicts of interests. My opinion is that EA as a community should probably think hard about where it stands on this trade-off...</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>...It would be pointless to aspire to building an organization in which conflicting incentives are completely eliminated. On the other hand, it would be completely illusory to think that individuals can consciously decide to free themselves from the biases associated with incentives of all kinds. Systemic safeguards are essential, all the more so when an organization aims to hold itself to high standards of rationality. Hopefully, the EA movement will remember this sooner rather than later.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Disclaimers</h1><p>This post deals with conflicts of interests, it is only natural that I would be particularly transparent regarding the incentives that played into its writing.</p><p>First, I did not receive any funding for writing this post, and I have no affiliation to the EA movement.&nbsp;</p><p>I wrote this post aiming to submit it to EA\u2019s criticism contest and was thus incentivized to write an effective critique of EA, but one that would not be too antagonizing to the jury of the contest (I believe that the jury is mainly composed of members of EA). I did my best to resist this incentive and aimed to not water down my thesis too much.<br>By making a pseudonymous submission, I am shielding myself from the fear of reputational damage, which could otherwise have been a powerful incentive to self-censor.</p>", "user": null}, {"_id": "xBfp3HGapGycuSa6H", "title": "I'm less approving of the EA community now than before the FTX collapse", "postedAt": "2022-12-16T19:40:37.082Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This is mostly a counterpoint to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CZXDTSvnFFe99kNoB/i-m-as-approving-of-the-ea-community-now-as-before-the-ftx\">Will Aldred/Duncan Sabien's post</a>.</p><p>I'm not really an EA; haven't taken the pledge, don't work at an org, have been to no EA meetups in my life, (haven't been a speaker at EA Global).</p><p>However, I have been close to the EA community for a while, agreeing with many of its goals and donating to many of its key causes.</p><p>Reading Duncan's post made me want to defend the case for why I'm less approving of the EA community than before.

This is a translation from Urdu. The translator, Quratulain, would like to specify that they don\u2019t talk exactly like this. The interview was carried out on the 12th of May of 2020.</p><p>Q: Where are you from in Balochistan? City or village?</p><p>N: I\u2019m from Balochistan\u2019s Larolai district, it\u2019s 5 km from the city</p><p>Q: Okay. In your area, how many people live in each house?</p><p>N: There's a combined family system here. In each house, an average of 15-20 people. In some houses, up to 30-40. I told you the average.</p><p>Q: How much distance is there between each house?</p><p>N: There\u2019s no distances. Attached houses.</p><p>Q: What do people there think about coronavirus? Are they worried about it or not so much? What do you yourself think about it?</p><p>N: Our city is almost Balochistan\u2019s second largest city. Over here, 90% of people don\u2019t accept that coronavirus could even affect them. Some say that yes, coronavirus exists on a world level but not in our city. There\u2019s no case yet in our city.</p><p>Q: Yes, okay. Is there anything being done there to increase social distancing or sanitation?</p><p>N: Government tries it but the public gives no response. Government is tired.</p><p>Q: Ok. What things did the government try to do?</p><p>N: To make shutdown better, the government has tried a lot. Often shops have circles for distance, there\u2019s printed material and wall chalking for awareness</p><p>Q: Meaning of wall chalking?</p><p>N: In villages, spreading awareness about precautionary measures against coronavirus</p><p>Q: Do shops and people follow this? And how strict is the government / police on this? Ok. How do you know about the villages?</p><p>N: [They are strict] to a large extent. I myself live in a village.</p><p>Q: Oh. You live in a village?</p><p>N: Yes</p><p>Q: So people are still following the rules?</p><p>N: Right now, before 5 pm there\u2019s complete freedom. After 5 pm, the government forces all shops to close. For the rest of the village, there\u2019s complete freedom. Because over here, there\u2019s no patient yet so people don\u2019t take it that seriously</p><p>Q: In people\u2019s opinion, should there be more freedom? Before 5 PM all shops are open and after 5 PM all shops are closed?</p><p>N: People say that no one has been affected by it yet so why should there be such strictness. Yes.</p><p>Q: In the shops, are people close together or are they maintaining social distance because of the circles?</p><p>N: They are close together</p><p>Q: But they can\u2019t go to shops after 5 pm? But they can meet their friends outside?</p><p>N: Yes. Only shops are closed. Otherwise, they can meet.</p><p>Q: Over the previous weeks, did you have any interaction with the medical system?</p><p>N: Yes I went [to a hospital]. CMH. 4 times in a week</p><p>Q: For what reason, if you want to say?</p><p>N: My nephew was ill. I took him there.</p><p>Q: What do you think about the hospitals there?</p><p>N: You must already know about CMH. 100 (emoji) was ok.</p><p>Q: What type of illness [about the nephew]</p><p>N: very severe fever. For many years. Even last year, and this year. So I took him for a check up.</p><p>Q: Is he fine now?</p><p>N: yes, yes</p><p>Q: ok</p><p>N: yes</p><p>Q: Are tests being conducted there for coronavirus in hospitals?</p><p>N: Sorry! I don\u2019t know. Maybe they are happening but not confirmed</p><p>Q: Ok</p><p>N: Yes</p><p>Q: So if someone is afraid that they have the virus, what would they do?</p><p>N: For them, there are preparations done by hospitals. They\u2019ll be isolated. Then a test will be done. Government has made isolation wards. In civil hospital</p><p>Q: In your opinion, hospitals / government are able to handle the isolation well?</p><p>N: Yes. Because if in the houses, someone gets the virus, then they can\u2019t provide better isolation. So in my opinion, the hospital will be better.</p><p>Q: In your opinion, do the hospitals have enough masks / tests etc to deal with this situation?</p><p>N: Yes</p><p>Q: Okay. In your area, did you hear of any unexplained sickness or death? Do you know of anyone who might have covid?</p><p>N: No. No deaths in the city. I don\u2019t know anyone personally who has the virus.</p><p>Q: Ok. Are mosques open there?</p><p>N: 100 (emoji)</p><p>Q: If they are open, how often do people go?</p><p>N: it\u2019s pretty obvious 5 times [a day]</p><p>Q: In your opinion, should they remain open?</p><p>N: In my opinion, not in the city. But they should definitely be open in the villages. Because in villages, no one comes from outside. In the city, people come from different areas</p><p>Q: Ok. No one comes from outside to your village?</p><p>N: Very few people come from outside the village</p><p>Q: But visitors from outside do come?</p><p>N: Yes</p><p>Q: Ok. In one mosque, at one time (like for Friday prayers), how many people gather?</p><p>N: Other than Friday prayer, on average 25-30 people. For Friday prayers, more than 150</p><p>Q: And this is without distancing?</p><p>N: Yes</p><p>Q: What do people there think about how to treat covid cases?</p><p>N: There\u2019s no treatment</p><p>Q: What do people think about how to deal with covid cases? Are there any superstitions about this?</p><p>N: Sorry I don\u2019t know about this, what people think.</p><p>Q: Ok, no problem. What do you think about it?</p><p>N: Isolate them, provide a clean environment, give them the medicine etc, with time it will get better</p><p>Q: Ok. Do people there wear masks? Are there any laws about this?</p><p>N: In government offices, people wear masks. Otherwise, 80% of public doesn\u2019t</p><p>Q: People can buy masks in shops?</p><p>N: Yes, they are available in pharmacies</p><p>Q: Do people make masks at home? Have you yourself made / worn a mask?</p><p>N: [about making masks at home] there was no need</p><p>Q: Ok</p><p>N: I wear a mask.

But in your opinion, people have been largely unaffected financially?</p><p>N: Yes.</p><p>Q: What do you think about the Baloch nationalists?</p><p>N: I don\u2019t know about this. In our area, there\u2019s no such thing. Only pashtuns live here.</p><p>Q: Ok. In your opinion, how well is Pakistani government handling the covid situation?</p><p>N: Yes, they\u2019re doing well. To a large extent.</p><p>Q: The Balochistan government as well?</p><p>N: Yes</p><p>Q: What do you think about the quality of CMH hospital?</p><p>N: Very satisfied</p><p>Q: If the virus spread a lot more, do you think the government would still be able to handle it well?</p><p>N: yes, when the public supports the government</p><p>Q: Ok. What do you think the chances are of you or your close relatives getting coronavirus this year?</p><p>N: Very little. This is my opinion but Allah knows best.

He lives in Turbat, Makran in Balochistan. The interview was carried out on the 18th of May of 2020.</p><p>Q: What type of area do you live in? Is it a city or a village?</p><p>M: I live in a city but otherwise my connection is to the rural area Dasht.</p><p>Q: In your area, how many people live in one house?</p><p>M: Minimum five and many have a joint family system as well. From 10-12 people.</p><p>Q: What do people there think of coronavirus? Do they worry about it a lot or not so much? What do you yourself think about it?</p><p>M: People are very worried about this virus. People's daily lives are greatly affected. Shops and markets are closed. The economic condition of the people is ruined. The government has turned lockdown into smart lockdown. But it is not being implemented by the public. Because the government is not helping the people. In Balochistan, there is no test facility in any city except Quetta. So far some cases have been reported in Makran, Gwadar and Panjgur. No cases have been reported in Turbat division.</p><p>Q: Is there anything being done there to increase social distancing and sanitation?</p><p>M: No.</p><p>Q: Are markets open? How crowded are they? Where do people buy food?</p><p>M: The shops are mostly all open here. People do not maintain distancing in the market.</p><p>The shops are closed now after 5 o'clock so there is a lot of crowding before</p><p>Q: Have you visited a hospital in the past few weeks or have any interaction with the medical system or with doctors?</p><p>M: Yes, I went to the hospital. I am in constant contact with doctors every day.</p><p>Q: What is your opinion of the healthcare system? Are there tests happening in your area for covid?</p><p>M: Doctors aren\u2019t doing their duty in government hospitals but private clinics are quite crowded.</p><p>No, there is no test laboratory or facility.</p><p>Q: How often do people get fevers? When was the last time you or a friend had a fever? Do you know the reason for that fever?</p><p>M: I had a fever before Ramadan and recovered in a couple of days. I only took Panadol</p><p>Q: Have you heard of any unexplained illnesses or deaths in your area? Do you know of anyone who you think might have covid-19?</p><p>M: No, this has not happened in our area yet. There isn\u2019t any facility for testing so who knows, someone might have coronavirus.</p><p>Q: Are mosques open there? What do people think about whether the mosques should be open? If the government tries to close mosques, what do you think will happen?</p><p>M: Mosques were closed in the beginning but are now open. People here are against closing mosques</p><p>Q: At one time, how many people gather in a mosque?</p><p>M: On Fridays the mosques are packed and the rest of the time there are are two to four rows</p><p>Q: Is there any local knowledge about how to deal with covid cases? Are there any superstitions about this?</p><p>M: People are self-quarantining. People who are less educated are more worried about this virus. However, educated people are not bothered by this, they just follow the instructions of the doctors</p><p>Q: Do people wear masks there? Are there any laws for this? Are people making masks at home? Have you yourself made or worn a mask?</p><p>M: Yes, they do. I wear masks too. People have made their own masks as well. I haven't made my own. The Balochistan government has prohibited people from going out without wearing a mask.</p><p>Q: Are the people who go out without a mask fined or punished in some way?</p><p>M: No, this doesn\u2019t happen.</p><p>Q: Are people meeting with their friends outside? Or having iftar at home with their friends? Do you think people will gather with their relatives and friends during Eid? By your estimate, what percentage of people wear masks outside?</p><p>M: Yes, definitely we meet our friends every day. Iftar gatherings have also been happening. I have been breaking my fast with a friend every day since Ramadan started. The situation here is that people will gather [for Eid]. 20% of people [wear masks]. There have been many funerals during this time and hundreds of people have attended. Due to corona, religious tendencies have increased. People have started going to mosques more.</p><p>Q: Why so many funerals? Are people falling more ill during this time?</p><p>M: No, because of old age. This is a picture of an iftar today, only two people are wearing masks. [Attached was a photo of 13 men sitting close together, two wearing masks but these weren\u2019t covering their mouth or nose so that they could talk]</p><p>Q: What type of sickness in old age, if you know?</p><p>M: Diabetes, cancer, kidney, liver etc. Tuberculosis. There are no health facilities in Makran at all. Karachi is beyond the reach of the people</p><p>Q: Do any of them require a ventilator?</p><p>M: They do but ventilators are not available in Makran. If necessary, doctors refer the patient to Karachi. Due to lack of facilities, most patients die on the way. Makran does not yet have a good ambulance service, either provided by government or private service.</p><p>Q: Is the number of deaths now greater than, less than or the same as before?</p><p>M: Same as before, there has been no significant increase or decrease in our areas.</p><p>Q: Have people\u2019s jobs been affected due to the virus and the lockdowns?</p><p>M: Government jobs have not been affected, but labourers and daily wagers are worried. People who work in shops are worried. Government employees are living in luxury, they are getting paid and as all the offices are closed, they are on holiday.</p><p>Q: What are the people who\u2019ve lost their jobs doing now?</p><p>M: This has rarely happened in our area. Those who are unemployed now are sitting at home.</p><p>Q: What is your opinion of Baloch nationalists and the army in the area due to the nationalists?</p><p>M: The Pakistan army is present everywhere in Balochistan. Things were very bad a couple years ago, now thank God they are very good. As FC (Frontier Corps) or as something else, but the army is everywhere. The influence of the Baloch Nationalists has diminished. The situation is bad everywhere though, such events keep happening.</p><p>Q: Do you think the situation with the baloch nationalists is going to affect how the epidemic plays out?</p><p>M: No that won\u2019t happen.</p><p>Q: In your opinion, how well is the Pakistani government handling the covid situation? What about the Balochistan government?</p><p>M: Both are not handling it well. Turbat is the second largest city in Balochistan yet there is no testing facility or other arrangements provided by the government. Leave aside ventilators, there aren\u2019t even testing kits.</p><p>Q: How likely do you think it is you or your close relatives will get the coronavirus this year?</p><p>M: I think there is very little chance of that because this has not happened so far here so it isn\u2019t likely.</p><p>Q: Do you have any other thoughts on this you\u2019d like to share?</p><p>M: [A prayer against the virus]</p><p>Q: Thank you so much for taking the time to answer all of this :)</p><p>M: Thank you. We\u2019re willing to help any time with any work or information you require.</p><p>Q: Thank you so much. Bye.</p><p>M: Bye.</p><p>M: Hi. I forgot to mention one thing yesterday. There is a high incidence of intermarriage here, which is why thalassemia is so common. It is also a cause of death in young children. There is no center or facility for thalassemia. These children need blood every fortnight or every month. Because there is no blood bank here, this is also the cause of their death.</p><p>Follow-up question later: Are people moving between cities and cities to the villages, and if so, is it minimal or more or less the same as always?</p><p>Answer: Yes, people are moving from one city to another but movement between cities is less than before. Movement between villages is same as before. The reduction in movement to cities is because of public transport being shut down.</p>", "user": {"username": "NunoSempere"}}, {"_id": "PP8jQFp7FaDieMbid", "title": "Seeking feedback on a MOOC draft plan: Skills for Doing Good Better", "postedAt": "2022-12-16T11:42:51.776Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:100%\"><table style=\"background-color:rgb(20, 20, 20);border-style:double\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 178, 241);border:0.99609pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>This is a&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vHogKj87ZBLgN8TpQ/today-is-draft-amnesty-day-december-16-18\"><strong><u>Draft Amnesty Day</u></strong></a><strong> draft.&nbsp;</strong>That means it\u2019s not polished, it\u2019s probably not up to my standards, the ideas are not perfect, and I haven\u2019t checked everything.

This a draft where I try to practice what I preach. John Walker and I have been exploring ideas for another EA Massively Open Online Course (MOOC). This is currently Plan A.</p><h1><strong>Big-picture intent</strong></h1><h2><strong>Why make a MOOC?</strong></h2><p>There are many great forms of outreach to build the community of people who care about effective altruism and existential risk. In contrast with most approaches, MOOCs provide:</p><ul><li>Authority, via their university affiliation</li><li>Credentials for completion, with a university badge</li><li>Minimal marginal cost per learner, by design</li></ul><p>Designed well, they can provide high-quality, evidence informed learning environments (e.g., with professional multimedia and interactive learning). These resources can feed into the other methods of outreach (e.g., fellowships).</p><h2><strong>Course pitch to learners</strong></h2><ul><li>Many people want to do good with their lives and careers.</li><li>The problem is: many well-intentioned attempts to improve the world are ineffective. Some are even harmful.</li><li>With the right skills, you can have a massive impact on the world.</li><li>This MOOC provides many of those skills.</li><li>Through this course, you\u2019ll learn how to use your time and money to do as much good as possible, and give you a platform to keep learning about how to improve the world.</li></ul><h1><strong>Underlying assumptions</strong></h1><p><i>To be&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/reasoning-transparency/\"><i><u>transparent</u></i></a><i>, most of these assumptions are not based on direct data from the community or general public.

I think this might be relevant to EAs as I've generally perceived there to be quite a lot of skepticism about groups who employ \"radical\" tactics (e.g. disruptive protest) as it might taint a certain field, or otherwise slow overall progress. Whilst this work only answers the public opinion component of this concern, we find that radical tactics can actually increase support for and identification with more moderate organisations working on the same issue - a helpful dynamic. However, it's plausible that this works best for large social movements (e.g. the climate movement) where distinctions between a radical faction and moderate faction are much more clear. That said, we also found some trends towards polarisation that we intend to analyse further.</i></p><h2>Summary</h2><p><a href=\"https://socialchangelab.org/\">Social Change Lab</a> conducted nationally representative YouGov surveys, before and after a week-long campaign by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://juststopoil.org/\"><u>Just Stop Oil</u></a> to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/m25-just-stop-oil-protests-activists-police-b1038930.html\"><u>block the M25 motorway</u></a>. These surveys were conducted longitudinally, by surveying the same people before and after the Just Stop Oil M25 campaign. Our aim was to see if a \u2018radical flank effect\u2019 was at play: did the radical tactics implemented by Just Stop Oil impact attitudes towards more moderate UK climate organisations? We surveyed 1,415 members of the public about their support for climate policies and support for and identification with a more moderate climate organisation (Friends of the Earth).&nbsp;<strong>We detected a positive radical flank effect, whereby increased awareness of Just Stop Oil resulted in increased support for and identification with Friends of the Earth</strong> (p=0.004 and p=0.007 respectively)<strong>.</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p>We believe this is the first time the radical flank effect has been observed empirically using large-scale nationally representative polling, and it corroborates previous experimental findings by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/1/3/pgac110/6633666\"><u>Simpson et al.

How these different factions interact and what an \u2018optimal\u2019 pursuit of different tactics might look like are currently open questions. One way to compare factions is to look at how radical their tactics are - that is, the extent to which they break social norms or cause disruption. The \u2018Radical Flank Effect\u2019 (RFE), coined by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://irasilver.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Reading-Movement-funding-Haines.pdf\"><u>Haines (1984)</u></a>, is a theory of how more radical factions of a movement might impact more moderate factions. The RFE can be positive, whereby radical tactics&nbsp;<i>increase&nbsp;</i>support for more moderate groups, or negative, whereby radical tactics&nbsp;<i>decrease&nbsp;</i>support for the moderates. There has been little empirical work which looks directly at the RFE and the extent and direction (positive or negative) of its effect.&nbsp;</p><p>Those who argue for a positive radical flank effect claim that more radical groups make moderate groups seem more palatable by comparison. Within social movement advocacy, this strategy is also referred to as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://beautifultrouble.org/toolbox/tool/use-your-radical-fringe-to-shift-the-overton-window/\"><u>shifting the Overton Window</u></a>. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://irasilver.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Reading-Movement-funding-Haines.pdf\"><u>Haines (1984)</u></a> who analysed the funding of major civil flights organisations in the US in the 1960s, claims that the existence of more radical black organisations (such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/southern-christian-leadership-conference-sclc\"><u>Southern Christian Leadership Conference</u></a>, led by Martin Luther King) led to an increase in funding for more moderate black organisations, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://naacp.org/\"><u>NAACP</u></a>, by white groups. Haines claims that, contrary to popular belief, there was no \u201cwhite backlash\u201d due to radical black organisations, but instead an influx of donations from white groups to moderate black organisations. Similarly, in experimental studies of the RFE looking at both climate and animal advocacy movements,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/1/3/pgac110/6633666\"><u>Simpson et al. (2022</u></a>) show that radical tactics can increase support for more moderate factions, through people identifying more with those moderate positions.&nbsp;</p><p>Proponents of the negative radical flank effect, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Matthew-Feinberg-2/publication/338562538_The_activist's_dilemma_Extreme_protest_actions_reduce_popular_support_for_social_movements/links/5ea5eff892851c1a90728bd5/The-activists-dilemma-Extreme-protest-actions-reduce-popular-support-for-social-movements.pdf\"><u>Feinberg et al. (2019)</u></a>, suggest that extreme actions can alienate people and reduce identification with a movement. This effect can extend even to moderate groups, and so reduce overall support for a movement. Others, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26964733#metadata_info_tab_contents\"><u>Ellefsen &amp; Busher (2020)</u></a> show that radical tactics can have other negative consequences, such as increased repression for a social movement.</p><p>As mentioned, there has been little empirical work on the impact of the radical flank effect. Whilst&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/1/3/pgac110/6633666\"><u>Simpson et al. (2022</u></a>) finds experimental support for a positive RFE, it is not clear how well these findings extend to the real world. To our knowledge, there has been no attempt to measure the radical flank effect through large-scale nationally representative public opinion polling, for an ongoing campaign using radical tactics. Using a recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://juststopoil.org/\"><u>Just Stop Oil</u></a> campaign in the UK, we sought to gain a clear understanding of the radical flank effect in practice.&nbsp;</p><p>Understanding the radical flank effect is particularly important now, since radical tactics are being used more and more, particularly by the climate movement. For example, since Extinction Rebellion\u2019s conception in 2018, there has been a wave of new organisations such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://juststopoil.org/\"><u>Just Stop Oil</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://letztegeneration.de/en/\"><u>Last Generation</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://save-old-growth.ca/\"><u>Save Old Growth</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fireproof.news/\"><u>Fireproof Australia</u></a> and more, who use civil disobedience and disruptive tactics to progress action on climate change. There is also an umbrella organisation, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://a22network.org/en/\"><u>A22 Network</u></a>, which is a coalition of international climate groups pursuing disruptive nonviolent direct action as a key strategy. In addition, new funders, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.climateemergencyfund.org/\"><u>Climate Emergency Fund</u></a>, are increasingly funding this radical flank of the climate movement.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Methodology (synthesised)</h2><p>We conducted a nationally representative survey, through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/\"><u>YouGov</u></a>, before and after a large direct action campaign by Just Stop Oil. The specific campaign by Just Stop Oil involved a week of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/m25-just-stop-oil-protests-activists-police-b1038930.html\"><u>blockading the M25 motorway</u></a> that surrounds London. The campaign ran from Monday 7th November to Friday 11th November. Some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/just-stop-oil-supporter-swansea-25499276\"><u>media coverage also persisted</u></a> after the end of the campaign.&nbsp;</p><p>This campaign was chosen for several reasons:</p><ul><li>First, we were informed this campaign would be happening on these dates. This meant we could conduct polling before the campaign began and measure baseline attitudes to Just Stop Oil, Friends of the Earth (the moderate faction), and other relevant metrics, such as support for climate policies.&nbsp;</li><li>Secondly, Just Stop Oil protests are often disruptive and receive high levels of media and public attention. For instance, our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.socialchangelab.org/_files/ugd/503ba4_db9ae9e6d8674810ba65fbb193867660.pdf\"><u>April polling for Just Stop Oil</u></a> found that over 60% of the UK public had heard of them. Their recent protest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/damiengayle/status/1580864210741133312\"><u>throwing soup</u></a> at a Van Gogh painting was watched almost 50 million times on Twitter. High levels of campaign awareness are essential to detect the sort of population-level effects we are looking for.&nbsp;</li><li>Thirdly, we knew this campaign was short (around a week) and clearly defined. This was important to reduce the impact of external factors which might also have an influence.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br>Our survey was conducted longitudinally, such that the same participants were contacted before and after the campaign. Our first survey on Friday 4th November had 1741 respondents, whilst our second, starting on Monday 14th and concluding on Monday 21st, had 1415 respondents. This equates to an overall retention rate of 81.3%.</p><p>Our key research questions were:</p><ol><li>Will increased awareness of Just Stop Oil, the radical faction, lead to increased identification with Friends of the Earth, the moderate faction?</li><li>Will increased awareness of Just Stop Oil lead to higher levels of support for Friends of the Earth?</li><li>Will increased awareness of Just Stop Oil lead to any change in support for climate policies?</li></ol><p>Further information about our analyses and methodology can be seen in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aspredicted.org/DWD_KZ4\"><u>pre-registration</u></a>.

The first set of analyses uses linear mixed effects models, a type of regression analysis that allows researchers to model variability within and between participants and items (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2515245920960351\"><u>Brown, 2021</u></a> for an accessible introduction). The second set of analyses focused on the change in people\u2019s responses before and after the protests - that is, one data point per respondent; this analysis involved conventional linear regression.</p><p>To correct for multiple comparisons within the six main analyses (two sets of three), we used Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction (Benjamini &amp; Hochberg, 1995).<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Results (synthesised)</h2><p><strong>Causal effects related to changes in awareness of Just Stop Oil due to the M25 protests</strong></p><p>Just Stop Oil\u2019s M25 protests were deliberately disruptive and received a lot of media attention.&nbsp;<strong>A striking 92.3% of respondents claimed to have heard at least to some extent about Just Stop Oil at T2</strong>. As such, it is plausible that they had an effect on people\u2019s knowledge of and attitudes towards Just Stop Oil itself, as well as to Friends of the Earth (through the radical flank effect) and to climate policies more generally. Our results showed that from T1 (just before the protests) to T2 (just after the protests) there was an increase in the awareness of Just Stop Oil (T1 mean=2.71, T2 mean=2.92,&nbsp; p&lt;0.001), an increase in people\u2019s identification with (T1 mean=3.98, T2 mean=4.06, p=0.03) and support for Friends of the Earth (T1 mean=4.35, T2 mean=4.41, p=0.03), and increased support for climate policies (T1 mean=4.28, T2 mean=4.49, p&lt;0.001).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>This allowed us to look at whether people who were more aware of Just Stop Oil after the M25 campaign tended to identify more with Friends of the Earth and feel more supportive towards them. In doing this, we can be reasonably sure we are directly testing a radical flank effect: the two time points were only 10-15 days apart (depending on when participants completed the follow-up survey) which makes it very likely that any difference between those times is due to the protests (see the&nbsp;<u>Limitations</u> section for discussion).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>We calculated difference scores for each variable (T2 minus T1), such that positive numbers reflect an increase over time and negative numbers reflect a decrease. In support of a positive RFE, linear regression analyses showed that increases in awareness of Just Stop Oil were linked with increases in identification with (estimate=0.14, SE=0.05, t=3.06, p=0.004) and support for Friends of the Earth (estimate=0.09, SE=0.03, t=2.79, p=0.007).&nbsp;<strong>In lay terms, this means there is a 0.4-0.7% chance that we observed results as extreme as this if no positive radical flank existed.&nbsp;</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671449227/mirroredImages/LXj4cs5dLqDHwJynp/zqoweqibhjwjkyvpb2im.png\"></p><p><i><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Effects related to changes in Just Stop Oil\u2019s awareness.

We also tested whether increased awareness of Just Stop Oil was associated with stronger support for&nbsp; climate policies. This was not the case. Instead, in both types of analysis there was a non-significant trend towards a negative association (analysis 1 looking at overall effects: estimate=-0.05, SE=0.03, t=-1.73, p=0.10; analysis 2 looking at relative differences from before to after the campaign: estimate=-0.05, SE=0.04, t=-1.32, p=0.19).<strong> Overall, regardless of the change in awareness for Just Stop Oil, support for climate policies increased by a statistically significant amount between T1 and T2.&nbsp;</strong>We suggest that the media coverage around COP27 is likely to have been responsible for this increase (see&nbsp;<u>Limitations</u> section). When we looked at whether an increased awareness of JSO was associated with this stronger support for climate policy, we found that it was not. We discuss this counterintuitive combination of findings below..</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These results indicate that a group utilising radical tactics may bring about two opposite effects concurrently. On the one hand, higher overall levels of awareness of Just Stop Oil were associated with stronger identification with and support for Friends of the Earth. More importantly, increased awareness of Just Stop Oil after a week of protests was associated with increased identification with and support for Friends of the Earth, a clear illustration of the&nbsp;<i>positive&nbsp;</i>radical flank effect. On the other hand, in both analyses (that is, looking at overall levels and at change between T1 and T2), there was a non-significant trend towards a&nbsp;<i>negative&nbsp;</i>effect on support for climate policies.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Why does increased identification with and support for Friends of the Earth not translate to support for climate policies? We might predict that it would, since the goals of Friends of the Earth resemble the climate policies people were asked about in the survey. Indeed, overall identification with and support for Friends of the Earth is correlated with support for climate policies in this survey. This initially confusing pattern can be explained by the fact that the overall results obscure what is going on for particular sub groups, whose behaviour is affected in different ways (see figure 4 below). To elaborate: generally, support for Friends of the Earth is linked with support for climate policies. Increased awareness of Just Stop Oil increases support for Friends of the Earth in some people and this likely also increases support for climate policies in those people. However, the relationship between these two factors is modest (see Figure 1, left and middle panels). This means that for many people, greater awareness of Just Stop Oil was&nbsp;<i>not</i> associated with greater support for Friends of the Earth. For these people, increased awareness of Just Stop Oil tends either to have no effect or to have a slightly negative effect on their support for climate policies. In both analyses (looking at overall levels and relative differences between T1 and T2), we see a possible negative effect specifically for people with overall low identification with Friends of the Earth and low support for climate policies (see bottom left panel in Figure 2). These are likely people who are generally more sceptical about climate change and about organisations working on it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This suggests that a backfire effect of radical tactics might specifically exist for people who are more sceptical about the need to address climate change in the first place. We see an opposite trend for people who have high identification with Friends of the Earth to start with; for them, increased awareness of Just Stop Oil may lead them to support climate policies more (bottom right panel of Figure 4). A follow-up analysis showed that the effect of overall awareness of Just Stop Oil on overall support for climate policies (Figure 4, top part) was significantly modulated by the degree of identification with Friends of the Earth (interaction: p&lt;0.001). Even though an equivalent analysis looking at the effect of changes in awareness of Just Stop Oil and changes in support for climate policies showed a similar trend (Figure 4, bottom), it was not statistically significant (interaction: p=0.14). From this, it seems that Just Stop Oil generates a small degree of polarisation, such that people who are already unsupportive of climate policies marginally reduce their support, and people who are already supportive, marginally increase their support. However, our data show these trends as quite weak in this particular campaign, so we are unsure about the extent of this effect.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671449228/mirroredImages/LXj4cs5dLqDHwJynp/tj1buctmpzqhdvtdmnun.png\"></p><p><i><strong>Figure 4</strong>: Top row: Relation between overall awareness of Just Stop Oil and support for climate policies, plotted separately for people with low, medium, or high overall identification with Friends of the Earth.

For example, the protests we studied here presented a unique opportunity to investigate the previously hypothesised RFE in a large-scale nationally representative polling study, looking at a widely known ongoing campaign utilising radical tactics. However, the observational nature of the study also has disadvantages. COP27 was held from 6-18 November 2022 and thus overlapped with the JSO protests studied here. Media coverage of COP27 likely influenced responses in the survey, which was fielded on 4th of November and mostly completed by 18th November. For example, it is possible that COP27 coverage is the main reason that overall support for climate policies rose. Is it possible that what appears to be a positive RFE was actually due heightened attention on climate issues due to COP27? We think that overall increases in support for climate policies and increased support for Friends of the Earth could be attributed to COP27. However, awareness of Just Stop Oil was specifically linked with support for Friends of the Earth and not with support for climate policies more generally. This points to an independent effect: knowing more about Just Stop Oil leads the public to support Friends of the Earth more.&nbsp;</p><p>We plan to investigate this question further by analysing the amount of UK media coverage received by Just Stop Oil and COP27, to form estimates of the likelihood that changes in our variables were due to COP27 rather than the Just Stop Oil protests. Our conclusions about the finding of a RFE would also be strengthened by additional studies testing the RFE in different sociopolitical contexts.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Generalisability to other tactics</strong></p><p>A second limitation concerns generalisability. Here, we focused on a particular week of protests, in which JSO blockaded the M25 by climbing on top of motorway gantries. This is a very particular kind of protest, involving very small numbers of people (often 1-2 people per gantry) causing a large amount of disruption to the public. It is hard to know whether we would observe a similar radical flank effect for different types of protests, with different numbers, different direct effects on the public, and so on. Throwing soup at paintings and blocking oil refineries are just two recent examples of very different kinds of radical actions. It is also unclear whether parallel negative effects might be seen: would a similar negative correlation (albeit a non-significant one) be seen between support for climate policies and awareness of other radical groups? Our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.socialchangelab.org/_files/ugd/503ba4_db9ae9e6d8674810ba65fbb193867660.pdf\"><u>previous polling about Just Stop Oil</u></a> in April found no negative impact on support for climate policies. We speculate that this is because the April campaign focused on blockading oil depots and oil infrastructure, involved larger numbers and caused less direct disruption to the general public. Future studies using experimental and observational methods are needed to shed light on these sorts of questions.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Limitations of the study\u2019s design</strong></p><p>As our survey was a longitudinal study, it involved recontacting the same set of people for a follow-up survey. This has several implications that may affect some of our results, with the foremost issue being our finding that 92% of people had heard of Just Stop Oil after the M25 campaign. Whilst unlikely, it\u2019s possible that the increase in awareness (from 87% to 92% of the UK population) of Just Stop Oil was partly due to participants remembering something about Just Stop Oil from our survey, consciously or subconsciously. As a result, this 92% might be slightly inflated, although we think this is neither a crucial finding nor likely to be a large effect, as participants probably understood us to mean if they had heard of Just Stop Oil, in the \u2018real world\u2019. Moreover, participation in our first survey might have meant that participants were more interested than normal in JSO\u2019s activities, so they might have followed it more closely on the news or social media. As a result, our sample could have higher awareness of Just Stop Oil relative to the general population.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, it\u2019s plausible that our survey served as a treatment in an experiment, by exposing people to both moderate and radical climate organisations back-to-back, such that the difference between them appears more stark. As a result, we might not expect to find results this extreme if not directly comparing Friends of the Earth to Just Stop Oil.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Discussion &amp; Conclusion</h2><p>Protest-focused social movements use a range of tactics in the hope of convincing other people of their cause with the ultimate goal of bringing about social change. It is still unclear what effects radical tactics have and the balance between positive and negative effects. Here, we focused on the radical flank effect, which proposes that disruptive activities of a radical faction alter support for more moderate groups in the same broader movement. Our results show that the extent to which people were aware of Just Stop Oil, a group employing radical protest tactics, affected their support for and identification with Friends of the Earth, a moderate group within the broader climate movement. Such a positive radical flank effect was observed in recent experimental research (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/1/3/pgac110/6633666\"><u>Simpson et al., 2022</u></a>). Experimental and observational studies have complementary strengths and weaknesses; experimental work is highly controlled and better able to rule out confounding factors and isolate specific active ingredients, while observational work can test how a certain phenomenon occurs in the real world, in the context of real protest movements. Convergence of results across research methods increases confidence in findings.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>The radical flank effect we observed here was quite specific: awareness of Just Stop Oil was associated with increased identification with and support for Friends of the Earth but did not have a similar effect on support for climate policies. Instead, and particularly for people with low levels of support for climate policies to begin with, Just Stop Oil appeared to have had a slight negative effect on their climate attitudes. Specifically, it seems there was some polarisation generated by this campaign: people who were initially not very supportive of climate policies moved to support climate policies less, while those who were already supportive of climate policies trended in the opposite direction. This might be due to the specific tactics used by Just Stop Oil in this week-long campaign, which deployed small numbers of people to blockade a key UK motorway - a controversial tactic. We would like to repeat that this pattern was quite tentative and point out that in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.socialchangelab.org/_files/ugd/503ba4_db9ae9e6d8674810ba65fbb193867660.pdf\"><u>previous polling for Just Stop Oil</u></a>, we found no negative impact on support for climate policies when large numbers of protesters targeted oil depots. Thus, more work is required to understand whether and in which circumstances polarisation and/or backfire effects due to radical tactics can occur.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>We did not see a relationship between people\u2019s awareness of Just Stop Oil and the extent to which they would be willing to act for Friends of the Earth (sign a petition, donate, or participate in an event). Thus, even though radical tactics may lead to more positive attitudes towards moderate factions, it is not entirely clear how this translates into tangible behavioural change. It is possible, though we cannot know without further research, that other effects develop over time. For instance, Just Stop Oil\u2019s radical activities are likely to catalyse public debate of climate issues. To the extent that this leads to people becoming more informed about climate change, this could plausibly lead to higher degrees of concern for climate issues; previous research demonstrated that knowledge is an important driver of concern for climate change&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ask-force.org/web/Global-Warming/Milfont-Interplay-Knowledge-Perceived-Efficacy-Concern-2012.pdf\"><u>(Milfont, 2012</u></a>). On the other hand, the lack of change in willingness to take climate action could be down to the tactics used. Whilst we didn\u2019t see any changes in willingness to act for the M25 blockades, we did for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.socialchangelab.org/_files/ugd/503ba4_db9ae9e6d8674810ba65fbb193867660.pdf\"><u>Just Stop Oil\u2019s campaign in April 2022</u></a> which directly targeted oil depots and other oil infrastructure. It is plausible that extremely high levels of public disruption were seen as less legitimate by the public, as opposed to targeted disruption of the oil industry, which in turn nullified any potential mobilising effects.</p><h2>Contact us</h2><p>We would appreciate any and all feedback on this, so please do leave comments below or reach out to us!

Brendan rightly points out that stunting can be due to malnutrition and &nbsp;any claim that Indians are shorter than Americans should be treated with caution as societal reasons are causally related.

The authors pooled Hb thresholds across studies and countries and arrived at \u201c<strong>multinational estimates of Hb fifth percentile were 1.35 and 1.19 g/dL lower than the current WHO Hb cutoffs</strong> for defining anemia among preschool children and nonpregnant women\u201d.</li></ul><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671184670/mirroredImages/zAprZJhBCDscDHGWs/yi6fqespvckogcdz3grk.png\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X21000772\">Sachdev, 2021</a> focused specifically on Indian adolescents and used the distribution of hemoglobin in a healthy subpopulation to arrive at percentile-derived thresholds. Based on these thresholds, they argue that anemia prevalence among Indian adolescents is lower than generally estimated (and the same logic likely applies for Indian adults as I argue in posts 1. and 2.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Do hemoglobin differences result from biological or societal factors?</h3><p>A key question that Brendan raises and that applies to both these studies is - how do we know if a subpopulation is as healthy as they would be under ideal societal conditions? Both papers rely on criteria based on the absence of disease, inflammation and vitamin deficiencies, Brendan comments that \u201cit is not clear [to me] that those who remain would not be healthier if they had higher hemoglobin levels\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>One way we could get at whether hemoglobin levels naturally vary in populations of healthy people is by<strong> looking at a multiethnic population.&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>For instance, it could be useful to look at hemoglobin levels amongst White and Asian populations in the United States. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4578165/\"><u>Lim 2015</u></a> looked at reference intervals for various biochemical tests, including hemoglobin, amongst different ethnic groups - Whites, Asians, Hispanics, and Blacks - focusing on self-reported healthy individuals. They found that -&nbsp; \u201c<strong>Compared to Whites, Asians have lower RIs</strong> in creatinine,&nbsp;<strong>hematocrit, hemoglobin, mean cell hemoglobin</strong>, MCHC, and mean platelet volume and higher normal ranges in globulin and total protein.\u201d&nbsp;</li><li>While the study did not control for socio-economic status (SES), it\u2019s worth noting that Asians as a monolithic group have higher incomes than Whites, which can be used as a rough proxy for access to quality healthcare/nutrition that could skew results.<ul><li>Note that the broad ethnic characterization of ethnicities as well as the self-report nature of the study prevents any strong conclusions. In particular, as Brendan noted, meat-eating can be an important factor in hemoglobin levels, and it\u2019s possible that the Asian group in the study was skewed towards vegetarianism/veganism. However, except for Indians (~30% of whom tend to be vegetarian), most Asians eat meat and Indian-Americans make up ~20% of Asians.

Although clinical outcomes were not available in this work, we modeled Hb to sTfR concentrations, which physiologically reflect erythropoiesis. The curves of Hb-sTfR concentrations indicate<strong> distinct curvilinear and linear erythropoietic drive phases when Hb values are below a threshold (9.61 g/dL in children and 11.01 g/dL in women</strong>). The&nbsp;<strong>linear erythropoietic drive phase describes the expected compensatory physiological response to anemia</strong>, including increased tissue demand for iron and increased erythroid in the bone marrow. The&nbsp;<strong>physiological Hb-sTfR curves support the use of a pooled multinational Hb fifth percentile for defining anemia, as opposed to adopting Hb estimates that are specific to a survey, country, or race/ethnicity, </strong>which could lead to proliferation of multiple different Hb cutoffs and, thus, complicate their clinical application and global disease burden quantification, among other factors. W<strong>e found that in both preschool children and women, regardless of Hb distribution, the population fifth percentile Hb was lower than 9.61 g/dL and 11.01 g/dL</strong>,<strong> indicating that tissue ID has already ensued</strong> The Hb fifth percentile derived in this analysis may reflect the development of anemia apparently caused by ID.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Re-evaluating past studies in light of new thresholds&nbsp;</h3><p>In a conversation I had with Brendan, he pointed out an interesting point I'd missed.

In this context:</p><p><i>Contributors</i> would be civil servants and supporting staff etc. Progress in optimising the number of contributors might be tracked, for example, by surveying the heads of government departments to track how well different categories of human resources needs were met. Groups of potential recruits could also be surveyed/engaged to see whether they all knew of key opportunities and incentives to work in government.</p><p><i>Contributions</i> are the amount of time (and performance within that time) that civil servants and supporting staff contribute to the government. Progress might be tracked, for example, by surveying a representative sample of relevant civil servants to understand if their work is being hindered by addressable issues (e.g., bad equipment or mental health). Progress might also be measured by tracking metrics such as total employee hours committed to projects, sick leave, and projects completed.</p><p><i>Coordination</i> is the extent to which these individual contributions converge to efficiently achieve the outcomes that the government desires. We might track progress in optimising coordination by (for example) surveying the heads of similar government departments to track how well they understand each other\u2019s goals and projects, and/or a representative sample of relevant civil servants to test awareness and understanding of key concepts, projects or directives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Clarifications</h2><h3>These factors/outcomes track progress in movement building, not necessarily progress in AI safety&nbsp;</h3><p>Success in movement building will only reduce the risk of AI related catastrophe&nbsp;<i>if&nbsp;</i>the AI Safety community and its constituent groups have good strategies.

However, I decided to divide productivity into \u2018contributions\u2019 and \u2018coordination\u2019 because a focus on productivity could mislead readers into focussing too much on individual researchers: for example, \u2018does Person X have good physical and mental health and the technology they need to do many regular hours of focused work?\u2019. This could lead them to overlook more abstract and systemic issues that impact productivity: for example, \u2018Does Person X know/understand the ideal theory of change, and have access to similarly-aligned mentors, networks, and collaborators?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Feedback</h2><p>Does this all seem useful, correct and/or optimal?

Extraordinary altruists were less likely than controls to believe that humans can be truly evil. Results persisted after controlling for trait empathy and religiosity. Belief in pure good was not associated with extraordinary altruism. We found no differences in the religiosity and spirituality of extraordinary altruists compared to controls. Findings suggest that highly altruistic individuals believe that others deserve help regardless of their potential moral shortcomings.

In this review we provide an evidence-based heuristic for guiding efforts to share science-based information about climate change with decision makers and the public at large. Well-informed decision makers are likely to make better decisions, but for a range of reasons, their inclinations to act on their decisions are not always realized into effective actions. We therefore also provide a second evidence-based heuristic for helping people and organizations change their climate change\u2013relevant behaviors, should they decide to. These two guiding heuristics can help scientists and others harness the power of communication and behavior science in service of enhancing society's response to climate change.</p><p><br>Many Earth scientists seeking to contribute to the climate science translation process feel frustrated by the inadequacy of the societal response.&nbsp;Here we summarize the social science literature by offering two guiding principles to guide communication and behavior change efforts.&nbsp;To improve public understanding, we recommend simple, clear messages, repeated often, by a variety of trusted and caring messengers.&nbsp;To encourage uptake of useful behaviors, we recommend making the behaviors easy, fun, and popular.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><p><a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0273971&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_ea_behavioral_science_newsletter_december_2022_7&amp;utm_term=2022-12-07#abstract0\"><u>Sure-thing vs. probabilistic charitable giving: Experimental evidence on the role of individual differences in risky and ambiguous charitable decision-making</u></a></p><p><i>Philipp Schoenegger &amp;&nbsp;Miguel Costa-Gomes</i></p><p>PLOS ONE (2022)</p><p>---</p><p>Charities differ, among other things, alongside the likelihood that their interventions succeed and produce the desired outcomes and alongside the extent that such likelihood can even be articulated numerically. In this paper, we investigate what best explains charitable giving behaviour regarding charities that have interventions that will succeed with a quantifiable and high probability (sure-thing charities) and charities that have interventions that only have a small and hard to quantify probability of bringing about the desired end (probabilistic charities). We study individual differences in risk/ambiguity attitudes, empathy, numeracy, optimism, and donor type (warm glow vs. pure altruistic donor type) as potential predictors of this choice.</p><p><br>We conduct a money incentivised, pre-registered experiment on Prolific on a representative UK sample (n = 1,506) to investigate participant choices (i) between these two types of charities and (ii) about one randomly selected charity. Overall, we find little to no evidence that individual differences predict choices regarding decisions about sure-thing and probabilistic charities, with the exception that a purely altruistic donor type predicts donations to probabilistic charities when participants were presented with a randomly selected charity in (ii). Conducting exploratory equivalence tests, we find that the data provide robust evidence in favour of the absence of an effect (or a negligibly small effect) where we fail to reject the null. This is corroborated by exploratory Bayesian analyses. We take this paper to be contributing to the literature on charitable giving via this comprehensive null-result in pursuit of contributing to a cumulative science.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Other publications</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224545.2022.2140024?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_ea_behavioral_science_newsletter_december_2022_7&amp;utm_term=2022-12-07\"><u>The relationship between attitudes to human rights and to animal rights is partially mediated by empathy</u></a>,&nbsp;<i>Anna Stone,&nbsp;</i>The Journal of Social Psychology (2022)</li><li><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/08997640221129541?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=the_ea_behavioral_science_newsletter_december_2022_7&amp;utm_term=2022-12-07\"><u>Nonprofit Scandals: A Systematic Review and Conceptual Framework</u></a>,&nbsp;<i>Cassandra M.

Assistant</p><p>Tom Hird \u2014 Senior Research Manager</p><p>Melanie Basnak \u2014 Senior Research Manager</p><p><i>The purpose of this report is to provide a rigorous overview of the research and uncertainties in relation to REDD+, given disagreements and inconsistencies in the EA perspective on anti-deforestation initiatives (particularly the Coalition for Rainforest Nations) in the past. This preliminary evaluation of the intervention does not include recommendations for funding particular organizations, nor does it sit within a wider portfolio of such evaluations that would allow for comparisons in cost-effectiveness across similarly evaluated climate interventions. The research was commissioned by a client who sought an unbiased and academic research-driven perspective on the promise of anti-deforestation initiatives. We opted to focus our investigation on REDD+, since it is both the intervention that CfRN proposed and seemingly one of the most tractable anti-deforestation solutions of which we are aware. There was no direct communication between the researchers and the client \u2014 who remains anonymous to the researchers \u2014 for the duration of the project. We conducted a vast majority of the research in Q1 and Q2 2022, and we have not updated the research to reflect changes in the global landscape nor other research/publications since then.</i></p><h1>Editorial note</h1><p>This report is the&nbsp;first&nbsp;part of a two-part series&nbsp;on anti-deforestation initiatives. The overall project was commissioned by an anonymous donor.</p><p>This report examines the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of the REDD+&nbsp;framework for reducing forest loss and degradation and for abating CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions that contribute to climate change. We first investigate the overall effectiveness of payments for ecosystem services (PES) programs, the broad category of environmental interventions into which REDD+ falls. We then evaluate REDD+ with respect to the issues that plague PES programs in general, and spotlight jurisdictional REDD+ (i.e., as implemented consistently within a state or country) as a promising solution. Finally, we estimate with 80% confidence that the cost-effectiveness of REDD+ falls within the range of $6-$62&nbsp;per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;abated.</p><p>We have tried to flag major sources of uncertainty in the report and are open to revising our views as more information becomes available.</p><h1><strong>Epistemic status</strong></h1><p><strong>Updated as of June 2023</strong></p><p>We first published this report in December 2022. In March 2023, Dr. Matthew Dahlhausen of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory pointed out in a Slack post that our treatment of permanence required more nuance, since permanence can be assessed on different timescales. We have since had a constructive conversation with Dr. Dahlhausen, after which he sent us a more thorough written assessment of the issue. In total, we have engaged with his collective feedback for about three to four hours. We <a href=\"https://carbonplan.org/research/permanence-calculator-explainer\">read more about</a> and deployed the <a href=\"https://carbonplan.org/research/permanence-calculator\">CarbonPlan permanence calculator</a> in an attempt to understand how our cost-effectiveness estimates might be affected by stretching the relevant timescale of emissions reductions to 1000 years, as opposed to 100 years. The cost-effectiveness of the lower bound of our estimate range increases substantially when we consider a 1000-year timescale (from $6/tCO2 to $206/tCO2, assuming no risk of reversal, availability of permanent removal technologies costing $200 from 2050, and a discount rate of 0%). Given general uncertainty over the relevant timescale, Dr. Dahlhausen\u2019s point has therefore reduced our confidence in our estimated cost-effectiveness range.</p><p>We also engaged with his more thorough critique, which we do not currently have the time to satisfactorily assess nor respond to with commensurate updates to our report, though we agree that they likely lead to potentially much more uncertainty and a wider cost-effectiveness estimate range. We also agree with his take that assessing cost effectiveness for anti-deforestation is extremely complicated, and there is not an easy fix. Based on our interview with McKinsey and the methodological <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/sustainability/our%20insights/why%20investing%20in%20nature%20is%20key%20to%20climate%20mitigation/nature-and-net-zero-appendix-vf.pdf\">appendix</a> to their Nature and Net Zero report (on which we rely heavily for cost-effectiveness estimates), we are not confident that Dr. Dahlhausen\u2019s critiques are adequately addressed in their modeling, though it is possible they will address these concerns in the future in collaboration with the <a href=\"https://leafcoalition.org/\">LEAF Coalition</a>. We remain sympathetic to the view that anti-deforestation measures are a potentially important \u201cinterim\u201d and \u201cenabling solution\u201d until more permanent emissions reductions become less costly to achieve (<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%20functions/sustainability/our%20insights/why%20investing%20in%20nature%20is%20key%20to%20climate%20mitigation/nature-and-net-zero-vf.pdf\">McKinsey 2021</a>, p. 30, Box 11), and we hope to have an opportunity to engage more deeply with Dr. Dahlhausen\u2019s critiques in the future.</p><h1>Key takeaways</h1><ul><li>Based largely on a 2021 consultation report by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and McKinsey &amp; Company, <strong>we are fairly (~80%) confident</strong>&nbsp;<strong>that</strong>&nbsp;<strong>the majority of emissions reductions from REDD+ over the next decade would cost $6-$62 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;(tCO<sub>2</sub>)</strong>. Despite ongoing implementation issues, REDD+ therefore represents a cost-effective abatement strategy in the near term (e.g., next 10 years), though not as cost-effective as previously claimed by EA organizations.</li><li>The ranking of climate change solutions in terms of cost-effectiveness will change over time, as low-hanging fruit is exhausted and technological innovation continues to increase the economic competitiveness of currently high-cost solutions. <strong>In the near term, anti-deforestation is a particularly salient mitigation approach since emissions from deforestation are irreversible. Implementation is immediately actionable</strong>&nbsp;(with several promising outlets for funding) <strong>and</strong>&nbsp;<strong>cost-effective compared to direct air capture, another popular carbon removal approach.</strong>&nbsp;Moreover, we would not expect market forces alone to slow deforestation in the coming decades.</li><li>REDD+ credits accounted for about 80% of forest and land-use related voluntary carbon offsets in 2019. <strong>There is still substantial room for more funding in this space, in the high tens to low hundreds of billions of dollars annually over the next decade.</strong></li><li><strong>The three core issues facing REDD+ are additionality, permanence, and leakage.</strong><ul><li>Our rough cost-effectiveness estimate adjusts WEF&nbsp;and McKinsey\u2019s cost-effectiveness&nbsp;estimates to reflect findings from the literature regarding each of these issues.</li><li>Different carbon standards have varying ways to account for these problems, and ultimately REDD+ schemes may be somewhat higher quality than average due to strict requirements for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV), and the need for certification.</li></ul></li><li>With respect to MRV of emissions reductions, the primary issue appears to be the under-detection of forest degradation (e.g., selective tree cutting), an issue that appears surmountable with high-resolution satellite data.</li><li><strong>We believe jurisdictional REDD+ \u2014 i.e., an emerging framework with consistent carbon baselines and crediting for all REDD+ projects within a given jurisdiction (e.g., a subnational region or a country) \u2014 is a promising intervention that can be high-impact and cost-effective, particularly if certain conditions are met.</strong>&nbsp;These conditions include:<ul><li>Existence of a credible signal of sustained demand for high-quality credit supply</li><li>Incentives for effective government participation</li><li>Continued innovations and improvements in the development of market architecture, infrastructure, and financing</li><li>Establishment of a clear regulatory framework to align the market for forest credits with the goals of the Paris Agreement</li></ul></li><li>We are not confident that recent advancements in REDD+ contracting will adequately address the issue of low credit prices, which have led to concerns about equity and incentive compatibility.</li><li><strong>We lack a consensus framework to compare anti-deforestation with other potential charitable interventions.</strong>&nbsp;Without a comprehensive understanding of cost-effectiveness across climate interventions, it is impossible for us to say whether funding REDD+ is the <i>most</i>&nbsp;cost-effective climate intervention. Additionally, without a means by which to compare the impact of climate interventions with non-climate interventions in, say, global health or poverty reduction, it is highly difficult to incorporate the opportunity cost of funds toward REDD+. We hope to see progress along both of these dimensions in future research in the effective altruism community.</li></ul><h1>An introduction to REDD+</h1><p>REDD+ is an international framework negotiated under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and endorsed in the Paris Agreement to include forest-related emissions in reaching global climate change mitigation goals, given forests\u2019 important environmental role as carbon stores and sinks.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefspr9z5lwggo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnspr9z5lwggo\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It is defined as \u201creducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries, and the role of conservative, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks\u201d (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/DA78-CACL\"><u>UN-REDD Programme, 2016</u></a>, p. 1).</p><p>REDD+ facilitates results-based payments following the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LmjsyFvQavLQnYSTp/the-redd-framework-for-reducing-deforestation-and-mitigating#Payments_for_ecosystem_services_programs_appear_effective_but_have_important_flaws\"><u>payment for ecosystem services (PES)</u>&nbsp;model</a>. In the context of REDD+, the PES framework allows for money to flow from industrialized to developing countries in exchange for successful forest conservation \u2014 via public funds or carbon markets \u2014 that directly incentivize efforts to protect their forests. Payments are intended to compensate for the opportunity cost of not developing forest land for the production of agricultural and other commodities \u2014 such as beef, gold, soy, and palm oil \u2014 that drive deforestation.</p><p>According to an interview with Ruben Lubowski, co-founder of the Emergent Forest Finance Accelerator, chief carbon and environmental strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Management,&nbsp;and former chief natural resource economist at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), the largest current source of demand for REDD+ is the voluntary market. In turn, REDD+ credits accounted for about 80% of forest- and land-use-related voluntary carbon offsets in 2019 (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/YA2K-R59J\"><u>Donofrio et al., 2020</u></a>, p. 7). Other sources \u2014 such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, the United Nations\u2019 (UN) effort to ensure any growth in emissions after 2019 is offset elsewhere \u2014 may become important in the future, but currently account for only a small proportion of the carbon offsets (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/W4PP-438S\"><u>Prater, 2019</u></a>).</p><p>To qualify for REDD+ participation, developing country participants must provide a reference emissions level (i.e., a baseline) against which to measure emissions reductions induced by REDD+; a measurement, reporting, and verification system to accurately assess forest cover change and associated emissions reductions; a national plan for reducing forest-related emissions; and a system for reporting on the implementation of measures to prevent environmental and social harm. \u201cReadiness\u201d funds are available to help developing countries meet these criteria and qualify for REDD+ payments (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7HYZ-5BL5\"><u>Forest Carbon Partnership Facility [FCPF], 2022</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/HKQ7-9DQW\"><u>UNFCCC, 2015</u></a>).</p><p>Conceptually, REDD+ addresses the equity issue that originally led to the exclusion of deforestation activity under the Kyoto Protocol \u2014 i.e., that industrialized nations had benefited economically from deforestation, so developing countries should be allowed to do so as well.

Based on our understanding of the issues and solutions we explore, <strong>we conclude with our best guess of cost-effectiveness, which ranges from $6 to $62 per tonne of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;(tCO<sub>2</sub>) abated with 80% confidence.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>This range suggests that targeted funding \u2014 both to ensure that the conditions for the success of jurisdictional REDD+ are met&nbsp;and that sufficient funding is committed to pay forest owners for continuous certified emissions reductions in the coming decades \u2014 is a cost-effective climate change intervention relative to alternatives for which we have identified estimates. For instance, <a href=\"https://perma.cc/B4UH-7EFD\"><u>Giving Green (2022c)</u></a>&nbsp;has recommended funding commitments to direct air capture (DAC) via the Frontier advanced market commitment; while Giving Green does not undertake its own cost-effectiveness analysis,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvwhg4etfwz\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvwhg4etfwz\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;research&nbsp;suggests that DAC costs could drop to below $100/tCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aau4107\"><u>Service, 2018</u></a>), and the United States Department of Energy has set a goal to reach $30/tCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://perma.cc/AJ37-SWUH\"><u>Ryser, 2020</u></a>).</p><p>It is possible that advocacy is or has been more cost-effective than more direct implementation of greenhouse gas reduction strategies such as DAC or REDD+, though cost-effectiveness analyses to assess the impact of advocacy are extremely uncertain and often depend on political context. With Democrats having lost their majority in the House of Representatives this year, we believe that advocacy at the federal level is much less likely to remain as cost-effective as previous claims have suggested,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftleeuogikz9\"><sup><a href=\"#fntleeuogikz9\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and we are currently unsure of the expected impact and cost-effectiveness of climate advocacy at the state level or outside of the United States.</p><h1>Payments for ecosystem services programs appear effective but have important flaws</h1><p>Given the findings of the sole randomized controlled trial (RCT) on a payment for ecosystem services (PES) program for reducing deforestation (i.e., 88% reduction in forest loss among enrollees relative to a control group) \u2014 in addition to our inclination to give significant weight to RCT evidence \u2014 our main takeaway from the academically published literature&nbsp;is that PES has very strong potential to significantly&nbsp;reduce deforestation if participation is sufficiently high (high confidence). However, we estimate with medium-high confidence that up to 40% of claimed emissions reductions may not be additional (that is, they may have happened in the absence of the intervention) and with low confidence that 20%-30% of emissions reductions may be impermanent. We do not believe that leakage will pose a major threat to the environmental integrity of future REDD+ programs, as we expect a successful and complete transition to jurisdictional REDD+ in the coming one to five years with medium-high confidence.</p><h2>PES programs such as REDD+ involve results-based payments for environmental services</h2><p>Payments for ecosystem (or environmental) services (PES) refers to \u201cthe voluntary payment by a (minimum one) buyer to a (minimum one) provider to \u2018buy\u2019 an environmental service (or a land use likely to secure that service), if and only if the provider secures the environmental service\u201d&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9HYM-2HKJ\"><u>UN-REDD Programme, 2018</u></a>). In other words, PES involves an agreement between two parties \u2014 a buyer and a seller of an environmental service, such as carbon sequestration \u2014 where the buyer offers to pay the seller an agreed amount of money conditional on the seller\u2019s delivery of the environmental service during the contract term.</p><p>Our non-exhaustive reading of the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LmjsyFvQavLQnYSTp/the-redd-framework-for-reducing-deforestation-and-mitigating#The_only_randomized_controlled_trial_of_PES_suggests_that_its_effect_on_REDD__enrollees_is_high__88__reduction_in_forest_loss__but_enrollment_is_low__32__enrolled___leading_to_an_overall_reduction_in_forest_loss_of_54_\"><u>academic literature</u></a>&nbsp;leads us to <strong>believe (with 90% confidence) that the majority of forest-related PES programs have led to a decline in deforestation rates of 0%-55%, though the effect for those eligible for the REDD+ project </strong><i><strong>who actually enroll</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;can be much higher (up to about 90%).</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk0nwriqxrio\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk0nwriqxrio\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We believe that the effectiveness of the program in reducing deforestation depends on the size of the incentive, ease of enrollment, and awareness and understanding of the program.

A counterfactual assessment measures \u201cadditionality,\u201d meaning the extent to which the program in question induced additional benefits beyond what otherwise would have occurred. <strong>Accounting for the various estimates we have come across in the literature, we estimate with medium-high confidence that 60%-100% of reported emissions reductions from future (</strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LmjsyFvQavLQnYSTp/the-redd-framework-for-reducing-deforestation-and-mitigating#Jurisdictional_REDD__is_a_promising_anti_deforestation_intervention\"><strong><u>jurisdictional</u></strong></a><strong>) REDD+ projects will be genuinely additional.</strong></p><h3>Historical data and empirical evidence suggest that reference-level gaming has been a threat to additionality</h3><p>The lack of a clear baseline of previous or counterfactual deforestation against which to measure program impacts \u2014 along with the perverse incentive of participating countries to exaggerate baseline emissions from deforestation to increase revenues from PES schemes \u2014 means it is extremely difficult to be confident in programs\u2019 additionality. Many PES schemes rely on setting an initial reference level (RL), known in the context of REDD+ as a forest reference emissions level&nbsp;(FREL). This level is set by choosing a \u201ctypical\u201d period of forest emissions against which to compare future emissions levels. As one might expect, the decision is fraught:</p><blockquote><p>The exercise of setting an RL is by nature a hypothetical one: what would the state of deforestation and forest degradation \u2013 and resulting emissions \u2013 be in the absence of REDD+? Deforestation rates typically vary from year to year, adding noise to the data. At low rates, deforestation, forest degradation, and forest regrowth can be hard to detect and monitor. Equally, there is no scientific consensus on the most appropriate methodology, on which factors to include in the estimation of RLs, or on the time period for which to calculate historical deforestation (or emissions). (Angelsen et al., 2018, p. 49)</p></blockquote><p>Incentives to \u201cgame the system\u201d are evident when comparing countries\u2019 claims to different programs with varying standards. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/007045\"><u>Angelsen et al. (2018)</u></a>&nbsp;express further concern about this dynamic:</p><blockquote><p>RLs may also be candidates for gaming [i.e., manipulation and misrepresentation of emissions data to increase PES revenues]. The time period, definitions and statistical approaches for estimating historical emissions vary in the UNFCCC submissions, and this may greatly affect the actual RL \u2013 and hence the estimated emissions reduction. There are few formal checks and balances in place to avoid inflated RLs. Country submissions are subject to a technical assessment by UNFCCC. \u2026 While there may be good reasons for this consensus approach, it also limits the scope for critical assessment to detect systematic biases across submissions. (p. 50)</p></blockquote><p>A useful example to illustrate this dynamic is Brazil, which experienced high&nbsp;rates of deforestation until the mid-2000s. For the Amazon Fund, which is overwhelmingly funded by the Norwegian government, the starting year used to calculate Brazil\u2019s RL \u2014 a 10-year average updated every five years \u2014 is flexible and changing over time, to reflect a continuously updating counterfactual (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/2BDW-C39M\"><u>Amazon Fund, 2018</u></a>). Brazil would have claimed credit for 4 GtCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;or $21.5 billion worth of avoided emissions from 2006 to 2016 under this reference level. However, Brazil has retained autonomy to set its own reference level as reported to UNFCCC. By fixing its FREL&nbsp;in the higher-emission year of 1996 rather than in 2006,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe5k4aih8o6l\"><sup><a href=\"#fne5k4aih8o6l\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Brazil added an extra 3 GtCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;of claimed avoided emissions from 2006 to 2016, which would indicate that Brazil received $36 billion in payments, perhaps half of which rewarded Brazil for maintaining forests that may not have been in serious danger of deforestation during the period in question. Thus, Brazil may have received payments for benefits that were not the direct result of the REDD+ program.</p><p>Even if we assume the Amazon Fund reference level of 2006&nbsp;was correct (though we assume it is likely also overstated), <strong>43% of Brazil\u2019s official emissions reductions reported to the UNFCCC were not additional in this case. </strong>Still worse, using the synthetic control method to account for \u201cthe effects of contemporaneous drivers of deforestation, including agricultural commodity prices, currency exchange rates, and environmental regulations,\u201d <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2004334117\"><u>West et al. (2020)</u></a>&nbsp;find effectively no evidence of additional emissions reductions in about 10 voluntary REDD+ projects from 2008 to 2014 in Brazil (p. 24190).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4852xjr9hhi\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4852xjr9hhi\">[15]</a></sup></span></p><p>Similarly, Peru \u2014 whose deforestation rate has trended upward since the early 2000s \u2014 submitted an FREL extrapolating the trend so that the baseline in 2020 is 20% above 2015 deforestation levels. Such extrapolation may be valid, though it presents an issue when such trends are used to a country\u2019s advantage when they are increasing, and not similarly accounted for when they are declining (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17528/cifor/007045\"><u>Angelsen et al., 2018</u></a>, p. 46).</p><p>According to a recent <i>Washington Post</i>&nbsp;investigation, Malaysia claims in its Biennial Update Report to the UNFCCC that its trees absorb carbon 4x faster than those in similar forests in neighboring Indonesia, allowing it to reduce its stated CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions by 73% (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/KR36-BMWL\"><u>Mooney et al., 2021</u></a>). The journalists estimate that the gap in actual versus reported emissions globally ranges from 8.5 to as high as 13.3 GtCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;a year (the latter constituting 23%&nbsp;of total anthropogenic emissions), with 59% of the gap attributable to land use (including forests).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsirozufbisk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsirozufbisk\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In line with these findings, researchers found that 37% of 120 early REDD+ projects they investigated overlapped with protected areas&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://perma.cc/GA2F-FXVH\"><u>Simonet et al., 2015</u></a>). Given these findings, along with the claim that some of the discrepancy seems intentional and others may be due to inadequate&nbsp;technical capacity, it seems likely that reference emissions levels are poorly measured and err on the side of overreporting reference emissions.</p><p>Unfortunately, gaming also appears to have occurred in parts of the world where technical capacity is high.&nbsp;For example, several major corporations (JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., the Walt Disney Company, and BlackRock) purchased land in the US Northeast to offset the carbon emissions from their operations, facilitated by the Nature Conservancy (which receives a 40% cut of these contracts and claims to have been following American Carbon Registry&nbsp;rules):</p><blockquote><p>The additional revenue from the carbon-offset program helps [the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary] take better care of the land, plant more saplings, and improve the forest\u2019s health, [Hawk Mountain\u2019s director of conservation science, Laurie] Goodrich says. She says her understanding is that these incremental improvements generate the carbon credits. That\u2019s not the case: The project documents show almost all of the credits come from the assumption that the land would have been heavily harvested. Goodrich says Hawk Mountain had no intention to cut down most of its trees; that runs counter to their mission, and the sanctuary already had a management plan in place that protects the trees. \u201cWe\u2019d still be managing the land the same way,\u201d without carbon payments, she says. (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/3VL3-GW7T\"><u>Elgin, 2020</u></a>)</p></blockquote><p>A similar issue emerged in the case of California forest carbon offsets, which are eligible for compliance under its cap-and-trade program (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.15943\"><u>Badgley et al., 2022</u></a>). The authors find <strong>evidence of 29.4% (20.1%-37.8%) over-crediting, equivalent to 30 million tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;(MtCO<sub>2</sub>) valued at $410 million</strong>. The validation of such additionality concerns in contexts with seemingly high technical capacity and desired environmental integrity exacerbates concerns about additionality in REDD+ programs, where technical capacity and concern for environmental outcomes may be lower.</p><h3>Gaming aside, accurately assessing counterfactual emissions can be both practically and methodologically difficult, though experimental evidence and recent REDD+ advancements leave us optimistic</h3><p>The issue of additionality creates methodological difficulties for non-RCT studies, such as the synthetic control study of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1904027116\"><u>Roopsind et al. (2019)</u></a>. Here, the low number of valid synthetic control countries (i.e., the very limited sample size) means that the probability of observing a 35% reduction from 2010 to 2015, as they do, is 60% \u201cby chance alone\u201d (p. 24493). The same probability for the years with the highest treatment effect (2014-2015) is 25%.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref92kx371700j\"><sup><a href=\"#fn92kx371700j\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Additionally, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/csp2.28\"><u>Burivalova et al.

(2020)</u></a>&nbsp;that baselines against which historical trends are assessed should be updated more frequently than every 10 years, and that different approaches to baselining should be assessed to identify the (combination of) method(s) for establishing counterfactual emissions with the highest social and environmental integrity (p. 24192).</p><h2>We estimate with low confidence that 70%-80% of quality-certified emissions reductions from REDD+ are permanent</h2><p>The issue of impermanence, i.e., the possibility of reversal during or at the end of a carbon crediting period, has similarly plagued anti-deforestation initiatives. For instance, a majority of the benefits of paying for a forest to remain intact \u2014 keeping its stored carbon from entering the atmosphere and potentially also acting as an active carbon sink \u2014 may be lost if the forest is cleared once the credit expires, or once payments cease. We assume a high likelihood of reversal in the absence of robust safeguards to ensure permanence after contract expiration, and <strong>we believe with low confidence (based on limited empirical evidence) that existing standards that aim to ensure permanence (and to insure against impermanence) for up to 100 years will be&nbsp;70%-80% effective based on the additional credits banked to address permanence by Verra, ART TREES, and Gold Standard.</strong></p><p>Reversal may occur due to natural events such as pest infestation, fire, or frost damage (with possibly temporary or short-term impacts, e.g., if the forest recovers), or drought, stand replacing forest fires, and disease outbreaks (with longer term impacts, e.g., if the forest does not recover or it can no longer store as much carbon). Man-made threats of reversal, such as intentional forest burning or clearcutting, may be influenced by policy instability. For instance, under Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s leadership and outspoken support for agribusiness, Brazil closed down two climate change divisions and cut the budget for Brazil\u2019s top environmental enforcement agency by a quarter. These moves removed barriers for aligned state governments to pursue expansion of soy and cattle farming in deforestation-prone regions (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/E2T8-J6XR\"><u>Song, 2019</u></a>).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aan0568\"><u>Jayachandran et al. (2017)</u></a>&nbsp;do not measure the persistence of their treatment effects and instead make a series of assumptions around permanence in their cost-benefit analysis. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1904027116\"><u>Roopsind et al. (2019)</u></a><strong>&nbsp;find that tree cover loss increased by 200% \u2014 from 0.069% to 0.140%, equivalent to the level of Guyana\u2019s synthetic counterfactual&nbsp;\u2014 in 2016, following the end of the Norway-Guyana REDD+ program.</strong>&nbsp;Moreover, tree cover loss exceeded the 0.1% threshold, above which Guyana would have received no payments, for two years following the program, holding implications for the program\u2019s cost-effectiveness:</p><blockquote><p>Based on assumed payments of US $250 million, the cost of the 12.8 million [metric] tons of avoided CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions is US $19.53 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub>. If these emission reductions are permanent, then this is the effective cost per ton of CO<sub>2</sub>. However, if this emission is only avoided for 5 years, then the rental rate at a 5% discount rate is US $4.50 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;per year, and the effective cost of carbon is around US $90 per ton of CO<sub>2</sub>. (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1904027116\"><u>Roopsind et al., 2019</u></a>, p. 24497)</p></blockquote><p>In line with <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1904027116\"><u>Roopsind et al. (2019)</u></a>, we would generally assume over a relatively short time horizon (perhaps 0-25 years)&nbsp;that avoided deforestation is completely and quickly reversed in the absence of continued PES payments, and that forest clearing returns to levels closer to pre-contract rates. Thus <strong>we strongly recommend continuing results-based payments for the desired duration of emissions reductions</strong>&nbsp;and updating the price paid over time to account for updates to opportunity costs (e.g., the opportunity costs to PFOs may decline as countries develop, identify alternative forest uses, or create protected areas).</p><p><a href=\"https://perma.cc/E2T8-J6XR\"><u>Song\u2019s (2019)</u></a>&nbsp;investigation for ProPublica also highlights the risk of reversion to baseline levels of deforestation:</p><blockquote><p>I looked at projects going back two decades and spanning the globe and pulled together findings from academic researchers in far-flung forest villages, studies published in obscure journals, foreign government reports and dense technical documents. I enlisted a satellite imagery analysis firm to see how much of the forest remained in a preservation project that started selling credits in 2013. Four years later, only half the project areas were forested. In case&nbsp;after case, I found that carbon credits hadn\u2019t offset the amount of pollution they were supposed to, or they had brought gains that were quickly reversed or that couldn\u2019t be accurately measured to begin with. Ultimately, the polluters got a guilt-free pass to keep emitting CO<sub>2</sub>, but the forest preservation that was supposed to balance the ledger either never came or didn\u2019t last.</p></blockquote><p>Recent years have seen significant progress in the development and refinement of carbon standards, and how permanence will be addressed in future REDD+ projects will depend on the carbon standard governing the project (Carvalho and \u00c1lvarez Campo, 2022). For instance, the <a href=\"https://perma.cc/FRD9-EXMN\"><u>American Carbon Registry (2018)</u></a>&nbsp;requires the use of an approved risk analysis tool to account for general and project-specific risks, with options to mitigate the risk in the form of a buffer or through an insurance product (pp. 19-21).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1od6qltgu4i\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1od6qltgu4i\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;For credits issued by <a href=\"https://www.artredd.org/\"><u>Architecture for REDD+ Transactions</u></a>&nbsp;(ART), each project makes an annual contribution of 5%-25% of credits to ART\u2019s combined buffer pool depending on the number of risk mitigation factors applied; participants must then report annual emissions after years one, three, and five of the \u201ccrediting period\u201d and if emissions exceed the crediting level, an equivalent number of credits from the buffer pool are retired and the annual buffer increases by 5% for the following five years (<a href=\"https://www.artredd.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TREES-2.0-August-2021-Clean.pdf\"><u>ART, 2021</u></a>, pp. 42-43).</p><p>Gold Standard&nbsp;and Verra&nbsp;(the largest issuer of REDD+ and forestry credits) have up to 21- and 100-year permanence requirements, respectively, and set aside a percentage of issued emissions reductions<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkg6q6jdyk6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkg6q6jdyk6\">[23]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;\u2014 20% for Gold Standard and a variable percentage for Verra,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwno5efsrhmc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwno5efsrhmc\">[24]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;depending on the project risk as assessed by its AFOLU risk tool&nbsp;\u2014 to address the risk of early reversal<strong>&nbsp;</strong>(<a href=\"https://perma.cc/W9WG-DWYK\"><u>Gold Standard, 2015</u></a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/G88X-9EUZ\"><u>Verra, 2019</u></a>). That is, if carbon is \u201cknown, or believed, to be lost,\u201d these excess credits&nbsp;are canceled, negating the need for projects that experience reversal to pay credits back to the issuer&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://perma.cc/M37G-Q4ER\"><u>Verra, 2022</u></a>, p. 6). Our sense from our conversation with Maria Carvalho, former head of public affairs at the South Pole Group, is that&nbsp;the Verra standards are among the most robust.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftu6s3uvt29f\"><sup><a href=\"#fntu6s3uvt29f\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<strong>We believe with low confidence (based on limited empirical evidence) that such standards that aim to ensure permanence (and to insure against impermanence) for up to 100 years will be&nbsp;70%-80% effective based on the&nbsp;buffer pool approaches of ART TREES, Gold Standard, and Verra.</strong></p><p>In our interview, Carvalho provided an insightful reminder that anti-deforestation is not unique in confronting issues around permanence: \u201cascertaining permanence for <i>any</i>&nbsp;carbon removal project is difficult; even [direct air capture] removals need a lot of measurement, reporting, and verification to show permanence.\u201d We agree with Carvalho\u2019s recommendation that further academic research should more rigorously investigate the questions of permanence and reversal. In the meantime, <strong>we would recommend continuous payments unless and until the economic benefit of the standing forest exceeds its opportunity cost</strong>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyjqsz2s05j9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyjqsz2s05j9\">[26]</a></sup></span></p><p>One alternative approach to addressing permanence concerns, known as tonne-year accounting, considers temporary carbon storage to be equivalent to avoiding some amount of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions altogether. In particular, the technique equates briefly storing a larger amount of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;with permanently storing a smaller amount of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;by assuming an accounting time horizon beyond which costs and benefits are ignored (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7WDK-CPPR\"><u>Chay, Badgley,&nbsp;et al., 2022</u></a>). Temporary carbon storage becomes more valuable the shorter the assumed time horizon of relevant costs and benefits, leading to differences in valuation depending on the selected time horizon.</p><p>In part because the choice of accounting time horizon is \u201cintrinsically subjective\u201d (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate1335\"><u>Levasseur et al., 2012</u></a>, p. 6), tonne-year accounting has stirred controversy. For example, Verra declined to include tonne-year accounting in its Verified Carbon Standard following public consultations (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/EY8F-57CF\"><u>Hestad, 2022</u></a>). In an email exchange, Dan Stein of Giving Green also indicated skepticism of the technique, directing us to CarbonPlan\u2019s explainer (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7WDK-CPPR\"><u>Chay, Badgley, et al., 2022</u></a>). In a post summarizing comment letters submitted to Verra during the consultations, CarbonPlan claims that tonne-year accounting ignores planetary temperature outcomes and can be used to legitimate ongoing emissions, and that it also introduces perverse incentives that induce further additionality challenges (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/22Q9-LYK6\"><u>C</u></a><a href=\"https://perma.cc/7WDK-CPPR\"><u>hay, Cullenward, and </u></a><u>Badgley</u><a href=\"https://perma.cc/22Q9-LYK6\"><u>, 2022</u></a>).</p><p>On the other hand, Natural Carbon Exchange (NCX)&nbsp;\u2014 which offers PES forestry schemes with tonne-year accounting \u2014 has alleged that many critics of the technique simply fear disruption to the traditional business model of carbon credits (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/LH3R-A9YF\"><u>Meyer, 2022</u></a>). NCX\u2019s CEO has also expressed skepticism of the industry\u2019s ability to assure permanence in general (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9A3S-MCLE\"><u>Parisa, 2022</u></a>). We have not determined whether the technique is employed by PES projects other than NCX, nor whether it should be considered viable for addressing permanence concerns.</p><h2>While leakage has historically been problematic, we do not believe that leakage will remain a cause for concern for future (jurisdictional) REDD+ projects</h2><p>Another potential problem is leakage, which refers to the \u201cunexpected loss of anticipated carbon benefits due to the displacement of activities in the project area to areas outside the project, resulting in carbon emissions \u2026 negat[ing] some or all of the carbon benefits generated by a project\u201d (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9HYM-2HKJ\"><u>UN-REDD Programme, 2018</u></a>).

The authors conclude that detecting leakage in their case would \u201crequire more in-depth economic analysis that focuses on transboundary investment flows, labor, and market effects, especially those related to the demand and supply of gold and policies implemented by other countries\u201d (p. 24496). While they find evidence of \u201ccoarse increases\u201d in tree cover loss on both Suriname\u2019s interior and its border with &nbsp;Guyana, the concurrent increase in gold prices makes it difficult to isolate the real drivers. Critically, if leakage from Guyana to Suriname did occur owing to REDD+, the results of the synthetic matching approach would be biased toward overestimating the effect of the program.</p><h1>REDD+ programs include some methods to address PES issues, but more progress is needed</h1><h2>REDD+ measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) standards are thorough&nbsp;but not yet sufficient to adequately account for forest degradation</h2><p>The UN REDD+ measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) process consists of two steps. In the first step, countries submit a FREL<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2mhtl0frnfo\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2mhtl0frnfo\">[28]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;delineating annual tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;for a reference period that they select, which then undergoes a third-party technical evaluation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbzsy5ut01a\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbzsy5ut01a\">[29]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Second, countries submit a comparison of measured results to the FREL&nbsp;in their biennial update reports, and these results undergo another expert technical analysis.</p><p>According to the <a href=\"https://perma.cc/7HYZ-5BL5\"><u>FCPF (2022)</u></a>, measurement combines two types of data: <i>activity data</i>, or information on the magnitude of carbon emissions- or removal-relevant human activity, and <i>emissions factor data</i>, or coefficients that translate activity data into tCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;per unit of land area. Measurement of five carbon pools \u2014 \u201cabove-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, deadwood, litter, and soil organic carbon\u201d \u2014 takes place using three primary sources of information. First, satellite land monitoring systems capture activity data, i.e., the extent of human-caused deforestation and degradation. Second, forest inventories contain global, national, regional, or local information on relevant carbon stocks, allowing for the conversion of activity data&nbsp;to measure impact via emission factors. Integration models \u2014 ranging from basic spreadsheets to custom tools applying complex spatial models \u2014 combine data from satellites and on-the-ground observations to measure emissions for a given region, and uncertainty analyses account for systematic and random error.</p><p>Reporting requires compiling comprehensive data and information to make the measurement step transparent and available in a standardized format. It must include forest-related data, greenhouse gas emissions and removal estimates, a description of methods for measurement and activities undertaken to fulfill its REDD+ commitments, quality assurance and quality control checks, and uncertainty estimates. Data are&nbsp;stored in a harmonized&nbsp;REDD+ database (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7HYZ-5BL5\"><u>FCPF, 2022</u></a>).</p><p>Finally, verification entails a technical assessment of the FREL, and biennial reports are scrutinized via both a technical analysis of activities, methods, assumptions, and emissions impacts and sharing of international views among government agencies, institutions, communities, and NGOs. The process may include, for example, interviews with select government officials and national NGOs, assessment of (media) reports and training materials, and making data available to several institutions and civil society for scrutiny (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/C4QJ-BYAD\"><u>UN-REDD Programme, 2011</u></a>). Participating countries also undergo a Country Needs Assessment to identify areas (financial, technical, institutional) where countries could use further MRV assistance (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7HYZ-5BL5\"><u>FCPF, 2022</u></a>).</p><p><strong>The main issue with MRV that we came across in our research appears to be the underdetection of forest degradation,</strong>&nbsp;which refers to the reduction of forest conditions below natural capacity without reducing tree cover by more than 10% (which would then be classified as deforestation), for instance through selective tree cutting.</p><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aan0568\"><u>Jayachandran et al.

The qualitative findings of <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2018.07.001\"><u>Duchelle et al.

For the REDD programs, Brazil has relied on a satellite program that tracks large-scale tree loss, starting at chunks the size of about 10 city blocks. But there\u2019s emerging evidence that landowners are clear-cutting smaller&nbsp;areas to escape detection. It doesn\u2019t account for degradation, the thinning of trees from wildfires and logging; a major study found this cut the Amazon\u2019s carbon content by an average of 55%. Luiz Arag\u00e3o, who heads the remote sensing division at Brazil\u2019s National Institute for Space Research, said wildfires alone can change the numbers by 30%, and scientists are just beginning to understand&nbsp;how they create lasting damage.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://perma.cc/E2T8-J6XR\"><u>Song (2019)</u></a>&nbsp;also expressed concerns about tracking and measuring degradation, which can be difficult, particularly because the Tropical Forest Standard does not require reporting at the same level as it does for deforestation:</p><blockquote><p>The [Tropical Forest S]tandard&nbsp;requires programs to exceed protections in existing policies and to show a drastic reduction in deforestation \u2026 but it doesn\u2019t make countries report degradation, potentially leaving out a huge chunk of the emissions. Jason Gray, chief of the board\u2019s cap-and-trade program, said degradation is hard to measure, but the standard will incentivize better monitoring so countries can add the data later. \u201cIf we wait to have the perfect information,\u201d he said, \u201cit might be too late.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>While we have not come across research that informs our expectations regarding the exact extent to which MRV overlooks emissions (reductions), <strong>we are optimistic that \u2014 with a sufficiently significant demand signal for certified REDD+ credits \u2014 technological improvements in satellite detection and movements toward corroborating satellite data with on-the-ground data will attenuate MRV issues in the coming decade. Nevertheless, we assume that 5% of emissions go undetected, particularly from unmeasured degradation, due to MRV shortcomings.</strong></p><h2>Increasing REDD+ incentives would likely improve equity and effectiveness, with unknown implications for impact and cost-effectiveness</h2><p>The effectiveness of PES programs depends on whether local actors are sufficiently incentivized to follow through with conservation actions. It is therefore important to consider whether the effective carbon prices paid through REDD+ programs are high enough to guarantee real changes in outcomes on the ground.</p><p>Poverty can be a key driver of forest clearing and degradation, as people seek to monetize the natural resources afforded by the forests in order to pursue higher living standards (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2019.104746\"><u>Miyamoto, 2020</u></a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/CZZ5-ZL4M\"><u>Bostwick, 2019</u></a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqzqw0uyjl2d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqzqw0uyjl2d\">[30]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Individuals or communities might choose to convert forested areas to cleared land for cattle grazing, as is often the case in the Amazon (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/03066150.2019.1604510\"><u>Kr\u00f6ger, 2019</u></a>).

According to Sanjay Joshi (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/HRJ3-5ZTF\"><u>Joshi, 2019</u></a>),<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn6b7htkb1i\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn6b7htkb1i\">[32]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;McKinsey&nbsp;has asserted that REDD+ payments could cover at most 25% of total costs of conservation. Other organizations argue that McKinsey ignores certain costs in their calculations, implying that the real coverage of REDD+ payments might be even lower (e.g., <a href=\"https://perma.cc/9SDH-4426\"><u>Dyer and Counsell, 2010</u></a>).</p><p>If REDD+ programs are effective in averting deforestation, then <strong>one should&nbsp;consider the remaining costs as being borne by local communities</strong>,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2qem4f2fxfd\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2qem4f2fxfd\">[33]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which are much less wealthy on average than the developed-nation clients that purchase credits.

This information would help us to understand the implications of funding REDD+ from both ethical and effectiveness standpoints, as well as to consider whether funds could be allocated to advocate fairer incentives. <strong>Stronger incentives have ambiguous implications for cost-effectiveness in terms of dollars per tCO<sub>2</sub></strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>All else equal, stronger incentives increase program costs, while, on the other hand, stronger incentives could lead to disproportionately higher effectiveness and therefore lower cost per ton abated.<strong>&nbsp;Additionally, stronger incentives would likely improve social benefits along other dimensions, leaving us with significant uncertainty regarding the size and direction of potential changes to the intervention\u2019s cost-effectiveness both per tCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;and per unit of overall social impact.</strong></p><h2>Aligning incentives by improving carbon pricing is promising</h2><p>The&nbsp;low and inconsistently applied price of carbon is a key reason that incentives have been poorly aligned in past projects.

About 1 GtCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;was on sale in voluntary carbon markets in 2021, with annual supply outpacing annual demand by 7x-8x (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/E8KA-5ZUU\"><u>Jennifer L, 2022</u></a>). This excess is a result of issues around the environmental integrity of earlier offsets \u2014 both leading to inflated supply of (potentially non-additional) offsets and, relatedly, reduced demand for them.</p><p>A private donor may be able to raise the market price of carbon offsets by increasing demand for credits, possibly by making private purchases on voluntary markets. <a href=\"https://perma.cc/6R75-CHVB\"><u>Trove Research and UCL (2021)</u></a>&nbsp;estimate that clearing the aforementioned excess offsets from the market would increase the price of offsets from $4-$5/tCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;to $10-$15/tCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;(p. 45).</p><p><strong>In addition to raising the market price of offsets, purchasing excess offsets on the voluntary market with a </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LmjsyFvQavLQnYSTp/the-redd-framework-for-reducing-deforestation-and-mitigating#1__Credible_sustained_demand_is_necessary_to_encourage_supply_of_certified_credits\"><strong><u>sustained commitment</u></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;to continue purchasing over the coming decade would help to send a signal to the market that carbon offset demand is on the rise, spurring new projects to supply higher-cost but higher-quality carbon offsets.</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref683upe9w6ft\"><sup><a href=\"#fn683upe9w6ft\">[34]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Companies that buy cheap offsets currently run the risk of greenwashing accusations, since offsets characterized by environmental integrity would cost much more than the offsets\u2019 current low prices. Philanthropic efforts could plausibly improve the average quality of carbon offsets by offering an effective price floor.</p><p>However, we are unsure whether doing so would also signal demand for offsets with questionable environmental integrity. A philanthropist may therefore consider placing conditionality on the purchase of future REDD+ carbon credits based on quality criteria (e.g., a particular certification).</p><h1>Jurisdictional&nbsp;REDD+ is a promising anti-deforestation intervention</h1><p>Jurisdictional REDD+ is \u201can accounting framework that establishes consistent baselines and carbon crediting approaches across forest projects within a jurisdiction (e.g., state or country)\u201d (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/G586-SMXT\"><u>Giving Green, 2022b</u></a>), as opposed to standalone REDD+ projects that operate under project-specific contracts and arrangements.</p><p>As such, jurisdictional REDD+ increases the scale of coverage of the REDD+ program, minimizing the risk of leakage from one jurisdiction to contiguous participating jurisdictions, and allows for sharing of risks of impermanence across projects within a jurisdiction. Moreover, reference levels over larger areas are less likely to lead to inflated estimates of emissions reductions \u2014 in part due to fewer opportunities for project developers to self-select into areas where baselines are favorable \u2014 and there may be more localized benefits to human welfare if particular stakeholders (e.g., Indigenous peoples and local communities) are involved in the distribution of benefits. However, the success of jurisdictional REDD+ hinges on several conditions, including, though not limited to, the existence of robust systems to facilitate MRV across scales, credible and sustained demand for credits, &nbsp;and market development to facilitate trading. Philanthropic funding could play several roles in catalyzing early-stage development of the jurisdictional approach, for example, by creating or expressing demand for the resulting forest carbon credits or providing risk-neutral financing opportunities.&nbsp;If the conditions are met, we have high confidence that jurisdictional REDD+ will represent the anti-deforestation approach with the highest impact, and the highest impact per dollar.</p><h2>By increasing the scale of REDD+ coverage, jurisdictional REDD+ will likely help to overcome concerns of leakage, additionality, and permanence, while extending program benefits to&nbsp;Indigenous peoples and local communities</h2><p>Jurisdictional REDD+ and project-based REDD+ are separated by a thin and often blurred line. Project-based approaches may be absorbed into jurisdictional approaches through \u201cnesting\u201d to align project-level approaches at any scale with jurisdictional baselines, MRV strategies, emissions reduction estimates, and accounting methods, in order to avoid double counting emissions reductions. Additionally, advocates of jurisdictional REDD+ (of which there appear to be few to no opponents) claim that the <strong>jurisdictional approach largely remedies leakage issues since measurement takes place on a larger scale thereby incentivizing enforcement against geographically proximate deforestation. It also attenuates the risk of impermanence associated with carbon credits since these risks can be pooled across projects in a jurisdiction</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://perma.cc/PW92-W9TJ\"><u>Emergent, 2021b</u></a>, p. 10).</p><p>Proponents also claim that jurisdictional REDD+ encourages and supports government-led REDD+ programs and provides transparency and robustness of emissions reductions estimates relative to a common baseline, which can facilitate their incorporation into emerging carbon exchange mechanisms. A draft consensus statement by eight organizations describes the benefits of jurisdictional REDD+ as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Jurisdictional-scale crediting has the potential to incentivize governments to take the decisions and perform the actions that only they have the authority to implement. This includes actions such as policy reform; recognition of [Indigenous peoples\u2019] and [local communities\u2019] rights and full and effective participation; and enforcement of the law. All of these are necessary to end tropical deforestation at scale. Scale can be an important determinant of the environmental integrity of carbon credits regardless of sector, with larger-scale programs better positioned to mitigate risks of leakage, non-additionality, and impermanence compared to stand-alone projects. For example, <strong>reference levels based on the recent historical deforestation rates of large areas are less likely to overestimate net emissions reductions</strong>, suggesting that forest carbon crediting based on performance measured at the scale of large jurisdictions can help ensure high quality credits. Furthermore, the inclusion of Indigenous territories and the full and effective <strong>participation of [Indigenous peoples] and [local communities] in jurisdictional programs have the potential to extend benefits to more communities</strong>, including for the conservation of carbon stocks. Therefore, we believe that a rapid transition to jurisdictional-scale crediting for forest-based emissions reductions and removals, including fully nested projects, can help to ensure there is a robust pipeline of high-quality tropical forest carbon credits. (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Y9EG-RVU3\"><u>Coordinating Committee of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin et al., 2021</u></a>, pp. 7-8; see also <a href=\"https://perma.cc/4G4M-XEXE\"><u>Seymour, 2019</u></a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/PW92-W9TJ\"><u>Emergent, 2021b</u></a>)</p></blockquote><p>We agree that <strong>jurisdictional REDD+ approaches represent the most viable path forward for carbon credits with social and environmental integrity</strong>. While jurisdictional REDD+ credits are not yet available in the market, our take \u2014 based on conversations with experts and our reading of the literature \u2014 is not only that they will become available soon&nbsp;(with high likelihood), but that they will come to dominate the market for REDD+ credits over the coming five years (with moderately high likelihood). Several comprehensive carbon accounting and crediting platforms have already been established and gained acceptance into important voluntary and compliance markets. For instance, Verra\u2019s Jurisdictional and Nested REDD+&nbsp;accounting and verification framework, first released in 2012, and ART\u2019s The REDD+ Environmental Excellence Standard (TREES) have both been accepted into the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)&nbsp;market&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://perma.cc/8AVJ-9U22\"><u>Verra, 2020b</u></a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/5XJL-MUA4\"><u>ART, 2022</u></a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo1ggzb7aj78\"><sup><a href=\"#fno1ggzb7aj78\">[35]</a></sup></span></p><p>Moreover, public sector funding, which has primarily targeted REDD+ readiness programs to date, is increasingly giving way to results-based payments. These funding trends, along with increasing literature and dialogue around the benefits of jurisdictional REDD+ and the development of relevant infrastructure and standards, leads us to believe that credits from standalone projects will not reach market acceptance without nesting into their respective jurisdictions in the future.</p><p>Finally, <strong>coordinated public-private investments in jurisdictional credits are on the horizon and are likely to replace private sector-funded supply of forest credits from individual projects</strong>. On Earth Day 2021, the Lowering Emissions by Accelerating Forest Finance (LEAF) Coalition \u2014 representing the US, UK, and Norwegian governments along with several multinational companies \u2014 committed an initial $1 billion to buy 100 MtCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;equivalent of jurisdictional REDD+ credits for a minimum $10/tCO<sub>2</sub>, which will be coordinated by Emergent and use its platform to generate supply credits compliant with TREES (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/92VP-5PZ2\"><u>Forest Trends\u2019 Ecosystem Marketplace, 2021</u></a>, pp. 3-6).</p><p>When asked about the biggest opportunities for philanthropic funding in the context of nature-based solutions, Lubowski (co-founder of Emergent) responded that anti-deforestation is unequivocally the most important nature-based solution, and that he avidly supports the jurisdictional approach. He claimed that there is \u201ca fair amount of evidence in favor\u201d of the jurisdictional approach, but that it has generally moved more slowly than desired in many respects, which he attributes at least in part to lack of resources and effort. He recommends mobilizing funds to <strong>commit to pay for jurisdictional REDD+ results to activate the market and to help jurisdictions access the resources necessary to achieve those results, with actionable opportunities&nbsp;</strong>available through the Climate and Land Use Alliance (CLUA; see also <a href=\"https://perma.cc/8ZXT-Q72Z\"><u>CLUA, 2021</u></a>).</p><h2>MRV&nbsp;coordination across scales will prove challenging</h2><p>The importance of logistical challenges remains to be determined as jurisdictional REDD+ gains ground. First, there are issues of coordinating the carbon stock measurement at larger scales:</p><blockquote><p>From a carbon-accounting perspective, the biggest challenge is getting enough random samples over a long enough period of time to offer carbon-stock estimates that are 95 percent certain, which is what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends. That can be costly, because, despite all the advances in satellite and even drone technology, it still requires sending teams out into the forest with tape-measures. Then someone in the jurisdiction \u2013 usually in the forestry department \u2013 has to blend those findings with satellite images going back decades to document the jurisdiction\u2019s land-use change over time \u2013 how much forest has been converted to field and then to farm, and sometimes back again. Once a jurisdiction has this, it\u2019s actually more straightforward to establish a reference level for an entire jurisdiction than it is for a small patch of land. \u2026 That\u2019s because things average out over a large scale, so a jurisdiction can use its prevailing rates of deforestation as its reference level. (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9S5Y-YWKM\"><u>Zwick et al., 2015</u></a>)</p></blockquote><p>Relatedly, MRV must be coordinated to ensure that sub-national systems are aligned with the national system when nested REDD+ programs exist (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7HYZ-5BL5\"><u>FCPF, 2022</u></a>). Additionally, complexities may arise in harmonizing estimated emissions reductions across carbon markets and accounting methods:</p><blockquote><p>Critical&nbsp;barriers linked to diverse, multi-activity and multi-stakeholder environments remain to which solutions are still needed. \u2026 Avoiding double counting between different markets and accounting systems (e.g., carbon markets, [nationally determined contributions], corporate supply chain, emerging systems like CORSIA) must be addressed, e.g., by applying corresponding adjustments (aligned with Paris Agreement Article 6) to ensure that a mitigation unit (i.e., a [greenhouse gas] emissions reduction or removal) is only counted once across all market and systems.&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Q53N-EKWG\"><u>Gehrig-Fasel et al., 2021</u></a>)</p></blockquote><p>Nevertheless, we believe that jurisdictional REDD+ is the best path forward and are optimistic that these issues can be overcome with sufficient momentum and resources.</p><h2>Early results from the Brazilian states of Acre and Mato Grosso suggest that jurisdictional REDD+ can achieve&nbsp;significant&nbsp;reductions in deforestation&nbsp;and meaningfully and equitably engage local stakeholders</h2><p>Acre and Mato Grosso, respectively around the size of Tunisia and Venezuela, are Brazilian states containing large swathes of the Amazon rainforest.</p><p>Acre and Mato Grosso entered into REDD Early Movers programs&nbsp;in 2011 and 2017 to facilitate a new jurisdictional REDD+ approach in the area (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/D486-WRZC\"><u>Schwartzman, 2021</u></a>).

While 10%-30% was reinvested to strengthen program administration, 70-90% was distributed directly to participants responsible for implementation on the ground.

While this reduction may indeed be attributable to its jurisdictional approach, we are more skeptical of attributing success in Mato Grosso to the jurisdictional REDD+ approach based on this information given that 2020 and 2021 were associated with significant COVID-induced changes in behavior and economic downturn that likely influenced deforestation trends.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft4zpco1zb7q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt4zpco1zb7q\">[37]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Nevertheless, <strong>there are reasons to believe the jurisdictional approach supported a reduction in deforestation, for instance, due to improvements in local institutional and enforcement capacity</strong>. Due to the jurisdictional approach, the state could make decisions on resource allocation and program enforcement: 40% of resources were allocated to \u201cinstitutional strengthening of the state\u2019s system of incentives for environmental services\u201d (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/D486-WRZC\"><u>Schwartzman, 2021</u></a>, p. 12).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeezokps2nr9\"><sup><a href=\"#fneezokps2nr9\">[38]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;According to Lubowski, the state also ramped up police enforcement activities<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoy73xuha7wi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoy73xuha7wi\">[39]</a></sup></span>, even when the country as a whole rolled back enforcement. Over the period from 2005 to 2012, Brazil also ramped up enforcement and barred people from publicly-funded business loans if they were found to be in violation of the program.</p><p>According to Lubowski, Mato Grosso serves as an impressive success story for early jurisdictional REDD+.&nbsp;<strong>Despite the relatively small amount of payments from REDD+ funders, this program may actually have been profitable for the state,</strong>&nbsp;according to Lubowski<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Enforcers were able to collect substantial amounts in fines from violators, and also reduced fund outflows in the form of business loans to illegal operations.</p><p>The Mato Grosso REDD+ program has provided some early lessons for future jurisdictional REDD+ planning and implementation. For instance, the flexible and responsive participatory governance structure of its subprogram on indigenous territories \u2014 which gave significant influence to Indigenous representatives and facilitated strong dialogue across stakeholders \u2014 serves as a model for ensuring program buy-in and equity (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/3FGS-QVZS\"><u>Brodsky et al., 2022</u></a>, p. 14-15). On the other hand, the programs in Acre and Mato Grosso pointed to further need for patience, contextual understanding, cultural sensitivity, capacity building, and design of financial mechanisms to enable \u201cIndigenous People\u2019s autonomy over time\u201d (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/3FGS-QVZS\"><u>Brodsky et al., 2022</u></a>, p. 21; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/D486-WRZC\"><u>Schwartzman, 2021</u></a>, p. 10; see also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/f11091012\"><u>Guerra and Moutinho, 2020</u></a>).

Credible sustained demand is necessary to encourage supply of certified credits</h3><p>From the corporate finance perspective, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink\u2019s 2020 call to action&nbsp;via his insistence that CEOs equate climate risk with investment risk represents a step in the right direction (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/HZ6G-JNUC\"><u>Fink, 2020</u></a>). Also, net-zero emissions (and related) commitments from companies and large corporations will instill confidence that demand for certified credits is on the rise and will persist into the future. For example, Microsoft has vowed&nbsp;to become carbon-negative by the end of this decade and to negate by 2050 all of the company\u2019s historical emissions since its founding in 1975 (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/P96K-XMVB\"><u>Smith, 2020</u></a>).</p><p>Voluntary carbon markets suggest growing demand for forest protection carbon credits, having represented ~5%-10% of voluntary carbon credits in 2010 and having grown to ~30% of such credits in 2020 (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/PW92-W9TJ\"><u>Emergent, 2021b</u></a>, p. 8), reaching $400 million total during 2017-2019 (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/92VP-5PZ2\"><u>Forest Trends\u2019 Ecosystem Marketplace, 2021</u></a>, p. 1, Table 1). CORSIA \u2014 the voluntary agreement to reduce emissions in the international aviation sector \u2014 and other international markets being negotiated under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement also represent a potentially sizable source of demand with transaction values of more than $10 billion per year within this decade (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/92VP-5PZ2\"><u>Forest Trends\u2019 Ecosystem Marketplace, 2021</u></a>).</p><p><strong>Innovative actors such as the Emergent Forest Finance Accelerator</strong>&nbsp;<strong>can help to stimulate demand by removing transaction costs and financing frictions.</strong>&nbsp;Emergent \u2014 established in 2019 by EDF in partnership with the Norwegian government \u2014 guarantees payments based on forest results by purchasing \u201cput options\u201d that act as a price floor, with the option to ultimately sell for a higher price to private actors (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/BBE2-T7GE\"><u>Emergent, 2022</u></a>). Such mechanisms provide certainty of demand for forest nations, as well as a unified platform for buyers\u2019 ease of purchase of verified high-quality carbon credits that may remove barriers to demand.</p><h3>2. Political leaders need incentives to follow through</h3><p>In her post on the World Resources Institute (WRI) website, <a href=\"https://perma.cc/4G4M-XEXE\"><u>Seymour (2020)</u></a>&nbsp;points out that government action is required to set up appropriate economic and legal incentive structures to combat deforestation:</p><blockquote><p>Halting and reversing deforestation and forest degradation on a large scale usually requires actions that only governments can perform. Where forest loss is due to illegal activity, only governments can enforce the law. Where deforestation results from unclear land tenure, only governments can recognize rights to resources. Where forest conversion or degradation is due to licensing of concessions on state-owned land, only governments can suspend or better regulate such licenses. Where deforestation is happening on private land, governments can regulate land use and provide incentives and disincentives through fiscal policies such as access to credit and tax relief.</p></blockquote><p>She argues, however, that the <strong>governments lack political incentives to enforce deforestation-related regulations and policies</strong>, and that this is a major driver of recent upward trends&nbsp;in forest loss (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/CD64-4HLL\"><u>Weisse and Goldman, 2019</u></a>). She also argues that <strong>project-scale interventions lack crucial legal enforcement and regulatory capabilities, such as assignment of land rights, so that project-related gains are often not sustained or scaled.</strong>&nbsp;Her view is that REDD+ finance is just one incentive (\u201cwithin a set of stacked incentives, including preferential commodity sourcing, reputational benefits\u201d) for political leaders to prioritize sustainable land use. Both <a href=\"https://perma.cc/4G4M-XEXE\"><u>Seymour (2020)</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1710465114\"><u>Griscom et al. (2017)</u></a>&nbsp;point to positive outcomes in Brazil in the 2000s that presumably derived from its \u201cstrong regulatory framework, accurate and transparent federal monitoring, and supply chain interventions\u201d (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1710465114\"><u>Griscom et al., 2017</u></a>, p. 11648).</p><p><strong>The credibility of incentive payout is also crucial.</strong>&nbsp;Past emissions reductions in Brazil that, if their claims are accurate, should have led to $24 billion to $36 billion in REDD+ payments have only led to some $2 billion given the limited budgets of funders (e.g., the UN and Norway), which one would imagine could lead to the erosion of trust and waning motivation to devote scarce resources and attention to tackling the problem of domestic deforestation. Thus, credible and sufficient incentives may go a long way in persuading governments to implement and enforce policies and regulations that preserve forests.</p><h3>3. Market architecture, infrastructure, and financing can facilitate trading</h3><p>Based on qualitative academic research, private sector demand can be further stimulated through increased certainty around market structure and design of REDD+, suggesting a role for enhanced communication and common standards to build trust and confidence on both the supply and demand side of the market (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0376892916000187\"><u>Laing et al., 2016</u></a>).</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, as stated by Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters, \u201cagreement is required on standards and certification under one commonly accepted international standards body\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/business%2520functions/sustainability/our%2520insights/why%2520investing%2520in%2520nature%2520is%2520key%2520to%2520climate%2520mitigation/nature-and-net-zero-vf.pdf\"><u>WEF and McKinsey &amp; Company, 2021</u></a>, p. 3). <strong>An international standards body would not only facilitate dialogue among major market actors but also help to rebuild trust in the integrity of forest-related offsets to the benefit of suppliers</strong>, who could market the various features of the carbon credits they offer. The closest we found to such a body is the <a href=\"https://perma.cc/8QXV-BNTK\"><u>Integrity Council on the Voluntary Carbon Market</u></a>&nbsp;(ICVCM; successor to the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets; TSVCM)&nbsp;\u2014 a private sector-led initiative to meet the Paris Agreement goals comprising over 250 relevant institutional actors representing carbon buyers and sellers \u2014 and the <a href=\"https://perma.cc/U8CS-TJAX\"><u>International Carbon Reduction &amp; Offset Alliance</u></a>&nbsp;(ICROA), which advocates high-integrity, -quality, and -impact corporate climate action and provides services through its accreditation program.</p><p>According to Carvalho and \u00c1lvarez Campo (2022), that endorsement by ICROA is just one of three ways carbon credits may be \u201cjudged as having market acceptance,\u201d with the other two being CORSIA eligibility and (perhaps to a lesser extent) carbon standards whose credits are accepted under the carbon markets of various jurisdictions (e.g., the EU Emissions Trading System&nbsp;or California\u2019s cap-and-trade program). The <a href=\"https://perma.cc/EX85-4TB8\"><u>TSVCM (2021)</u></a>&nbsp;suggested that a set of core carbon principles ensure the integrity of carbon credits as well as other features of carbon contracts that may account for, e.g., co-benefits in line with the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (Slide 16). Given progress in this space, broad agreement on which standards meet a globally agreed set of criteria seems likely to us in the next one to three years.</p><p>Moreover, increasing the reliability, availability, and transparency of pricing, risk, and performance data through exchanges \u2014 or a centralized carbon exchange \u2014 that offer spot and futures contracts would pave the way for structured finance, increase the confidence of buyers, and facilitate market entry. Moreover, <strong>finance intermediaries and innovation are needed to, for instance, address gaps in cash flow (i.e., between the time a contract is signed and value generation from emissions reductions), de-risk early stage investments, and enable high-risk, high-impact projects. There may be a role here for venture philanthropy</strong>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://perma.cc/XZD4-L2RL\"><u>WEF and McKinsey &amp; Company, 2021</u></a>). <a href=\"https://perma.cc/3V9J-3KT5\"><u>Emergent\u2019s (2021a)</u></a>&nbsp;flexible contracting model&nbsp;provides one such example.</p><h3>4. Establishment of a clear regulatory framework can allow countries to use forest-related carbon credits to help meet their Paris Agreement goals</h3><p><strong>Clear and coherent regulatory frameworks will help to align the market for forest-related carbon credits with international climate goals under the Paris Agreement</strong>&nbsp;to ensure that global average temperature rise does not exceed 2\u00b0C. For instance, emissions reductions from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LmjsyFvQavLQnYSTp/the-redd-framework-for-reducing-deforestation-and-mitigating#Jurisdictional_REDD__is_a_promising_anti_deforestation_intervention\"><u>jurisdictional approaches to REDD+</u></a>&nbsp;count toward a country\u2019s nationally determined contribution, and \u201cnesting\u201d \u2014 i.e., embedding individual REDD+ projects into jurisdictional programs \u2014 can bring project-based REDD+ into alignment with the Paris framework and remove the risk of double counting. For example, Peru\u2019s pilot scheme strikes emissions reductions from non-jurisdictional REDD+ projects that were sold as credits internationally from its own emissions reduction inventory (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/XZD4-L2RL\"><u>WEF and McKinsey &amp; Company, 2021</u></a>, p. 28, Box 10).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxky16zy5759\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxky16zy5759\">[40]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Additionally, <strong>inclusion of forest credits in compliance markets would greatly increase the scale of demand</strong>; for example, Colombia\u2019s carbon tax compliance can be met through purchase of voluntary carbon market credits (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220523002246/https://verra.org/data-insights/colombia/july-2020/\"><u>Verra, 2020a</u></a>).</p><p>The International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) posits that costs &nbsp;to 2030 of meeting nationally determined contributions (NDCs) \u2014 non-binding pledges that enshrine countries\u2019 emissions reductions targets (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/FWC4-KKXQ\"><u>UNFCCC, 2014</u></a>) \u2014 could be halved to $250 billion annually, or abatement enhanced by 5 GtCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;holding costs constant, under an international carbon market (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/VTY5-3USJ\"><u>Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition and IETA, 2019</u></a>, p. 1). We did not investigate the likelihood that such a market is established under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. In 2021, 32 countries committed to adopt the San Jos\u00e9 Principles for High Ambition and Integrity in International Carbon Markets&nbsp;that they agree should guide such an international carbon market, despite the lack of a consensus thus far, which may pave a path toward future progress on this front (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/B2WB-MGL5\"><u>Direcci\u00f3n de Cambio Clim\u00e1tico, 2021</u></a>).</p><h1>We estimate the cost-effectiveness of REDD+ to fall in the range of $6-$62/tCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;abated (80% confidence), excluding co-benefits</h1><p>Our favored estimation of cost per ton for emissions reductions from deforestation comes from a report by the World Economic Forum and McKinsey &amp; Company, which appears to err on the conservative side (i.e., higher $/tCO2) relative to other estimates we came across in the literature. We make crude adjustments to their estimates to account for issues discussed in the section on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LmjsyFvQavLQnYSTp/the-redd-framework-for-reducing-deforestation-and-mitigating#Payments_for_ecosystem_services_programs_appear_effective_but_have_important_flaws\"><u>payments for ecosystem services</u></a>&nbsp;\u2014 primarily additionality and permanence \u2014 leading us to formulate a best guess of cost-effectiveness in the range of $6-62/tCO2 with 80% confidence. While we do our best to account for the possibility of overstating cost-effectiveness by adjusting for these model omissions, two reasons we may be understating cost-effectiveness is that McKinsey\u2019s model uses a fairly high discount rate and it does not account for seemingly sizable co-benefits. We did not have time to assess the extent to which incorporating related changes may impact our estimate.</p><h2>A World Economic Forum (WEF) and McKinsey &amp; Company consultation&nbsp;estimates that a majority of forest conservation can be achieved for $10-$50/tCO<sub>2</sub></h2><p><a href=\"https://perma.cc/XZD4-L2RL\"><u>WEF and McKinsey &amp; Company\u2019s (2021)</u></a>&nbsp;consultation report undertakes a fairly rigorous cost-effectiveness analysis (see notes on their methodology in the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LmjsyFvQavLQnYSTp/the-redd-framework-for-reducing-deforestation-and-mitigating#Appendix__WEF_and_McKinsey_s_marginal_abatement_cost_curve_methodology\"><u>Appendix</u></a>). Based on literature reviews and expert interviews, they create an aggregate natural climate solutions (NCS) carbon credit cost curve that derives information from more detailed cost curves for each country deemed high-potential (i.e., representing 70% of their conservative estimate of potential, so that 2.2 GtCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;is not costed). They find that NCS carbon credit costs generally lie in the $10-$40/tCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;range depending on geography and type of NCS, which is \u201csignificantly lower than technology-based removal\u201d (p. 14), but that forestry is one of the most expensive forms of NCS, at approximately $30/tCO<sub>2</sub>:</p><blockquote><p>What drives high costs for avoided deforestation is land efficiency. As a rule of thumb, protecting 100ha in an area where there is a 1% annual deforestation rate will yield credits for avoiding the emissions from the deforestation of 1ha per year. In practice, land costs can be funded by other parties such as national governments or NGOs. In these circumstances, avoided deforestation is lower cost than reforestation due to lower maintenance costs. Our cost estimates were calculated based on typical deforestation rates per country. While avoided deforestation may incur higher costs in places, it is worth noting that it also carries the potential to bring about more substantial co-benefits than other pathways. (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/XZD4-L2RL\"><u>WEF and McKinsey &amp; Company, 2021</u></a>, p. 14)</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://perma.cc/XZD4-L2RL\"><u>WEF and McKinsey &amp; Company\u2019s (2021)</u></a>&nbsp;analysis indicates significant regional variation in project cost and abatement potential (p. 14, Figure 4b). For instance, high-feasibility projects to avoid deforestation and peatland impact in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Republic of the Congo, Bolivia, and Venezuela jointly have the potential to abate about 0.2 GtCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;annually at a cost of $5/tCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;or less, while such a project in Brazil alone could accomplish similar (perhaps slightly higher) emissions reductions albeit for about $20/tCO<sub>2</sub>. From eyeballing the figure, it appears that <strong>a vast majority of medium- to high-feasibility carbon reductions from anti-deforestation initiatives have a cost-effectiveness of $10-$50/tCO<sub>2</sub>.</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3yav250enfb\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3yav250enfb\">[41]</a></sup></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>From a global social planner\u2019s perspective of maximizing social welfare cost-effectively, one should first finance the lowest-cost projects (i.e., starting with cover crops in India, which are cost-saving on net) and work one\u2019s way up to the most expensive projects (i.e., medium-feasibility avoided deforestation and peatland impact projects in Malaysia).</p><p>We are impressed with <a href=\"https://perma.cc/XZD4-L2RL\"><u>WEF and McKinsey &amp; Company\u2019s (2021)</u></a>&nbsp;methodology.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxhla9pdxgnn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxhla9pdxgnn\">[42]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It seems worth noting that they use quite a high discount rate (10%) to calculate net present values of future emissions abatement in their model. We tend to believe&nbsp;that a 10% discount rate is too high, since much of the literature on discount rates in climate economics debates&nbsp;whether setting discount rates to match market interest rates (which are generally well below 10%) is unethical, where some argue that discount rates should instead be much lower,&nbsp;placing closer to equal weight on future value generation (see, e.g., <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203095201\"><u>Groom, 2014</u></a>).&nbsp;On the other hand, upon a quick scan of the experimental development economics literature, it seems that high discount rates are empirically quite common in developing countries (even up to 34%; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ajae/aar067\"><u>Duquette et al. 2011</u></a>, p. 451; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00220380701848327\"><u>Cardenas and Carpenter, 2008</u></a>, p. 325). It seems likely to us that the marginal abatement cost (MAC)&nbsp;curve<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmsqh5ksao7o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmsqh5ksao7o\">[43]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;would be fairly sensitive to updates in the discount rate, though we are not sure to what extent. Nonetheless, we speculate that lowering the discount rate would meaningfully increase benefits and therefore cost-effectiveness outputs in their model.</p><p>Importantly, not all projects <a href=\"https://perma.cc/XZD4-L2RL\"><u>WEF and McKinsey &amp; Company (2021)</u></a>&nbsp;consider are REDD+ projects, but instead they consider multiple types of anti-deforestation projects targeted at tropical countries.

A more policy-relevant figure may be the international financial flows required to support significant reductions in deforestation, as distinct from efforts within tropical forest countries. <strong>New research indicates that cost-effective implementation of current NDCs would entail about 1 billion tonnes of international REDD+ transactions per year (over and above what countries would do domestically) at prices of $10-$20 through 2035.

This overview is by no means exhaustive of potential opportunities for high-impact funding.</p><p>In our conversation with Lubowski, he mentioned several <strong>well-considered and immediately actionable funding opportunities on the CLUA website</strong>, so we would recommend taking those as a starting point (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/8ZXT-Q72Z\"><u>CLUA, 2021</u></a>).</p><p>Lubowski also recommended <strong>committing funds for results-based jurisdictional REDD+ payments and supporting the recipient countries in setting up their programs.</strong>&nbsp;One reason we agree that this could be a promising opportunity is that the jurisdictional REDD+ infrastructure is still fairly new, and philanthropists are well-placed to provide financing in a risk-neutral manner that will help to build market function and competence, paving the way for future financing from risk-averse parties. We are not sure which organizations or actions to recommend in this undertaking, but we would recommend starting by speaking with <a href=\"https://www.emergentclimate.com/\"><u>Emergent</u></a>.</p><p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://perma.cc/XZD4-L2RL\"><u>WEF and McKinsey &amp; Company (2021)</u></a>&nbsp;explicitly mention a <strong>potential role for venture philanthropists to fill the need for bridging temporal gaps in the financing of REDD+ projects,</strong>&nbsp;for instance between project conception and actual credit generation (p. 26). When asked where they would give money if they were in a position to make a large donation, multiple experts mentioned support for jurisdictional REDD+, including conservation trusts, public-private partnerships, jurisdictions that will implement REDD+ programs, and commitments to results-based payments. Supporting jurisdictional REDD+ projects is also one of <a href=\"https://perma.cc/TYN8-V7T7\"><u>CLUA\u2019s (2022)</u></a>&nbsp;four \u201cforest protection\u201d funding recommendations.</p><p>For large donors interested in identifying high-impact projects at a given point in time, and who are willing to pay a consultancy fee, we recommend liaising directly with McKinsey\u2019s Nature Analytics team.</p><p>One interesting route that <a href=\"https://perma.cc/XZD4-L2RL\"><u>WEF and McKinsey&nbsp;&amp; Company (2021)</u></a>&nbsp;have highlighted is the role of financial intermediation (p. 27). There may be a role for venture philanthropy in addressing cash flow gaps and cushioning early-stage investment risks.</p><p><strong>We also sympathize with Carvalho\u2019s inclination toward supporting those who research the chief concerns of the REDD+ model</strong>&nbsp;(e.g., additionality, permanence, leakage, and MRV), and who identify innovative solutions to address those concerns, so that the lack of rigorously researched solutions does not further stall the effective implementation of forest PES schemes. Carvalho suggested that support for such research could catalyze the development of a more robust global market for forest credits to more urgently address ongoing forest loss. For instance, abstracting from feasibility momentarily, an RCT with a simple design could go a long way toward resolving uncertainties around impermanence \u2014 for example, a study may suggest it is beneficial to remove PES payments after a contracting period for a control subset&nbsp;of projects (globally or within a jurisdiction) in line with the status quo, while maintaining those payments for a treated subset to compare forest loss outcomes.</p><p>Moreover, given the seemingly critical issue of poor degradation measurement, we would be <strong>curious to understand the extent to which funding high-resolution satellite data capture or access could help to resolve such consequential measurement error</strong>. We are aware of a few organizations working in this space, including Pachama&nbsp;and Space Intelligence.</p><p>Finally, we would research opportunities to leverage funding across poverty alleviation, biodiversity, sustainable agriculture, gender equity (e.g., the World Bank\u2019s EnABLE&nbsp;program; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/34LD-XUHD\"><u>World Bank, 2021</u></a>), and forest loss prevention initiatives.&nbsp;For instance, <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.aaz1298\"><u>Ferraro and Simorangkir (2020)</u></a>&nbsp;find that a large-scale anti-poverty program in Indonesia that provides conditional cash transfers to households for meeting certain health- and education-related criteria led to a reduction in deforestation. Thus, <strong>in some contexts,</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4fnx1ctp3qk\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4fnx1ctp3qk\">[56]</a></sup></span><strong>&nbsp;targeting poverty alleviation programs for forest (fringe) dwellers seems likely to provide a sizable additional benefit in terms of reduced deforestation</strong>.&nbsp;Given the significant funding that is directed toward poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation, it seems that a donor could have significant impact in forging connections and fostering awareness of shared benefits so that projects optimizing across all of these outcomes are prioritized.</p><p>We came across some other organizations during our research that may potentially be promising (e.g., Conservation International), but we did not have time to research these in any depth.</p><h2>Further research into other interventions</h2><p>Our primary focus has been on payments for ecosystem services in part due to the focus of&nbsp;EA organizations on the Coalition for Rainforest Nations in recent years, mainly due to its apparent status&nbsp;as the most viable and advanced coordinated forest loss prevention solution (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/ASS6-35L6\"><u>Halstead, 2018</u></a>). <strong>Further work could dig more deeply into the merits of alternative and potentially complementary approaches, such as targeting improved supply chains or shifting forest product demand.</strong></p><h2>Further research into climate&nbsp;impacts of forests</h2><p>We would additionally like to <strong>spend more time engaging with the academic debate&nbsp; regarding tropical forests\u2019 net climate impacts</strong>&nbsp;(e.g., see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-019-00122-z\"><u>Popkin, 2019</u></a>), and perhaps interviewing subject-matter experts to gain a deeper understanding. We would also like to get a sense of the distribution of primary uses for tree products to get a better sense of aggregate climate impacts.</p><h2>Additional ways we would spend more time</h2><ul><li>Conduct extensive research to identify the best giving opportunities in the broader NCS space (in particular peatlands, as these were mentioned in conversation on a few occasions as a potentially highly important and neglected area, as well as mangroves; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/conl.12445\"><u>Fernanda Adame et al., 2017</u></a>)</li><li>Reach out to more experts to resolve some of our remaining uncertainties. Some experts with whom we might initially aim to engage include Frances Seymour (WRI), Seema Jayachandran and Pam Jagger (as recommended by Justin Labeille from Giving Green), an MRV practitioner at Space Intelligence (or other REDD+ MRV specialist), and an expert in anti-deforestation carbon accounting \u2014 preferably one who has worked on setting up or piloting accounting systems for jurisdictional REDD+ \u2014 regarding the challenges&nbsp;to jurisdictional REDD+&nbsp;that we and others have identified, as well as challenges and conventions in MRV.

Costs included land costs (to acquire or rent the area of land to implement NCS, plus other costs like land taxes), initial project costs (e.g., legal, administration, site preparation), recurring project costs (e.g., labor, maintenance, security, overhead, and community payment), and carbon credit monetization costs (e.g., validation, verification, issuance; excludes marketing).</p><p>The team used <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-019-0485-x\"><u>Busch et al.\u2019s (2019)</u></a>&nbsp;land-cover change model to identify areas at risk of deforestation by 2050, which would lead to emissions on the order of just under 260 GtCO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;(for reference, total anthropogenic annual emissions are about 40 GtCO<sub>2</sub>, so this amount corresponds to about 6.5 years of current annual anthropogenic emissions).

And so that translates into around 40 Toggl hours, like 35 to 40 Toggl hours a week. And then, then the fraction of those that are spent on key priorities.

This isn't even half an order of magnitude, so you might expect work hours to be unimportant relative to working on the right problems.</p><p>This leads us to the second reason to think you should try working harder, which is that\u2014especially early in your career\u2014working more hours has superlinear returns because it increases the growth rate of your career. This can be true even if your short-term productivity stagnates or decreases. A good take on this:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M44i4CiMECP5Xoorz/demandingness-and-time-money-tradeoffs-are-orthogonal?commentId=BTyN8AzMNNJfBcBwK\"><u>\"One extremely under-rated impact of working harder is that you learn more. You have sub-linear short-term impact with increasing work hours because of things like burnout, or even just using up the best opportunities, but long-term you have super-linear impact (as long as you apply good epistemics) because you just complete more operational cycles and try more ideas about how to do the work.\"</u></a></p><p>A third reason is that burnout risk might be overrated if most of your impact comes from the small chance of you being a very high performer, perhaps because being 99th percentile is 100+ times better than being 90th percentile. This makes studying the habits of top performers even more useful because the survivorship bias is less important.</p><p><strong>Addendum: stimulants</strong></p><p>Consider&nbsp;<a href=\"https://troof.blog/posts/nootropics/\"><u>this large nootropics survey</u></a> and the metric \"probability of life-changing effect\":</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671136713/mirroredImages/FFY8zfkQq3qdELyvm/vddlymaut6vmmhnrzmtf.jpg\" alt=\"rating_life_changing\"></p><p>Famous intellectuals, artists, and statesmen throughout history often took stimulants, sometimes in copious amounts.

This contest was GiveWell's most successful effort so far to solicit external criticism from the public, and it wouldn't have been possible without the participation of people who share our goal of allocating funding to cost-effective programs.</p>\n<p>Overall, we received 49 entries engaging with our <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/change-our-mind-contest#Requirements\">prompts</a>. We were very happy with the quality of entries we received\u2014their authors brought a great deal of thought and expertise to engaging with our cost-effectiveness analyses.</p>\n<p><strong>Because we were impressed by the quality of entries, we've decided to award two first-place prizes and eight honorable mentions.</strong> (We <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/change-our-mind-contest#What_are_the_prizes\">stated in September</a> that we would give a minimum of one first-place, one runner-up, and one honorable mention prize.) We also awarded $20,000 to the piece of criticism that inspired this contest.</p>\n<p>Winners are listed below, followed by our reflections on this contest and responses to the winners.</p>\n<h2>The prize-winners</h2>\n<p>Given the overall quality of the entries we received, selecting a set of winners required a lot of deliberation.</p>\n<p>We're still in the process of determining which critiques to incorporate into our cost-effectiveness analyses and to what extent they'll change the bottom line; we don't agree with all the critiques in the first-place and honorable mention entries, but each prize-winner raised issues that we believe were worth considering.

These entries came from a wide range of people\u2014from health economists and from people in entirely unrelated fields, from the global health community and from the effective altruism community, from students and from professionals with years of work experience.</p>\n<p>People submitted entries on many different topics. We received at least two entries on each of the six cost-effectiveness analyses we pointed people toward, plus some entries on other programs, and many cross-cutting entries on issues like uncertainty, the discount rate for future benefits, our moral weights, and more.</p>\n<p>In order to manage all the suggestions we received, one of our researchers reviewed all 49 entries and created a dashboard for tracking the 100 discrete suggestions we identified. For each of those, we're tracking whether we plan to do additional work to address the suggestion and how high-priority that work is.</p>\n<p>We're so glad that people were excited to contribute to our decision-making, and we'll be continuing to look for ways to collaborate with the public to improve our work.</p>\n<p><strong>We have room for improvement, particularly on transparency.</strong></p>\n<p>We\u2019re proud of being an unusually transparent research organization; transparency is one of our core values. Transparency has two facets: making information publicly available, and also making it easy to understand. We generally succeed at publishing the information that drives our decisions. But, we could do more to enable people to understand why we believe what we believe.</p>\n<p>Some entries proposed changes that are actually very similar to what we\u2019re already doing, but where the authors didn\u2019t realize that because of the way our work is presented (e.g., a calculation takes place in a separate spreadsheet, or the name of a parameter doesn\u2019t clearly represent its purpose). In other cases, entries flagged areas where the assumptions underlying our judgments aren't apparent (e.g., in the case of development effects from averted cases of malaria). We appreciate these authors bringing those issues to our attention, and we hope to improve the clarity of our work!</p>\n<p><strong>People brought us new ideas\u2014and old ones we hadn\u2019t implemented.</strong></p>\n<p>Some entries covered ideas we hadn't considered but found worth pursuing. For example, an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2gG7eeDD5uqud4Rfm/cost-effectiveness-of-iron-fortification-in-india-is-lower\">entry</a> arguing that iron fortification might be less cost-effective than we think inspired us to dig into the questions it raised about the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia in India. In this case, our current best guess is that our view on iron fortification won't change much, but we believe it's worthwhile for us to consider this issue.</p>\n<p>Other entries covered issues we were aware of but hadn't resolved. For example, we've known for a while that a calculation in our cost-effectiveness analysis for the Against Malaria Foundation is both poorly structured and presented in a confusing way. A few entries flagged perceived issues with how we calculate mortality in that analysis, and some authors thought the calculations were mistaken in a way that would have a significant impact on our bottom line (e.g., some entries understandably believed we'd failed to account for indirect deaths from malaria). We don't think any of these entries captured the precise problem with the current calculation, but they homed in on a weak point in our analysis. Several months ago we created a revised version of our internal analysis that fixes the issue, but we haven't yet finalized and published it. We're likely to publish this revision in the next few months. In general, people flagging a known issue can help us prioritize changes.</p>\n<p><strong>This contest was worth doing.</strong></p>\n<p>We haven't done anything like this before, and we weren't really sure what to expect. We saw this as an opportunity to lean into our <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/about/values\">values</a>, particularly transparency and truth-seeking, in service of helping people as much as we can with our funding decisions. The contest succeeded in that goal;&nbsp;we identified improvements we can make to our cost-effectiveness analyses in terms of both accuracy and clarity. And beyond that, this contest established that there are people who care deeply about our work and want to help us improve it. To everyone who participated\u2014thank you!</p>\n<h2>Appendix: Discussion of winning entries</h2>\n<p>In this section, we share our initial thoughts on the two first-place entries.</p>\n<h3>Noah Haber on uncertainty</h3>\n<p>Several entries focused on how GiveWell could improve its approach to uncertainty. <a href=\"https://www.metacausal.com/givewells-uncertainty-problem/\">This entry</a> stood out for its clear demonstration of how failing to account for uncertainty can lead to suboptimal allocations, even in a risk-neutral framework.</p>\n<p>In brief, this entry argues that when prioritizing by estimated expected value, one will sometimes select more uncertain programs whose true values are lower, over less uncertain programs whose true values are higher. This \"optimizer's curse\" or \"winner's curse\" can create a portfolio that is systematically less valuable than it could be if uncertainty was properly accounted for. This issue has been raised before, but we haven't ever fully addressed it.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-F7qDBFJyBpGoiZAHd-2\" id=\"fnref-F7qDBFJyBpGoiZAHd-2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>We'd like to consider the issues presented in this post and other recent criticisms of our approach to uncertainty in more depth. In the meantime, we'll share some initial thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We really appreciated that this piece drew a clear link between incorporating uncertainty and the ranking of programs. It shows that if we don\u2019t account for uncertainty explicitly, we may be allocating too much funding to more uncertain programs, which lowers the value of our overall funding allocation.</li>\n<li>Currently, we make ad hoc adjustments for uncertainty, such as our strict internal validity adjustment for deworming. However, we haven\u2019t adopted any rules for penalizing more uncertain programs, either quantitatively or qualitatively. This entry updates us toward believing we should consider a more systematic approach.</li>\n<li>We\u2019re not sure if conducting the full uncertainty modeling recommended by the entry is the right approach for GiveWell, and we\u2019d like to explore alternative approaches to addressing this issue.\n<ul>\n<li>The entry argues the best approach would be to model uncertainty using a probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). This would involve selecting and parameterizing probability distributions for key parameters; running repeat simulations to obtain a distribution of potential outcomes; and using this distribution as the basis for decision-making.</li>\n<li>We\u2019re not sure if this is the right approach because we think there could be some important drawbacks. It could limit accessibility of our models externally, make it difficult to compare across models if we\u2019re unsure if uncertainty is being equally accounted for across programs, and make it harder to understand intuitively what\u2019s driving our bottom line on which programs are more cost-effective. We would want to weigh those downsides against the benefits of PSA.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>On the other hand, if we find that this problem leads to a sufficiently large impact on the value of our allocations, it might be worth the costs of a more complicated modeling approach. We\u2019d like to do more work to explore how big of an impact this problem has on our portfolio.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, we think handling uncertainty is an important issue, and we appreciate the nudge to consider it more deeply!</p>\n<h3>Matthew Romer and Paul Romer Present on water</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6cJM2pWH8dz9TnBRy/an-examination-of-givewell-s-water-quality-intervention-cost#Potential_Issues_Found\">This entry</a> clearly presented a series of plausible changes to how we estimate the cost-effectiveness of water quality interventions, specifically Dispensers for Safe Water (DSW) and in-line chlorination (ILC). We believe the authors understand our analysis well and were able to identify some weak points in our cost-effectiveness analysis; we expect to make some but not all of the changes they propose.</p>\n<p>To briefly summarize in our own words, this entry suggests that GiveWell should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Include Haushofer et al. (2021) in its meta-analysis on the effect of water chlorination on all-cause mortality.</li>\n<li>Use a formal Bayesian approach rather than a \"plausibility cap\" to estimate the effect of water chlorination on all-cause mortality.</li>\n<li>Revise our estimate for the age distribution of deaths averted by water chlorination, as well as for the medical costs averted.</li>\n<li>Discount both future costs and future benefits to account for changes over time.</li>\n<li>Revise the cost estimates for ILC.</li>\n<li>Review a calculation in our leverage and funging adjustment that they believe may contain an error.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We share some initial thoughts here, noting that we're still in the process of deciding whether and how to incorporate these suggestions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Including Haushofer et al.:</strong> The choice to exclude Haushofer et al. was difficult, but we're currently comfortable with our decision to exclude it. See more on <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/water-quality-interventions\">this page</a>, including in footnote 39. For our practical decision-making (versus a context like Cochrane meta-analyses where stricter decision rules might be needed), we think it makes sense to exclude it given (a) the fact that we find the implied intervention effect implausible across the 95% confidence interval; (b) the divergence of these results from the other strongest pieces of evidence we have; and (c) the large effect that including it would have on the pooled result.</li>\n<li><strong>Using a formal Bayesian approach:</strong> We're planning to consider this in more depth. Estimating effect sizes is difficult in cases where the point estimates from available evidence seem implausibly high to us. As the authors note, we've used a Bayesian approach in some of our other analyses (e.g., deworming), and it might be reasonable to use here. The plausibility cap we're currently using seems like one reasonable approach in this context, but we haven't fully explored other approaches. If we don't move to a Bayesian approach, we may still make other changes inspired by this point.</li>\n<li><strong>Revising the ages of deaths averted and medical costs averted:</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>On the ages of deaths averted: We think it's reasonable to use the age structure of direct deaths from enteric infections for indirect deaths as well because those deaths are still linked to enteric infections, based on the idea that enteric infections increase the risk of other diseases.</li>\n<li>On medical costs averted: Our published cost-effectiveness analysis uses an outdated method to estimate medical costs averted by water quality interventions, and we're now internally using a method that we believe is better aligned with our analyses for interventions like those conducted by our <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Discounting future benefits and costs:</strong> We hadn't realized that we're treating future deaths differently in the New Incentives analysis\u2014thank you for flagging that. For grants where the benefits occur more than a few years in the future (like <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/evidence-action-dispensers-for-safe-water-January-2022?utm_source=GiveWell+Mailing+List&amp;utm_campaign=5d6844f88e-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_update-12-2022&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_f0388bd490-5d6844f88e-2184829\">this Dispensers for Safe Water grant</a>), we generally want to account for both changing disease burdens (in this case, a decline in deaths from diarrhea) and general uncertainty over time, and we didn't do that in this case. We're less sure that we'd want to discount costs (versus benefits) in the future, given (a) consistency with our other analyses and (b) the fact that from our perspective, the costs are \"spent\" when we decide to make a grant.</li>\n<li><strong>Revising costs of ILC:</strong> It's true that we're using very rough cost figures for ILC in our published analysis. We expect to learn more over time and incorporate that in future analyses we publish.</li>\n<li><strong>Reviewing funging calculation:</strong> This seems like a likely error (that makes a small difference to the bottom line). We'll correct it if upon further review we confirm that it's an error!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our best guess overall is that after more thoroughly reviewing these suggestions, we'll revise our water quality cost-effectiveness analysis and our estimate of the cost-effectiveness of Dispensers for Safe Water will change by very roughly 5 to 10%.</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-F7qDBFJyBpGoiZAHd-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Both of these entries were outstanding, and they represent very different approaches.

I still think the arguments I made here are good, but the case for it might be less strong than I thought while writing it as the organizations are more transparent than I previously thought.</i></p><h2>Context</h2><p>Recently, the purchase of Wytham Abbey came in the spotlight: The purchase by Effective Ventures of a (15 million pound?) manor house. On Twitter and on the forum, people&nbsp;have held extensive discussions on whether the expense was justified. I personally was very surprised, which is why I made a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey\"><u>forum post</u></a>&nbsp;requesting an explanation. (Currently, I\u2019m still slightly sceptical but I\u2019m happy I now understand the reasoning behind it a lot better.)</p><p>Because of the purchase, the idea that Effective Ventures/CEA should be more transparent about large expenses has been brought up more often. I agree with that idea, and try to defend it here.</p><p>I added footnotes/links when I have a source for the (counter) argument. They may have been made regarding a different formulation of my proposal or a slightly different proposal, but are nonetheless worth mentioning. I sometimes rewrote arguments and may have misunderstood their original meaning, so don\u2019t interpret my rewritings as the original authors\u2019 intentions. I just want&nbsp;to credit where I got the ideas from. I have no experience at all with funding projects, so there might be practical things I\u2019ve overlooked.</p><h2>My proposal</h2><p>All spending above a certain threshold by EA organisations should be publicly explained</p><ul><li>The threshold should be high enough so it doesn\u2019t take away too much time from grantmakers/employees (ex. $500k, 1 million pounds)</li><li>The more concerned people might be about the expense, or the more influential the expense is, the more time and effort should be put into the explanation</li><li>The public explanation should be some kind of cost-benefit analysis and clearly state the reasons for the purchase including positives, potential negatives and counterfactuals in layman's terms.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefplnylvw9z1j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnplnylvw9z1j\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Precise numbers are admirable but not always necessary. \u201cWorst case\u201d and \u201cbest case\u201d scenarios with some kind of probability distribution might be helpful.</li><li>The explanations should be published within a reasonable timeframe (ex. within a month after the purchase/grant is made, every quarter,...). This timeframe should be made clear so that people can expect when to get an explanation of something. The sooner after the purchase, the better.</li></ul><p>The EA organisations could be: Effective Ventures and the organisations that fall under it (CEA, 80,000 Hours, Forethought Foundation, EA Funds, Giving What We Can, The Centre for the Governance of AI, Longview Philanthropy, asterisk, non-trivial, BlueDot Impact), Open Philanthropy, GiveWell, Animal Charity Evaluators,... I think the case is the strongest for Effective Ventures and CEA since they represent the EA movement, so they should be held to the highest standards.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftcqcilqi5r9\"><sup><a href=\"#fntcqcilqi5r9\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>I haven\u2019t reviewed every organisation. Some might already do a great job. For example, I get the impression that <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/all-grants%23Database_of_all_GiveWell_grants\"><u>GiveWell</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/georgetown-university-center-for-security-and-emerging-technology/\"><u>Open Philanthropy</u></a>&nbsp;do a better job at explaining grants than <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/grants\"><u>EA Funds</u></a>&nbsp;does (except for EAIF they often only use one sentence, even with million dollar grants).</p><p>I\u2019m highly confident some variation of my&nbsp;proposal should be done if the grant is made using individual/small donations, I think it\u2019s reasonable to claim you owe explanations to your donors. The case is less strong when the donor of the grant is just one or two people (like with Wytham Abbey/Open Philanthropy), but I\u2019m still quite confident it\u2019s important in those cases too. You may not owe an explanation to individual/small donors, but rather to the EA community as a whole.</p><p>Should this be some kind of official rule every EA organisation must follow? No, but I\u2019d be happy to see some organisations (especially Effective Ventures/CEA) try it out. Different organisations can try different thresholds and use different rules for their public explanations.</p><p>Similar proposals have been <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GYttpoavExSjcfZFs/ftx-cea-show-us-your-numbers\"><u>made</u></a> <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nxeL7XFvtQCx7hpxo/everyone-show-us-your-numbers\"><u>before</u></a>.</p><p>Holden Karnofsky (co-CEO of&nbsp;Open Philanthropy) <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gTaDDJFDzqe7jnTWG/some-thoughts-on-public-discourse\"><u>has also written interesting</u></a>&nbsp;thoughts related to this before. It\u2019s a bit different from what I\u2019m proposing but I\u2019m happy to see some overlap.</p><h2>Arguments for my proposal</h2><p>Even though I\u2019ve split up the arguments, I feel like they often overlap quite a bit.</p><h3>Transparency</h3><p>I\u2019m for the most part a consequentialist, and I think being more transparent generally leads to better consequences. Perhaps you disagree it generally leads to better consequences. But given moral uncertainty, I would argue transparency is also just a very important virtue to strive for. Neither I, or the EA movement is purely consequentialist. I think transparency fits well within the values of effective altruism as described in points 3 and 4 <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism%23what-values-unite-effective-altruism:~:text%3DOpen%2520truthseeking%253A,a%2520better%2520world.\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672420802/mirroredImages/4iLeA9uwdAqXS3Jpc/bncc0kvcxbdeqxcgm0ee.png\" alt=\"\">&nbsp;</p><p>Transparency isn\u2019t explicitly mentioned. But it\u2019s difficult to do open truthseeking&nbsp;if we lack information/details.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv6ky20euo0c\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv6ky20euo0c\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In my view, transparency is a form of honesty, or at least closely related. Being transparent is also a way to be a good citizen. It is something I'd expect of any charity/NGO that values effectiveness and empirical backing.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefih1m0xrskb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnih1m0xrskb\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;And sharing information surrounding decisions is helpful for the wider EA community. This way the expenses themselves can also be talked about and openly criticised by the community. I\u2019m not arguing that expenses should be deliberated by the whole community before being spent. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey?commentId%3DbAMYo6X89KDEKt6qK\"><u>Accountability and transparency does not mean voting by consensus or committee.</u></a></p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey?commentId%3DDihqkRnmcJHEoHGyy\"><u>This comment</u></a>&nbsp;by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/lastmistborn\"><u>lastmistborn</u></a>&nbsp;captures my thoughts on this really well:</p><blockquote><p>I feel like the value of this kind of transparency would by far outweigh the costs in time and effort by setting a good example and \"practising what you preach\" alone. As a major representative of EA and a major funding body, CEA should hold itself to the same standards of cost effectiveness and transparency that we would expect of other NGOs. Additionally, having to publish a writeup like that would incentivize rigorous and clear thinking, and seeing the calculations and reasoning in action would make CEA's general approach clearer. I think it's reasonable to expect a report on spending choices and the reasoning behind them ~every 3-6 months if doing it on an item-by-item basis is too burdensome.</p></blockquote><p>Relatedly, having long write ups can help signal thoughtfulness even if people aren\u2019t actually going to read them.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi2tzpqnhvb\"><sup><a href=\"#fni2tzpqnhvb\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><h3>Effectiveness</h3><p>If EA organisations publish their explanations (the forum is likely a good place for this, aside from their own website), other EAs&nbsp;are able to give feedback/criticism. The organisations can take these into account for the future, which might improve the effectiveness of their next expenses. This alone could make up for the time spent on writing the explanations. Other EA organisations can also benefit from the explanations/feedback, thus improving their spending as well.</p><p>Somewhat related: We should be careful about our effectiveness being reduced because of lavishness. 2 or 3 years ago I would\u2019ve agreed that EA\u2019s generally need to spend a lot more on reducing time and increasing comfort to increase productivity. But now I\u2019m starting to get concerned some are taking that reasoning too far, rationalising bad spending and thus reducing effectiveness.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsr12hsw9unr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsr12hsw9unr\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><h3>Optics</h3><p>With any controversial expense you'll get people who become sceptical of EA. That's unavoidable. But it\u2019s good for anything that might be controversial to have some explanation ready, so that at least our target audience (those interested in having an impact, those with more of a scout mindset) will hopefully read it. This way we don't lose out on potential EA's. It's also bad to wait to give an explanation until there's criticism.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwnbtjfbh2ld\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwnbtjfbh2ld\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I wish I didn't have to make the Wytham Abbey forum post and that I could just link an explanation to critics instead. (Though <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey?commentId%3D3cLRAk98q8jMwhrEc\"><u>it now appears</u></a>&nbsp;that the purchase was made through Open Philanthropy and they're just behind on publishing grants, which makes the situation a lot more understandable).</p><p>As a general rule when making purchases, EA orgs shouldn\u2019t put too much weight on optics. Like <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey?commentId%3Du3yJfbm2pes8TFpYX\"><u>Owen said</u></a>, it\u2019s more important to do actual good things than things that look good. But in some cases, optics could seriously affect the consequences in expectation and then the expense should be reconsidered. I think having explanations ready would likely help with optics, if only slightly. (With Wytham Abbey, I\u2019m both worried that it wasn\u2019t a cost-effective purchase and that the optics could result in it being even less effective or potentially harmful, but I'm becoming more optimistic).</p><p>A highly relevant and great <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey?commentId%3DDJ9RHm8X5ptaPEJPm\"><u>comment by jacquesthibs</u></a>.</p><h2>Responding to arguments against this proposal</h2><h3>\u201cWriting things for the public is a large use of time, since you want to be especially careful and good with language.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefooj2hxvenx\"><sup><a href=\"#fnooj2hxvenx\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It could slow down grant-making and other projects by the EA orgs too much.\u201d</h3><p>Thinking through the costs and benefits must be done anyway with large grants, plus writing it down could help with thinking through the expense. The cost in time of writing it in careful and good language is worth it for the sake of transparency. To reduce time spent writing, you can sometimes just refer to more general posts written in the past (ex. similar to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DYMbpPoz9hWQ%26t%3D2914s%26ab_channel%3DCentreforEffectiveAltruism\"><u>what Open Philanthropy did</u></a>&nbsp;with their explainer on transformative AI).</p><h3>\u201cThings that are mostly good for 2nd or 3rd order effects may not have numerical cost-benefit analyses, but rather arguments where someone has judged the balance\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo8ipkka20w8\"><sup><a href=\"#fno8ipkka20w8\">[9]</a></sup></span></h3><p>I don\u2019t think the cost-benefit analysis always needs to be completely numerical.

This would be concerning, but I believe it could be solved. Perhaps instead of a threshold it can be something more gradual, for example: Everything above $100k should be published, and the higher the amount the higher the minimum amount of words for the explanation should be. (I'm not saying this example is perfect)</li><li>What constitutes an expense? Does ex. \u201c600k to the community health team\u201d fall under it? Or the individual wages/expenses within the community health team? Where do you draw the line? How do you group expenses together? I don't have a good answer to this, but I feel like there has to be some kind of system that would work well.</li><li>Perhaps the threshold shouldn\u2019t be monetary, but rather based on a degree of potential controversy? This sounds very difficult to put into practice though. Perhaps anything above a monetary threshold has to be explained, plus anything under it that might be influential or controversial.</li><li>\u201cIt raises the barrier for people to do projects through EA, since it exposes them to bad faith criticism for every single detail from uninformed (and very often bad faith) individuals\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcs75yvqr6en\"><sup><a href=\"#fncs75yvqr6en\">[12]</a></sup></span>. I don\u2019t have a good response to this, it could be a good counter argument.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I greatly appreciate any feedback and thoughts on my proposal. While some specifics of my proposal might be a bad idea, I\u2019m very confident I\u2019m at least directionally right. I hope to see more transparency regarding big/controversial expenses in the future.</p><p>Thanks to Pradyumna and Nick Lowry for the feedback!&nbsp;</p><h2>Edit: Extra thoughts&nbsp;</h2><p>I had practically finished this post before <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey?commentId=3cLRAk98q8jMwhrEc\">Claire Zabel's comment.</a> And since the purchase was made a while back I was of the opinion EVF should've already written something about it. But since it's through Open Phil and it has only finalized this year plus with delay in grant publishing, that changes things. It still comes across as a 'failure' (I don't want to sound this harsh) that there is so much delay, but perhaps there are good reasons for it. Still, I hope this post has some usefulness so I decided to publish it anyway, as I would still like to see more transparency and clearer reasoning. But the case is potentially less strong than I previously thought.</p><p>Regarding my opinion on the Abbey: I don't have anything really useful to say that isn't mentioned by others. My goal of my first post was to ask a question and gather information, mostly because I was very surprised. I don't have a strong opinion on the purchase anymore and the ones I have are with high uncertainty.</p><p>Also I hope this and my previous post aren't seen as 'hate' towards EVF/CEA/OP. I have great appreciation for these organisations and especially the people working for them. Most of the work I've seen from them is amazing. I want to have a positive impact on the world, so if I can improve their decision making and make them more effective that would be great. That's my only goal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnplnylvw9z1j\"><span

EA principles framed from a high-income audience can fall flat in contexts where individuals lack the ability to donate, don\u2019t have access to large EA networks for continued engagement, and where EA principles may be at odds with typical cultural norms and histories.&nbsp;</p><p>If you come from an LMIC, you have probably wondered how your strategy and prioritization fits in with the EA movement at-large. Some common questions/concerns we hear from LMICs audiences (that you might have at the moment) are:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Why should I care about suffering in other countries if I am surrounded by suffering, poverty, and disease in my own city or country?</li><li>What are the most effective causes and charities in my country? Does global EA or GiveWell have adequate information to assess local interventions?&nbsp;<ul><li>Is it worthwhile to focus on identifying effective charities in my own country? Will it increase overall impact or divert funding from higher impact interventions?</li></ul></li><li>What other high leverage interventions can increase impact? How should we think about localized career advising, research, community building, founding new charities?</li><li>What are the comparative advantages of my region to face global threats?&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We have pondered similar questions and regularly hear about these uncertainties in our countries and our neighboring LMICs (the authors of this post are from India, Malaysia and Colombia). We created this post to start a conversation about some of these difficult questions.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of these concerns are matters of career path prioritization: How should we, individuals from LMICs, think about prioritizing career paths to maximize our impact? Should we do charity evaluations in our countries? Should we move to Oxford and work on existential risks instead? Should career advice be different for us due to our contexts and preferences? We went through different paths of impact and debated pros and cons of each. This post aims to share the tentative outcomes of these discussions.</p><p>This is not a final answer and you should take our advice with caution. We had diverse perspectives and internal disagreements about the best paths to greater impact, so this is an invitation to start a community-wide discussion so we can get to better answers.&nbsp;</p><h1>Potential paths to greater impact via LMICs</h1><p>There are many paths you can engage in to maximize your impact, and many approaches to each: general community-building, working in local organizations, entrepreneurship, local priorities research and others. Since the very best options can be 10-100x better than average, it\u2019s worth putting the time and effort into prioritizing instead of going by your instincts. This prioritization involves taking into&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/\"><u>consideration</u></a>:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The scale and neglectedness of the problems (How big is the problem and how many people are already working on it?)</li><li>The tractability of the problems and incremental value of your contribution (Is the problem solvable and how much can you contribute to solving it?)&nbsp;</li><li>Your personal fit (Does the path align with your interests and values? Will you be able to sustain a productive career in the path?)</li></ul><p>With that in mind, the following sections provide an overview of different paths you can take to increase your impact, including LMIC-specific considerations and actionable next steps.</p><h2>Build career skills and learn more about EA</h2><p>Contributing to solving the world\u2019s most pressing problems requires career capital (hard and soft skills, credentials, connections and resources) that takes time and experience to build. We believe that accumulating career capital early can be particularly fruitful in the longer term by unlocking additional, high leverage opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>While the movement has sought to build infrastructure to help individuals build such career capital through training programs and fellowships, many of these resources are not available to EAs in LMICs. In addition, unfortunately many LMICs\u2019 education systems are insufficient to teach some skills that are broadly important for impactful careers (e.g. English fluency in non-English speaking contexts, soft skills such as project management, professional communication for corporate contexts, etc.). Many of these issues are structural and require large-scale interventions, but individuals in LMICs can start investing in themselves to bridge existing skills gaps. Some of those things might involve improving particular skills (improving English, research, technical skills) or building networks (attending conferences, finding mentors, starting internships).&nbsp;</p><p>For those who are particularly interested in EA principles, this path could mean learning more about EA by participating in virtual or in person programs, connecting with a local or virtual EA community, reading and discussing EA ideas to critically analyze them and form your own conclusions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Reasons to focus on building career capital</strong></p><ul><li>Building career capital is crucial to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/career-capital/\"><u>enabling high impact</u></a> over your career. Productivity in most fields usually peaks at the age 40-50, so accumulating skills early is a good investment for the future.&nbsp;</li><li>Upskilling has value for your prospects in both EA and non-EA careers</li><li>If more EAs from LMICs are able to leverage high impact opportunities, current power structures in EA will become more diverse leading to better decision-making and further reduce the barriers for individuals from LMICs in the future.</li><li>It\u2019s important to engage deeply with EA topics and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9pJ9CwsNmJQ8BmgSt/the-ea-movement-s-values-are-drifting-you-re-allowed-to-stay\"><u>form your own critiques</u></a> instead of starting projects straight away before having a clear understanding of many of the concepts. Hastiness can lead to ill-informed decisions and outcomes that may actually harm the overall movement and create&nbsp;<i>negative</i> impact.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Potential considerations against this path</strong></p><ul><li>If you already have enough career capital to leverage high impact opportunities and make well-informed decisions, you should get started as you can have greater incremental impact from direct work versus spending more time building marginal capital.</li><li>Building career capital takes significant time and resources and many individuals from LMICs may not have this privilege to focus exclusively on building career capital. They may consider other related paths that help reduce some of their risk, such as direct, salaried work in an EA-adjacent area while building career capital on the side. EA institutions and major funders should address resourcing gaps from the top-down to ensure people from LMICs are also able to access career-building resources.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>So, how recommended is this path for EAs in LMICs?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We think this should be the&nbsp;<strong>default</strong> path for new entrants to EA (both from LMICs and around the world). A bias towards action is good but when acted upon too early, could have potential for sub-par outcomes if:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>You have not engaged deeply with EA ideas and critiqued them yourself</li><li>You are letting go of potential high impact opportunities that could\u2019ve been available to you through upskilling</li></ol><p><strong>Actionable steps&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Identify skills to improve and work on them:&nbsp;</strong>Identify which skills might put you at a disadvantage and work on improving them. Some of the skills that we can think of are:&nbsp;<ul><li><strong>Improve your English,&nbsp;</strong>especially in professional settings. English is not the main language in many LMICs. If you can fluently read, speak and write in English, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qf6pGhm9a7vTMFLtc/english-as-a-dominant-language-in-the-movement-challenges\"><u>dominant language of elite institutions</u></a>, you will be able to access influential networks and resources and direct them to good causes. Luckily, there are many virtual platforms to improve English skills such as Duolingo, Babbel, and Grammarly. In parallel, many efforts are being made to translate EA content to other languages. However, it is still the case that participating in EA\u2019s most important decisions requires a fluent level of English in many domains.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Practice networking in international settings:&nbsp;</strong>Attend international conferences and schedule one on one calls with experts. Explore programs aiming to increase EAs diversity such as Magnifying Mentoring.</li><li><strong>Seek advice:&nbsp;</strong>EA has a very open culture and you should feel comfortable&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Pc3CFbYxPXgyjoDpB/seven-ways-to-become-unstoppably-agentic\"><u>reaching out to people for advice</u></a> (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/acyfmFTN3cNgwnYw6/agency-needs-nuance\"><u>thoughtfully</u></a>). Also use EA conferences and groups as a forum for finding more people with more experience in your fields of interest to learn from their experiences and formulate your own views.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Build your EA worldview:&nbsp;</strong>Learn more about EA and adjacent topics and figure out how EA&nbsp;<a href=\"https://michaelnotebook.com/eanotes/\"><u>fits in with your other beliefs</u></a>, circumstances, and ambitions. This will happen gradually, over time, as you increase your exposure to EA through virtual programs, in virtual or in person conferences, and get to know more people in the movement.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Learn through low-stakes opportunities:&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>Volunteer or apply to work for an organization that is doing valuable work</li><li>Volunteer for a research project, criticize a forum post, discuss your ideas online</li></ul></li><li><strong>Aim high</strong>: Your path to building capital and end-goal should be ambitious, as illustrated by these&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/career-capital/#how-to-gain-the-best-career-capital\"><u>examples</u></a>. A more diverse EA movement including more people from LMICs will improve the movement\u2019s thinking and increase our collective object-level impact.</li></ul><h2>Contribute as an individual to global EA causes&nbsp;</h2><p>Regardless of where you come from, you can work on current best guesses of the world\u2019s most pressing problems. Most organizations working on the top global priorities as defined by EA tend to be based in high-income countries but they are increasingly hiring from around the world (either remotely or by supporting immigration).&nbsp;</p><p>Also consider that current EA global priorities are only best guesses and shouldn\u2019t be seen as the ultimate authority to define an impactful job. As noted in the previous section, you should spend time learning more about EA principles and figuring out how to apply them to your own life before proceeding in any specific direction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Reasons to work on global EA causes</strong></p><p>We have seen that many people in LMICs don\u2019t consider working for global EA institutions because they don\u2019t think they have the proper skills to contribute or feel committed to local causes. Even though working on pressing issues in your own country may feel like the natural path to impact, there might be important reasons to consider working on global priorities, especially if you\u2019re from an LMIC:</p><ul><li>As a rule of thumb, you should not expect the world\u2019s most important problem or the most effective charity to be exclusively in your own country, particularly if you\u2019re not from the lowest income countries.</li><li>In a globalized world, no problem is strictly \u201clocal\u201d or \u201cglobal.\u201d Challenges to humanity transcend boundaries of nation-states and are not exclusive to any one country. Thus it is likely that you can have greater impact by working on a globally pressing issue instead of choosing the biggest challenge within your country, especially if you hail from a middle or high-income country (unless you are particularly well-suited to in-country problem solving due to your skills or experiences). There is a lot of value in building international communities of do-gooders working on our most pressing problems. Adopting a global frame of mind can help create impact across borders and learn from a range of contexts.&nbsp;</li><li>Global prioritization in a globalized world<strong> needs diversity</strong>. Your perspective as a person from an LMIC will be exceptionally valuable to improve&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rb5YDEk3zej3HF5bg/ea-diversity-unpacking-pandora-s-box\"><u>diversity of talent, experience, opinion, and appearance</u></a>. Key global EA organizations are dominated by white men from high income countries, which is potentially leading to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jhCGX8Gwq44TmyPJv/ea-s-culture-and-thinking-are-severely-limiting-its-impact\"><u>sub-par outcomes</u></a> in identifying impactful interventions, actually delivering object-level impact etc. Increasing the number of people from LMICs in higher-level decision making positions that allocate resources can have a huge ripple effect in diversity, epistemics and community health.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Potential considerations against this path:</strong></p><ul><li>If you have knowledge, experience, or a network that makes you particularly well suited to working on important local problems, you might be able to deliver higher impact by focusing locally. The case for this is even stronger if you hail from a large LMIC, such as India, China or Brazil, where working on local issues can still reach hundreds of millions of people. Working in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.probablygood.org/profile-civil-service-careers\"><u>policy roles in LMICs</u></a> may be one particularly impactful path.&nbsp;</li><li>Many global issues require coordination from local entities (e.g. pandemic preparedness, food security, etc). People from LMICs could be very impactful by contributing locally to such global coordination. However, we think that this prioritization could come from considering the global cause first and then examining their comparative advantage.</li><li>Strong personal reasons or preferences including any constraints on movement, finances etc.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>So, how recommended is this path compared to other paths for EAs in LMICs?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In the absence of very clear reasons to work on a local cause (e.g. significant personal fit and importance of local cause), you should probably work towards setting yourself up to contribute to global problems. By working on global causes, EAs from LMICs can add epistemic diversity that leads to better ideas and interventions. Working at some \u201cnodal\u201d EA or other global organizations can help you have significant impact, move the frontier of EA, and have ripple effects around the world.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Actionable steps</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Engage with career advising materials:&nbsp;</strong>Follow advice from existing global organizations dedicated to answer how to solve the world\u2019s most pressing problems (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/\"><u>80,000 Hours</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.probablygood.org/\"><u>Probably Good</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ea-internships.pory.app/board\"><u>EA Opportunities Board</u></a>).&nbsp;<ul><li>But also: remember that these are current best guesses, not final answers. Keep in mind that the community has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jhCGX8Gwq44TmyPJv/ea-s-culture-and-thinking-are-severely-limiting-its-impact\"><u>huge blindspots</u></a> and that current content can miss relevant aspects for LMICs audiences.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Discuss your thoughts and get advice from other EAs and experienced professionals:&nbsp;</strong>Following this path doesn\u2019t require LMIC-specific infrastructure because individuals can rely on existing tools such as advice from 80,000 Hours, attend EA Globals or apply to impactful jobs directly. However, discussing career paths with a local group and having a support network can make this process a lot easier. This is why in the absence of a local group, you should interact with the international community through virtual programs, conferences, and online fora. You should also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8Qdc5mPyrfjttLCZn/learning-from-non-eas-who-seek-to-do-good#comments\"><u>seek advice from non-EAs</u></a> to learn from a diversity of worldviews and experiences</li></ul><h2>General community building and awareness</h2><p>You can also be an enabler for impact through community building\u2013creating or strengthening local groups, introducing more people to EA, organizing events, and supporting a growing community. When done well, community building can have a strong multiplier effect by helping more people increase their own object-level impacts..&nbsp;</p><p>There are many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://resources.eagroups.org/\"><u>existing resources for community builders</u></a> and we strongly recommend building on global best practices since many efforts transfer well across regions. Here we will only add some considerations relevant for LMICs to think about the impact of community building:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How should LMICs prioritize community building?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Impact is only achieved through direct work (by doing things like saving lives or preventing suffering) so activities like community building and prioritization efforts are valuable only to the extent that they enable direct work. Community building is critical to setting the tone and culture of the movement, which further influences the movement\u2019s longevity and people\u2019s engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>The balance between direct and meta work such as community building should be consistently revisited and critiqued, as many posts on the Forum have done (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xomFCNXwNBeXtLq53/bad-omens-in-current-community-building\"><u>one</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jhCGX8Gwq44TmyPJv/ea-s-culture-and-thinking-are-severely-limiting-its-impact\"><u>two</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/oD3zus6LhbhBj6z2F/red-teaming-contest-demographics-and-power-structures-in-ea\"><u>three</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/h8n8z9GroLHdgrJcZ/where-is-the-social-justice-in-ea\"><u>four</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Here we will address some arguments in favor and against community building in LMICs in particular.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Reasons to work on community building in LMICs</strong></p><ul><li>LMICs should not simply be sites of intervention from global EA, but rather inform global EA priorities and become part of the community. Community building in LMICs is critical to improving diversity enabling a two-way synergistic relationship between LMICs and existing EA hubs. Community builders in LMICs can have a huge impact on EA's epistemic health by enabling such conversation and active critique of EA\u2019s current values and priorities, making them more globally relevant and adaptable. Community building can then further enable direct work that is better adapted to the local context and reflective of truly global values and priorities, instead of simply accepting the existing paradigm at face value.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff22v23mbbt\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf22v23mbbt\">[2]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p><strong>Potential considerations against this path:</strong></p><ul><li>Direct work could have higher and clearer positive impact (at least in the short-term) versus doing community building from scratch</li><li>The global playbook for community building may not be entirely applicable to new cultures and contexts in LMICs</li><li>EA is going through a phase of increased scrutiny, which means the way ideas are represented, especially in new contexts, has high stakes.

Potential community builders in LMICs should therefore talk to experienced community builders in EA as well as social organizers and non-profits in their own countries to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bkF4jWM9pbBFxnCLH/observations-of-community-building-in-asia-a\"><u>understand the context</u></a>, and how they can best contribute.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Actionable steps&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Effective community building in LMICs may look quite&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gicYG5ymk4pPzrKAd/doing-good-is-a-privilege-this-needs-to-change-if-we-want-to\"><u>different</u></a> from existing approaches or even&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xomFCNXwNBeXtLq53/bad-omens-in-current-community-building\"><u>improve on them</u></a><u>.&nbsp;</u>These are aspects you can consider:</p><ul><li><strong>What is \u201cEA\u201d in your country:&nbsp;</strong>Question from scratch what EA should be in your context and discuss this with other EAs, influential community organizers, nonprofits and other stakeholders in your regions. There are still many questions to be addressed and early-stage community building will shape how EA evolves in your country. Things to ask:<ul><li>Should groups be called \u201ceffective altruism\u201d or will other terminology be more resonant?&nbsp;</li><li>What is the ideal unit of organization\u2013are university, city or country level groups?&nbsp;</li><li>What kind of programming would be most useful? Should you run fellowships, programs, or large-scale events?&nbsp;</li><li>What are potential risks or criticisms of EA?&nbsp;</li><li>How can existing cultural frameworks augment and complement EA ideas?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Encourage critical engagement:&nbsp;</strong>Promote spaces where ideas are questioned from first principles. Be wary of \u201cspreading\u201d ideas and think of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FpjQMYQmS3rWewZ83/effective-altruism-is-a-question-not-an-ideology\"><u>EA as a \u201cquestion\u201d</u></a> instead. This could mean, for example, encouraging locals to come up with their own best guesses of global priorities and existential risks instead of relying exclusively on existing EA content.</li><li><strong>Engage with experts and experienced individuals:&nbsp;</strong>Doing community building with young people in high school or college has a lot of advantages, but also risks creating epistemic homogeneity due to a lack of diversity in prior professional or personal experiences. Epistemic diversity is more likely to show up in more experienced groups who already have prior mental models of the world. Engaging with local experts, even if they don\u2019t identify as EA or even know about the movement, will also help improve your understanding of the local context and what doing the \u201cmost good\u201d might look like for someone from your region.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Don\u2019t blindly replicate prevailing social norms:&nbsp;</strong>Be wary of blindly replicating social norms that you identify in EA without allowing local cultures to express their own preferences and intrinsic behaviors. This includes things like using jargon or replicating interpersonal dynamics common in existing EA settings (many of which might be actively harmful, as identified&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/t5vFLabB2mQz2tgDr/i-m-a-22-year-old-woman-involved-in-effective-altruism-i-m\"><u>in recent forum posts</u></a>), particularly if you are a community builder and if you are in a position of power. Cultural exchange between current EA hubs and future LMICs hubs can be extremely rich and fruitful, but if newcomers from LMICs perceive that belonging to EA requires adopting existing social norms, we risk losing their engagement or giving them the space to share perspectives and norms that could create a truly global EA culture.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Build your social and emotional intelligence to sustain diverse engagement:&nbsp;</strong>As an early community builder in LMICs, you have a great opportunity to set off the flywheel of alleviating EAs diversity problem. This is a huge opportunity but also a great responsibility. You will have to negotiate a range of viewpoints, some of which might challenge your own core beliefs, thoughtfully engage with criticisms , and know when things are not and shouldn\u2019t be under your control. This requires outstanding intellectual and social skills and being someone who can easily internalize and respond to social feedback to create a vibrant, healthy, and engaged community of do-gooders.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Keep object-level impact in mind:&nbsp;</strong>Always remember that impact is achieved through direct work and community building is only an enabler. Make sure you are constantly reevaluating your impact and not doing community building for the sake of it.</li></ul><h2>Local priorities research</h2><p>The basic idea of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jjxEw45X2EPoYk6T9/local-priorities-research-what-is-it-who-should-consider\"><u>local priorities research</u></a> (LPR) is that EAs do research to figure out the most impactful cause areas, career pathways and organizations within their local context (though impact may not be locally constrained).</p><p><strong>Reasons to do LPR in LMICs</strong></p><p>LPR is especially valuable if it helps find blindspots in cause prioritization, or brings more attention to locally promising causes that might be previously neglected. From a community-building perspective, it also improves outreach by making it more targeted, improving the EA group\u2019s credibility, and attracting more EA-aligned people in the local community.&nbsp;</p><p>LPR is a catch-all term that encompasses many kinds of research, including cause prioritization, problem profile research, high-impact career pathways, public policy research, charity evaluation and more generally research into the local philanthropic landscape, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The key difference between LPR and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/global-priorities-research\"><u>global priorities research</u></a> (GPR), aside from being more focused on helping EAs find local career pathways, is that LPR is more applied instead of philosophical / foundational (i.e. more \u201cwhich cause areas should we prioritize in this region?\u201d and less \u201cwhat is the value of the far future?\u201d). In this sense, LPR can be thought of as complementary to GPR.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Potential considerations against this path:</strong></p><p>Note that LPR is difficult to do well. One risk to avoid is low-quality research that gets used as motivated reasoning to justify working on \u201cpet causes\u201d that are not necessarily neglected, or where there is no good evidence for the tractability of existing interventions.

However, we think that the best versions of LPR could bring value to EA and could help spot promising causes that EA hasn\u2019t identified yet.&nbsp;</p><p>LPR might also be more valuable in large, low-income countries since there is a higher likelihood of important, currently neglected problems with high tractability existing.

Simply improving the effectiveness of arbitrarily-chosen local charities (e.g. by applying&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_Six_Sigma\"><u>Lean Six Sigma</u></a> principles) is unlikely to be as high-impact as pre-screening for cost-effective programs and then finding charities that implement them. If intervention A is (say) 10x more cost-effective at reducing DALYs than intervention B, then it\u2019s very unlikely that charity B running intervention B can be improved 10x to close the cost-effectiveness gap with charity A. This is why pre-screening for the most cost-effective programs has to be the first step.</p><p><strong>So, how recommended is this path compared to other paths for EAs in LMICs?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It depends on the location, the group\u2019s skills and the potential interventions considered. In general, unless there are already defined cost-effective interventions or charities that can be realistically improved or created, then this is unlikely to be the best path to impact.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Actionable steps</strong></p><ul><li>Run a \u201cquick and dirty\u201d LPR exercise to identify potentially high impact interventions and research the charity landscape in your country to understand if anyone is already doing these activities, and if so, how well. If not, dive deeper into the potential for setting up a charity to address this intervention.</li><li>Contact organizations or individuals who can advise and give feedback on their plans, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship</u></a>.</li></ul><p>For some examples of these efforts in LMICs, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/isggu3woGwkpYzqwW/presenting-2022-incubated-charities-charity-entrepreneurship\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship incubated charities</u></a>&nbsp;</p><h2>Local career advising</h2><p>Current career advising focuses on jobs in high income countries like the US and UK, as most prominent EA and EA-aligned organizations are primarily based there, but it is difficult for EAs from LMICs to get these jobs due to strict immigration restrictions. In addition, there are other constraints preventing them from moving, such as lack of initial capital to finance migration, familial ties or other social obligations, or simply a desire to remain in their home country, which EA should respect and enable.</p><p>Another issue is that prevalent career advising (say from 80,000 Hours) assumes a Western educational background where people might have flexibility in choosing their course of study, which may not be universally true. For example, most university admissions in India are dictated by performance on entrance exams or final school leaving exams. Courses of study have varying \u201ccut offs\u201d based on the amount of applications and higher cut offs are often associated with higher prestige, so students are largely sorted into fields based on their marks over actual preference.</p><p>Local career advising solves for this by providing EAs in LMICs with more useful context-specific career advice that directs them to resources to upskill given their constraints and helps them pursue impactful careers globally and locally. By being plugged into the global EA network, such local career advising can further diversify the talent pool that traditional EA organizations draw from.</p><p><strong>Reasons to do local career advising in LMICs</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Help identify high impact paths:&nbsp;</strong>Current career advising organizations in EA may not be well-geared to assist people in LMICs due to lack of context on educational systems and paths to high impact careers within LMICs. A greater focus on local career advising may help uncover career paths with inordinate leverage (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.probablygood.org/profile-civil-service-careers\"><u>civil services in LMICs</u></a>).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Expand option set for EAs from LMICs:&nbsp;</strong>In conjunction with LPR, local career advising can help increase EAs momentum in LMICs by providing people a wider option set that can fit within their prior world view and constraints. This will help put more people on higher impact paths and create cultures of effectiveness in institutions around the world.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Potential considerations against this path</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Poor LPR may lead to low quality advising</strong>: For local career advising to be good, the local career pathways identified need to be good as well. Since this is a subset of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jjxEw45X2EPoYk6T9/local-priorities-research-what-is-it-who-should-consider\"><u>local priorities research</u></a> (LPR) which is difficult to do well, one risk factor is poor-quality LPR leading to folks being advised to pursue career pathways that are not impactful or perhaps even harmful.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>So, how recommended is this path compared to other paths for EAs in LMICs?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Local career advising is an option for more mature EA groups with members who are good at LPR, so the same considerations apply: sufficient research capacity and comparative advantage in doing research to identify high-impact local career paths, EA knowledge, and being able to coordinate at national capacity.</p><p><strong>Actionable steps</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Do shallow local priorities research</strong> to identify potential high impact career paths locally. A good example to draw inspiration from is EA Philippines\u2019&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LtKzmBrdWhshlHP6yz9VhzSNvO4e2U5nDa_VAoSEM4E/edit#gid=1612147778\"><u>top local career paths</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LtKzmBrdWhshlHP6yz9VhzSNvO4e2U5nDa_VAoSEM4E/edit#gid=0\"><u>recommended roles</u></a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Talk to experts or EAs in focus areas of interest</strong> to find specific roles.

Doing cause-specific community building assumes that the best guess is worth acting on now, and that might be reasonable in many scenarios, but should have a very high bar to be implemented as such. Starting with strong general infrastructure for cause prioritization in LMICs through community building and meta work by locals can help mitigate these risks.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fno1d33p73s5j\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefo1d33p73s5j\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Here are other pathways that we think could be promising, most of these are subsets of larger paths outlined in the post above:</p></div><ol><li><strong>Understand your country\u2019s comparative advantages:&nbsp;</strong>Work on other research questions that address a region\u2019s comparative advantage to face the world\u2019s most pressing problems:&nbsp;<ol><li>How can specific regions approach longtermist issues?

This seems wrong: funding fertility is not an adequate substitute for bednets. &nbsp;We can avoid this result by giving separate weight to <i>both</i> person-directed <i>and</i> undirected (or \"impersonal\") reasons. We have weak impersonal reasons to bring an extra life into existence, while we have both impersonal <i>and</i> person-directed reasons to aid an existing individual. This commonsense alternative to totalism still entails longtermism, as zillions of weak impersonal reasons to bring new lives into existence can add up to <i>overwhelmingly strong</i> reasons to prevent human extinction.</p><h1>Killing vs Failing to Create</h1><p>I think the strongest objection to <a href=\"https://www.utilitarianism.net/population-ethics#the-total-view\">total utilitarianism</a> is that it risks collapsing the theoretical distinction between <i>killing</i> and <i>failing to create</i>. (Of course, there would still be good <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/ethical-theory-and-practice\">practical reasons</a> to maintain such a distinction in practice; but I think there\u2019s a principled distinction here that our theories ought to accommodate.) While I think it\u2019s straightforwardly <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/utilitarianism-and-abortion\">good to bring more awesome lives into existence</a>, and so failing to create an awesome life constitutes a <i>missed opportunity</i> for doing good, premature death is not just a \u201cmissed opportunity\u201d for a good future, it\u2019s <i>harmful</i> in a way that should especially concern us.</p><p>For example, we clearly have <i>much</i> stronger moral reasons to save the life of a young child (e.g. by funding anti-malarial bednets) than to simply cause an extra child to exist (e.g. by funding fertility treatments or incentivizing procreation). If totalism can\u2019t accommodate this moral datum, that would seem a serious problem for the view.</p><p>How can we best accommodate this datum? I think there may be two distinct intuitions in the vicinity that I\u2019d want to accommodate:</p><p>(1) Something about the intrinsic badness of (undesired) death.<br>(2) Counting both person-directed <i>and</i> undirected (\u201cimpersonal\u201d) moral reasons.</p><h3>The Intrinsic Harm of Death</h3><p>Most of the harm of death is <i>comparative</i>: not bad in itself, but <i>worse</i> <i>than</i> the alternative of living on. Importantly, we only have reason to avoid comparative harms in ways that secure the better alternative. To see this, suppose that if you save a child\u2019s life, they\u2019ll live two more decades and then die from an illness that robs them of <i>five decades</i> more life. That latter death is then <i>really</i> bad for them. Does it follow that you shouldn\u2019t save the child\u2019s life after all (since it exposes them to a <i>more harmful</i> death later)? Of course not. The later death is worse <i>compared to</i> living the five decades extra, but letting them die now would do them <i>even less good</i>, no matter that the early death \u2014 in depriving them of just two decades of life \u2014 is not \u201cas bad\u201d (comparatively speaking) as the later death would be (in a different context with a different point of comparison).</p><p>So we should not aim to minimize comparative harms of this sort: that would lead us badly astray. But it\u2019s a tricky question whether the harm of death is <i>purely</i> comparative. In \u2018<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/CHAVR\">Value Receptacles</a>\u2019 (2015, p. 323), I argued that it plausibly is not:</p><blockquote><p>Besides preventing the creation of future goods, death is also positively disvaluable insofar as it involves the interruption and thwarting of important life plans, projects, and goals. If such thwarting has sufficient disvalue, it could well outweigh the slight increase in hedonic value obtained in the replacement scenario [where one person is \u201cstruck down in the prime of life and replaced with a marginally happier substitute\u201d].</p></blockquote><p>Thwarted goals and projects may make death <i>positively bad</i> to some extent. But the extent must be limited. However tragic it is to die in one\u2019s teens (say), I don\u2019t think one could plausibly say that it\u2019s so bad as to render the person\u2019s life overall not worth living. The goods of life can fairly easily outweigh the harm of death, I believe.</p><p>It\u2019s a tricky question where exactly to draw the line here. Suppose a couple undergoing fertility treatment learns that all of their potential embryos have a genetic defect that would inevitably result in painless death while the child is still very young. That obviously gives the parents strong prudential reasons to refrain from procreating and suffering the immense grief that would soon follow. But if we bracket others\u2019 interests, and focus purely on the interests of the potential child themselves: is it <i>ever</i> the case that an overall-happy life, however short, is not worth living, <i>purely </i>due to the fact of death? I could, of course, imagine a painful death outweighing the happiness of a very short life. But suppose the death is painless, or at any rate is nowhere near to outweighing the prior joy the life contains. Yet it does thwart the child\u2019s plans and projects. Is that so bad that it would have been better for them to never exist at all? I find that hard to believe.</p><p>For another test: imagine a future society that uses artificial wombs to procreate (and parents aren\u2019t notified until the entire process is successfully completed). Suppose some fetuses have a congenital condition that causes them to painlessly die <i>almost</i> <i>immediately</i> after first acquiring sentience (or whatever is required for morally relevant interests of a sort that makes death harmful for them). How much should the society be willing to invest in diagnostic testing to instead allow the defective embryos to be aborted prior to acquiring moral interests? (Or, at greater cost, to test the gametes prior to fertilization?) Could <i>preventing short but painless existence</i> ever take priority over other societal goals like <i>saving lives </i>and <i>reducing suffering</i>?</p><p>We probably can\u2019t give <i>that</i> much weight to the intrinsic harm of (painless) death, if it\u2019s never enough to make non-existence look especially desirable in comparison. So I think we may need to look elsewhere to find stronger reasons.</p><h3>Person-Directed <i>and</i> Undirected Reasons</h3><p>Much population ethics discourse sets up a false dichotomy between the two extremes of impersonal total utilitarianism and narrow person-affecting views on which we\u2019ve <i>no</i> reason to bring happy lives into existence. I find this very strange, since a far more intuitive middle-ground view would acknowledge that we have <i>both</i> person-directed <i>and</i> undirected (or \u201cimpersonal\u201d) reasons.</p><p>Failing to create a person does not harm or <i>wrong that individual</i> in the way that negatively affecting their interests (e.g. by killing them as a young adult) does. &nbsp;Contraception isn't murder, and neither is abstinence. Person-directed reasons explain this common-sense distinction: we have especially strong reasons not to harm or wrong particular individuals.</p><p>But avoiding wrongs isn't all that matters. &nbsp;There's always some (albeit weaker) reason to <i>positively benefit</i> possible future people by bringing them into a positive existence, even though it doesn't <i>wrong</i> anyone to remain childless by choice.</p><p>And when you multiply those individually weak reasons by zillions, you can end up with <i>overwhelmingly strong</i> reasons to prevent human extinction, just as longtermists claim. (This reason is so strong it would plausibly be wrong to neglect or violate it, even though it does not wrong any particular individual. Just as <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/i/56650827/the-non-identity-problem\">the non-identity problem</a> shows that one outcome can be worse than another without necessarily being worse for any particular individual.)</p><p>On this hybrid view, which I defend in more detail in \u2018<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/CHARTA-5\">Rethinking the Asymmetry</a>\u2019 (2017), we are warranted in some degree of <i>partiality towards the antecedently actual</i>. We have weak impersonal reasons to bring an extra life into existence, while we have both impersonal <i>and</i> person-directed reasons to aid an existing individual (or a future individual who is certain to exist independently of our present decision).</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I think this hybrid view is very commonsensical. We all agree that you can harm someone by bringing them into a miserable existence, so there\u2019s no basis for denying that you can benefit someone by bringing them into a happy existence. It would be crazy to claim that there is literally <i>no </i>reason to do the latter. And there is no theoretical advantage to making this crazy claim. (As I explain in \u2018<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AgQx44vtw5bi4LmBh/puzzles-for-everyone\">Puzzles for Everyone</a>\u2019, it doesn\u2019t solve the repugnant conclusion, because we need a solution that works for the intra-personal case \u2014 and whatever does the trick there will automatically carry over to the interpersonal version too.) So the narrow person-affecting view really does strike me as <i>entirely</i> unmotivated.</p><p>But, as indicated above, this very natural hybrid view still entails the basic <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/review-of-what-we-owe-the-future\">longtermist</a> claim that we\u2019ve very strong moral reasons to care about the distant future (and strongly prefer flourishing civilization over extinction). So the notion that longtermism depends on stark totalism is simply a mistake.</p><p>Totalism is on the right track when it comes to many big-picture questions, but it is an oversimplification. Failing to create is importantly morally different from killing. We have especially stringent reasons to avoid the latter. (It's an interesting further question precisely <i>how much</i> extra weight we should give to saving lives over creating lives.) But we still have some moral reason to want good lives to come into existence, and that adds up to very strong moral reasons to care about the future of humanity in its entirety.</p>", "user": {"username": "RYC"}}, {"_id": "qexomkYp5D7vZR4zP", "title": "Small EA Groups and Invisible Impact", "postedAt": "2022-12-14T23:35:58.100Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i><strong>Epistemic Status:</strong> personal observation (n=1)</i></p><p><i><strong>tl;dr:</strong> EA groups not in central hubs (Loxbridge, Berkeley) generate a lot of value they don't see when members move to central hubs to work.

This country has an 8.9 Human Rights and rule of law index [2], out of 10. The wealthiest person in the 14th century, Mansa Musa, had an estimated $400 billion in wealth, divided by his 57 years of life, an annual income of roughly $7 billion. Although 700 years seems minuscule compared to the model of humanity\u2019s full-span potential, still the sign of everyone being more well-off than the richest person once upon a time is nowhere to be seen. If people are being controlled by the elite with a lack of human rights, the rich would only become richer as the poor become poorer. But we already see a positive tendency in this as the world develops, accompanied by a rise in both democracy and human rights.

The massive dip occurred before and during the Second World War when inhumane atrocities were carried out. Yet it is shocking to see the downward tendency of the curve from 2012 till 2021 - the magnitude showing little difference from that of the war period. This should be extremely alarming. Back in 2016, the Thomson Reuters Foundation estimated that more than a third of the world\u2019s population was under human rights abuses [4], just imagine the increased scale in 2022 with the newest advancements in international situations. <strong>(Scale)</strong></p><p><br><strong>Neglectedness</strong> - I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be thinking: I\u2019m not sure this is a very neglected problem; I see it being reported in the news almost every day!&nbsp;</p><p>True, there is awareness, yet the problem is still being neglected as not much has been done for fear of conflict and the huge costs.</p><p>Or should I say there <strong>was </strong>awareness - with the increased global resurgence of nationalism and the costs/hardness for addressing this issue, we gradually consider the atrocities we see on news as common, and therefore redirect our attention to other problems that are arguably not as important. (This will be very controversial, but personally, I don\u2019t see why we consider factory farming as a high priority when much more than a third of the people on earth are still suffering under, arguably, the same level of control and treatment as those animals - don\u2019t get me wrong, I am an animal rights activist myself. But at the same time, I am a human rights activist as well, I just think that we should include human rights as at least a sub-cause area under the big cause area of existential risks)</p><p>Nevertheless, awareness is not the same as not-neglected, because not much that\u2019s useful has been done to address the issue.</p><p><br><strong>Tractability </strong>- as I said before, this is a tough one to solve as it is the most directly linked with international politics. However, because so much is at stake, I believe more research and funding should go into this cause area, just like most of the other sub-cause areas under the existential risks umbrella.</p><p><br><strong>A final note on longtermism -</strong></p><p>Some argue that under the cause area of existential risks, we should be prioritising other problems that may happen in the future to serve the idea of longtermism, which is often neglected by people today.</p><ol><li>the human rights issue has its longterm value in terms of human potential and development as explained above</li><li>From another perspective, isn\u2019t avoiding human rights crises in other parts of the world another form of short-termism as we enjoy our current peaceful state? In the not-even-so-\u201clong-term\u201d future (as the world today has globalised so much, it is hard for countries to return to the same level of nationalism pre-globalisation), bigger conflicts or problems will erupt as a result of today\u2019s concession, giving a higher probability for the other emerging problems (e.g. CBRN) to occur on a larger/global scale. Therefore, if we can\u2019t even consider the not-so-\u201clong-term\u201d in the future, how are we able to consider the real longterm across the lifespan of humanity?</li></ol><p><br><strong>Disclaimer-</strong></p><p>My argument does not mean that I advocate for violent methods such as war to settle human rights issues - peace is very important. However as history has shown, again and again, short-term peace in the form of appeasement will only lead to greater not-so-\u201clong-term\u201d catastrophes in the near future, which will exacerbate other cause areas related to global power rivalries increasingly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Notes</u></strong></p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/are-authoritarian-states-better-at-delivering-economic-growth\">https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/are-authoritarian-states-better-at-delivering-economic-growth</a></li><li>The Human Rights and Rule of Law Indicator evaluates the correlation between the country and its population insofar as fundamental human rights are upheld and respected.</li><li>Further reading on the relationship between development, democracy and human rights see: Donnelly, Jack. \u201cHuman Rights, Democracy, and Development.\u201d <i>Human Rights Quarterly</i>, vol. 21, no. 3, 1999, pp. 608\u201332. <i>JSTOR</i>, http://www.jstor.org/stable/762667.

Progress studies and EA have overlap, so I thought it would be useful to give my thoughts on the event.

Everything felt more professional (cocktails, food, outfits, etc.) and the operations seemed smoother than any EA event I\u2019ve been to.&nbsp;</p><p>--</p><p>The facilitators were all Atlantic writers, such as Ross Anderson and Derek Thompson, and they were significantly more eloquent and better at holding people\u2019s attention than any EA event I\u2019ve been to. I could definitely tell the difference in their training. That being said, the talks felt fluffy and often skirted around intellectual issues for the sake of a smooth conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>--</p><p>Networking was less direct. More small talk, less intensity.&nbsp;</p><p>--</p><p>The event was catered towards investors/venture capitalists. Speakers were trying to make their product sound appealing so investors will fund them, which I thought was slightly bad for epistemics, often ignoring the risks of their products (e.g. AI slaughter bots).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>--</p><p>In general, the majority of the attendees seemed bullish on \u201cthe progress of technology,\u201d and didn\u2019t touch much on the potential risks of things like AGI or biorisk. If they did address the risks, it was invariably in relation to (1) the economy, (2) climate change, or (3) war. Of the people I spoke with, &lt;20% had heard of misalignment or existential risk. I didn\u2019t get the impression that anyone at the event didn\u2019t take existential risk seriously. Rather, it felt like they had not heard about it in the progress studies ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p>--</p><p>Overall, I think the Progress studies community seems decently aligned with what EAs care about, and could become more-so in the coming years. The event had decent epistemics and was less intimidating than an EA conference. I think many people who feel that EA is too intense, cares too much about longtermism, or uses too much jargon could find progress studies as a suitable alternative. If the movement known as EA dissolved (God forbid) I think progress studies could absorb many of the folks.&nbsp;</p><p>--</p><p>Notable events:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>\u201cHow mRNA Technology Can Save the World\u201d&nbsp;<ol><li>Most of the people I talked to here had never considered the risks posed by biotechnology (beyond class inequality stuff)</li></ol></li><li>\u201cDrones and AI: The Future of Military Technology\u201d&nbsp;<ol><li>The concern most people had was causing a war (which seems good), but because much of what Brian Schimpf talked about was technology used for deterrence, most people then seemed bullish on the positive impacts of this technology (I was not).&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>\u201cHow Artificial Intelligence Can Revolutionize Creativity\u201d&nbsp;<ol><li>I didn\u2019t go to this one, but I heard from someone who did that they talked about GPT-3 and Dall-e positively, and didn't mention the potential risks posed by capabilities advancements.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>\u201cThe Long View\u201d&nbsp;<ol><li>Didn\u2019t go, unfortunately.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Nick Corvino"}}, {"_id": "njnGunLAp3zrTghGv", "title": "Direct Sharing, consent and mental health online: an open proposal for social media without \"an algorithm\", CC A", "postedAt": "2022-12-14T23:35:37.500Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Epistemic status: an educated guess inspired by my experience in social media startups&amp;non-profits, by the recent discussion about activism on Mastodon, and by many discussions in Russia&amp;Switzerland&amp;Bay Area about social media, activism, polarization, mental health online.</i></p><p><i>The writing is vague sometimes intentionally.

Why do I believe that? </strong>We here in Switzerland did an academic social media non-profit<a href=\"https://tournesol.app\">&nbsp;<u>https://tournesol.app</u></a>. The algorithm uses more classical ML so it is simple to interpret and study. This is the first (to my knowledge) alternative recommender engine for YouTube, acting as <a href=\"https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-future-of-platform-power-making-middleware-work/\">Middleware</a>, one of the proposals to improve social media, built with ethics, security, and robustness in mind. Yet, analysis shows two kinds of videos when comparing hyperparameters: \"laminar\" (don't change their position in the ranking much) and \"turbulent\", red ones (ones that change their position a lot) -- see Figure 8 on page 12 in<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07334\">&nbsp;<u>our first paper</u></a>. Basically, if there are two groups of people, one says \"show this video\", and another says \"don't show this video\", <i>any</i> social media platform&nbsp;<i>has</i> to decide something, for everyone:&nbsp; who to listen to, what to show, etc. For big platforms like Facebook, this seems to be causing a never-ending political, legal and social nightmare, both for the company and for people outside :( The algorithm uses state-of-the-art&nbsp;<a href=\"https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/hash/f4b9ec30ad9f68f89b29639786cb62ef-Abstract.html\"><u>byzantine-resiliency for ML</u></a>, and this problem still exists -- it's a human problem, and not a tech problem. The non-profit went one way to solve this, and this is one path - create a better algorithm.</p><p>My thinking instead was: humans have to decide, otherwise, it's going to be a never-ending drama like FB or YouTube have, in some form or another (every month there is some lawsuit or the other, to one big social media company or the other, in some country or the other, where improper moderation/lack of it/too much of it/too little of it led to some violence or some misfortune, with proofs of cause-effect relationship, without, all sorts of news stories like that, all shapes, colours, and sizes...).</p><p>This just reminds me of the USSR's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/central-planning/\"><u>central planning</u></a> and the same kinds of never-ending issues, all coming from the way central planning is: some people who never saw a shoe factory in real life are in an office building in a big city, they are busy making some plan on some computer about which shoe factories to shut down and which to keep running... Basically, some centralized entity tries to decide \"for everyone\", and it inevitably fails: the world is just too complex, and the entity has, as we all do, limited computational abilities, let alone alignment properties. There are always outliers for Deep Learning-based self-driving cars. There are always things that people who design the system just do not know of.&nbsp;<i>Maybe we decide for ourselves? Do we really need to build the algorithm in the first place?</i></p><p><strong>I feel this could be done way easier, otherwise, we'll never see the end of any of this... What if there is no algorithm?</strong></p><p>Mastodon already promotes something like that. Can we take it further and add functionality, and consent, to make it nice?</p><p><i>What is important, I feel is that we do it together. How do you feel about this? What do you want to see online? Most of it has not changed much in 20 years (feeds, following, algorithms for recommendations as a concept), there must be a better way. Let's create it together.</i></p><h1>Direct Sharing</h1><p><strong>Overview of direct sharing.&nbsp;</strong>So, we had this idea at the social media next startup (Fave) I was at, Direct Sharing. Unfortunately, I left before we could try it, so we agreed to put all this as Creative Commons Attribution.</p><p><strong>What if there is&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>no algorithm, just people&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>recommending things to each other?</strong></p><p>We did try it via Instagram stories -- people were happy to share their stories with and recommend stuff to us, and those are interesting to read and try. Basically,&nbsp;<i>people recommend things to each other, we like to see that, they like doing it!</i></p><p><i>I enjoy recommending things to people and getting feedback. I like when my friend recommends me a book or tells me something I did not know of. Maybe we can just do it like this and do not need an algorithm?</i></p><p>See the picture and text below for a more-or-less concrete proposal. None of it is tested at scale. Feedback is welcome!</p><p>For Mastodon specifically, this applies to the \"Federated\" timeline -- there are way too many things to show in the world, so we have to choose. For major social media platforms, this applies to... everything :) Can&nbsp;<i>people</i> choose instead of a cold-blooded algorithm?</p><p>&nbsp;<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671283228/mirroredImages/njnGunLAp3zrTghGv/upcuyqb5xsglqbqdavsz.png\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How it looks for a sender and for a receiver.&nbsp;</strong>For a person who wants to recommend something, there is a new pipeline: instead of sharing something (\"into the Universe\"), one can recommend it to specific communities or people. Machine Learning can be used to suggest those people or communities, and by default does not execute anything by itself (how it already is), only suggests. On the other end, the receiving end, the person sees who the recommendation came from. Instead of receiving things \"from the algorithm\", they receive them from their friend, a fellow fan of their music band, or even from their political opponent (I bet a lot of politicians would love to recommend stuff to their own and to other parties... :). See the picture above!</p><p><strong>Requesting recommendations.&nbsp;</strong>One can ask a person to recommend them something, a movie, an account, an article, anything! They could be paid for that, as one of the options.</p><p><strong>Consent (applicable to indirect sharing too).&nbsp;</strong>Consent preferences are really important here. As an activist, I notice that a lot of people who don't really want to see political posts, who don't read them, who don't learn anything from them, are bombarded by political stories and news. On the other hand, there are a lot of people (like me) who want to discover new people in that domain, but just don't know how: most of the interesting people I follow, or someone who is close to them in the social graph, I actually met in real life, *not* via the algorithm! Or, I saw them replying to someone, deep inside the threads. Again, NOT recommended by the algorithm, at all. It simply did not show that to me.</p><p>This all shows how algorithmic feeds&nbsp;<strong>break our consent every day:</strong> at a specific moment, we don't see a lot of what we want to see and&nbsp;<strong>see things we don't want to.</strong></p><p>A person could instead select with fine-grained detail how many posts from a topic, from a person, from a community, or from a country they receive per day. For example, sometimes the news from the U.S. are just too much and way too many. I could mute them or blur them. There could be a friendly interface for that, like swiping left to mute. There could be a warning if too many important topics are muted for way too long.</p><p><strong>Fine-grained consent</strong> is also important. For example, when I am hungry or angry, I am no good at reacting to political news. I will probably write something not nice, with no value created. On the other hand, if I'm rested, full and happy, I might donate to a charity or reply with helpful things, or recommend the post to someone who can help. I could swipe left when I'm tired, and not see polarizing posts. All the muted polarizing scary news could be queued, and then read later when a person is ready, like a \"do not disturb\" mode or a&nbsp;<strong>\"safe space\" mode.</strong></p><p><strong>Consent also applies to discoverability in the \"who to recommend to\" screen. Some people do not wish to be found, for example, survivors of harassment - thanks to a </strong><a href=\"https://gnusocial.net/notice/13463333\"><strong>conversation</strong></a><strong> on Mastodon for pointing this out.</strong></p><p>Meta: note how this feature is suggested by a member of a different community than I am from. I had no idea that is even needed! Given how <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/eprint/DPJI9F3EDFAIMUPSNGPH/full\">conversations with strangers are likely to lead to surprises</a>, I call for you to describe what you need online. There's a <a href=\"https://designjustice.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/0v6035ye/release/2\">Design Justice</a> book on this.</p><p>Some people just want their friends to comment on what they eat right now. Direct message etiquette prohibits (usually) just sending random stuff to people. \"Feeds\" are not like that -- by default, no action is required. That is the case for commenting on the dinner exactly. If one mass-emails or mass-DMs a picture of their dinner to all their friends, that is not OK (conventionally). If they recommend it to their friends, that is much better.</p><p><strong>Inboxes (\"feeds\", \"attention markets\"), and fans (\"viewpoint representatives\").&nbsp;</strong>Since there are way more things online than we can mentally deal with (or&nbsp;<i>want to</i> deal with, or&nbsp;<i>would have&nbsp;</i>wanted to deal with - none of us know what's out there!), we have to choose some things over others. Currently, it is chosen by a cold-blooded algorithm... That leads to issues described in the Prequel.</p><p>We could do a&nbsp;<i>map</i> of all the things online, and choose from that -- that is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sergia_ch/status/1541507992360812547\"><u>one way</u></a> to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R_aVUrbAmkVXFF1vJWxnXE03FBtpxE8jkHF9P53n4Qk/edit\"><u>do it</u></a>. Another way is to have&nbsp;<strong>actual humans</strong> choose things. As we saw before, it feels good to do that!</p><p>To send something to a person whose attention is overwhelmed (celebrity, business person, scientist, CEO, artist, musician, etc), one could either pay some amount (\"attention market\") or have a \"go\" from a human(s) with a certain viewpoint (a \"representative\" of that viewpoint, or a \"fan\") to check and \"approve\" as well (\"market regulation\"). With no regulation, there probably will be a lot of ads and scams.</p><p><i>For example, I want to send my painting to an artist to ask how they feel about it, does it inspire them or not. I can recommend it to them, so it appears in their feed (\"inbox\", can we not say \"feed\", it sounds like we're animals) and says \"recommended by Sergia\". If the artist likes money and libertarianism, I'd probably have to pay for that, pay to recommend. If this artist does not like libertarianism (duh), they can appoint representatives of different viewpoints who need to all agree to recommend the post to them. Mixing the options is possible too -- \"partially regulated market\".</i></p><p>Music fans all try to send their cover to the singer. Actors want to show their demos to producers. Scientists want to show their papers to other researchers.</p><p><strong>Fans (\"viewpoint representatives\").&nbsp;</strong>Usually, every community has its devoted people -- like, fans of music literally think about it every day. There are political people who know a lot about their parties or movements. There are activists who know about the problems they work on. Some of them are really interested in the health and well-being of their community and basically even do it for free sometimes. Those people are \"in the know\". They know what is up. The recipient of recommendations (\"regular person\") can subscribe to them, can ask them for recommendations. People who are overwhelmed can nominate fans to only send them the most important things. Celebrities can nominate those to \"regulate\" their \"attention markets\"</p><p>F<i>or example, I can say I want a single most important post about US news for today. I ask one of the fans of that, and they recommend it to me. I can choose who I ask.</i></p><p><strong>Financial side.</strong> Some people spent a lot of money to send a statue of Elon Musk to his offices. They could spend that money to recommend a post into his timeline. For this crowd, money-based attention seems less problematic, and I doubt they will want to regulate that market for themselves (?).&nbsp;<strong>They could definitely pay for all of the hosting with their activity!</strong></p><p>A person can&nbsp;<strong>choose</strong> how their input \"attention market\" works: how much human moderation by viewpoint representatives (or, put simply, fans) there is, how much it depends on the money, whether is there an upper bound for a post, etc.</p><p><i>This is like ads, but one can&nbsp;<strong>regulate</strong> their&nbsp;<strong>own&nbsp;</strong>attention market with viewpoint representatives (\"fans\") that they choose, to the point of even not allowing any posts that were paid for.</i></p><p>If a person does not have money (say, a struggling artist wants to send their painting to a famous one for them to check it out), crowdfunding is possible. Basically, the person can determine how their attention market works, how much it's regulated, and whether there is any money in it at all.</p><p><strong>Sheriffs and community moderation.&nbsp;</strong>Like a \"sheriff\" of a small town, some of the \"fans\" could do moderation for that community. They, can be&nbsp;<strong>elected by the community</strong>, with no issues of centralized planning. Those people could be nominated together by the community, or by it's \"celebrities\".</p><p><strong>No complications for the \"regular person\".&nbsp;</strong>The regular person doesn't really have to know all the details of how all of this works, exactly like a person in real life doesn't really have to know who their sheriff is, and how their government works. It is the other way around -- if they do something that is not nice, then they WILL meet the sheriff. In the same way, a person in the real world doesn't need to know how the stock market works in order to buy a sandwich. On the other hand, if the \"sheriff\" doesn't do their work well, there's the next election process to replace them. If someone doesn't like the recommendations they are receiving, they can change who recommends things to them, how, and change the parameters of their \"attention market\". There could be some easy presets (full spectrum from \"libertarian\" to \"tight hippie community\"). Consent preferences could have a friendly interface.</p><p>What I am uncertain of:</p><ul><li>Will all of the communities self-regulate like this? Like, would be there enough people who recommend things?</li><li>How to have better exploration? For example, I'm thinking where to post this proposal. There's on the one hand, the whole internet, the whole of humanity (well, some of it :). On the other hand, I only know a small part of all that. Maybe I could ask a, say, a university professor to recommend a good place for that? What are other ways to do it? How can one discover new people? Here in our proposal we can ask someone to recommend us someone! Like, I can ask a musician to recommend me good music classes. What are other ways to do this?</li><li>On the one hand, the proposed method deals with polarization this way: political parties can recommend quality content to each other. In our conditions, each person only has limited attention, and everyone knows that. That will probably make people think before they recommend, only sending the meaningful messages. On the other hand, what if everyone sets their consent preferences to 0 for the \"other side\"? It seems, the whole of humanity, both online and offline, rests on the fact that it does not happen: that we still want to talk to each other. This is more of a social question than a tech question&nbsp;</li><li>In this \"attention market\" in libertarian unregulated version, do we select the post with the most money paid for it? Is there a better way to do this only based on money, with no human moderation?</li><li>In the \"regulated attention market\" with fans or \"viewpoint representatives\" giving a \"go\" for a busy person to see a recommended post, how do we make sure the busy person has some diversity of views? What if they do not wish to see diversity of views and only want to see posts from a specific information bubble, do we allow that do we include some basic minimum (like, at least 1 post not from the bubble per week) in the consent preferences?</li><li>What are other ways consent online could be improved?</li></ul><p>I'm thinking to implement something like this on Mastodon eventually (it is open-source). So, here's an EA analysis:</p><p>Neglectedness: nobody seems to be doing social media like this&nbsp;</p><p>Scale: all of Mastodon people who consent to be a part of this, all of social media if this really works well and good</p><p>Tractability: about a year of work for a few engineers, then tons of iterations, checks and balances&nbsp;</p><p>Positive impact: hopefully will make lives online more consensual, informative and happy, reduce polarization and bring people closer to each other (a hypothesis). If it works, other social media platforms will probably copy it (which is good, license is CC A is by choice exactly for this)</p><p>What is important, I feel is that we do it together. How do you feel about this? What do you want to see online? None of it has changed much in 20 years <i>(feeds, following, algorithms for recommendations as a concept),&nbsp;</i> there must be a better way.

Recent changes in the EA funding landscape have had a large impact on our work. I\u2019ve decided that now is a good time to write a detailed summary of our work so far, as well as how recent events have affected our work.</p><p>The primary purpose of this article is to be informative to our potential future employees, funders, and collaborators. Secondarily, I believe somewhat in the value of transparency, and hope that this article can be useful to some set of the (EA Forum reading-) public. Tertiarily, I expect this article to be internally helpful for myself and the rest of the team to keep track of what we did, especially for future reviews.</p><p>Within this article, I mostly chose to take a \u201cdescriptive\u201d rather than \u201cevaluative\u201d approach. That is, I attempted to be factual and describe&nbsp;<i>what</i> we did and sometimes&nbsp;<i>how</i> or&nbsp;<i>why</i> we did it, but not&nbsp;<i>whethe</i>r we did well or poorly, leaving the reader to judge for themselves. However, I think my opinions are sometimes helpful for understanding what we did, so I included them when appropriate. I do think public self-evaluations are often helpful (though they have a lot of potential for bias), but I nonetheless think a descriptive approach is more appropriate and useful here.&nbsp;</p><p>Both to maintain accountability for my decisions about the team and to maintain a single authorial voice for this article, I tried my best to frame decision points using \u201cI\u201d instead of \u201cwe.\u201d&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>\u201cI\u201d in this article refers to me, Linch Zhang.

Do feasibility analyses to narrow it down to ~5-10 ideas. Attempt founder recruitment and pick the best founder-idea matches.&nbsp;<i>(Main focus)</i></li><li><strong>Founder-first approach:</strong> Make a list of great founders we know and match them to promising projects.

Thus, to the extent we want to focus on longtermist entrepreneurial projects, the focus should more explicitly shift to smaller, highly cost-effective (rather than very scalable) projects.<ul><li>Note that we had already de facto shifted to focusing on smaller projects before (and independently of) the changes to the funding situation, partly because we found that it was significantly easier to find cost-effective-seeming small projects than large projects and partly because of idiosyncratic factors like team member preferences.&nbsp;</li><li>However, in light of current events, we\u2019re reconsidering if we should continue to focus on longtermist entrepreneurship projects at all. We are currently exploring other focus areas we might want to focus on (see \u201cNext Steps\u201d section).</li></ul></li><li>Our explicit theory of change listed \u201clongtermist megaprojects\u201d as our primary focus and \u201cstrategic clarity around intermediate goals\u201d as our secondary focus.

Note that I frame things as \u201coutputs and outcomes'' rather than \u201cimpact,\u201d as I believe this is a more accurate representation of the underlying reality. If we\u2019re positively impactful, approximately all of the actual impact of our work (measured in lives saved or fractional&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/myp9Y9qJnpEEWhJF9/shortform?commentId=E7383cdAjeKBub3Ks#comments\"><u>dooms averted</u></a>) will a) hit after 2022, and b) will require substantial further work (from ourselves or others) to come to fruition.</p><p>This list is not exhaustive, and systematically does not include some of the private work (e.g., consulting for EA organizations, or research on semi-sensitive topics) we\u2019ve done. However, I do not believe the private work we\u2019ve done is unusually impactful or very time consuming relative to our public work, so the non-private summary here is probably a reasonable summary of both our work so far and our time expenditures.&nbsp;</p><h2>Starting the SP team and evaluating applications for fiscal sponsorship</h2><p>I worked to encourage Rethink Priorities to start a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AFgvA9imsT6bww8E3/announcing-the-rethink-priorities-special-projects-program\"><u>Special Projects team</u></a>. The basic idea is that there are many wonderful, highly impactful ideas and projects (both existing and potential) in (longtermist) EA. However, many of them were operationally bottlenecked, and RP can potentially help unblock such bottlenecks. My main contribution was just saying that such a team should be created. The actual structure, setup, and onboarding came from Abraham, Rethink\u2019s exec team, and of course the wonderful members of the Special Projects team themselves!</p><p>To quote the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AFgvA9imsT6bww8E3/announcing-the-rethink-priorities-special-projects-program\"><u>Special Project Program\u2019s announcement post</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>The team\u2019s Acting Director&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/carolyn-footitt-1a951039/\">Carolyn Footitt</a> is leading this work with Associates&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/merilalama/\">Mar\u00eda De la Lama</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristina-schmidtibanez/\">Cristina Schmidt Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez</a>.

The idea is that there are many proposed ideas for megaprojects (and many more ideas in \u201cidea space\u201d that aren\u2019t proposed), but we don\u2019t have enough time to carefully evaluate each of them, so it\u2019d be good to have a model to help with triaging further evaluations. This project turned out to be pretty hard to do well, with initial work led by me, then Max and Renan, and finally Marie and Renan, after Marie joined in August. Now, I think we\u2019re close to having a model that\u2019s serviceable enough to be externally relevant, but unfortunately external conditions have changed enough to decrease their broad usefulness. However, we will likely still publish some version of the model in either January or February.<br><br>The actual approach we took was pretty iterative and messy, but roughly, a clean retelling of our process (led by Marie) looked like:</p><ol><li><strong>Idea generation</strong>: Find pre-existing lists of ideas, have interviews/conversations with experts for idea elicitation, sometimes generate our own ideas. We probably got a few hundred ideas total from this process.</li><li><strong>Cleanup/deduping:&nbsp;</strong>Removing duplicates, clearly low-impact ideas, ideas that are too vague or incoherent, ideas that aren\u2019t very scalable, etc. We ended up with a list of slightly more than 100 ideas.</li><li><strong>Creating a very simple weighted factor model</strong>: We came up with a list of factors to consider (impact at scale, tractability, downside risk, our team\u2019s comparative advantage, cost) and relative weightings.</li><li><strong>Scoring</strong>: Marie and Renan, and to a lesser extent other teammates, quickly scored megaproject ideas based on this model.</li><li><strong>Further prioritization, research and iteration</strong>: We did research speedruns, other deep dives, etc., based on which projects in the model scored highly, had high variance in the scores given by different people, or otherwise appeared interesting.&nbsp;</li></ol><h2>Research Speedruns</h2><p>A large factor in our prioritization process was \u201cresearch speedruns,\u201d&nbsp; ~10h of focused work of shallow dives into specific megaproject ideas. This research and subsequent discussions (both internally and with external experts) helped provide clarity into which ideas we should focus subsequent research and other work on. &nbsp;</p><p>We originally planned to write 20 research speedruns before revisiting this. We ended up with 13 before the FTX crash. We currently plan to release several of them over the next few months on the Forum, prioritizing research speedruns that are positively impactful to publish. Our primary metrics for whether to publish are:</p><ol><li><strong>Direct impact</strong>: Do we expect publishing this research speedrun to cause good things to happen? E.g., inspire further research in an important area, or connect founders and funders of promising projects, etc. Notably, some of our speedruns were internally focused (e.g., which cause areas to focus and how) and are thus less relevant for others to read.</li><li><strong>Interestingness/Indirect Impact/Cultural effects</strong>: Do we expect our publications to contribute novel ideas to the conversation, or present underrated ideas or ways of thinking among EAs?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Costs and downside risks</strong>: Do we envision some speedruns as unusually costly in our time to translate to an EAF format? Do we envision the publication of some speedruns to be net negative (for reasons other than opportunity cost, e.g., because they\u2019re substantially more rushed and more likely to have mistakes than usual for RP research reports)?</li></ol><h2>Deep Dives</h2><p>Research Fellows at RP often follow up on their research speedruns with more in-depth investigations and planning/setup for potential pilots of different projects that we think are good for reducing existential risk or otherwise making the future go well. Note that the initial pitch for each of these ideas, and a large fraction of the details and content, are not original to us.</p><p>We may publish more research or other results for some of these deep dives in the coming months.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that not all deep dives are included below; two other deep dives are not currently ready for summarization on the EA Forum, but I'm tentatively optimistic that we\u2019ll make considerable progress on them early next year.&nbsp;</p><h3>Mass deployment of air sterilization technologies to reduce indoor transmission of airborne pathogens</h3><p>Research Fellow Jam Kraprayoon investigated the case for mass deployment of air sterilization technologies, particularly Ultraviolet-C (UVC). He thought it was reasonably convincing, and is investigating how best to accelerate research, development, and deployment of such technologies. He worked with 1Day Sooner to release a report on indoor air quality and existential biorisk, with recommendations for funders interested in contributing to this area. Alongside this, they submitted a public comment to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/10/05/2022-21590/request-for-information-better-indoor-air-quality-management-to-help-reduce-covid-19-and-other\"><u>EPA\u2019s RFI regarding indoor air quality</u></a>. He also worked with RP\u2019s Survey Team to run a series of surveys looking at US public attitudes towards UVC technologies for reducing illness and pandemic risk.</p><h3>AI Safety Recruiting Pipeline</h3><p>In April 2022, former GLT Research Fellow&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:max@rethinkpriorities.org\"><u>Max R\u00e4uker</u></a> studied the current state of the AI safety recruiting pipeline and got feedback from several AI safety researchers and community builders about potential projects to increase the talent pipeline in AI safety. This resulted in two scalable ideas for AI safety talent recruitment that tentatively seem like they could be tractably piloted. Max decided to focus on AI governance/strategy research projects after his fellowship was over, and we do not currently have people championing any pilots here. However, I continue to be fairly excited about projects in this direction, and may be interested in either a) reprioritizing this in 2023 or b) having someone external champion pilots here. While they're now slightly outdated, please feel free to message me if you'd be interested in us sharing non-public reports, drafts, or notes with you.</p><h3>Infrastructure to Support Independent Researchers</h3><p>Research Assistant Marie Buhl investigated various potential projects to support independent researchers. She considered and evaluated various different models, including (a) an open-ended fellowship to enable early-career exploration or mid-career pivots, and (b) an organization providing institutional affiliation and ongoing support to people on independent research grants. Overall, she thought this was a promising space for longtermist intervention. The investigation is ongoing, and Marie is currently talking to various stakeholders. She\u2019s keen to be contacted by independent researchers, potential project founders, and other people with an interest in the area, at marie [at] rethinkpriorities [dot]&nbsp;org.</p><h2>Internally Incubated Projects</h2><h3>Condor Camp</h3><p>Researcher Renan Araujo\u2019s main project has been to lead&nbsp;<a href=\"https://condor.camp/en/\"><u>Condor Camp</u></a>, a team that aims to find and engage world-class talent in Brazil for longtermist causes, while also field-building longtermism and supporting EA community building in the country.&nbsp;</p><p>Condor Camp ran a pilot 10-day workshop for 13 highly-talented Brazilian university students in Cusco, Peru, between July 29 and August 3, 2022. Overall, the pilot seems to have gone well in several ways. They managed to establish a solid brand among Brazilian top students, consolidate a competent team, mostly satisfy camp participants, RP staff, and guest speakers, and ensure participants\u2019 learning of core concepts. Additionally, many camp participants have counterfactually engaged with impactful activities, such as founding the first EA university group in Brazil at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo (recently accepted into&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/J8dF2qkybAgKgoPHo/announcing-cea-s-university-group-accelerator-program-ugap\"><u>UGAP</u></a>), the first AI safety university group of the country (and getting actively involved with beginner-level AIS research projects), and were final-round applicants to several EA-related opportunities.</p><p>Condor Camp is currently seeking funding. Plans for 2023 include AIS hackathons, the first EA intro virtual program in Portuguese, sessions at EAGx Latin America, workshops with students of international STEM olympiads, and another iteration of the Condor Camp workshop. If you\u2019re interested in supporting the project or learning more about it, feel free to reach out directly to Renan at renan [at] rethinkpriorities [dot] org.</p><h3>Pathfinder</h3><p>Ben co-founded a new project with Claire Boine called EA Pathfinder, which aims to help professionals motivated by reason and evidence to find the highest impact work. <strong>This occupied most of Ben's time from April to September 2022, after which Ben stepped back from the project for personal reasons.</strong></p><p>EA Pathfinder is currently piloting different programs for professionals with five or more years of experience who want to increase their EA impact. They are monitoring the impact of each program.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.eapathfinder.org/\"><u>EA Pathfinder</u></a>\u2019s current programs are: &nbsp;</p><p>1) Career advising: up to five sessions per person</p><p>2) Coaching to address certain issues like imposter syndrome</p><p>3) Research and project mentorship for individuals who want to prove themselves in an EA cause area&nbsp;</p><p>4) Peer-support cohort matching</p><p>5) Matchmaking with potential employers</p><p>EA Pathfinder has served or is currently serving a total of 110 participants. &nbsp;</p><p>EA Pathfinder is also organizing a community called the High Impact Talent Ecosystem (HITE), which aims to improve coordination between the people and organizations working in recruiting and meta services supporting talents in EA.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2023, EA Pathfinder is aiming to serve 166 more individuals, produce online resources, create an intergenerational mentorship program, and investigate other potential ideas such as a two-year residence program.&nbsp;</p><p>EA Pathfinder is actively looking for funding. If you are interested in supporting them, please contact claire [at] eapathfinder [dot] org.&nbsp;</p><h2>Founder search</h2><p>I think one of the most important determinants of the success of longtermist projects is having great founders and a great founder-project fit. This is even more important for projects where our team (and RP more broadly) lacks some of the key skills or expertise needed for the project to go well, such that our ability to run our own pilots or advise on the project is limited. To that end, we (primarily me) experimented with finding founders for a number of high-impact projects.</p><h3>Shelters and Other Civilizational Resilience work</h3><p>For the last few years, I\u2019ve been excited about the potential of civilizational shelters (aka refuges, aka bunkers) to help humanity survive and navigate a certain subsection of GCRs. This year, I tried a variety of directions to accelerate such work. Broadly, I think noticeably less progress has been made on shelters or other civilizational resilience work this year than I hoped or expected. However, there is more work and success than seems apparent from public outputs.<br><br>From my end, I wrote some private initial scoping document(s) for civilizational shelters and resilience, reviewed docs from others, and worked on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BtqhvcawMdrYJcKgK/help-us-make-civilizational-refuges-happen\"><u>founder search and coordination</u></a> for a potential project lead.<br><br>I also recommended several grants. I recommended a grant to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/tereza-flidrova-1\"><u>Tereza Fildrova</u></a>, an architect-in-training, to explore potential careers in EA as well as how to advance shelters and biosafety or civilizational resilience. This culminated in SHELTER Weekend. She also has some cool research that I hope will be published soon.</p><p>I also recommended a grant to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/ulrik-horn\">Ulrik Horn</a>, who has considerable engineering experience, to explore his fit for pandemic preparedness shelters or civilizational resilience work.&nbsp;</p><p>I believe there\u2019s a handful of other civilizational resilience projects in various stages of completion (though all fairly early-stage in absolute terms).</p><p>Unfortunately, I do not believe I\u2019ve found teams who are stellar fits for leading or co-leading the full shelters project. I am uncertain whether this is due to a lack of people with relevant experience and skill sets in our community, a lack of sufficient prioritization or time on my end, or just because I overestimate the difficulty of such a project.&nbsp;</p><p>In some ways this is fortunate: My current guess is that while it continues to be useful to do the preliminary research and other work to make shelters a shovel-ready project,&nbsp;<strong>doing full shelters construction is currently below LT EA\u2019s current funding bar.&nbsp;</strong>This comes from two updates: 1) relatively fast AI timelines, and 2) <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/C26RHHYXzT6P6A4ht/what-rethink-priorities-general-longtermism-team-did-in-2022#How_Recent_Changes_in_the_Funding_Landscape_Affected_Our_Team\">longtermist EA having significantly less funding</a> (~ 2 doublings?) than I previously thought at the end of last year.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi8z64uf19bf\"><sup><a href=\"#fni8z64uf19bf\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>I believe that there are a number of non-shelter civilizational resilience projects that are cheaper and potentially worth the costs. However, I feel like I\u2019ve done a mediocre-to-poor job of coordinating/ushering in their existence in the past, and I probably will continue to be poor in making them happen in the future. Fortunately, a) I do not believe most work is reliant on me, and b) I\u2019m hopeful that other people can pick up the slack here.&nbsp;</p><p>I know some subset of EAs think of me as one of&nbsp;<i>the</i> primary people thinking about and coordinating work around civilizational resilience for worst-case non-AI catastrophes. To the extent that this belief is true, please note that I currently think I am unlikely to do much work on this front going forwards.&nbsp;</p><p>I hope more work on civilizational resilience will be published in the coming months (this is not currently a major priority for me).&nbsp;</p><h3>Early Warning Forecasting Center: Farpoint</h3><p>For some time, I\u2019ve been excited about the idea of an<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zjMeGcgWpvDcm3CkH/early-warning-forecasting-center-what-it-is-and-why-it-d-be\"><u> Early Warning Forecasting Center</u></a>, a focused forecasting agency for detecting future pivotal moments and helping to give EAs (and others) additional warning for such pivotal moments so we can respond to them quickly. I wrote&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zjMeGcgWpvDcm3CkH/early-warning-forecasting-center-what-it-is-and-why-it-d-be#comments\"><u>a forum post about this idea</u></a> in March this year.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/palexd/?originalSubdomain=ca\"><u>Alex D</u></a> responded to it with a lot of enthusiasm.&nbsp;</p><p>I think in many ways he\u2019s the ideal founder for such a project (plugged into the biosecurity space, experience with epidemic &amp; cyber threat intelligence, forecasting experience, epidemiology, generally experienced including in management, well-read, etc.). We\u2019ve been meeting weekly for the last some months fleshing out this idea and what would it mean for Alex to found a new project focused on early warning for pivotal moments that are potentially relevant to existential security.&nbsp;</p><p>We\u2019re currently excited about this next project (tentatively named \u201cFarpoint\u201d), with Alex as head and me in a light advising capacity.&nbsp;</p><p>We\u2019re currently seeking funding.</p><p>I consider this tentatively a positive example in founder search for longtermist entrepreneurial projects, though a) things are still in very early stages, and b) the replicability is of course unclear.</p><h3>Generalized System for Founder Search</h3><p>We (I) also attempted to work on creating a more generalized system for founder search and founder-project matching. Nothing very interesting has really been done here, but if we were to continue focusing on research on entrepreneurial longtermist projects into 2023, hopefully we\u2019ll have more interesting work to show on that front.</p><h2>Nanotechnology strategy</h2><p>Ben Snodin\u2019s (Senior Researcher) first project with us after joining in February 2022 was finishing up work he\u2019d done at FHI for scoping out nanotechnology strategy as a cause area. He wrote his thoughts on advanced nanotechnology strategy and risks&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/oqBJk2Ae3RBegtFfn/my-thoughts-on-nanotechnology-strategy-research-as-an-ea\"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>He also worked with Marie Buhl in setting up a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AuhkDHEuLNxqx9rgZ/a-new-database-of-nanotechnology-strategy-resources\"><u>database of resources</u></a> relevant to further work in nanotechnology strategy.</p><h2>Grants</h2><p>I had significant grantmaking responsibilities throughout 2022. While this was not officially a part of my RP work, my research at RP was helpful for me to form models relevant to making good grants, and questions that arose during grantmaking were also moderately helpful in informing which specific research directions or questions we felt were important and action-relevant to pursue.</p><p>In particular, I\u2019ve been serving as a guest funds manager for EA Funds\u2019 Long-Term Future Fund since January 2022. I\u2019ve devoted significant time to making good grants there. You can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vPMo5dRrgubTQGj9g/some-unfun-lessons-i-learned-as-a-junior-grantmaker\"><u>read some of my reflections here</u></a>.</p><p>I also worked as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ftxfuturefund.org/announcing-our-regranting-program/\"><u>regranter for the FTX Future Fund</u></a>. We were not supposed to \u201cout\u201d ourselves, originally for status/CoI reasons, but of course this is now much less relevant. I took the regranting responsibilities quite seriously, and recommended 16 different grants to 10 different individuals and groups. I was pretty proud of the grants, and think that they\u2019ve helped unlock quite impactful work. Unfortunately, in light of current events, I think the moral and legal status of those grants are very uncertain, and I\u2019ve unintentionally caused some large work/life changes and probably saddled my regrantees with nontrivial hassle. I feel rather sorry about this.</p><p>I\u2019ve tried reaching out to all of my regrantees, and tried to help them emotionally and logistically whenever possible (sidenote: if you\u2019re in this group and haven\u2019t heard from me or haven\u2019t heard enough, please reach out!). I am truly hopeful that things will work out for them and that the projects that are making a large positive impact will continue to do so. I will do my best to help them maximize their impact.</p><h2>Miscellaneous</h2><p>We also worked on a number of miscellaneous projects. Some examples: we (especially I) worked on various coordination activities with other effective altruism organizations. Ben Snodin and&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:renan@rethinkpriorities.org\"><u>Renan Araujo</u></a> led around ten talks and workshops at EA Global and EAGx events, as well as a few more local events. Renan and I helped out on some scattershot high-leverage community-building activities when relevant, including for Boston, Colombia, and Mexico. Marie and I also worked on an initial decomposition of important questions in longtermist nuclear strategy which we sent to a funder.</p><h1>How Recent Changes in the Funding Landscape Affected Our Team</h1><p><strong>Recent changes in the EA funding landscape should probably have large ripple effects on our team\u2019s strategy</strong>. I\u2019m primarily thinking about a) the large drop in tech stocks across the board since the beginning of this year and b) the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ftx-collapse\"><u>FTX crash</u></a>. While I have not evaluated this rigorously, between the two events, I expect total EA funds since the beginning of this year to have roughly halved twice (a 4x decline). Relative to my previous estimate when I decided on team strategy roughly in Jan-Feb of this year, this obviously means that megaproject implementations should be a lower priority for EA (except maybe for a few of the most robust or highest impact projects). In turn, this puts a relative damper on excitement for further research into megaprojects, as well as capital-intensive pilots.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent months, we\u2019ve also received some negative feedback from other sources for unrelated reasons on the \u201cmegaproject\u201d framing, and have internally shifted somewhat away from focusing on researching capital-intensive projects before the FTX crash.</p><p>Another way these events could affect our team\u2019s strategy is that there might be specific new research areas or other needs that are especially important and pressing in light of the FTX crash, both in terms of a) new holes in the ecosystem, and b) revealing structural weaknesses that we may wish to identify good ways to fix.</p><p>A specific subpoint here is grantmaking: While it was never a central focus in our team strategy, grantmaking played a nontrivial role in our general thinking and theory of change. I expect my grantmaking responsibilities to significantly change in the next year (most likely towards less grantmaking than in 2022, but possibly towards significantly more).</p><p>Finally, a reason these events may influence our decision-making is that they provide an opportunity for us to evaluate our progress and reconsider our future plan. I hope this post and resultant discussion can serve as one of the steps in this process of reassessing our strategy.</p><p><strong>We have not decided on an updated team strategy</strong> (see the \u201cNext Steps'' section for our process for updating this). I think it is very plausible that we continue to focus on entrepreneurial longtermist projects as our team\u2019s main research area. I think it is also plausible, though currently unlikely, that we continue to do research into megaprojects, albeit in an updated form. But it is also plausible that we pivot to work in another area.</p><h1>Next Steps</h1><h2>Reorienting</h2><p>I think the team in general, and me in particular, is trying to reorient towards the current situation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh0rrsfptd15\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh0rrsfptd15\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We are trying to understand what happened and how it\u2019s relevant to us.&nbsp;I consider this post among the first steps we're taking in this foray. We\u2019re also meeting and talking to stakeholders to understand how we fit in the current ecosystem, recording our own thoughts, etc. At some point, reorienting will entail fewer mostly factual notes (like this post) and switch to being evaluative: are we happy with what we did in 2022? Why or why not? What are our biggest successes? How exactly have we fallen short?&nbsp;</p><h2>Strategy/Figure out What to Do in 2023</h2><p>Next, we are going to figure out what to do in 2023. We are exploring some ideas now, both internally and via talking to advisors. We may also canvass the community later. I expect the entire team to be involved in this decision, but I\u2019ll likely make the final call.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, the two most plausible strategies to beat are: 1) continue to do research into new entrepreneurial longtermist projects and 2) fold into RP\u2019s AI Governance and Strategy team and focus on strategy research that can reduce the probability of AI doom.&nbsp;</p><h2>Publication</h2><p>Since right now we are more in the \u201cmeta\u201d and the \u201cstrategizing\u201d phase that\u2019s slower and more deliberative, it seems like a pretty good time for us to publish a reasonably large fraction of our work, in particular pieces that are interesting and/or hopefully positively impactful for the community to read.&nbsp;<br><br>I expect a number of pieces to be published on this forum in early 2023.

And, as we leave the Moon at Taurus\u2013Littrow, we leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind. </i>- Eugene Cernan, 14 December, 1972</p></blockquote><p>The past 50 years of the great stagnation have been marked by a marked decline in humanity\u2019s ambitions. I am referring to, among other things, humanity\u2019s unfortunate retreat from space exploration. Today, marks 50 years since a human being left Low Earth Orbit. Of course, there has long been the argument that we need to focus on making things right here on earth, and keep our heads, and astronauts, firmly planted on the ground.</p><p>And here on earth, there has been progress. Most notably, we have seen amazing advances in more broadly shared prosperity. At an interpersonal level, violence and discrimination against minorities and women is an ongoing problem, but one that is thankfully (if too-slowly) being addressed. Child abuse is now rare and widely condemned, instead of a fact of life for most children. And obviously, life expectancies have been greatly increased. Humanity has eliminated smallpox, and is poised to do the same for polio. Global poverty has declined precipitously, and while poverty is far from eliminated, the worst-off fraction of the population in most of the world today has access to foods, entertainment, and material comforts undreamt of by kings centuries ago.</p><p>Of course, there is the concern that with prosperity and newer technology comes capacity for violence, and through World War Two it seemed humanity was on a trajectory to destroy itself. But instead of destruction, we have seen a continuation and expansion of the post-WWII long peace. While this is at present threatened, the Western world has taken steps to curtail future territorial incentives to violence, reaffirming post-WWII norms against territorial conquest. Our international structures have been wildly successful.</p><p>Even newer threats like climate change and engineered pandemics are being addressed - slowly, but with every expectation of success. These new and more global problems could not have been managed by a world at war with itself, but by-and-large, we have found ways to cooperate and coordinate globally. We should be aware of the growing threat of retrenchment or reversal of the trends and expected continued successes, but we should also celebrate progress.</p><p>At the same time, there is a sharp limit in how much progress can be achieved by seeking only to stop bad things, whether violence and war, or climate change. Ambition and continued progress require more than just avoiding unacceptable outcomes. The progress in material comforts is primarily the product of innovation, trade, and policy, not redistribution of existing goods. The progress against war is primarily the product of global cooperation, economic statecraft, and robust global institutions, not an imposed peace by the victors of the last war. And the progress against diseases is primarily the product of scientific understanding, medical research, and ambitious global programs, not closing borders or isolating patients.</p><p>Unfortunately, ambition has recently been placed in contrast with continuing progress towards equality. This is disappointing. Humanity has been successful so far when it both pushes for ambitious goals and continues to pursue widespread prosperity and safety. Either on its own seems much less viable. Lives that are nasty, brutish, and short are the default, and much lack of equity and violence was due to humanity remaining in, or uneven emergence from that state. At the same time, progress imposes new harms, and active government intervention is needed to redistribute the gains to the otherwise-losers. But that possibility is a feature of modern life - governments are stable enough to have persistent and well-run economic policy.</p><p>The great stagnation's seemingly widely-shared pessimism undermines progress in every sense. I certainly can\u2019t claim causation, but there is a notable confluence of dystopian sci-fi and escapist fantasy replacing futurist visions, a decline in innovation, and decreasing optimism among the public. People are despairing not only about the long term future and ignoring progress on things like climate, but even about things that have already improved, and seem likely to continue to do so, like air pollution, poverty, or health. That\u2019s not to say there are no threats, but the pessimism, such as not having children because of misplaced concerns about climate, goes far beyond rational concern about future prospects, well into the realm of depression and anxiety disorder.</p><p>It took incredible progress to bring humanity to our current far-from-perfect but incredible position, and continued striving for ambitious goals doesn\u2019t undermine that. More poetically, space travel does not require abandoning earth. In fact, quite the opposite; ambition is critical for allowing flourishing. The vast majority of human suffering has been the result of a lack of plentiful resources, either directly, or from humans fighting over those resources. We are winning that fight. So to me, the most worrying thing about the future is not retrenchment and a loss of progress, but a lack of ambition to do more.</p><p>We have a promising future. Without being particularly optimistic, it seems likely humanity will eliminate more diseases, build and provide clean and effectively unlimited energy, enhance agricultural productivity and reduce impacts on humans and animals, explore and protect the oceans and other natural habitats, all over the coming century. And these are all worthwhile opportunities - but we can do far more.</p><p>It seems that the United States has decided to return to deep space, including missions to send humans back to the moon - redoing a feat accomplished half a century ago. Two years ago, China launched the third space station, following the precedent of the USSR\u2019s Mir and the International Space Station. But if we want to be ambitious, we need to do more than what\u2019s already ben done. Much more daring plans for the coming decades, and centuries, seem critical. We can and should work on widely shared prosperity, basic income, and continued planning to explore the universe. We should begin by dreaming bigger for ourselves and our children and continue launching ambitious projects on earth, and beyond.</p>", "user": {"username": "Davidmanheim"}}, {"_id": "2tYdLAtgyrvN2eCHN", "title": "A better society shortcuts away the \"longterm consequences versus rules\" dilemma", "postedAt": "2022-12-14T05:46:45.369Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Consider these events:</p><ul><li>In 1859, the abolitionist John Brown orchestrated an assault on a federal weapons arsenal, violating many laws and killing an innocent person, in order to obtain guns for a slave revolt.&nbsp;</li><li>In 1917, the Communist political party known as the Bolsheviks started a violent uprising in Russia, violating many laws, provoking a civil war before inflicting massive scale atrocities against innocent people, in order to implement a stateless, classless society.</li><li>In 2022, Samuel Bankman-Fried committed wire fraud and conspiracy against innocent people, possibly in order to raise money for philanthropic and political causes.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>What these events have in common is that people were willing to break laws and inflict immediate harm in order to pursue some kind of greater good. Another thing they have in common, though people may not always be willing to admit it, is that they make a degree of ethical and rational sense. If you lived in America in 1859 you could easily decide that a slave revolt was a way to make life much better for African-Americans, and then it could plausibly make sense for you to attack a federal arsenal and try to steal guns to give to slaves. If you lived in Russia in 1917 you could easily decide that the forces of historical materialism and moral decency demanded the establishment of a communist society, and then it could plausibly make sense for you to use military force against the authorities and aristocrats who implacably opposed that goal. &nbsp;And if you live in America in 2022 you can easily decide that some world-saving philanthropic programs are far underfunded compared to others, and then it can plausibly make sense for you to manipulate financial markets into giving you the funding you want.</p><p>To be clear, I don't think these actually were good ideas. They were certainly bad ideas in hindsight, but even without hindsight some people knew better. In John Brown's time there were many abolitionists who nonetheless argued against his violent methods, in the Bolsheviks' time there were many communists who opposed violent methods, and pre-2022 there were many effective altruists who condemned the idea of breaking the law for the sake of altruism. &nbsp;But this \"many\" doesn't always persuade everyone. And sometimes the rulebreakers actually turn out to be right; we can easily find examples where norm- or rule-breakers did comfortably achieve their goals (such as \"great\" imperial conquerors, and colonial revolutionaries). The unpleasant truth is that kindly following rules and norms isn't always the most rational way to achieve a goal, and that's probably the biggest reason why the champions of movements like abolition, communism, and effective altruism have never been able to persuade all of their compatriots to please be nicer when fighting for the cause. Even while the rulebreaking is a bad idea, it's not such a patently terrible idea that it can be written off as purely the product of individual stupidity or vice. The political or philanthropic motivation plays a role as well.</p><p>However, not every movement ends up like this. For example, the YIMBY movement which advocates libertarian land use for the purpose of growing the economy and reducing poverty has not tried to detonate bombs in cities, even though <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/joeg/article/21/6/869/6213370?login=false\">such a thing does lead to more new construction and economic activity</a>. (They could try to render buildings structurally unsound, thus mandating their demolition, without probably killing anyone.) Nor have YIMBYs attempted to circumvent the law in order to construct illegal new housing. And unlike the EA movement, in the YIMBY movement disavowing such behavior is not even a topic of much discussion. YIMBYs simply don't consider it in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>The difference between movements like slavery abolition, communism, and EA on one hand, and YIMBYism and other ordinary political movements on the other hand, is that the latter's goals are more closely aligned with the rest of society. If society writ large shares your goals, then you will not want to harm society. A YIMBY will look at a homeowner and see that this person's life and career still contribute to the YIMBY's overall goals of growing the economy and reducing poverty, so short-term harm to the homeowner would undermine the YIMBY's goals. But a communist can look at a landowner and see that his life and career are nothing but obstacles to the objectives of communism, thus making the landowner dispensable.</p><p>So one can imagine what would happen in a society where radical views like abolition, communism and effective altruism are not outliers at all. If America had not entrenched slavery so strongly or practiced it so harshly, then John Brown might not have raided Harpers Ferry. If Russia's government and landowners had not been so incompetent and implacable then the Bolsheviks might not have started a civil war. And if mainstream American government agencies and philanthropists had given higher priority to important/neglected/tractable cause areas then Bankman-Fried might not have engaged in wire fraud. I don't mean \"radical people will become more cooperative out of gratitude if you give them their way,\" I mean this in a more pragmatic sense. Inflicting short-term harm to achieve a greater good no longer makes sense when the rest of society is already progressing toward that greater good - not only because that greater good is more likely to be achieved without any aid from the rulebreaker, but also because the people harmed in the short run are more likely to be contributing toward that greater good.&nbsp;</p><p>To show what I mean in the extreme case, consider whether an EA would steal from another EA. Of course that could not make the world better, because the benefits of funding one EA project would be immediately outweighed by the harm caused by impoverishing another. Also, if everyone were in the EA movement, then all the especially high impact projects would get funded and any unfunded charities would not be astronomically more impactful than something like taxes (the taxes themselves presumably going to good government programs). Clearly, if everyone was an EA, then there would be no altruistic motivation to commit wire fraud or other crimes.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, not everyone will be EA for at least the foreseeable future, and EAs can still judge that their own causes are better than other EA causes. But the idea of breaking the rules for the greater good would clearly become much less attractive if more people and institutions acted in ways closer to those of effective altruism, since <i>some</i> victims would lose their ability to support high-impact projects, and <i>some</i> proper reliable funding would be going to solve the highest-impact causes.</p><p>Now, I don't mean to say \"more people should become effective altruists in order to reduce the risk of wire fraud (etc),\" as that is obviously a rather ineffective way to reduce wire fraud (etc). Also, I don't mean to say that people deserve to be harmed or deceived just because they are landlords, not effective altruists, etc. What I mean is that EA and longtermism are not only desirable for direct moral reasons, they - like abolitionism - are also perfectly adequate principles for a harmonious and rule-following society as long as they are sufficiently popular. In a world where, say, 10% of society actively supported EA and/or longtermism, and most philanthropic foundations and government agencies paid a modest degree of attention to these principles, the idea of rulebreaking in favor of EA or longtermism would make much less sense.&nbsp;</p><p>So a strong belief in longtermism doesn't inherently give rise to rulebreaking, <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2022/11/20/what-the-sam-bankman-fried-debacle-can-teach-us-about-longtermism/\">as Emile Torres claims in his attacks against EAs and longtermists</a>, it's simply the sharp disparity in values between longtermists and everybody else. I suspect that if this were a world governed by longtermism, then a small number of \"shorttermists\" would engage in rulebreaking behavior of their own, such as engaging in fraud to help themselves or their immediate communities. In fact, this is not unlike the problem we see in real life where the (relatively speaking) long term and collectivist goals of governments are ignored by all manner of criminals who break the law in pursuit of their more immediate and parochial interests.</p><p>Now, for many people, the idea of EA and longtermism getting much bigger and more influential does not seem likely, or even desirable. So the argument \"if only longtermism were more popular, then your objection to it would be resolved\" may not be compelling. However, there are humbler options for win-wins to be achieved. People don't need to like all about EA in order to see the wisdom in many more reasonable ideas:</p><ul><li>People should give more to charity.</li><li>Donors and governments should pay more attention to the impact achieved by charities.&nbsp;</li><li>We need to work more to reduce global disease and severe poverty relative to our efforts in more traditional charities.&nbsp;</li><li>We should try to pick jobs which have a positive ethical impact.</li><li>If humanity becomes incredibly advanced, rich, and happy, then we should increase our population so that there can be more people enjoying that life. Pay parents much more in compensation for the difficulty of childraising. Basically, pronatalism of some modest sort.</li><li>If we spread animal life all over the universe then we should do it in a cautious manner that ensures the animals will have pretty good lives in the new ecosystems that we create.</li><li>Institutions should more seriously take into consideration the ways that future generations will be impacted by their decisions.</li><li>Institutions should focus less on the national good, and focus more on the global good.</li><li>People with weird ideas about potentially important issues should be taken more seriously. Less gatekeeping (e.g. trying to wreck the reputations of AGI Cassandras), more hits-based giving. Institutions should be more responsive to random groups of smart people on the Internet with new proposals; a non-EA example would be if NASA and Congress could listen to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9ZKo8h5Ddw\">random people with better ideas about space travel</a>. And yes sometimes it leads to the wrong ideas (heterodox economics?) but the good outweighs the bad.</li><li>Governments should work together more to reduce existential risk.</li><li>If people want to make use of transhuman or posthuman technologies then they should be legally allowed to do so.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This stuff is bigger than the EA movement and I think it would tend to be applauded by the majority of people. Our institutions and culture need to react to the changed modern landscape: more awareness of our places in a global society, more types of charitable projects to consider, more information about charitable impacts, more technological risks and theories about the long-run future, more and better ideas surfacing through nonstandard channels. And our institutions are especially not keeping pace with the changes. With or without EA, it is objectively healthy for our institutions to adjust in this direction. Just like it would have been objectively healthy for the institutions of southern America in the 1850s, or Imperial Russia in the 1910s, to have adjusted to be more democratic or to take the welfare of their people more seriously. I think most of the above list of changes will happen sooner or later, and when they do, longtermists will fret less about whether their comrades are following the rules.</p><p>Of all things, I most greatly want to live in a world where effective altruism and longtermism are so popular that I can happily overpay on my taxes or go out of my way with generosity for strangers, without having to worry that I am ignoring important causes for the sake of silly ones. Such a world would be devoid of politically and philanthropically motivated rulebreaking - until such time as a new ideology would arise in opposition to the effective altruist and longtermist mainstream, and the cycle of human conflict would repeat itself.</p>", "user": {"username": "kbog"}}, {"_id": "8xsDrkLpzvsh5zZeR", "title": "Open Philanthropy is hiring for (lots of) operations roles!", "postedAt": "2022-12-14T09:38:02.648Z", "htmlBody": "<p>It\u2019s been a busy year at Open Philanthropy;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FoBQxB7hjreoW9iFJ/open-philanthropy-is-hiring-more-people-than-ever-this-year\"><u>our ambitious growth goals have had us expanding our team rapidly this year</u></a> (we roughly doubled over the course of 2022).

If you proceed to the end of the process, you may have interviews with multiple hiring managers if multiple teams are still interested in considering you as a candidate, and you may receive an offer for one or multiple of the roles you expressed interest in.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Interested candidates can self-select into applying for a 3-month temporary two-way trial for these roles.&nbsp;If you select this track, this means you\u2019ll:&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>Potentially have the opportunity to go through a more streamlined application process (one brief work test, rather than two, with the option to consider alternatives to work tests), if you need a decision more quickly.&nbsp;</li><li>If you seem like a very strong candidate for full-time employment at the end of that streamlined process, receive an offer of 3 months of employment, at the end of which we will mutually decide whether to continue a longer-term employment relationship (assuming no compliance issues arise, we plan to extend this option to both US and international candidates).&nbsp;</li><li>Please don\u2019t feel any pressure to select this option \u2014 we\u2019re providing it as an experiment, and in case it\u2019s actively preferable for some candidates (e.g. because they\u2019re uncertain they want to transition into a career in ops and would like to try it out, don\u2019t have the financial flexibility to go through a more involved application process, or don\u2019t feel they can make a good longer-term career decision right now for whatever reason). If we get feedback from applicants that this isn\u2019t useful, or is stressful in some way we didn\u2019t anticipate, we may decide to eliminate it later in the round.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Please note that all work test deadlines are somewhat flexible, and we may be open to considering alternatives to our usual work tests.&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>If you need more time to complete a work test, we will try to accommodate that. If you don\u2019t think you can commit the time to doing a work test at all, we\u2019re open to brainstorming alternatives for candidates who otherwise look like very strong fits. This could look like: sharing a few similar past work products, a recent performance review, or a work test completed as part of another organization\u2019s hiring process. By default, our operations roles have two work tests \u2014 one &lt;2 hours in length, and one 4-6 hours in length (each compensated with an honorarium).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>If it\u2019s important to you to know your chances of being hired, or to know whether you\u2019ll receive an offer by a certain date, just ask.&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>We\u2019ll be glad to communicate the number of people at your stage in the pipeline, and may be willing to expedite especially promising candidates who need a decision sooner (we\u2019ve done this in the past).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>We\u2019ve added a question to our application form which lets candidates opt into being referred to other organizations if they are rejected later in our process.&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>If you check this box, we will share some basic information (your email, resume, how far you made it in our process, and a high-level sentence or two about why we think you should be on their radar) with organizations looking for similar talent. The goal of this change is to make matchmaking for promising candidates more streamlined by asking for candidates\u2019 consent up front, rather than after rejection.&nbsp;</li><li>We will&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> share work tests or work test scores, and will not respond to inquiries asking for more detailed evaluative feedback without first checking with candidates.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Candidates rejected at the final interview stage will receive individualized feedback.&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>A desire for more feedback is the most frequent piece of feedback we get from applicants. Unfortunately, due to the volume of candidates and requests for feedback we receive, we haven\u2019t come up with a way to guarantee this for candidates rejected earlier in the process, but we\u2019re working on potential alternatives (e.g. providing a summary of the kinds of mistakes most commonly made on work tests), so there\u2019s a chance we\u2019ll be able to share something along those lines.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ol><p>If you have a question or concern, or are a recent applicant to Open Philanthropy and want to discuss your specific situation before applying again, please email&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:jobs@openphilanthropy.org\"><u>jobs@openphilanthropy.org</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnhku4hgxt8t6\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefhku4hgxt8t6\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This role will backfill my current role at OP as I switch to managing our recruiting team next month.

Through our summer research fellowship programme, we aim to identify and support aspiring researchers in this field, providing them with the resources and mentorship needed to succeed.</p><p>The establishment of ERA will allow us to optimise our programming and support ecosystem for the Summer Research Fellowship programme.

(Hayden Wilkinson)", "postedAt": "2022-12-15T11:18:28.759Z", "htmlBody": "<h2>Abstract</h2><p>Two key questions of normative decision theory are: 1) whether the probabilities relevant to decision theory are <i>evidential</i> or <i>causal</i>; and 2) whether agents should be risk-<i>neutral</i>, and so maximise the expected value of the outcome, or instead risk-<i>averse</i> (or otherwise sensitive to risk). These questions are typically thought to be independent - that our answer to one bears little on our answer to the other. But there is a surprising argument that they are not. In this paper, I show that evidential decision theory implies risk neutrality, at least in moral decision-making and at least on plausible empirical assumptions. Take any risk-aversion-accommodating decision theory, apply it using the probabilities prescribed by evidential decision theory, and every verdict of moral betterness you reach will match those of expected value theory.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>When making moral decisions about aiding others, you might think it appropriate to be <i>risk-averse</i>. For instance, suppose you face a decision between: rescuing one person from drowning for sure; and spinning a roulette wheel\u2014if the roulette wheel lands on 0 (one of 37 possibilities), you thereby rescue 37 people (with similarly valuable lives) from drowning and, if it lands on any of the other 36 numbers, you rescue no one.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefioal3f7xjp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnioal3f7xjp\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;On the face of it, it seems plausible that it is better (instrumentally) to rescue the one person for sure, rather than to risk saving no one at all.</p><p>In this paper, I will present a novel argument against risk aversion<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdn39ya7k05\"><sup><a href=\"#fndn39ya7k05\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;in moral cases, and in favour of <i>risk neutrality</i>: that one risky option is instrumentally better than another if and only if it results in a greater expected sum of moral value. The argument starts from a surprising place, usually thought to have no bearing on issues of risk aversion or risk neutrality. It starts from the claim that the probabilities used to compare options are those given by your evidence, <i>including</i> the evidence provided by that option being chosen; that we should accept <i>evidential decision theory</i> (EDT).</p><p>To illustrate what EDT asks of us, consider the much-discussed Newcomb\u2019s Problem.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Newcomb\u2019s Problem</strong></p><p>Before you are two boxes, one opaque and one transparent. You can see that the transparent box contains $1,000. You cannot see into the opaque box, but you know that it contains either $0 or $1,000,000. You can either take the opaque box, or take both boxes. But the contents of the opaque box have been decided by a highly reliable predictor (perhaps with a long record of predicting the choices of others who have faced the same problem). If she predicted that you would take both boxes, it contains $0. If she predicted that you would take just take the opaque box, it contains $1,000,000.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Which is better: to take one or to take both? EDT tells us that taking the one is better. Why? You know that the predictor is highly reliable. So, if you take just the opaque box, you thereby obtain strong evidence that the $1,000,000 is contained within\u2014we can suppose the probability that it does, conditional on taking just one box, is very close to 1. But, if you take both boxes, you thereby obtain strong evidence that the opaque box is empty\u2014the probability that it contains $0, conditional on taking both boxes, is again close to 1. Using these probabilities, taking both boxes will almost certainly win you only $1,000, while taking just the opaque box will almost certainly win you $1,000,000. The latter then seems far better.</p><p>Alternatively, you might endorse <i>causal decision theory </i>(CDT): that the probabilities used to compare options are how probable it is that choosing that option will <i>cause</i> each outcome; evidence provided by the choice itself is ignored (see Joyce, 1999, p. 4). In Newcomb\u2019s Problem, to the causal decision theorist, the probability of the opaque box containing $1,000,000 is the same for both options\u2014making either choice has no <i>causal</i> influence on what the predictor puts in the box, so the probability cannot change between options. Using these probabilities, taking both boxes is guaranteed to turn out at least as well as taking just the one. So, the option of taking both must be better than that of taking one.</p><p>On the face of it, whether we endorse EDT\u2019s or CDT\u2019s core claims seems to be independent of whether we should endorse risk aversion or risk neutrality.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp0z7kki8xm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp0z7kki8xm\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;At its core, the question of EDT or CDT is a question about what notion of probability we take as normatively relevant. And this doesn\u2019t seem to bear on how we should respond to said probabilities, and so whether it is appropriate to be risk-averse. Any theory of risk aversion could perhaps be applied to either notion of probability.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0dwykscpnb2o\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0dwykscpnb2o\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p>But this turns out not to be true.

More specifically,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fao.org/3/ca5224en/ca5224en.pdf\"><u>according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)</u></a>, the most commonly farmed fish types include carp, tilapia, catfish, perch, and salmon, all of which generally grow to at least 1 kg, or &gt;285x larger than any species mentioned above.

One example is the calculator at<a href=\"https://foodimpacts.org\">&nbsp;<u>FoodImpacts.org</u></a>, which describes itself as:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>a tool [that] allows you to set your priorities on these two issues in order to rank consumption of different animal species according to contributions to climate change and farmed animal suffering.</p></blockquote><p>For the welfare side of the comparison, the calculator&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/villesokk/species-ranking/src/master/website/components/species.js\"><u>uses</u></a> 10 million for the neuron count of a ~3 kg salmon\u2014the very same number empirically estimated to be the neuron count of a 0.75 g zebrafish. Given that a salmon and zebrafish differ in body weight by a factor of ~4000, this is virtually certain to be false. As a result, the calculator likely significantly underweights the moral importance of suffering in farmed fish.&nbsp;</p><p>This kind of underestimation is not just limited to resources directed at the public. For example, in their recent paper<a href=\"https://files.theseedsofscience.org/2022/Moral_Weights_of_Six_Animals.pdf\">&nbsp;<u>Moral Weights of Animals, Considering Viewpoint Uncertainty</u></a> (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XAqTMomdJzoZuY4r3/moral-weights-of-animals-considering-viewpoint-uncertainty\"><u>linkpost/summary on the Forum</u></a>) Richard Bruns and Jim Davies use neuron counts as one input into a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the plausible ranges of moral weights of a variety of species. Using existing estimates of brain mass and a range of neurons/brain-gram estimates, the authors report that the plausible neuron count range of salmon (the paper\u2019s representative farmed fish) is 8 to 64 million.&nbsp;</p><p>The low end of this range seems implausibly low, given that it would be lower than the neuron count of a &lt;1 g zebrafish. The high end of this range also appears to be much lower than a reasonable maximum plausible estimate, since it would imply that the 4000x difference in body weight between salmon and zebrafish only leads to a 6.8x increase in neuron count. This result is certainly possible, but it seems unlikely to be an upper bound.&nbsp;</p><p>As an alternative to these very low estimates, it is worthwhile to consider the<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YyZtm1M3JGKs1wqR7PCY1Yav4qCo0dV5GgVCqbCNVyQ/edit#gid=1085654352\">&nbsp;<u>curve fits</u></a> developed by Invincible Wellbeing that relate body weight and neuron count, based on fitting the data from all 131 species in their database.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7zstpy0o60m\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7zstpy0o60m\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Their result is</p><p>log10(neuron count) \u2248 7.133*log10(bodyweight * 0.15) + 0.812</p><p>Applying this result to the fish species of interest leads to the following results.</p><p><strong>Table 2.

This result for salmon is approximately twice the upper bound estimate from Bruns and Davies (2022).</p><h1><strong>Implications</strong></h1><p>The enormous gap between the types of fish species whose neuron counts have been studied and the types of fish species that are commonly farmed creates a significant challenge for animal welfare advocates. In the short run, it seems likely that advocates should treat all neuron count-based estimates of moral weight for large fish with significant skepticism, and should avoid placing emphasis on neuron counts when developing more holistic moral weights for fish. Moreover, if past prioritization decisions around fish have been made based on neuron count-based moral weight estimates, it seems likely that they should be reexamined. Given that fish are one of the most common farmed animals and that the global aquaculture industry is<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/rise-of-aquaculture\">&nbsp;<u>rapidly growing</u></a>, any underestimate of fish's capacity for suffering could lead to major harm.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking to the future, this uncertainty highlights the importance of additional research. If neuron counts are thought to be at all relevant to moral weight calculations, as even the Rethink Priorities team appears to believe, then it seems critical that researchers obtain correct neuron count estimates for salmon, carp, and/or other large farmed fish. It is possible that this data already exists, and is simply not in a publicly accessible or known location. If so, it would be of great value to make this data accessible and available to all researchers working on animal welfare. If the data does not currently exist, EA organizations should consider funding efforts to obtain it. The required techniques for neuron count measurements in vertebrates are<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Bee_Bytes/status/1576623571454959616\">&nbsp;<u>relatively well known</u></a>, so getting this data is likely just a question of providing a grant to one of the labs with relevant experience.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeoq59d2agkj\"><sup><a href=\"#fneoq59d2agkj\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This kind of research would not be costless, but would likely be a small expense compared to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZbaDmowkXbTBsxvHn/historical-ea-funding-data\"><u>$30-90 million</u></a> spent per year by EA organizations on animal welfare, and could lead to significant improvements in cause prioritization in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Thank you to Aaron Bergman for providing comments on a draft version of this post.</i><br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnke8dib0w4wb\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefke8dib0w4wb\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;For another example and some justification of this usage, see What We Owe the Future (2022) by Will MacAskill, pp. 210-211:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>To capture the importance of differences in capacity for wellbeing, we could, as a very rough heuristic, weight animals\u2019 interests by the number of neurons they have.

Most especially, if anyone in my house using the oven</li><li>More generally, it my mental energy and clarity seems less mysterious now, which seems both intrinsically nice and instrumentally useful<ul><li>Sometimes, this means ruling *out* that air quality is a cause of e.g., being tired</li><li>Subjectively, I think I value the device's functions at well over $300 from subjective well-being alone</li></ul></li><li>But more relevantly, I think donating $300 to any existing organization I know including the <i>EA Infrastructure Fun</i>d of would have been net negative even ignoring my own subjective well-being<ul><li>I think this is the most succinct way of putting why this I think this project is good</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Anyway, this is all to say that the answer to \u201cwhy [I] think that EAIF should purchase CO2 monitors rather than individual EAs buying them out of their own money?\u201d is that ~all should buy their own (both altruistically and for their own wellbeing), but most are simply not going to.</p><p>So, I think the real choice is something like \u201cConsider the 100 people you/I/we would give the first 100 monitors to.

They can resources (e.g. key decsion-makers) and/or wield influence (e.g. thought leaders) over others' beliefs and actions.&nbsp;</p><p>A member is someone who is a part of the movement and (broadly) agrees with the movment-wide goals, strategy &amp; actions, and has some chance of participating in collective action. &nbsp;Depending on the dominant structure (whether leader- or member-) the distribution of responsibilities to achieve goals will be different. This has implications for how (and whether) they are able to achieve their goals.&nbsp;</p><p>Responsibilities include:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Strategy setting &amp; communication</strong>: Developing &amp; communicating movement-wide values, goals, strategy and actions</li><li><strong>Resource Acquisition &amp; Allocation</strong>: Acquiring resources (talent, funding and sociopolitical capital) and allocating or coordinating them</li><li><strong>\"Inspire\"</strong>: Inspiring others to take action, potentially by embodying the movement\u2019s values</li><li><strong>Collective Action</strong>: Participating in collective action efforts</li></ol><p>Leader- and member-organised structures are two ideal types but are unlikely to be found in real life. &nbsp;</p><h3>Leader-organised movements</h3><p>In leader-organized movements, leaders may take on most responsibilities, while members may mostly act on recommendations. Leaders may be able to fully dedicate themselves to this work. &lt;example missing&gt;</p><p>Leaders may require influence to inspiring collective action. Influence is a function of trust, respect, reputation, past successes, and the credentials of the agents making claims.

There may be little or no differentiation between leaders\u2019 and members\u2019 roles. Extinction Rebellion is a good example of a decentralised member-organised movement. Each local chapter operates independently and decideds on their own strategy and collective action. There are few requirements to be considered an \"official\" chapter of Extinction Rebellion.&nbsp;</p><p>Member-organized movements will likely have the following characteristics:</p><ul><li>grow slower (possibly not have growth-related goals)&nbsp;</li><li>pursue more diverse or complex goals</li><li>(possibly) not always have clearly defined actions for members</li><li>inspire more, or more high-commitment, actions from members</li></ul><h1>Application to EA</h1><p>It seems like the EA movement requires a <strong>strong, professional leadership</strong> and an <strong>engaged and active membership</strong> to achieve its goals. Below I outline some reasons for both. I do not try to evaluate whether one is more important, or whether EA should lean a specific way.&nbsp;</p><p><i>I also don't necessarily endorse the case as I've laid it out here anymore, as this post was last edited a few months ago, and the initial draft was written in late 2019.</i></p><h2>Leadership</h2><p>I refer to the group of people we could consider leaders in EA as the core.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrnijubbc76\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrnijubbc76\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Within the group of decision-makers, influencers and stakeholders within EA. These actors have an outsized influence on the trajectory of the movement via funding and communicating their priorities to the community.&nbsp;</p><p>The EA movement's values, goals and actions are complex; a coordinated leadership can help to research and specify them for the movement. <i>In EA, those priorities have been set by early cause prioritisation work done by philosophers (e.g. at GPI and FHI), funders (Open Philanthropy), and organisations like 80,000 Hours. &nbsp;</i></p><p>The more dynamic the goals and actions, the more leaders would need to increase transparency and information sharing in order to maintain influence (i.e. willingness to defer). This has high time costs, but is necessary for members to feel understand the movement's priorities.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table style=\"background-color:#9AC791\"><tbody><tr><td><p><i>(this was written prior to the FTX collapse) </i>People feel ownership of the EA community and movement. It\u2019s natural for community members to be concerned or following changes to the movement, such as the announcement of the FTX Future Fund and their <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2mx6xrDrwiEKzfgks/announcing-the-future-fund-1\">intention</a> to spend up to $1bn in their first year.

(I'm *not* saying this is optimal/desirable, but just that GiveWell's decision was legible). It's reasonable for people to speculate and critique decisions when leaders are inaccessible - there are strong norms against wasting leader's time - and a lack of public information.&nbsp;</p><p>A more recent example of this is the Wytham Abbey purchase, and the ensuing <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4iLeA9uwdAqXS3Jpc/the-case-for-transparent-spending\">discourse.</a>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><ul><li>Certain goals are risky and require leaders with domain expertise (e.g. biosecurity)</li><li>When members aren't willing to coordinate, leaders' ability to influence members can be reduced because the more complex and potentially valuable actions are ones where members work together. &nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Membership&nbsp;</h2><p>EA requires elements of a membership-organised structure.

Most community builders occupy a role where they can have a decent amount of influence - they can form people's views on ideas, the community, the leadership. For example, in one city peopel getting burnt out and not getting funding, shaped those peopels perceptions of the funding landscape, which I don't think were justified.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table style=\"background-color:#9AC791\"><tbody><tr><td>The influence of community builders (at least internally amongst meta organisations) has shaped decisions around what activities they should pursue. Prior to 2020, there was a lot of hesitation (and there still is today) about whether and how community builders should provide career advice to their members. Stakeholders were worried that community builderse would influence career paths too much and that those people have less impact / make worse decisions if the advice was bad. Feels like this level of discourse around leading institution's influence is not clear (e.g. 80K).&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><i>Thank you to the countless people who I've discussed these ideas over the years with, most recently Hamza who reminded me to revisit this post, and Amber for reviewing.&nbsp;</i></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnwgx4og9kz1a\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefwgx4og9kz1a\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Internal models describe the structure, interactions and relationships within the movement, while external models describe the same features, but between the movement and the outside world.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn72xqp6xj9n5\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref72xqp6xj9n5\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This comes from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_mobilization\">resource mobilisation literature</a>.

This doesn\u2019t just mean a lack of opportunities at EA organisations, but rather a lack of knowledge about other high-impact opportunities that may be worth pursuing (e.g. roles in local government, think tanks, academia, etc.).&nbsp;</li><li>A<strong> lack of freedom of movement</strong>, i.e., the inability to move geographic regions for a job</li></ol><p>This was based on group discussions and informal conversations with ~20 group organisers, mainly from outside of the US/UK. One community builder at a meta organisation at the time thought it was possible that the main bottleneck was instead that members in those groups weren't as talented or promising as those in other groups.</p><p>Based on this feedback, we wanted to develop a way to evaluate any and all bottlenecks EA community members might face, and survey organisers in a way that didn\u2019t influence their responses.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Methodology</strong></h1><h2>Deciding on an approach</h2><p>We first deliberated about whether we should take a structured, semi-structured or unstructured approach to surveying respondents about their group members\u2019 bottlenecks. We outlined some advantages and disadvantages (summarised in the table below) of each approach.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Table 1: Attributes of different survey approaches</strong></h3><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"3\"><strong>Approach</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Attribute</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Structured</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Semi-structured</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Unstructured</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Methodology</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Quantitative Survey</td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Qualitative Survey</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Case Studies, Interviews</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Sample Size</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Large</td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Medium</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Small</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Data Accuracy (excluding influencing respondents)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Low&nbsp;</td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Medium</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">High</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Time-Cost (respondents)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Low-Medium</td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Medium</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">High</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Time-Cost (surveyors)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Low</td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Medium-High</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>High</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We decided on the semi-structured survey approach. Our reasoning was as follows:</p><ol><li>Both we and our respondents had limited time. For us, LCAN is a volunteer project and both the survey designers had full-time jobs. Many of our respondents had their own responsibilities with their groups or full-time jobs. At this point we had been working on LCAN for 4 months and wanted to start testing out different ideas. We were also wary of organisers\u2019 survey fatigue. This ruled out an unstructured approach.&nbsp;</li><li>We wanted to get a representative sample of groups from around the world. This was another reason why the unstructured approach could not be used: this would mean that we would only have capacity to interview a small number of organisers.&nbsp;</li><li>We were very uncertain about the results we might get, and didn\u2019t want to compromise data accuracy in order to make the survey quicker to fill out. We didn\u2019t want to bias and limit the answers from&nbsp; respondents with the career factors framework, so we let them brainstorm bottlenecks first, before introducing them to our framework. This ruled out a purely structured approach.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Thus we decided on the semi-structured approach. This consisted of both structured and open-ended questions, which will be described in detail below. We were ultimately able to get 27 respondents, notably 11 who were national group organisers and could speak about general trends in their countries. We think that we weren\u2019t able to get more responses because the survey did take a reasonable time to complete (around 30+ minutes). To account for this, we asked a number of demographic questions to help us weight responses, such as how much time the organisers spent on community building and careers advice, the size of the group, and so on.</p><h2>Developing the semi-structured approach</h2><p>In the semi-structured approach, we wanted to investigate the different factors that could affect (positively and negatively) a person\u2019s career transition into a career with high(er) impact. At first, we experimented with trying to identify different \u201ctypes\u201d of members who had a similar cluster of career factors that enabled or limited them which group organisers may be able to discuss (e.g. someone who has the relevant career capital for a path, but perhaps lacks the resources or work authorization to pursue it). As we started discussing these different \u201ctypes\u201d we realised that 1) we didn\u2019t have sufficient data to know whether these types were accurate and 2) we could instead try to simply identify the different factors that affect someone\u2019s career transition, and ask questions about these to the respondents.&nbsp;</p><p>We then developed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pzdrPAiQuFasLsymP/the-career-factors-framework\"><u>career factor framework</u></a> (see below). Using this framework, we still needed to figure out how we wanted to ask respondents about these factors. At first we considered asking group organisers to identify the \u201ctypes\u201d themselves. The rationale behind this was to see if there were some very talented people who faced the same bottlenecks. But we realised that this might be too complicated and could make the data quite messy. It would also probably take too much time, as organisers would need to think about individual group members and (particularly in larger groups) they may not know most members personally, or if they did it would take too long. We didn\u2019t want the survey to be too complicated or cumbersome and put respondents off. For that reason, we also couldn\u2019t ask precise quantitative questions such as, for example, the numbers of members who faced a particular bottleneck.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, we decided to ask respondents to freely brainstorm the different bottlenecks faced by their group members, and then ask them to isolate and categorise individual bottlenecks, with the understanding that many factors could correlate and overlap.</p><p>The downside of this approach is that we lacked the nuance of individual cases. We wanted to use the data we gathered to help us identify the big picture issues, and discover areas that needed more focus or more targeted research.. We try not to make too many inferences from the data.&nbsp;</p><h2>Developing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pzdrPAiQuFasLsymP/the-career-factors-framework\"><u>Career Factors Framework</u></a></h2><p>We started with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/#being-good-at-your-job-is-more-important-than-you-think\"><u>80,000 Hours\u2019 formula for a perfect job</u></a>. However, we found it didn\u2019t break down the possible factors into enough depth for the purposes of our study. Importantly, it didn\u2019t account for the situational factors that we\u2019d observed from the group organisers we\u2019d spoken to before. In particular, we wanted to take another look at the concept of \u201c<i>personal fit</i>\u201d, which is defined by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/\"><u>80,000 Hours</u></a> as: \u201cYour degree of personal fit in a job depends on your chances of excelling in the job, if you work at it.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>We grouped the individual factors identified into three high-level categories:</p><p>1.&nbsp; Internal Factors</p><p>2. Situational Factors&nbsp;</p><p>3. Career Capital Factors.</p><p>Throughout the process of developing this framework we sought out feedback from group organisers, especially those with significant experience running career 1-1s.</p><h3><strong>Table 2: Career Factors Version 1.0</strong></h3><p>The definitions of each category and factors are listed in the table below.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Category</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Definition</strong></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Factors</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Internal Factors</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Factors internal to the person which may include motivational, personality or other traits.&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Innate abilities</p><p>Knowledge of EA</p><p>Path uncertainty</p><p>Personal Uncertainty</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Situational Factors</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Factors external to the person, which can be linked but are not limited to socioeconomic status, nationality, social connections and health.</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Economic resources</p><p>Social and Health Resources Freedom of Movement</p><p>Flexibility of career capital</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Career Capital Factors</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Factors that are directly related to a given career path and your technical ability to excel in it.

After conducting the survey, we updated the framework in accordance with the responses. We will describe this process in the data cleaning &amp; code section below.&nbsp;</p><h2>Questions</h2><p>We asked respondents:</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>\u201c<i>Please take a few minutes to write the most important or salient bottlenecks that come to mind when thinking about the members of your local group. Treat this as a brainstorm session and write as many things as you can think of, in the next section we will ask you to categorise these.</i>\u201d</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>We then briefly explained our framework and provided a brief overview of the categories and framework, as it was presented in the previous section.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>We then asked respondents to identify individual bottlenecks from their brainstorm, and for each brainstorm asked them to:</p><ul><li>Categorise the bottleneck into none, one, or multiple of the factors from our framework. If they couldn't categorise the bottleneck, we asked them to explain why.</li><li>How widespread is this bottleneck? (Extremely prevalent, Moderately prevalent, Somewhat prevalent, Not at all prevalent)</li><li>How difficult is it to overcome this bottleneck? (Extremely difficult to overcome, Moderately difficult to overcome, Somewhat difficult to overcome, Not at all difficult to overcome)</li><li>Do you have any additional thoughts on this bottleneck?&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Steps to reduce bias</strong></h2><p>Once we'd chosen the semi-structured survey approach, we then tried to design it to mitigate its weaknesses, and to make sure that we didn't bias respondents' answers. We did this by:</p><ul><li>Asking respondents to freely brainstorm bottlenecks before introducing them to our framework.</li><li>Trying to make our framework as comprehensive as possible and including all possible bottlenecks.</li></ul><p>We tried to ensure data accuracy by:</p><ul><li>Priming respondents to think about concrete situations by asking them to evaluate their career events first, and explicitly asking them to think about concrete situations</li><li>After respondents categorised the bottlenecks, we gave them room to add more thoughts in case they wanted to clarify any points. Many respondents added more details and we found this clarification useful in helping improve the categorisation to be more consistent.</li><li>Respondents could categorise their observed bottlenecks by selecting one, many, or none of the career factors. They could also suggest their own factors if they wanted to (none did).</li><li>We also allowed respondents to add additional bottlenecks that weren't in their original brainstorm after they'd used our framework. We tried to mitigate the influence of the framework by taking into account the reported prevalence of different bottlenecks.</li><li>Since many factors overlap with each other, we did two comparisons of factor co-occurrence to make sure we could capture the interactions between factors.<ul><li>We created a heat map of the co-occurrence of factors across groups to see whether there were clusters of factors that appeared together.</li><li>We created a chart of factors within bottlenecks based on respondents' original coding since many respondents picked at least 2 or more factors for each bottleneck, but in our recoding we picked the one dominant factor that we think matched that bottleneck the best. This served as a check on how well we re-coded the bottlenecks.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Data Cleaning and Coding</h2><p>We expected that we would need to re-categorise the constraints given respondents' limited time with our framework and how interrelated constraints can be. We re-coded the factors by:</p><ul><li>Categorising uncategorised bottlenecks</li><li>Recategorizing bottlenecks into one dominant factor</li><li>Splitting up 1 bottleneck into two if there appeared to be 2 equally dominant factors</li><li>Creating new factors based on responses</li></ul><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We used context from the respondents\u2019 initial brainstorm, their categorization, description of the bottleneck identified and the additional thoughts to make sure we were categorising the information accurately. For most bottlenecks, we ended up choosing a factor that was among the factors the respondent had originally chosen. Where we couldn\u2019t make a good judgement call we excluded these responses from the analysis. We also decided to only list a factor once per group, to avoid over-counting. It didn\u2019t change the data by much, but we\u2019ve decided to just go with the 1 factor.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Coding Career Factors</strong></h3><p>This chart shows the comparison between the original coding respondents gave to the bottlenecks they identified, as compared with our final re-coding. Each column breaks down our final coding of the factor into the originally assigned factors. So, for example, for the \u201cSkills\u201d factor, only 4 respondents originally coded this factor as a \u201cSkills\u201d, while the remaining respondents coded it as something else.&nbsp;</p><p>For ease of comparison, we\u2019ve also colour-coded the career categories: dark green for career capital, blue for internal factors and light green for situational factors.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZBtP3NuD-cbGv55nJO8IH65451xs-c6OfNOSovbem0Y/edit#gid=1978866186\"><u>Click to see larger version.</u></a><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671216869/mirroredImages/tcBoeFGNpJ5wFWvse/qgbzr6nszelqq3veqwgj.png\"></p><p>As a test of the relevance of our framework, the 2020&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Dhxg9BfBQEYvZETAD/ea-survey-2020-community-information#Attitudes_Towards_EA_Community\"><u>EA Survey</u></a> asks participants what bottlenecks their impact.

We have outlined many of our main concerns in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/eqDy2MESt6h7CiHEL/exploratory-careers-landscape-survey-2020-group-organisers\"><u>first post</u></a> of this survey writeup. Here are a few other limitations:</p><p><strong>Respondent\u2019s lack of information:&nbsp;</strong>Group organisers don't know everything about their members, even those who know their members quite well.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Only a few group organisers mentioned social and health resources as a problem amongst their group members. This may be because members are not open with group organisers about these kinds of challenges. Based on general discourse in the community, we believe that this may be more of a barrier than suggested by the results here. In the cases that health is a concern, it could be a major constraint. (In general, we encourage group organisers to consider the prevalence of each bottleneck for their own group rather than look at the average results).</li><li>Respondents may not have been exhaustive in their listing of bottlenecks to save time when filling out the survey.</li></ul><h1>Results &amp; Discussion</h1><p>Overall, there was no one standout bottleneck or category of career bottlenecks.&nbsp; Situational factors and internal factors were almost equal at 38% and 35%, followed by career capital factors (24%) and other factors that we were unable to categorise (5%) (see pie chart). The top 5 factors cross all three categories, and are ranked closely together.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa6wmv60r6lc\"><sup><a href=\"#fna6wmv60r6lc\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671216869/mirroredImages/tcBoeFGNpJ5wFWvse/kq3yu3eeehdcsrrbni2j.png\"></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671216869/mirroredImages/tcBoeFGNpJ5wFWvse/gomfyseacrx5iauv6zvl.png\"><br><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671216869/mirroredImages/tcBoeFGNpJ5wFWvse/xwjmp89igujdotkp2tk0.png\"></p><p>Although we don't discuss this data in detail below, this data seems useful to contextualise how organisers see their members' actions overall:&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671216869/mirroredImages/tcBoeFGNpJ5wFWvse/ohjm2zvu3lnwmiawyrod.png\"></figure><h2>The top bottlenecks&nbsp;</h2><h3><strong>Opportunities and freedom of movement</strong></h3><p>We expected&nbsp;<strong>freedom of movement&nbsp;</strong>to be a top bottleneck for non-US and non-UK organisers.&nbsp; Issues included difficulties getting work visas, financial or difficulty communicating with their parents about EA jobs, and separation from social support networks of friends and family. The main co-listed factor is Economic Resources, suggesting this could contribute (this seems more plausible than the opposite connection). However, our respondents also specifically cited an overall lack of jobs (not just location-specific opportunities), so we coded these separately and added Opportunities as a new factor. Opportunities are also related to the Connections factor (3 respondents tagged these bottlenecks as Connections).&nbsp;</p><p>We had 8 total mentions of a lack of EA jobs, with 6 unique respondents citing a lack of local EA-aligned jobs as a bottleneck for their members, and an additional 2 repeated respondents citing a general lack of opportunities. Some respondents cited a lack of EA jobs in particular, other barriers were: language, country/location, and a lack of remote jobs.&nbsp; Others cited limited work opportunities at effective organisations (not necessarily EA) or even any organisations focused on relevant causes. Some respondents cited a lack of opportunities to test fit for undergrads, or on short time scales (both university groups), and one of them cited a lack of suitable academic supervisors for AI safety work in their country.</p><h3><strong>Motivation</strong></h3><p>We added \u2018motivation\u2019 as a factor because several respondents cited it. We had hypothesised that motivation would be a complex issue, and the results suggest that this is correct. Respondents cited numerous reasons why members lacked motivation including people feeling like they can\u2019t contribute because they lack a scientific background, challenges due to being later in their career, lack of ambition or initiative, lack of interest or commitment to EA.&nbsp;<i>Respondents who did mention motivation explicitly in their free brainstorms, categorised it as personal uncertainty, path uncertainty and knowledge (however, motivation was not an option in the default, and people have strong preferences towards defaults in general).</i></p><p>We thus still think it could be more actionable to address the most prominent causes of low motivation, or one of the other prominent bottlenecks, but it\u2019s possible that interventions that tackle motivation holistically may be worth investigating further.&nbsp;</p><p>These reasons may have deeper causes such as:&nbsp; a lack of self-efficacy exacerbated by a lack of knowledge, or needing a nudge to apply to impactful positions. Further, lack of motivation can itself be a root cause of other issues. For example, 3 respondents said that people who were unwilling to move lacked motivation.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Personal uncertainty</strong></h3><p><strong>Personal uncertainty (internal factors)</strong> was a top bottleneck. The most common reason for personal uncertainty (cited by 4 respondents) was low confidence or self-esteem. Reasons for low confidence were: decision paralysis because of the pressure to do the \u201cmost\u201d good, feeling that you can\u2019t have an effective career if you don\u2019t fit into one of 80,000 Hours\u2019 jobs, and imposter syndrome. Thus personal uncertainty could be resolved by improving the communication of EA career advice and ideas. Other points:</p><ul><li>One respondent noted that this was especially the case for women.</li><li>One respondent suggested that it could be effective to offer mentorship and to change EA messaging to celebrate a wider range of paths and emphasise that the movement will adjust to individuals\u2019 plans.</li><li>One respondent mentioned uncertainty regarding what to do in their country.</li></ul><p>Respondents originally coded personal uncertainty under knowledge, path uncertainty and credentials. These are not surprising co-listings.</p><h3><strong>Skills</strong></h3><p>Overall, there was acknowledgement that solving the issue of&nbsp;<strong>skills (career capital)&nbsp;</strong>was fairly difficult. One person suggested headhunting to fill high impact career paths in their country. Another mentioned the confusion between skills and talent, and finding it hard to know what is innate and what is learnable.&nbsp; In particular, this organiser mentioned that their members are \u201chighly educated and skilled people, but I do think getting high-impact roles is very hard to do. Internships or volunteer positions are hard for some people to get, and that is to be expected. I believe personal confidence/charisma/social skills might be something that limits some of my group members (as well as more credentialed things).\u201d</p><p>One organiser mentioned not knowing how to support people when they aren\u2019t well-suited to 80K\u2019s priority paths, which is likely to relate to skills, but may also relate to innate talent or other career capital factors.&nbsp;</p><p>One person mentioned challenges because most of their active members are fresh graduates or college students lacking skills and credentials (because they attended the local universities) and two mentioned a lack of fluent English as a barrier, one stating \u201cThe current world language isn't English, but bad English\u201d.&nbsp;</p><h2>Updating our career factors framework</h2><p>We updated our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pzdrPAiQuFasLsymP/the-career-factors-framework\"><u>career factors framework</u></a> as a result of the survey.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>We added&nbsp;<strong>motivation</strong> to the \u2018internal factors\u2019 category. We had initially brainstormed but then excluded this because we had hypothesised that motivation was a very complicated factor, and it would be more useful to know the underlying issues. Since it was explicitly mentioned several times, we added it back in.</li><li>We added&nbsp;<strong>Opportunities&nbsp;</strong>to the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>situational factors as a new category, in addition to&nbsp;<strong>freedom of movement.&nbsp;</strong>The difference is that lack of opportunities was a lack of jobs or opportunities&nbsp;<i>overall&nbsp;</i>(agnostic to the region) rather than the inability or unwillingness to get existing opportunities due to limited mobility.&nbsp;</li><li>We added&nbsp;<strong>Information resources&nbsp;</strong>to<strong>&nbsp;</strong>situational factors. Respondents mentioned a lack of sufficient information about high impact jobs and about different jobs' salaries and other policies. Some mentioned that it would be useful to have more tailored advice, more people specialise in giving EA career advice, and better material for workshops.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Evaluation of the survey design</h2><p>We didn\u2019t ask our organisers how they define a successful career change, and used the term \u201cpriority path\u201d throughout our v1 of our career factors framework, which refers to 80,000 Hours\u2019 priority paths. We think this is a significant flaw in our design.&nbsp;</p><p>This question seemed less pressing at the time the survey was conducted in early 2020. The de facto assumption was that 80,000 Hours\u2019 priority paths (and some other prominent EA paths) were highly valued&nbsp; (~50% of group organisers in our survey cited use 80K as a resource \u201call the time\u201d), and we assumed (we think mostly rightly) that most organisers, especially those on community building grants (who were evaluated on the basis of these metrics) saw these as the highest impact paths.&nbsp; Additionally, many group organisers discussed paths in animal welfare and global health and development in their responses, which weren\u2019t explicitly listed as 80K priority paths.&nbsp;</p><p>We now believe that getting a sense of organisers\u2019 strategy and perspective would have been valuable and would ask both how respondents define a successful career change, use the term \u201chigh impact paths\u201d and make it clear that this doesn\u2019t imply that 80,000 Hours\u2019 priority paths were all/most of possible high impact paths.&nbsp;</p><h1>Next Steps Considered &amp; Taken</h1><p>We could address the<strong> freedom of movement</strong> bottleneck by helping members identify promising local and remote opportunities, and improve <strong>information resources&nbsp;</strong>by generating more knowledge about promising paths, fields, and organisations on a locally-relevant level.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>LCAN ran a pilot group of 3-4 organisers conducting <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/local-priorities-research-1\">local priorities research</a> in summer of 2020 with mixed results.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Both&nbsp;<strong>motivation&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>personal uncertainty</strong> could potentially be alleviated by addressing the situational factors discussed above.&nbsp;</p><p>Improving 1-1 career advice could also address these issues. Career 1-1s were the top-rated event in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vaidehiagarwalla.com/local-career-advice-network/project-outputs/career-activities-write-ups\"><u>career activities evaluation</u></a>, and there appears to generally be high demand for them in the community. We believe that personal uncertainty in particular could be addressed by career 1-1s. They are highly personalised and targeted, meaning that if they are done well an organiser can help identify the root cause of an uncertainty and potentially help address it. Additionally, organisers can provide support and encouragement which could improve motivation or uncertainty.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>LCAN conducted a pilot career 1-1 training workshop with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vaidehiagarwalla.com/local-career-advice-network/project-outputs/pilot-career-1-1-training-workshop\"><u>positive initial results</u></a>.</li></ul><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fna6wmv60r6lc\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefa6wmv60r6lc\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Notes:&nbsp;<i>6 factors were categorised as \u201cOther\u201d because they were either too general and were applicable to almost all or all factors, or they were not directly relevant to the question.
