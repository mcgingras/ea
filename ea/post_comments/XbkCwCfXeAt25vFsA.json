One of the many interesting discussions I had was about intercultural communication differences in online discussion.  Apparently my habit of spending a few minutes thinking about someone's post and writing the first thing that comes into my head as a comment is &quot;very American&quot;.  It seems that some EAs in the UK like to be fairly certain about their ideas before sharing them online, and when they do share their ideas, they put more effort into hedging their statements to communicate the correct level of confidence.  I thought this was important for forum readers to know; I would hate for people to think that the thoughts I have off the top of my head are carefully considered, and similarly, it seems worth knowing that some forum users comment infrequently because they want the thoughts they do share to carry more weight.  This is plausibly more of a UK vs US cultural difference than a cultural difference between the UK &amp; US EA communities specifically, but it still seems worth knowing.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "John_Maxwell_IV"}}, {"_id": "25owCJqpyxoRCbkdw", "postedAt": "2018-09-03T06:40:03.422Z", "postId": "XbkCwCfXeAt25vFsA", "htmlBody": "<p>[Did Career Research to Reach a Sense of Conclusion]</p>\n<p>About a year ago I left an organization I was closely involved in, and I spent the past year struggling quite a bit with what I wanted to do with my career. I applied to PhD programs in economics and got into a top one, Stanford. I spent several months thinking about what causes I want to focus on and whether this made sense for my career, and I made a pretty ambitious plan of reading up on debates that pertained to crucial considerations I'd longed neglected, such as how RCTs compare to other forms of evidence, what the best theories of consciousness are and their implications, and what the odds of various risks are.</p>\n<p>I'm pretty happy with where I am now after doing this. I updated my moral weight for animals downwards (though it was quite high before so it's still pretty high), my probability of machine sentience in the medium-term upwards, and my views on different forms of evidence and seriousness of risk stayed largely the same. Overall, I concluded that most of the things I'm most concerned about have research as their biggest gap, and the PhD is well-suited to that. I like to contemplate my career regularly, but I've reached a place of satisfaction that I had not been in for a while.

My background is in mental health, research and psychological wellbeing, and since studying Bioethics in 2013 I have become increasingly influenced by EA.</p>\n<p>Last year I spent some time at CEA as a Mental Health Research Assistant Intern. I wrote several reports drawing on the existing evidence base in the psychological sciences exploring ways to protect and promote optimum psychological wellbeing. A significant component of the wellbeing in the workplace initiative I proposed included following the Mindful Initiative (2015) recommendations</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.themindfulnessinitiative.org.uk/\u2026/Mindfulness-AP\u2026\">http://www.themindfulnessinitiative.org.uk/\u2026/Mindfulness-AP\u2026</a>)</p>\n<p>offering an 8-week, 2x hours per week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) course to employees as a health intervention aimed at addressing occupational mental health issues including work-related stress.</p>\n<p>The emerging evidence for secular based MBCT interventions in the workplace is encouraging. The reason why this is likely to be particularly important for EA, speaks to the shared ethics, values, virtues and character strengths explicit in MBI, see Baer (2015)</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/\u2026/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12671-015-0419-2\u2026\">https://link.springer.com/\u2026/pdf/10.1007%2Fs12671-015-0419-2\u2026</a>)</p>\n<p>and the personal attributes / qualities we may wish to cultivate within the EA community. My particular interests include qualities like compassion (for self and others), friendliness, openness, kindness, gratitude and wisdom.</p>\n<p>Last weekend I attended the EA Blackpool Hotel Life Review discussing some of these ideas and my presentation was received with interest. I have agreed to run some mindfulness-based meditation sessions at EAG London next month where I look forward to meeting many more EAs.</p>\n<p>Finally, I have recently received an offer to study for a DPhil at Oxford University (Department of Psychiatry supervised by Oxford Mindfulness Centre (OMC)) exploring mindfulness in the workplace with a specific interest in the EA community.</p>\n<p>OMC is one of the leading institutions in the world for mindfulness training and research and has recently been nominated to receive a Chair in Perpetuity in Mindfulness and the Psychological Sciences so this is a very exciting, topical and world leading research opportunity. Unfortunately, following EA grants decision to not fund tuition fees / stipends this year, I have not yet secured funding (despite being due to start next month).</p>\n<p>If you have any ideas, thoughts or comments regarding funding streams or an interest in this area please feel free to get in touch.

Between donating U$3,000 for (A) saving a life (high certainty, presently) or (B) potentially saving 10^20 future lives (I know this may be a conservative guess, but it&#x27;s the reasoning that is important here, not the numbers), by making something like a marginal 10^-5 contribution to reducing in 10^-5 some extinction risk, people would prefer the first &quot;safe&quot; option A, despite the large pay-off of the second one. However, such bias is sensitive to framing effects: people usually prefer sure gains (like A) and uncertain losses (like B&#x27;). So, I was trying to find out, without success, if anyone had reframed this decision as matter of losses, to see if one prefers, e.g., (A\u2019) reducing deaths by malaria from 478,001 to 478,000 or (B\u2019) reducing the odds of extinction (minus 10^20 lives) in 10^-10.</p><p>Perhaps there\u2019s a better way to reframe this choice, but I\u2019m not interested in discussing one particular example (however, I\u2019m concerned with the possibility that there\u2019s no bias-free way of framing it). My point is that, if one chooses something like A-B\u2019, then we have a strong case for the existence of a bias.</p><p>(I\u2019m well aware of other objections against x-risk causes, such as Pascal\u2019s mugging and discount rates arguments \u2013 but I think they\u2019ve received due attention, and should be discussed separately. Also, I\u2019m mostly thinking about donation choices, not about policy or career decisions, which is a completely different matter; however, IF this experiment confirmed the existence of such a bias, it could influence the latter, too.</p><p>I\u2019m new here. Since I suspect someone has probably already made a similar question somewhere else - but I couldn\u2019t find it, so sorry bothering you - I\u2019m mostly trying to satisfy my curiosity; however, there\u2019s a small probability that it touches an important unsolved dilemma about global priorities - the x-risk vs. safe causes.
