I'm planning to do work on a task backlog because there's such a large difference between the total pool and those that are actively working on EA-adjacent projects. It seems like having a good onboarding process that could include some volunteer work for those that are just getting started would help drive more engagement down the line.&nbsp;</li><li>I think it would probably start out as meta-focused, but I could imagine orgs from specific cause areas could post one-off projects to the backlog as well.
