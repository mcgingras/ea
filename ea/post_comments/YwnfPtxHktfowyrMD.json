I would be the first to admit that we seriously lack this right now. It seems a very long shot to develop such an understanding before AGI, but I have trouble seeing how to ensure a good long term outcome for future human-AI civilization unless we succeed in doing something like this.</p>\n<p>I think in practice what we're likely to get <em>is</em> \"political indoctrination\" (given huge institutional pressure/incentive to do that), which I'm very worried about but am not sure how to prevent, aside from solving metaphilosophy and talking people into doing metaphilosophical paternalism instead.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, we better be honest with ourselves about which type of \u2018alignment\u2019 we\u2019re really aiming for.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have had discussions with some alignment researchers (mainly Paul Christiano) about my concerns on this topic, and the impression I get is that they're mainly focused on \"aligned with individual people\u2019s current values as they are\" and they're not hugely concerned about this leading to bad outcomes like people locking in their current beliefs/values. I think Paul said something like he doesn't think many people would actually want their AI to do that, and others are mostly just ignoring the issue? They also don't seem hugely concerned that their work will be (mis)used for \"political indoctrination\" (regardless of what they personally prefer).</p>\n<p>So from my perspective, the problem is not so much alignment researchers \"not being honest with themselves\" about what kind of alignment we're aiming for, but rather a confusing (to me) nonchalance about potential negative outcomes of AIs aligned with religious or ideological values.</p>\n<p>ETA: What's your own view on this?
