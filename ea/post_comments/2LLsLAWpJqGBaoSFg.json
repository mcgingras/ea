In it, he covers a particular issue.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A third sort of non-consequentialist position is that we should not act wrongly in certain ways even if the results of doing so appear positive in a purely consequentialist calculus. On this position we should not treat our ends as justifying absolutely any means. Examples of prohibited means could be any of the adjectives or nouns commonly associated with wrongdoing: dishonesty, unfairness, cruelty, theft, et cetera. This view has strong intuitive force. And even if we don\u2019t straightforwardly accept it, it\u2019s hard not to think that a sensitivity to the badness of some of these actions is a good thing, as is a rule of thumb prohibiting them - something that many consequentialists accept.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would be naive to suppose that effective altruists are immune to acting in these wrong ways - after all, they\u2019re not always motivated by being unusually nice or moral people. Indeed, effective altruism makes some people more likely to act like this by providing ready-made rationalisations which treat them as working towards overwhelming important ends, and indeed as vastly important figures whose productivity must be bolstered at all costs. I\u2019ve seen prominent EAs use these justifications for actions that would shock people in more normal circles. [...] And there are also attitudes that are sufficiently common to not be personally identifiable, such as that one\u2019s life as an important EA is worth that of at least 20 \u201cnormal\u201d people.</p>\n<p>I believe there should be an essay targeted at the issue above. It should be posed as a problem, or a question, which we will make an effort to solve. The question is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What, if any, circumstances allow us to make special exceptions for ourselves to act in ways we and others would usually prohibit?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question isn't &quot;is consequentialism true?&quot;, nor &quot;is effective altruism the same thing as consequentialism?&quot; Those are questions which have already been examined, not the least by the rest of Tom's essay. I want this essay for the sake of posterity, something we can point to as a common-sense guide to whether such an action is acceptable, and why not. So, it might be more about personal behavior, psychology, and practicality than philosophy. I <strong>really</strong> want help writing this. I think it needs to be written sometime, but I can't do it alone.

She was making enough money that I speculated, as an adept student of English, it was worth it for me to take up a career of plagiarism to earn to give. I was dumb. Jack LaSota commented I shouldn't consider it because if I was found out such actions would tarnish effective altruism by association. Months later, in another conversation, someone asked if funneling money into secret Swiss bank accounts to avoid paying taxes so the money could instead be donated to effective charities would be a good idea. Everyone responded 'uh, no', but I gave a lengthy and well-received response as to <strong>why</strong> it was a bad idea.</p>\n<p>Justifying crime and fraud are great, uncontroversial examples of things <strong>WE TOTALLY SHOULDN'T DO</strong>.

Voters are stupid, especially when it comes to the majority. They don't want to see their policymakers spend time (much less money!) on things that don't matter to them. This is why letter-writing (although at much greater scale than the EA community could currently support) is actually somewhat effective.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Lobbying is all about relationships. Lobbying does not get done with an appointment set up with a representative. It happens over very long periods of getting to know a number of politicians involved, including frank discussions and the support of a powerful group.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Politicians rely on those they've selected as experts. There's no chance they're going to listen to EA at this point... they're going to listen to the head of the World Bank and USAID. They'll pay a little attention to Gates, Amnesty and ONE, but those organizations struggle mightily to influence policy themselves.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>OK, now that I was a jerk who discussed huge barriers, here's what I see as opportunities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>One thing organizations such as J-PAL have clearly demonstrated is that the details of interventions matter greatly. Luckily, the details are often the things policymakers care the least about. There are opportunities to make what would be considered minute changes in policy, as long as we pay close attention and then work hard to make them happen.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Because policymakers represent a single geography, if you can gain scale within a single geography, you can get the attention of that policymaker. A concentrated EA population in Oxford and/or SF for example, can have an outside shot of getting the attention of their representative. If they happen to have a good one, he could help get the ball rolling a bit.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Organizations like ONE and Gates have spent many years doing a lot of this work for us. What that means is if we can influence them, or even partner with them, there's the potential to piggy-back those relationships and be heard.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's definitely a very difficult road, and scaling EA while gaining influence and political contacts is key. Of course, it does open up the potential for enormous long-term opportunity.</p>\n<p>I worked for a US Congressman and a US Congress Committee on policy, so let me know if there's questions regarding those experiences that I could help answer.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "u4MFXSxcTWBEbFHGX", "user": {"username": "joshjacobson"}}, {"_id": "xWPR6SgejBguH7nyi", "postedAt": "2015-03-10T02:05:41.843Z", "postId": "2LLsLAWpJqGBaoSFg", "htmlBody": "<p>West Oxford's MP, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Blackwood\">Nicola Blackwood</a>, is actually pretty promising from this point of view!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In late 2010, Blackwood was elected to serve on the Home Affairs Select Committee and is secretary of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Overseas Development.[5] Before her election to parliament, Blackwood worked as a volunteer on human rights and aid projects in the Middle East, Mozambique, Rwanda and Bangladesh, and has also worked as a volunteer among the disadvantaged in Birmingham and Blackpool.

You should consider that if your start-up weren't very successful in the niche it's going for, then someone else might be (even if they're a bit less good).
