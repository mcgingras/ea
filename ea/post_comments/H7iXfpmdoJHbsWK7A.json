In developing countries, flooding is worsened by encroachments, loss of urban lakes, concretization of surfaces, etc. As a consequence, the open space that permits seepage of water into the earth reduces.

(albeit a bit late)</p>\n<p>First, I really appreciate you looking into this and writing this. I'm excited to see people explore more cause areas and give rough estimates of how promising they are.</p>\n<p>There are quite a few details in the cost-effectiveness analysis that I think are inaccurate, and I've mentioned a few at the bottom of the comment in case it is of interest. However, I still think this is a good and valuable shallow investigation. If there weren't discrepancies between the conclusions from 50 hours of investigation and 6 years of work by different people that would be quite surprising (and Google would have wasted quite a lot of money on external analyses, RCTs, etc.).</p>\n<p>Details aside, I broadly agree with what you wrote in this comment. There's a big difference between statements about the promisingness of a field as a whole, vs. claiming that there aren't uniquely impactful opportunities in a field - and I think we have a uniquely impactful opportunity. I think flooding is an incredibly important problem and there are many organizations I would love to see investing more in it, but I would not make the case that this should be a top priority focus area for GiveWell / OpenPhil / CE.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth noting explicitly that even if I had more meaningful disagreements with the conclusions of this investigation I\u2019d still be very appreciative of it. These questions are complex, multiple perspectives are incredibly valuable, and even well-informed intelligent people can disagree.</p>\n<p>Finally, just in case it is of interest and useful, I\u2019ll note the largest drivers of where my estimates diverge from those in the report:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Total impact - the EMDAT is definitely a candidate for the most comprehensive source of recorded flood (and other natural disaster) deaths, but it\u2019s not a great source for an estimate of total deaths. This is partially due to undercounting of deaths (and other estimates that use EMDAT alongside other sources find higher numbers<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-gjggiowRwksEaWAyG-1\" id=\"fnref-gjggiowRwksEaWAyG-1\">[1]</a></sup>&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-gjggiowRwksEaWAyG-2\" id=\"fnref-gjggiowRwksEaWAyG-2\">[2]</a></sup>), but more significantly due to these types of counts only counting immediate deaths (due to reasons such as trauma) and not due to longer term health effects<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-gjggiowRwksEaWAyG-3\" id=\"fnref-gjggiowRwksEaWAyG-3\">[3]</a></sup>. Tracking the relationship between floods and all-cause mortality (or other health indicators)<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-gjggiowRwksEaWAyG-4\" id=\"fnref-gjggiowRwksEaWAyG-4\">[4]</a></sup> leads to vastly larger numbers. Both these methodologies are probably far from the true numbers, but in opposite directions. The World Bank report you linked to thinks warning systems can <em>save</em> 23,000 lives per year, and though this may be an overestimate of the number of lives that would be saved by that plan, I think it might indeed be a reasonable lower bound on the number of lives lost annually in total. My current best estimate of fatalities is about an order of magnitude higher than yours.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Comparison between top intervention to all harms vs. all investment - we both already commented on how unique opportunities might be more promising than the field as a whole. I want to make a related but broader point here, because I\u2019m worried the methodology here will systematically bias us in favor of existing cause areas over new ones. At least in parts, your analysis asks how much funding it would take to address all flood harms globally. You then compare your estimate of the cost-effectiveness of that to GiveDirectly, one of the top interventions globally, which invests immensely in targeting<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-gjggiowRwksEaWAyG-5\" id=\"fnref-gjggiowRwksEaWAyG-5\">[5]</a></sup> to maximize its cost-effectiveness. Due to diminishing returns, almost any domain you\u2019d look into would be very cost-ineffective to try and completely solve the problem globally (for example, trying to solve all poverty via cash transfers would also be far less cost-effective than GiveDirectly\u2019s current margin). Specifically in floods this can lead to a difference in orders of magnitude. While on average the cost-benefit ratio of early warning systems has been estimated as 1:9<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-gjggiowRwksEaWAyG-6\" id=\"fnref-gjggiowRwksEaWAyG-6\">[6]</a></sup>, but in highly-affected low income countries the cost-benefit ratio can rise to the hundreds<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-gjggiowRwksEaWAyG-7\" id=\"fnref-gjggiowRwksEaWAyG-7\">[7]</a></sup>. Also, I won\u2019t name names, but most $100M+ programs in this space that I\u2019ve seen were never actually completed or used - so the average cost-effectiveness numbers in this space are very far from the effectiveness of a well-functioning organization doing good work. Concretely, I think that your statements might be more than an order of magnitude off if we\u2019re considering investing in promising projects to mitigate flood harms (focusing on severely affected low and middle income countries, early warning, and organizations/solutions with a strong track record).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Note: my views are disproportionately influenced by work on early warning systems, which are only a part of the work you\u2019ve aimed to review, and you noted  towards monitoring, forecasting, and alerting, which are the areas I\u2019ve been most involved in, while your report touched on other areas in flood management as well.</em></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, you might also be interested in a <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/10v1MJ9BCo_3pBtyStXtuRrAHur3PzIbb/view\">report from 2016 by CEA</a>, which also includes a review of the cost-effectiveness of flood management.
