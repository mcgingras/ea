I discussed this in my post on <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/eg/effective_altruism_and_consequentialism/\">effective altruism and consequentialism</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A third sort of non-consequentialist position is that we should not act wrongly in certain ways even if the results of doing so appear positive in a purely consequentialist calculus. On this position we should not treat our ends as justifying absolutely any means. Examples of prohibited means could be any of the adjectives or nouns commonly associated with wrongdoing: dishonesty, unfairness, cruelty, theft, et cetera. This view has strong intuitive force. And even if we don\u2019t straightforwardly accept it, it\u2019s hard not to think that a sensitivity to the badness of this sort of behaviour is a good thing, as is a rule of thumb prohibiting them - something that many consequentialists accept.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It would be naive to suppose that effective altruists are immune to acting in these wrong ways - after all, they\u2019re not always motivated by being unusually nice or moral people. Indeed, effective altruism makes some people more likely to act like this by providing ready-made rationalisations which treat them as working towards overwhelming important ends, and indeed as vastly important figures whose productivity must be bolstered at all costs. I\u2019ve seen prominent EAs use these justifications for actions that would shock people in more normal circles. I shouldn\u2019t give specific examples that are not already in the public domain. But some of you will remember a Facebook controversy about something (allegedly and contestedly) said at the 2013 EA Summit, though I think it\u2019d be fairest not to describe it in the comments. And there are also attitudes that are sufficiently common to not be personally identifiable, such as that one\u2019s life as an important EA is worth that of at least 20 \u201cnormal\u201d people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Refraining from tipping might be an interesting and/or useful marginal case to consider. I'm not saying that EAs should <em>never</em> maximise their own gains in collective action problems, and tipping could be a case in which they should <em>if they're sufficiently sure they'll donate the money they thereby save</em>.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "xwgidYuXosMKhgEKY", "user": {"username": "Tom_Ash"}}, {"_id": "YS3hRARPvQSSxks5R", "postedAt": "2015-07-18T21:11:32.068Z", "postId": "4HwgjhYrGat9Lcds5", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Refraining from tipping might be an interesting and/or useful marginal case to consider.

I try to tip generously, even though I'm pretty sure I'd donate the extra money.  I think that's definitely the right call when other people are watching.  It might not be the right call when you're alone but I think it still may be because it's important to show consistency and that the EA movement doesn't come at the cost of the developed world poor.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "4W9aM6kNK8auXsX7X", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hurford"}}]
