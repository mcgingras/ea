My post (unsurprisingly) expresses fewer concepts with less clarity and resonance, but is hopefully of some value regardless.</i></p><p><i>Content warning: description of animal death.</i></p><p>I live in a small, one-bedroom flat in central London. Sometime in the summer of 2023, I started noticing moths around my flat.</p><p>I didn\u2019t pay much attention to it, since they seemed pretty harmless: they obviously weren\u2019t food moths, since they were localised in my bedroom, and they didn\u2019t seem to be chewing holes in any of my clothes \u2014 months went by and no holes appeared.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"433juvqebbq\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref433juvqebbq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn433juvqebbq\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The larvae only seemed to be in my carpet.</p><p>Eventually, their numbers started increasing, so I decided to do something about it.</p><p>I Googled humane and nonlethal ways to deal with moth infestations, but found nothing. There were lots of sources of <i>nontoxic</i>&nbsp;methods of dealing with moths \u2014 like putting out pheromone-laced glue traps, or baking them alive by heating up the air \u2014 but nothing that avoided killing them in the first place.</p><p>Most moth <i>repellents</i>&nbsp;also contained insecticide. I found one repellent which claimed to be non-lethal, and then set about on a mission:</p><ol><li>One by one, I captured the adult moths in a large tupperware box, and transported them outside my flat.<ol><li>This was pretty hard to do, because they were both highly mobile and highly fragile.</li><li>They were also really adept at finding tiny cracks to crawl into and hide from me.</li><li>I tried to avoid killing or harming them during capture, but it was hard, and I probably killed 5% or so of them in the process.</li></ol></li><li>Then, I found the area where I thought they were mostly laying their eggs, and sprayed the nonlethal moth repellent that I found.</li></ol><p>I knew that if this method was successful, it\u2019d be highly laborious and take a long time. But I figured that so long as I caught every adult I saw, their population would steadily decline, until eventually they fell below the minimum viable population.</p><p>Also, some part of me knew that the moths were very unlikely to survive outside my flat, having adapted for indoor living and being not very weather resistant \u2014 but I mentally shrank away from this fact. As long as I wasn\u2019t <i>killing</i>&nbsp;them, I was good, right?</p><p>After some time, it became clear this method wasn\u2019t working.</p><p>Also, I was at my wit\u2019s end with the amount of time I was spending transporting moths. It was just too much.</p><p>So, I decided to look into methods of killing them.</p><p>I was looking for methods that:</p><ul><li>Were very effective in one application.<ul><li>After all, if I could kill them all at once, then I could avoid more laying eggs/hatching in the meantime, and minimise total deaths.</li></ul></li><li>Had a known mechanism of action, that was relatively quick &amp; less suffering-intense.</li></ul><p>I called a number of pest control organisations. No, they said, they didn\u2019t know what kind of insecticide they used \u2014 it\u2019s\u2026insecticide that kills moths (but it\u2019s nontoxic to humans, we promise!).</p><p>So, I gave up on the idea of a known mechanism of action, and merely looked for efficacy.</p><p>The pest control professionals I booked told me that, in order for their efficacy-guarantee to be valid, I needed to wash every item of clothing and soft furnishings that I owned, at 60\u2103.</p><p>For a small person with a small washing machine, a lot of soft furnishings, and no car to take them to a laundrette\u2026 this was a really daunting task.</p><p>And so \u2014 regrettably \u2014 I procrastinated.</p><p>September became December, and then the moth population significantly decreased on its own. I was delighted \u2014 I thought that if the trend continued, I\u2019d be spared the stress and moral compromise of killing them.</p><p>But December became February, and the moths were back, in higher numbers than ever before.</p><p>It was hard to walk around on one side of my bedroom without being in danger of crushing them.</p><p>I developed new routines to avoid moth deaths:</p><ul><li>One time, I saw a moth drown in a cup of water I left out overnight. After that, I didn\u2019t leave water out unattended again.</li><li>I would cool down my electric hob with water after cooking, to avoid moths landing on it and burning to death.</li><li>I would shake my towel outside the bathroom before using it, because I knew moths liked to hide in it.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"vaih8g5rs\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvaih8g5rs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvaih8g5rs\">[2]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>Eventually, my boyfriend and I decided we couldn\u2019t carry on like this.</p><p>I wasn\u2019t sure what would happen if we kept doing nothing \u2014 would they eat the whole carpet and exhaust their food source? At the rate they were going, with minimal visible damage, that could take years \u2014 but we felt that we had to do something.</p><p>So \u2014 after finding a pest control company that didn\u2019t require me to wash everything I owned, and saying a small, feeble apology to the moths on the last night of their lives, which of course they didn\u2019t understand \u2014</p><p>I paid a man to come to my flat and kill all of the moths. I smiled and chatted to him, and offered him coffee, while he got set up.</p><p>I had to be out of the flat while the spraying actually happened.</p><p>But when I came back\u2026 the sight made me feel viscerally sick. Dead and dying adult moths littered the floor, and walls, and surfaces.</p><p>One by one, I tried to find and <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/kill-bugs-humanely/\">euthanise</a> the dying. I had to really work myself up to be able to do it the first time, but after a few crushed moths (the sickening \u2018pop\u2019 of their heads \u2014 or thoraxes? \u2014 is still vivid in my mind) it got easier to do.</p><p>The hardest ones to kill were those that <i>didn\u2019t </i>seem sick from the insecticide, and were still running or flying, but I reasoned that killing the whole flat\u2019s population would minimise <i>total</i>&nbsp;deaths.</p><p>\u2026And that being killed by crushing was almost certainly better than an eventual slow death from whatever insecticide had been used.</p><p>I\u2019d naively hoped that they\u2019d mostly have quick deaths, despite not knowing what chemical was even used, or how it was supposed to work.</p><p>And, to be fair, it\u2019s hard for me to observe the larvae who live in the carpet \u2014 and these are most of the population. I don\u2019t know how quickly the larvae died, if they even are dead. I hope they died quickly.</p><p>But the adults\u2026 I think about 5-10% of the adults that I found were still alive, 5ish hours after the treatment.</p><p>And some smaller percentage (1-2%?) were still alive more than 24hrs after. All of these that I found were writhing in agony, lying on their backs with their abdomens curling arhythmically back and forth. I think what I did by paying for their deaths is as close to purposefully inflicting torture as I can reasonably imagine myself ever doing.</p><p>Today, it is nearly 3 days after the treatment, and (mercifully) I haven\u2019t found any living adults for some time.</p><hr><p>Why am I writing this \u2014 why did I waste your and my time with a story of such a mundane moral atrocity?</p><p><i>In small part</i>, this is a public service announcement.</p><p>I think my procrastination led to many many more deaths than there would have been otherwise. If I\u2019d have dealt with the infestation in the summer, who knows how many fewer moths there would have been to kill.</p><p>Next time I notice an infestation of any animal in my home, I will act much faster.</p><p><i>In small part</i>, this is a story, for your consideration.</p><p>I think this forum is a place to share parts of our lives that result from taking our moral beliefs seriously.</p><p>It would be easy for me to feel okay about killing the moths by <i>looking away </i>from<i>&nbsp;</i>their suffering, or by taking solace in the lack of certainty about their sentience.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"gi4rsg5zzv\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgi4rsg5zzv\"><sup><a href=\"#fngi4rsg5zzv\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>I\u2019m sort of glad I don\u2019t do that.</p><p><i>But mostly</i>, I think I wrote this because part of me naively hopes that by \u201cconfessing\u201d the deliberate, knowing part I had in killing (torturing?) dozens or hundreds of animals, I will somehow be absolved.</p><p>\u2026That\u2019s not how this works, by the way.

In this post, I focus on a specific parameter: the timeline to TAI. Subsequent posts&nbsp;will explore \u2018short\u2019 timelines to transformative AI in more detail. &nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Feedback and discussion are welcome.</i></p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Summary\">Summary</h1><p>In this post, I gather, compare, and investigate a range of notable recent predictions of the timeline to transformative AI (TAI).</p><p>Over the first three sections, I map out a bird\u2019s-eye view of the current landscape of predictions, highlight common assumptions about scaling which influence many of the surveyed views, then zoom in closer to examine two specific examples of quantitative forecast models for the arrival of TAI (from Ajeya Cotra and Epoch).</p><p>Over the final three sections, I find that:</p><ul><li><strong>A majority of recent median predictions&nbsp;for the arrival of TAI fall within the next 10-40 years.</strong>&nbsp;This is a notable result given the vast possible space of timelines, but rough similarities between forecasts should be treated with some epistemic caution in light of phenomena such as Platt\u2019s Law and information cascades.</li><li><strong>In the last few years, people generally seem to be updating their beliefs in the direction of shorter timelines to TAI.</strong>&nbsp;There are important questions over how the significance of this very recent trend should be interpreted within the wider historical context of AI timeline predictions, which have been quite variable over time and across sources. Despite difficulties in obtaining a clean overall picture here, each individual example of belief updates&nbsp;still has some evidentiary weight in its own right.</li><li><strong>There is also some conceptual support in favour of TAI timelines which fall on the shorter end of the spectrum.</strong>&nbsp;This comes partly in the form of the plausible assumption that the scaling hypothesis will continue to hold. However, there are several possible flaws in reasoning which may underlie prevalent beliefs about TAI timelines,&nbsp;and we should therefore take care to avoid being overconfident in our predictions.</li><li>Weighing these points up against potential objections, <strong>the evidence still appears sufficient to warrant (1) conducting serious further research into short timeline scenarios and (2) affording real importance to these scenarios in our strategic preparation efforts.</strong></li></ul><h1 data-internal-id=\"Introduction\">Introduction</h1><p>The timeline for the arrival of advanced AI is a key consideration for AI safety and governance. It is a critical determinant of the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tCq2fi6vhSsCDA5Js/scenario-planning-for-ai-x-risk#Threat_models_\">threat models</a>&nbsp;we are likely to face, the magnitude of those threats, and the appropriate strategies for mitigating them.&nbsp;</p><p>Recent years have seen growing discourse around the question of what AI timelines we should expect and prepare for. At a glance, the&nbsp;dialogue is filled with contention: some anticipate rapid progression towards advanced AI, and therefore advocate for urgent action; others are highly sceptical that we\u2019ll see significant progress in our lifetimes; many views fall somewhere in between these poles, with unclear strategic implications. The dialogue is also evolving, as AI research and development progresses in new and sometimes unexpected ways.

Convergence\u2019s <i>AI Clarity </i>team worked together to collect an initial list of relevant sources. My own findings during the writing process then informed an iterative process of identifying further sources to include, aiming to cover as much ground as was reasonable given the questions I sought to shed light on and my time constraints.&nbsp;</p><p>In the <a href=\"#Appendix__Further_reading\">Appendix</a>, I list additional sources of possible interest to this discussion which I have not covered in this post.</p><p><strong>A note on the characterisation of advanced AI. </strong>For the purposes of <a href=\"https://www.convergenceanalysis.org/programs/scenario-research\">our scenario planning work</a>, Convergence Analysis will typically use the notion of <i>transformative AI </i>(TAI)&nbsp;as the key milestone for AI progress.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"6636wieav94\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6636wieav94\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6636wieav94\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Loosely, TAI is defined as AI that is capable enough to bring about a societal transformation comparable&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;or greater \u2013&nbsp;in scale to the industrial and agricultural revolutions (following e.g. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K32e2yiSd868e2xd21dWhr3JCEsDMKE9YFSpgDuSQ4A/edit\">Maas, 2023</a>). Note that reaching this milestone is, as currently stated, is about the development of AI with capabilities that could transform society. The<i>&nbsp;arrival </i>of TAI in a lab setting would not itself constitute a societal transformation; this would only come from the (sufficiently widespread)<i>&nbsp;adoption</i>&nbsp;of TAI.</p><p>In a previous post, \u2018<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sfst4ujZmZhK7Xcae/transformative-ai-and-scenario-planning-for-ai-x-risk\">Transformative AI&nbsp;and Scenario Planning for AI X-risk</a>\u2019, my colleagues have specified&nbsp;the notion of TAI in more detail, and outlined our reasons for generally favouring it over alternatives such as artificial general intelligence (AGI) or superintelligence.</p><p>Some of the views described in this article are explicitly in reference to the arrival of TAI. However, in the current discourse on AI timelines, many different benchmarks for AI progress are employed. Prevalent notions besides TAI which are often the focus of timeline predictions include <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/artificial-general-intelligence-agi#:~:text=An%20Artificial%20general%20intelligence%2C%20or,behaving%20intelligently%20over%20many%20domains.\">AGI</a>, <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/human-level-ai/\">human-level AI (HLAI)</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/human-level-ai/#:~:text=Related%20definitions-,High%20Level%20Machine%20Intelligence%20(HLMI),-The%202016%20and\">high-level machine intelligence (HLMI)</a>, and <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/superintelligence#:~:text=Definition%20of%20%22superintelligence,the%20scientific%20community%22.\">superintelligence</a>.</p><p>We believe that the adoption of such forms of advanced AI would also precipitate a major transformation of society. Reaching any of these milestones would be an indication that what we would call TAI has either been achieved, or is at least <i>very near</i>. Predictions of timelines to other characterisations of advanced AI therefore still shed light on the expected arrival of TAI, and are of consequence within this article.</p><p>I will sometimes use phrases like \u2018transformative AI or similar\u2019, \u2018transformative forms of AI\u2019, and \u2018TAI-level capabilities\u2019 to capture a range of different benchmarks for AI progress which are closely correlated with the potential for major societal transformation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"I__What_do_people_think_about_AI_timelines_\">I.

In particular, AI Impacts has observed such \u2018framing effects\u2019 in its survey results. Alongside questions about HLMI, the survey also asked respondents parallel questions concerning the arrival of \u2018full automation of labour\u2019 (FAOL),&nbsp;which would be achieved when \u201cfor any occupation, machines could be built to carry out the task better and more cheaply than human workers\u201d (2023 report, p7). Survey questions concerning FAOL consistently elicited much longer timelines than those concerning HLMI (in all three survey years, there was over 60 years\u2019 difference in the corresponding aggregate 50% probability predictions).</p><p>This is an odd discrepancy, as the terms <i>HLMI</i>&nbsp;and <i>FAOL</i>&nbsp;appear to capture closely related notions of advanced AI. For a direct comparison, let\u2019s restate the definitions. We have:</p><p><strong>HLMI</strong><br><i>Achieved when unaided machines can accomplish every task better and more cheaply than human workers.</i></p><p><i>vs</i><br><strong>FAOL</strong><br><i>Achieved when, for any occupation, machines could be built to carry out the task better and more cheaply than human workers.</i></p><p>Based on these definitions, the&nbsp;arrival of HLMI seems to imply that FAOL is nearby (if not, in fact, already achieved).&nbsp;The sensitivity of aggregate forecasts to such small shifts in framing casts doubt on the accuracy of expert surveys in general, and is highlighted again in <a href=\"#IV__Where_does_all_of_this_point_\">Section IV</a>.</p><p>I view the AI Impacts survey responses on FAOL as secondary in importance to those on HLMI. This is partly because most predictions in this section appear to be concerned with the <i>development</i>&nbsp;of transformative AI \u2013&nbsp;its initial arrival in a lab setting \u2013&nbsp;rather than its <i>implementation</i>, and I suspect that the question on HLMI timelines has done a better job of capturing its respondents\u2019 intuitions about this particular event than the corresponding question on FAOL. Although the survey authors urged respondents to \u201cthink feasibility, not adoption\u201d in both cases, it seems, on reflection over the discrepancies between the responses received, that the term \u2018full automation of labour\u2019 may sometimes have been falsely interpreted as referring to the implementation of systems. (The word \u2018automation\u2019 seemingly implies action in the world, rather than the mere capability of action.)</p><p>In any case, the notion of HLMI characterised by AI Impacts is already, in my view, strong enough to count as a form of transformative AI. So, to answer questions about the arrival of TAI, it\u2019s enough to look at the HLMI result here. If FAOL is considered by survey respondents to be stronger than HLMI, then their forecasts for FAOL are possibly best interpreted as referring to a development in a post-TAI world.</p><p>Although I include results on FAOL questions in <a href=\"#Figure_2__Summary_of_notable_recent_timeline_predictions_for_the_arrival_of_TAI_or_similar__\">Figure 2</a>&nbsp;and do not exclude them from any subsequent discussion of the sources in this section, I do not weight these results heavily in the formation of any conclusions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Community predictions&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Metaculus has aggregated thousands of user predictions on the development of AI. As in the expert surveys referenced above, the forecasting platform has seen a notable shortening of AI timeline predictions in recent years. As of February 2024, the <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/5121/date-of-artificial-general-intelligence/\">aggregated community prediction</a>&nbsp;for a 50% chance of AGI arriving is 2031,&nbsp;ten years sooner than its prediction of 2041 exactly one year ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Public surveys</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aims-survey-supplement-2023\">Sentience Institute\u2019s 2023 Artificial Intelligence, Morality, and Sentience&nbsp;(AIMS) survey</a>, which received responses from 1,099 members of US public, yielded median predictions of:</p><ul><li>AGI in 2 years (2025)</li><li>Human-level AI (HLAI) in 5 years (2028)</li><li>ASI in 5 years (2028)</li></ul><p>These aggregated results gesture towards shorter expected timelines for transformative forms of AI than those indicated by both Metaculus and recent expert surveys.</p><p>In the same year, a <a href=\"https://publicfirst.co.uk/ai/\">Public First survey</a>&nbsp;of 2,000 adults in the UK more closely echoed other recent results (such as the Metaculus prediction), with 2030-2039 as the respondents\u2019 median expected time frame for the arrival of AGI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Superforecasters</strong></p><p>The median predictions (and aggregated 50% probability assignments)&nbsp;for the arrival of TAI described so far have mostly been clustered within 2-25 years from now.

However, not all recent group forecasts point so strongly towards the imminent arrival of TAI.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref8\">In particular, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecaster\">superforecasters</a>&nbsp;are generally more sceptical of such short AI timelines. This is made clear by the results of the Forecasting Research Institute\u2019s <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/635693acf15a3e2a14a56a4a/t/64f0a7838ccbf43b6b5ee40c/1693493128111/XPT.pdf\">Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament</a>&nbsp;(XPT), which asked 89 superforecasters and 80 specialists on long term x-risks to predict the likelihood of global risks. <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/635693acf15a3e2a14a56a4a/t/64f0a7838ccbf43b6b5ee40c/1693493128111/XPT.pdf#page=697\">One question</a>&nbsp;asked respondents to assign probabilities to the statement \u2018Nick Bostrom believes that AGI exists\u2019<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"8\" data-footnote-id=\"wdytd45d3hb\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwdytd45d3hb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwdytd45d3hb\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;obtaining by 2030, 2050, and 2100.

Moreover, general forecasting proficiency may not translate into accurate predictions on specific, AI-related questions; domain expertise may be especially necessary (though not sufficient) for predictive accuracy in this context, as has been suggested by <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/notebooks/16708/exploring-metaculuss-ai-track-record/#:~:text=Being%20fundamentally%20mistaken,not%20be%20sufficient.\">M\u00fchlbacher and Scoblic</a>&nbsp;in their analysis of Metaculus\u2019 AI forecasting.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref10\">Perhaps we should not overplay the importance of establishing <i>who to trust </i>here.

But amongst those who have avoided directly stating any such probabilities, the idea of short timelines to TAI has still sometimes been taken very seriously:</p><ul><li><strong>Eliezer Yudkowsky</strong>&nbsp;is a key example of this; he has generally advised caution in specifying precise dates for the arrival of different forms of AI, and has objected to some attempts to do so (including Cotra\u2019s \u2018biological anchors\u2019 model, which we discuss later).&nbsp;Nonetheless, he did note <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2023/03/14/yudkowsky-on-agi-risk-on-the-bankless-podcast/#:~:text=It%20could%20be%20three%20years.%20It%20could%20be%2015%20years.%20We%20could%20get%20that%20AI%20winter%20I%20was%20hoping%20for%2C%20and%20it%20could%20be%2016%20years.%20I%E2%80%99m%20not%20really%20seeing%2050%20without%20some%20kind%20of%20giant%20civilizational%20catastrophe.\">in 2023</a>&nbsp;that the timeline for AGI \u201ccould be three years.

For example, as of 2023:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshua_Bengio\"><strong>Yoshua Bengio</strong></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://yoshuabengio.org/2023/08/12/personal-and-psychological-dimensions-of-ai-researchers-confronting-ai-catastrophic-risks/#:~:text=Instead%20of%20decades%20to%20centuries%2C%20I%20now%20see%20it%20as%205%20to%2020%20years%20with%2090%25%20confidence.%C2%A0\">expects</a>&nbsp;that human-level AI will arrive in 5-20 years, with 90% confidence, after previously estimating that it would take \u201cdecades to centuries\u201d to reach this point.</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton\"><strong>Geoff Hinton</strong></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/godfather-of-artificial-intelligence-weighs-in-on-the-past-and-potential-of-artificial-intelligence/#:~:text=%22Until%20quite%20recently%2C%20I%20thought%20it%20was%20going%20to%20be%20like%2020%20to%2050%20years%20before%20we%20have%20general%2Dpurpose%20AI.%20And%20now%20I%20think%20it%20may%20be%2020%20years%20or%20less%2C%22\">stated</a>&nbsp;that general purpose AI \u201cmay be 20 years away or less\u201d, having previously believed it was 20-50 years away.</li></ul><p>Note that favouring timelines of this kind isn\u2019t just a recent movement. Some AI experts have anticipated that TAI will arrive in the early 21st Century for decades. Notably, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil\">Ray Kurzweil</a>&nbsp;confirmed in March 2024 that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr-VgjtUZLM\">he still expects</a>&nbsp;human-level AI to arrive in 2029, having first advanced this prediction as early as 1999.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>AI labs and technology companies. </i>Some influential figures in AI technology and development have made very short AI timeline predictions (by this, I roughly mean that they suggest we are <i>five years or less</i>&nbsp;away from the arrival of a transformative form of AI). For example, as of 2023:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Altman\"><strong>Sam Altman</strong></a>&nbsp;(OpenAI) <a href=\"https://time.com/6342827/ceo-of-the-year-2023-sam-altman/#:~:text=Altman%20thinks%20AGI%E2%80%94a%20system%20that%20surpasses%20humans%20in%20most%20regards%E2%80%94could%20be%20reached%20sometime%20in%20the%20next%20four%20or%20five%20years.\">believes</a>&nbsp;AGI could be reached in four or five years.</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dario_Amodei\"><strong>Dario Amodei</strong></a>&nbsp;(Anthropic) <a href=\"https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/dario-amodei\">believes</a>&nbsp;human-level AI could arrive in two or three years, but \u201cwouldn't say it's 100%.

But equally, figures like Altman are at the forefront of efforts to build transformative technologies, having <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond\">made explicit commitments to pursue AGI</a>. The significance of these estimates is that they are not just predictions from a detached observer;&nbsp;in a sense, they might be seen as targets&nbsp;within the field.</p><p data-internal-id=\"Short_timeline_sceptics\">&nbsp;</p><p data-internal-id=\"Short_timeline_sceptics\"><strong>Short timeline sceptics</strong></p><p>This is not a complete picture of expert perspectives on the arrival of TAI.

It is possible to take a more analytical approach to generating predictions; indeed, there have been several notable attempts to build quantitative models whose outputs are probability distributions for the arrival of TAI over time.</p><p>Two such attempts will be of particular interest within this article. These are:</p><ul><li><strong>Ajeya Cotra\u2019s \u2018biological anchors\u2019 model</strong>&nbsp;(2020), which yields a 10% chance of TAI by 2031, a 50% chance by 2052, and a 78% chance by 2100.</li><li><strong>Epoch\u2019s \u2018Direct Approach\u2019 </strong>(2023), which yields a 10% chance of TAI being developed by 2025, and a 50% chance of it being developed by 2033.</li></ul><p>In <a href=\"#III__Two_influential_forecast_models_based_on_the_scaling_hypothesis\">Section III</a>,&nbsp;I&nbsp;turn to examine these models in detail, outlining their assumptions, explicating their methods, and noting some possible objections to the approaches taken.</p><p>For now, let\u2019s briefly summarise the landscape of views we have covered in this section.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Rounding_up\">Rounding up</h2><p>In the table below (Figure 2), I provide a summary of the key results surveyed in this section.</p><h3><strong>Important notes on the table</strong></h3><p>This is not intended as a direct comparison between predictions. Indeed, there are several key areas of disanalogy amongst the sources covered:</p><p>(i) <i>Different characterisations of advanced AI </i>have been used across the sources.&nbsp;</p><p>As stated previously, we consider most of these characterisations as constituting or closely corresponding to TAI, due to their clear transformative potential. However, the specific definitions used&nbsp;do matter, and should be taken into consideration when viewing the table. For example, those whose chosen benchmark for AI development is the ability to perform <i>every</i>&nbsp;human task should be expected to have longer timelines here than those concerned with AIs performing 90% of those tasks.</p><p>Where a source has specified a definition for an otherwise ambiguous term (such as \u2018high-level machine intelligence\u2019), this has been included in the table. The exception to this is where sources have directly appealed to the notion of TAI, employing the definition of this term I set out in the <a href=\"#Introduction\">Introduction</a>, which I do not restate.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref12\">(ii) There is sometimes&nbsp;ambiguity over<i>&nbsp;the meaning of a predicted date</i>&nbsp;in these sources.&nbsp;</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref12\">A forecaster might either mean to predict the date at which an advanced AI system is developed or the date at which such systems are implemented.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"12\" data-footnote-id=\"i9b2wy8ge2d\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi9b2wy8ge2d\"><sup><a href=\"#fni9b2wy8ge2d\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Most sources described in this section appear to target the former date. For example, AI Impacts explicitly urges its survey respondents to \u201cthink feasibility, not adoption\u201d when giving their predictions. However, survey respondents might still interpret instructions like these variably based on other aspects of framing.&nbsp;Moreover, in some individual predictions (especially personal views which have been expressed in imprecise terms) the relevant date is left largely open to interpretation.</p><p>In the table, I talk about the \u2018arrival of\u2019 advanced AI systems, taking this to refer to the initial arrival of the relevant capabilities within a lab setting. Though I believe that this accurately captures the intended meaning of most responses, this assumption does gloss over some potential variation here.&nbsp;</p><p>(iii) Each source elicits <i>predictions across different years and percentiles</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>As such, the range of views covered is resistant to any direct comparison without extrapolation work which is beyond scope of this article. See <a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/literature-review-of-transformative-artificial-intelligence-timelines\">Epoch\u2019s 2023 literature review of TAI timelines</a>&nbsp;for an interesting example of this kind of extrapolation, enabling a more direct comparison between sources.</p><p>(iv) <i>Not all forecasters have explicitly assigned probabilities to their predictions</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>In particular, some individuals have expressed that they view timelines of a certain length to be plausible or implausible, without specifying such claims more precisely with probabilities. Although it is difficult to compare such vague predictions to the explicit forecasts offered by other sources, I have nonetheless included in this table the full range of views described in this section.</p><p>(v) <i>Forecast aggregation methods are variable.&nbsp;</i></p><p>When a source has asked multiple respondents to each provide one date for the arrival of advanced AI, a median date is straightforwardly extracted from the list of elicited dates. However, when a source has asked its respondents to each make predictions over a <i>series</i>&nbsp;of fixed years (e.g. 2030, 2050, 2100) or fixed confidence percentiles (e.g. 10%, 50%, 90%), there are several different methods by which they could then \u2018aggregate\u2019 these results.</p><p>One option in this case is to simply take the median forecaster response for each fixed year or fixed percentile. But there are other, often more complex, aggregation methods which may be favoured. In the table, I use the term \u2018aggregate prediction\u2019 to cover a range of aggregation methods, without distinguishing between them.

Why do people think AI will advance?</h1><p>We have surveyed a range of predictions of the arrival of TAI. What we have not yet discussed is <i>what is underlying these differing expectations</i>.</p><p>Specifically: why might we think that we will achieve TAI (or similar) in the first place? And what would determine whether this feat will take a long or short time to achieve? This section will help to give a partial answer to these questions.</p><p>There are several possible routes to humanity developing TAI. The most commonly discussed is a pathway based on the \u2018scaling hypothesis\u2019, outlined below. Assumptions about scaling in relation to AI capabilities are one key determinant of AI timeline predictions, as will be illustrated further in <a href=\"#III__Two_influential_forecast_models_based_on_the_scaling_hypothesis\">Section III</a>.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"The_scaling_hypothesis_\">The scaling hypothesis&nbsp;</h2><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref17\">Many efforts to predict the arrival of TAI have assumed the \u2018<a href=\"https://gwern.net/scaling-hypothesis#scaling-hypothesis\">scaling hypothesis</a>\u2019. For the purposes of this article, I will define this as the assumption that, primarily through increasing computational power, neural networks will scale to arbitrarily powerful AI systems.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"17\" data-footnote-id=\"lr5ic1hwp1f\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflr5ic1hwp1f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlr5ic1hwp1f\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Note that there are other ways of thinking about the scaling hypothesis. Its proponents agree that computational power, data, and algorithms all contribute to AI capability improvements, but sometimes disagree on the balance of contributions between these three key elements. Under the popular variant of the scaling hypothesis that I have chosen to employ, increased computational power is <i>the most important </i>\u2013 but not only \u2013 factor driving progress in AI capabilities.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref18\">Thus defined, the scaling hypothesis tells us that&nbsp;the current paradigm<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"18\" data-footnote-id=\"qqrpuixt81\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqqrpuixt81\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqqrpuixt81\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;can reach human-level AI, AGI, superintelligence, and other transformative forms of AI; crossing these thresholds will primarily be a matter of obtaining sufficient levels of computational power.</p><p>This roughly tracks what we have seen so far with existing neural networks and deep learning techniques \u2013 increased compute has closely corresponded with increased capabilities. We have seen, for example, how increasing computational power dramatically (while keeping system architecture largely the same) has underpinned a significant jump in capabilities from GPT-2 vs GPT-3, and again from GPT-3 to GPT-4.&nbsp;Many experts believe this trend is likely to continue.</p><p>But not everyone endorses the scaling hypothesis. Some reject the assumption that neural networks can scale in capability indefinitely with increased compute \u2013 typically arguing that this is technically infeasible or will become prohibitively expensive \u2013 and instead expect that a paradigm shift will be necessary to achieve TAI. Those who expect this often endorse longer timelines to TAI, owing to the additional time that may be required for researchers to discover and develop a paradigm of AI that will succeed.</p><p>Moreover, even amongst those who do believe that the scaling hypothesis holds, there is still significant variation in AI timeline predictions. As we will shortly see, specific timeline predictions resulting from an assumption of the scaling hypothesis are partly determined by <i>the level of computational power that is believed to be required for TAI</i>.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Alternative_pathways_to_TAI\">Alternative pathways&nbsp;to TAI</h2><p>There are other&nbsp;potential pathways to TAI which do not rely on the scaling hypothesis. These are less commonly discussed in the literature, but have been compiled in a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K32e2yiSd868e2xd21dWhr3JCEsDMKE9YFSpgDuSQ4A/edit\">2023 literature review from Matthijs Maas</a>. We summarise these alternative pathways in a subsequent post on short timelines to TAI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"III__Two_influential_forecast_models_based_on_the_scaling_hypothesis\">III. Two influential forecast models based on the scaling hypothesis</h1><p>The scaling hypothesis is often used to make an in-principle argument towards shorter timelines, with a story that goes roughly like this:</p><ol><li>Computational resources get cheaper and more easily accessible over time;</li><li>Developers rapidly plug more and more compute into neural network systems utilising current deep learning methods;</li><li>In accordance with the scaling hypothesis, additional compute translates into additional capability for current systems;</li><li>So, before long, we get ultra-capable AIs (TAI or similar).</li></ol><p>Of course, this argument (in its present form) does not assign probabilities to any dates. But the scaling hypothesis can also be used to directly generate a forecast: we can build a quantitative model that predicts the arrival of AI with a certain level of capability or \u2018intelligence\u2019.</p><p>To translate the scaling hypothesis into a forecast for the arrival of TAI, we effectively need to estimate:</p><p>(E1)<i> how much computational power would be sufficient for current methods to achieve TAI-level capabilities; </i>and</p><p>(E2) <i>how long it will take us to build systems with this amount of computational power.</i></p><p>Throughout this section, I will refer to these two targets of estimation as (E1) and (E2). When forecast models which rely on the scaling hypothesis vary in their predictions for the timeline to TAI, it is generally a result of differences in their approaches to estimating (E1) or (E2).</p><p>We can forecast (E2) using economic models which take into account investment into hardware alongside price performance. Though this itself is no easy task, I am particularly interested in different approaches to estimating (E1), for the purposes of this article.</p><p>Below, I explore two forecasting models, both based on the scaling hypothesis, which take very different approaches to estimating (E1). I outline their assumptions and methods, the timeline predictions they have yielded, and their possible shortcomings.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Approach_1___Biological_anchors__\">Approach 1: \u2018Biological anchors\u2019</h2><p><i>Note: I owe parts&nbsp;of&nbsp;the exposition in this subsection to Scott Alexander\u2019s </i><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NGkBfd8LTqcpbQn5Z/biological-anchors-the-trick-that-might-or-might-not-work\"><i>\u2018Biological Anchors: The Trick that Might or Might Not Work\u2019</i></a><i>. I recommend reading that post for a more detailed treatment of Ajeya Cotra\u2019s work and Eliezer Yudkowsky\u2019s objections.</i></p><h3 data-internal-id=\"The_approach_\">The approach</h3><p>One class of approaches to estimating (E1) takes inspiration from biology.</p><p>The basic idea is that achieving TAI or similar&nbsp;requires&nbsp;an AI system to be roughly as intelligent as the human brain. So, a good way to estimate the amount of computation required to achieve TAI-level capabilities would be to ask: how much computation would be needed to create a system which (in some sense) replicates the biological&nbsp;workings of the human brain?</p><p>If&nbsp;we can use evidence from biology to answer this question \u2013 and then estimate (E2) based on the resulting computational threshold \u2013 we can build a forecast for the arrival of TAI which is effectively \u2018anchored\u2019 in biological estimates.</p><p>A notable, recent approach in this direction comes from <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/15ArhEPZSTYU8f012bs6ehPS6-xmhtBPP\">Ajeya Cotra\u2019s 2020 draft report on biological anchors</a>. Like us, Cotra is explicitly focused on TAI, understood as AI with transformative impact comparable to that of the Industrial Revolution. Her specific conceptualisation of such a transformative model is one which can \u201cperform a large majority of economically valuable jobs more cheaply than human workers can.\u201d (Part 1, p3)</p><p>She seeks to estimate (E1) using biological anchors. In her words:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI see the human brain as an \u2018existence proof\u2019<strong>&nbsp;</strong>found in nature for this type of transformative model, so I use evidence from biology to help estimate the computation needed to train it.\u201d (Part 1, p4)</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How it works</strong></h3><p>Cotra asks: how much training computation is required to replicate the human brain?</p><p>She identifies six possible answers to this question, corresponding to different features (\u2018anchors\u2019) of biological life that training computation might have to mimic in order to achieve the desired level of&nbsp;AI capability. Specifically, the biological anchors are:</p><ul><li><strong>Neural network anchors. </strong>Assume that the system would need to perform as much <i>inferential computation</i>&nbsp;as is performed by the human brain (estimated at 10^16&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS\">FLOP/s</a>), and would also need to have as many parameters as we would expect from simply scaling up architectures of the largest neural networks to run on<i>&nbsp;</i>this level of FLOP/s.&nbsp;<br>The resulting estimate for training computation will be dependent on the 'horizon' length \u2013 the average length of time required to learn how much reward an action has received. Cotra considers three possibilities here:<ul><li><strong>Short horizon: </strong>a few minutes.</li><li><strong>Medium horizon: </strong>a few hours.</li><li><strong>Long horizon: </strong>a few years.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Genome anchor. </strong>Assumes that the system would need to run on as much <i>inferential computation</i>&nbsp;as performed by the human brain (estimated at 10^16&nbsp;FLOP/s), and would also need to have roughly as many parameters as there are in the human genome (estimated at 7.5*10^8).</li><li><strong>Human lifetime anchor. </strong>Assumes that training computation requirements will resemble the amount of computation performed by a child\u2019s brain over the course of becoming an adult.</li><li><strong>Evolution anchor.</strong>&nbsp;Assumes that training computation requirements will resemble the amount of computation performed over the course of human evolution.</li></ul><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref19\">Each of these anchors yields&nbsp;(after several further assumptions are made) a distinct threshold for training computation. Note&nbsp;that, either directly or indirectly, they all appeal to an assumption that the total <i>inferential computation</i>&nbsp;performed by the human brain is&nbsp;10^16&nbsp;FLOP/s.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"19\" data-footnote-id=\"gcxu4ss2ur\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgcxu4ss2ur\"><sup><a href=\"#fngcxu4ss2ur\">[19]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than selecting one threshold to proceed with,&nbsp;she assigns a probability to each, based on how plausible she thinks the chosen anchor is. The resulting thresholds for training computation and the probabilities corresponding to each estimate are summarised in the table below.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"Figure_3__Training_computation_estimates_and_probabilistic_weightings_by_anchor_type_\">Figure 3.

There are several additional steps before this can be used to generate a forecast, each introducing new complexities and uncertainties.</p><p>Firstly, the computational thresholds identified above do not yet account for algorithmic progress over time (i.e. improvements to efficiency such that better performance can be achieved with less training computation). To this end, Cotra makes some assumptions which draw upon <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2005/2005.04305.pdf\">results from Hernandez and Brown</a>&nbsp;to project algorithmic progress over time.&nbsp;For each of the six weighted anchors, training computation thresholds for TAI over time can then be modelled.</p><p>She is then left to answer (E2): when will AIs be developed with enough training computation resources to meet the requirements for TAI?&nbsp;Answering this requires considerable additional effort. As a brief (and very rough) overview,&nbsp;Cotra proceeds to do the following:</p><ul><li>Quantitatively model how much training computation (in FLOP) AI developers will have access to over time by projecting trends into the future for compute-investment ($) and hardware cost-effectiveness (FLOP/$);</li><li>Compare the&nbsp;amount of training computation developers will have access to in the future against the six biology-inspired models for FLOP requirements over time, to identify when FLOP levels will hit one of the estimated thresholds for TAI-level capabilities;</li><li>Assign probabilities for TAI being achieved in each year, according to the weightings of the biological anchor estimates.</li></ul><h3 data-internal-id=\"The_result\">The result</h3><p>This forecast model arrives at the following predictions:</p><ul><li>10% chance of TAI arriving by 2031</li><li>50% chance of TAI arriving by 2052</li><li>78% chance of TAI arriving by 2100</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NGkBfd8LTqcpbQn5Z/biological-anchors-the-trick-that-might-or-might-not-work#How_Sensitive_Is_This_To_Changes_In_Assumptions_\">Scott Alexander has observed</a>&nbsp;that weighting the six anchors differently or tweaking some of the assumptions underlying Cotra\u2019s model does not usually lead to huge variation in these results. For example, suppose we significantly reduce our projections for investment and algorithmic progress in the coming years, and choose to weight one of the six anchors to 100%. For four of the six anchors, the model still yields a median prediction of TAI arriving between 2030-2070. The two anchors for which this does not apply (the evolution anchor and the neural network anchor with a long horizon) are not favoured by Cotra, and she doesn\u2019t weight them heavily in her own model.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"Objections\">Objections</h3><p>One obvious objection to models that are based on biological evidence is that our current understanding of how intelligence arises in biological life is actually very limited. We don\u2019t <i>know</i>, for example, how much inferential computation is performed by the human brain, or the total amount of training computation that has been performed over the course of evolution, or the extent to which either of those things has actually contributed to human intelligence. Indeed, Cotra has had to lean on a stack of assumptions and inexact estimations to arrive at each of her six biologically-inspired computational thresholds.&nbsp;As such, computational requirements arrived at from biological anchors are hard to trust.</p><p>Perhaps this objection means that we can\u2019t put too much stock in the <i>details</i>&nbsp;of the forecast. But we might still think that the essence of the approach is promising, and the model could be refined as our understanding of biology is improved \u2013 right?</p><p>Maybe not. There has been resistance to more fundamental aspects of the approach which could not be addressed by simply updating the model in light of new evidence. In particular, we might question in the first place <i>why</i>&nbsp;we should think that advanced AI systems will resemble biological intelligence in any meaningful sense.</p><p>An influential version of this objection has been levelled by Eliezer Yudkowsky in \u2018<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ax695frGJEzGxFBK4/biology-inspired-agi-timelines-the-trick-that-never-works\">Biological Anchors: The Trick That Never Works\u2019</a>. He points out that, just as AIs consume energy in a very different way to humans, we can expect them to also \u2018consume\u2019 computational resources in a very different way to us, resisting comparison. Therefore, any projected compute requirements for machine intelligence which are based on analogies to biological intelligence are on flimsy grounds.</p><p>Scott Alexander supplies additional examples to bolster our intuitions here:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cCars don\u2019t move by contracting their leg muscles and planes don\u2019t fly by flapping their wings like birds. Telescopes <i>do</i>&nbsp;form images the same way as the lenses in our eyes, but differ by so many orders of magnitude in every important way that they defy comparison. Why should AI be different?\u201d</p></blockquote><p>To reinforce these points, we can note that <i>already</i>, the way that current AIs and human brains work is clearly disanalogous in many ways. We can consider, for example, the major differences between us in terms of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate\">clock speed</a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing\">parallel computing</a>.</p><p>In fact, we can go much further than this: we can point to disanalogies between humans and machines which are specific to the chosen biological anchors.&nbsp;For example, the total amount of \u2018training\u2019 performed in evolution did far more than just produce human intelligence \u2013 it also created numerous other species, whose emergence was surely not essential to the formation of human intelligence.&nbsp;It therefore does not seem to be strongly comparable to the computation required in training an advanced AI, a more targeted process which presumably won\u2019t&nbsp;require doing all this <i>other stuff </i>along the way to intelligence.</p><p>Perhaps it is possible&nbsp;to refine Cotra\u2019s model to account for the differences between human intelligence and machine intelligence that we are already aware of. But looking to the future, how much will this help us? As the trajectory of AI development continues, we might see even more divergence from familiar biological features and patterns. What we are developing here \u2013 and the path to developing it \u2013 might look fundamentally different to what we\u2019ve seen before, in ways that are difficult to imagine right now.</p><p>It might be argued that Cotra\u2019s&nbsp;efforts to account for \u2018algorithmic progress\u2019 help to address the above concerns. The idea here is that any disanologies between AI and biological intelligence might possibly be represented, within her model, as differences in computational efficiency. By adjusting TAI compute requirements over time based on projected algorithmic improvements, she effectively acknowledges that AIs are going to start consuming compute in more efficient ways than we have previously seen. Her model could be adjusted such that the pace of algorithmic progress is more dramatic than originally assumed; this would reflect a scenario in which AIs rapidly outstrip human levels of efficiency.</p><p>In Yudkowsky\u2019s critique of Cotra\u2019s model, he envisions a hypothetical OpenPhil opponent levelling a counterargument along these lines against him. Yudkowsky makes clear that he is unmoved by this response. The imaginary debate with OpenPhil here seemingly hinges upon <i>the sense in which</i>&nbsp;we can expect TAI development to be disanalogous to both human biology and to historical patterns of AI development. If it\u2019s a straightforward case of AIs&nbsp;consuming compute in the same <i>way</i>, but much more efficiently \u2013 a quantitative change, but not a qualitative one \u2013 we may be able to capture this in our models by simply adjusting our projections of algorithmic progress. But Yudkowsky warns of a situation where AIs do not simply become algorithmically <i>faster</i>, but behave altogether algorithmically <i>differently</i>, consuming compute in a<i>&nbsp;</i>qualitatively&nbsp;different way to what we have expected.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref20\">It is not immediately clear what this would look like. I think Yudkowksy may be considering a <i>discontinuous</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"20\" data-footnote-id=\"o5hm8etfwjm\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo5hm8etfwjm\"><sup><a href=\"#fno5hm8etfwjm\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;path of AI development. That is: Cotra\u2019s projection of algorithmic progress assumes continuous improvements in efficiency (or rather, it assumes that any discontinuous jumps are minor enough to be reasonably approximated by a smooth curve). If our criticism of Cotra\u2019s model is that we should expect the same continuous pattern of improvement but <i>much faster</i>, it can be addressed by plugging in a higher rate of algorithmic progress.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"Figure_4__Continuous_vs_discontinuous_trajectories_of_algorithmic_improvement\">Figure 4. Continuous vs discontinuous trajectories of algorithmic improvement</h3><p data-internal-id=\"Figure_4__Continuous_vs_discontinuous_trajectories_of_algorithmic_improvement\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hzhGL7tb56hG5pRXY/ato7tsdz4jcdmrdqgifi\"></p><p>But Yudkowsky\u2019s resistance seems to be more fundamental, questioning whether progress will even <i>follow the same pattern</i>&nbsp;in future: specifically, we don\u2019t know whether computational efficiency improvements will take an (approximately) continuous path. At some unknown point, there might be a paradigm shift precipitating a drastic, sudden spike in efficiency that we cannot&nbsp;usefully approximate&nbsp;with a smooth algorithmic progress curve. This would mean we couldn\u2019t accurately model the future of AI development merely by adjusting the <i>rate </i>of algorithmic improvement.</p><p>Thus interpreted, Yudkowsky\u2019s objection raises questions for efforts to quantitatively model AI development in general. Sudden qualitative differences in algorithms would likely drive the trajectory of AI development even further apart from any human analogues, casting more doubt on the legitimacy of grounding AI forecasts in biological estimates.&nbsp;But the objection seems to extend beyond the issue of differences between AIs and humans, and may be seen as a limitation of <i>any</i>&nbsp;model for AI development: we don\u2019t know whether progress will be smooth, and if there <i>are</i>&nbsp;discontinuous jumps, we don\u2019t know when to expect them.</p><p>Putting broader issues like this aside, where do our reflections on Cotra\u2019s model leave us?&nbsp;Overall, the objections above suggest that analogies between machine intelligence and biological intelligence might not be the best basis for forecasting the arrival of TAI. However, there are other bases we could build on. We now turn to consider an alternative model which retains the scaling hypothesis as its foundation, but moves away from potentially flawed analogies to biology.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Approach_2__The__Direct_Approach_\">Approach 2:&nbsp;The \u2018Direct Approach\u2019</h2><p><i>For more on this subsection, see </i><a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/the-direct-approach\"><i>this summary post on Epoch's website</i></a><i>, </i><a href=\"https://epochai.org/files/direct-approach.pdf\"><i>this report on the Direct Approach</i></a><i>,&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/direct-approach-interactive-model\"><i>the interactive model</i></a><i>, and this </i><a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10klKXI_YnoZK5ajXi7BZk6aMJZ5fdZmt?usp=sharing#scrollTo=ktvSNwzmCJoi\"><i>Python notebook</i></a><i>.</i></p><p><i>My colleague Elliot Mckernon and I will be shortly publishing a post which breaks down Epoch\u2019s Direct Approach in more detail.</i></p><h3 data-internal-id=\"The_approach\">The approach</h3><p>There are other approaches to forecasting the arrival of TAI which are still based on the scaling hypothesis, but reject the idea that achieving some inner, biological sense of human-brain-like-ness is <i>what counts</i>&nbsp;for AI to develop transformative&nbsp;capabilities. Instead, to estimate (E1), we can look directly towards the outer behaviour of systems. Specifically, we can use empirical scaling laws (capturing an observed relationship between training computation and system performance) to directly estimate the amount of training computation at which a system could produce outputs of a certain level.</p><p>This conceptual shift towards outer performance metrics&nbsp;is fundamental to Epoch\u2019s \u2018Direct Approach\u2019 model. Like Cotra, Epoch&nbsp;is explicitly concerned with forecasting the arrival of transformative AI.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref21\">Epoch\u2019s&nbsp;basic idea&nbsp;is that, if a machine can <i>perfectly emulate</i>&nbsp;human performance on some task, it could substitute a human on that task with no loss of performance. So, if an AI system was able to perfectly emulate all scientific tasks, it could (if widely adopted) completely replace human scientific researchers, bringing about a revolution of scientific research. An AI system of this level of capability would therefore constitute TAI.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"21\" data-footnote-id=\"elrxooncppd\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefelrxooncppd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnelrxooncppd\">[21]</a></sup></span></p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref22\">Epoch has summarised this basic insight using the slogan \u201cindistinguishability implies competence\u201d.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"22\" data-footnote-id=\"pkffwub5jda\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpkffwub5jda\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpkffwub5jda\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Estimating (E1), then, lies in identifying the level of training computation at which AI performance will be <i>indistinguishable</i>&nbsp;from human performance on scientific tasks.</p><h3><strong>How it works</strong></h3><p>With this idea in mind, Epoch proceeds to estimate the amount of training computation required for \u2018indistinguishability\u2019 between AI and human performance on scientific tasks.</p><p>The key question here is: how do we decide when an AI\u2019s performance at a task is \u2018indistinguishable\u2019 from a human\u2019s performance at the same task?</p><p>To illustrate how Epoch approaches this, let\u2019s begin with a simple example.</p><p>Suppose you are a judge playing a game to distinguish between the performance of two participants: a human and a machine. The machine is trying to convince you that it can make marbles as well as the human can. You are given a bag of marbles from each marble-producer, but not told which bag is which.</p><p>Suppose you happen to be holding the bag of marbles produced by the machine. How many marbles would you need to examine from this bag to determine, with at least 90% confidence, which bag you are holding? This quantity is labelled the \u2018k-performance\u2019 of the machine.</p><p>If the machine\u2019s k-performance is above some <i>locally-relevant threshold</i>, then its performance at the task of making marbles is considered to be effectively indistinguishable from that of the human. The relevant threshold for k-performance is dependent on the task under evaluation; we won\u2019t discuss here what that threshold might be in the specific case of marble production, since we are not especially interested in AI marble production capability.</p><p>To bring this to bear on the automation of scientific research, the authors of the Epoch report consider a variant of the above distinguishing-game applied to <i>scientific task performance</i>&nbsp;instead of marble production. In particular, they focus their attention on determining when LLM performance at <i>writing scientific papers</i>&nbsp;is indistinguishable from that of a human scientist.</p><p>To this end, we can consider the game described above, but with human and LLM participants both generating scientific text. The bag of marbles in the above story is replaced by a sequence of letter-tokens produced by each participant. (Or: we might imagine that each marble is now produced with a letter-token stamped on it, and the judge is examining the sequence of words spelled out by the marbles she has drawn.)</p><p>In this context, what <i>locally-relevant threshold</i>&nbsp;for k-performance would the LLM have to surpass for its scientific papers to be considered \u2018indistinguishable\u2019 from those produced by a human? The Epoch authors assume that performance over long strings of text is what\u2019s important here. They therefore estimate a threshold for k-performance according to the length of an average scientific paper. Above this threshold, they argue that we can reasonably claim that scientific paper-writing can be \u2018indistinguishably automated\u2019 by the LLM.</p><p>How do we get from this \u2018indistinguishability\u2019 framework to an estimate for (E1)?</p><p>This is where scaling laws come in. Epoch appeals to an empirical scaling law from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.15556\">Hoffman et al.</a>&nbsp;here to estimate a linear relationship between training computation and k-performance. (The idea: with more compute, we get LLMs with higher k-performance.)</p><p>Specifically, Hoffman et al.\u2019s law relates the computational power used to train an LLM to the number of letter-tokens it takes for a (flawed) human judge to distinguish between the human and the LLM at the scientific text game. However, what we are interested in for our purposes is a machine\u2019s k-performance with respect to<i>&nbsp;an ideal judge. </i>The Epoch authors must therefore adjust k-performance to account for the discrepancy between human abilities to discriminate between the outputs of the scientific text game vs that of an ideal observer. This is done using an estimated \u2018human slowdown factor\u2019. The worse a human judge is, the greater the \u2018slowdown\u2019 compared to an ideal judge, and the easier it is for the machine to get a high k-performance (i.e. to fool the judge over long sequences of text-generation).&nbsp;An LLM\u2019s k-performance with respect to an ideal judge is thus lower than its k-performance with respect to a human judge.</p><p>The authors can then refer to the Hoffman et al. scaling law to convert these adjusted k-performance values into corresponding training computation requirements. In particular, they can determine a computational requirement corresponding to their estimated \u2018indistinguishability\u2019&nbsp;threshold.</p><p>The resulting value is thought to <i>bound</i>&nbsp;the amount of training computation required to indistinguishably automate scientific tasks, without loss of performance.</p><p>A few notes on this:</p><ol><li>This model is focused specifically on the task of writing scientific papers. It does not purport to estimate training computation requirements for the automation of <i>all</i>&nbsp;scientific tasks. This is because we lack suitable data on scaling properties for other relevant tasks in the scientific field. However, since the authors view writing scientific papers as one of the \u201chardest bottlenecks\u201d for scientific automation, the resulting estimates are still suitable for the purposes of forecasting the arrival of AI which would precipitate a scientific revolution.</li><li>The threshold for training computation resulting from this approach is considered to be <i>an upper bound</i>&nbsp;for automating such tasks, as the authors acknowledge that there could be more efficient ways of performing scientific tasks than simply emulating what humans currently do.</li><li>Crucially, we don\u2019t actually end up with a single upper bound, but a <i>probability distribution of upper bounds</i>. This reflects uncertainty over the two estimated parameter values \u2013&nbsp;namely, the k-performance threshold for \u2018indistinguishability\u2019 and the human slowdown factor. The authors assign percentile confidence levels to both estimates, thus generating probabilistic results rather than a single value.</li></ol><p>The result is a probability distribution which bounds training computation requirements for AIs capable of scientific automation&nbsp;(and therefore sufficient for TAI). &nbsp;It looks like this:</p><p><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hzhGL7tb56hG5pRXY/l7blm64qujtwrnuq4w6m\"></p><p>From this point onwards, Epoch\u2019s approach is fairly similar to that taken in Ajeya Cotra\u2019s biological anchors report. Specifically:</p><ul><li>To generate a complete picture of (E1), we project (a probability distribution of) training compute requirements for TAI after adjustments for algorithmic progress over time.</li><li>To then answer (E2), we compare these projections to a model of how much computational power (in FLOP) developers will have access to over time, which is based on projections into the future of compute-investment ($) and hardware cost-efficiency (FLOP/$).</li></ul><h3 data-internal-id=\"The_result1\">The result</h3><p>This method arrives at a 10% chance of transformative AI being developed by 2025, and a 50% chance of it being developed by 2033.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"Objections1\">Objections</h3><p>Some possible objections to this approach concern the specific scaling law used. In particular, it is noted that Epoch has utilised a scaling law based on a report studying an LLM that was trained on general internet data. We might question whether this relationship will genuinely carry over to the context of writing <i>scientific</i>&nbsp;papers.</p><p>Epoch has <a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/the-direct-approach#:~:text=Question%3A%20Why%20do,available%20in%20the%20future.\">a response</a>&nbsp;to this: the authors note that \u201cscaling laws have\u2026 been found to be ubiquitous across data distributions and modalities\u201d, and argue that there is little reason to believe that learning scientific writing would be substantially harder than learning to produce non-scientific internet text. Nonetheless, they admit that this is a limitation of the current model, and accept that there would be value in updating the model in accordance with better, more clearly applicable scaling data once it becomes available.</p><p>More general objections can be levelled at the use of&nbsp;existing scaling laws in this context.</p><p>Firstly, we might ask: will the empirical relationship that has been found so far hold over many orders of magnitude of compute? The authors of the Epoch report do not seem to be worried about this particular question. They note that the Hoffman et al. scaling law may disagree on details with other scaling laws e.g. observed by <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361\">Kaplan et al.</a>, but ultimately share the same assumption that performance scales predictably with compute. This predictable pattern of scaling (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law\">power law scaling</a>) has already<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05924\">&nbsp;held over about 24 orders of magnitude</a>, and the authors see no reason why it would not continue to do so.</p><p>But here\u2019s a similar worry that seems somewhat harder to counter by simply reflecting on past trends. Will the empirical relationship that has been found to hold in the past continue to hold beyond certain <i>levels of capability</i>, to human-level intelligence and beyond?</p><p>It is possible that after a certain point of capability, the&nbsp;quantity or quality of available data will become a bottleneck. We might therefore expect scaling to slow down beyond that threshold. If so, the question is: by how much? Will it effectively plateau, necessitating a paradigm shift before TAI can be achieved? If we strongly endorse the scaling hypothesis&nbsp;(in its compute-centric form), our answer to this will probably be no \u2013 we\u2019ll double down here, continuing to insist that computation is the primary driver of capabilities development. We could argue that increased computation would sufficiently empower AIs to <i>get around</i>&nbsp;the issue of data, perhaps through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-play\">self-play</a>&nbsp;or by <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/robtoews/2022/06/12/synthetic-data-is-about-to-transform-artificial-intelligence/\">generating synthetic datasets</a>&nbsp;to support continued progress in capabilities.&nbsp;In that case, we might concede only that previously observed scaling laws will be replaced by a somewhat slower relationship, owing to the need to overcome new data-related challenges (which models such as the one from the Hoffman et al. report have not had to contend with); but ultimately, compute-based scaling will still take us to TAI with the current paradigm. This concession would likely only amount to small changes to Epoch\u2019s forecast model.</p><p>Another worry in a similar vein to the above: will existing empirical scaling laws extrapolate well to the performance of <i>much larger models</i>&nbsp;(in terms of number of parameters)?</p><p>The answer to this appears to be that we shouldn\u2019t have high confidence in this extrapolating well to such models. In fact, Epoch notes that current scaling laws have false implications for existing large language models \u2013 namely, that it would only take a few&nbsp;tokens for an ideal observer&nbsp;to reliably distinguish between current LLMs and humans. The Epoch authors themselves admit that this suggests \u201cwhen we extrapolate performance to much larger models, the error in our estimate will tend to be quite high\u201d and that there should be low confidence in any <i>bottom line</i>&nbsp;results here as a result of this. Nonetheless, they are hopeful that the work done in building this model can 1) still be valuable in informing predictions on the arrival of TAI and&nbsp;2) be refined as better scaling data becomes available.</p><p>Other possible objections to the Epoch approach concern the uncertainty associated with estimating k-performance across scientific tasks. These objections are out of the scope of this article, but I would encourage referring to section 2.6 and 2.7 of the <a href=\"https://epochai.org/files/direct-approach.pdf\">full Epoch report</a>&nbsp;for further detail.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"IV__Where_does_all_of_this_point_\">IV. Where does all of this point?</h1><p>We have charted out a complicated picture of AI timeline predictions. The terrain of views on this subject is variable, rough, and uncertain. Attempts to forecast the arrival of TAI have not only been limited by a lack of existing information (i.e. a lack of relevant scaling data as well as an incomplete understanding of biological phenomena), they have also encountered difficulties at a conceptual level.</p><p>Still, there are some apparent&nbsp;areas of convergence amongst the views thus mapped out. In particular:</p><h3><strong>Ballpark similarity of predictions</strong></h3><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref23\">With only a small number of exceptions, recent&nbsp;median predictions<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"23\" data-footnote-id=\"ndm8pgvownk\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefndm8pgvownk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnndm8pgvownk\">[23]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;for the arrival of TAI or similar have <i>typically</i>&nbsp;fallen within a few decades of each other. For example, Cotra\u2019s biological anchors approach and Epoch\u2019s \u2018Direct Approach\u2019 result in median predictions which are around 20 years apart. As we have seen, even making substantial adjustments to the assumptions underlying Cotra\u2019s model does not induce much variation with respect to median predictions.</p><p>In some senses, a few decades is a significant gap. A world in which we have 30 or 40 years to prepare for the arrival of TAI is very different, from a strategic perspective, to one where we have only 10. However, given the <i>possible space</i>&nbsp;of AI timelines \u2013 which could be hundreds of years, according to some experts (e.g. Robin Hanson) \u2013 this still feels like a notable result.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref24\">Moreover, it is (at least on the surface of things) surprising to see that, even when making assumptions that appear to be fundamentally different \u2013 for example, over how best to establish training compute requirements for TAI \u2013 resulting forecasts are not vastly or irreconcilably different. The large majority of predictions I have covered in this article still <strong>point to TAI arriving between 10 to 40 years from today</strong>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"24\" data-footnote-id=\"c35uy04mbuh\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc35uy04mbuh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc35uy04mbuh\">[24]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Trend towards shorter timeline predictions</strong></h3><p>The surveys, competitions, forecasts, and individual predictions we have covered in this article have largely been taken from the last five years. Over this period, we have seen a pattern emerge of more recent AI predictions trending towards the lower end of timeline distributions. In recent years, and across most relevant groups, people generally appear to have been updating their beliefs in the direction of shorter timelines. Good examples of this include the AI Impacts survey results, the Metaculus community AGI prediction trendline, as well as notable personal updates from Ajeya Cotra, Yoshua Bengio, and Geoff Hinton.</p><p>This apparent pattern&nbsp;has become especially visible since 2022 \u2013 which is unsurprising, as many who have publicly updated their views have appealed to very recent aspects of AI development, such as the arrival of ChatGPT, and the strengthening body of evidence&nbsp;behind the scaling hypothesis provided by the latest GPT progress.</p><h3><strong>Some very important caveats</strong></h3><p>We should not get carried away with these conclusions. A few things seem very unclear here:</p><ul><li>How should we view the recent, sharp dip in median timeline estimates in comparison to the longer-term historical picture of AI predictions? Are timelines <i>legitimately</i>&nbsp;getting shorter, or is what we are seeing just noise in a very lumpy curve?</li><li>Will the apparent trend towards shorter timelines persist, or will such views soon fall out of favour?</li><li>In any case, are forecasts actually good evidence for our beliefs about AI timelines?</li><li>Should a rough consensus on timelines reinforce those beliefs, or point to general flaws in forecasting practices?</li></ul><p>Questions of this kind bring us neatly onto our next section.<br>&nbsp;</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"V__How_seriously_should_we_take_these_results__\">V. How seriously should we take these results?</h1><p>There are several reasons we might be sceptical of conclusions drawn from the predictions and forecast models detailed in this article. Some of these point to general issues with forecasting in the context of AI x-risk; others concern the attempt to extrapolate trends from what is ultimately a very lumpy terrain; others still are specific reasons to resist the idea that TAI will likely be achieved within the next few decades.</p><p>I outline some possible reasons for scepticism below.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A note on the significance of the below arguments. </strong>I don\u2019t take any of the arguments below to defeat, or even very seriously undermine, the observations I made in <a href=\"#IV__Where_does_all_of_this_point_\">Section IV</a>. However, it\u2019s important to ensure that we have considered different angles for interpreting this body of timeline predictions before drawing conclusions. The confidence levels we have in our conclusions, and the extent to which those conclusions are relied upon in making strategic decisions, should be adjusted accordingly.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"General_limitations_of_forecasting_AI_timelines\">General limitations of forecasting AI timelines</h2><p><i>This subsection highlights limitations of forecasting with respect to AI timeline predictions. Note that Corin Katzke\u2019s post on&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tCq2fi6vhSsCDA5Js/scenario-planning-for-ai-x-risk\"><i>'Scenario planning for AI x-risk'</i></a><i>&nbsp;touched upon some of these ideas when discussing the&nbsp;limitations of forecasting in the wider space of AI x-risk questions.</i></p><h3><strong>Platt\u2019s Law</strong></h3><p>Throughout this article, we have noted some similarities amongst the AI timeline predictions we have seen from different sources. On the surface, the (loose) consensus over TAI being achieved (with at least 50% confidence) in the next few decades might be believed to add credibility to the belief that TAI will, indeed, be achieved in the next few decades.</p><p>However, some objectors have taken this to point to a fundamental weakness of AI forecasting activities. Most notably, in his critique of Ajeya Cotra\u2019s biological anchors model, Yudkowsky has appealed to what is sometimes dubbed \u2018<a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/library/cyber/surf/1120surf-vinge.html\">Platt\u2019s Law</a>\u2019 \u2013 the observation that, over the last few decades, people have consistently been claiming that the arrival of advanced AI is roughly around 30 years away (and have consistently been in error).</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref25\">Cotra\u2019s biological anchors report follows this trend: it results in a median prediction of TAI in about 30 years from the date the work was conducted. Several of the other surveys and predictions outlined in this article have come to similar conclusions. Indeed, over&nbsp;a third&nbsp;of the specific<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"25\" data-footnote-id=\"fipu7svshzi\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffipu7svshzi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfipu7svshzi\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;median predictions I have covered fall in the range of 20-40 years from the time of elicitation.</p><p><i>On its own</i>, this result isn\u2019t particularly surprising or worrying, as most of the predictions covered in this article were made within a few years of each other \u2013&nbsp;but if we compare this against the decades-long historical pattern of incorrect predictions in this range, we might have some cause for scepticism. Perhaps this points to some common fallacy in reasoning that keeps making people interpret new evidence as gesturing towards TAI being around 20-40 years away, no matter where they are actually&nbsp;situated in the development curve.</p><p>Yudkwosky takes this as evidence that \u201ctiming this stuff is just plain hard\u201d, and argues that we shouldn\u2019t place too much faith in predictions of this kind, even if the arguments or models supporting such predictions appear to be sound. (We should note, for context, that Yudkowsky\u2019s personal beliefs&nbsp;imply <i>shorter</i>&nbsp;timelines&nbsp;than those fitting the Platt\u2019s Law trend.)</p><h3><strong>Information cascades&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Another related worry also stems from the similarities in timeline predictions found across a variety of sources: could these similarities be (partly or entirely) due to the opinions of different groups of people influencing each other? For example, perhaps the Public First UK survey results were influenced by existing Metaculus community predictions, or the Sentience Institute US survey respondents were drawing from the predictions of individuals from prominent&nbsp;AI labs and technology companies.</p><p>There\u2019s a concept in behavioural economics that captures this phenomenon, known as <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/052715/guide-understanding-information-cascades.asp\">information cascade</a>.</p><p>What should we take from this? Perhaps each new addition to the body of views which support <i>P </i>claim&nbsp;about TAI timelines should not be seen as a new or distinct piece of evidence that <i>P</i>&nbsp;is true, or used to update our beliefs more strongly in favour of <i>P</i>. Instead, maybe these additions should sometimes be seen as repetitions of other views in the space. That is, at least some predictions are made (either consciously or subconsciously) along the lines of: \u201cOther people think <i>P</i>&nbsp;about the timeline to TAI, so I guess I roughly think that too\u201d.</p><p>Of course, it\u2019s extremely difficult&nbsp;to identify which results should be taken in this way, and which should be treated as independent, new<i>&nbsp;</i>evidence supporting a particular view.</p><h3><strong>Framing effects</strong></h3><p>As noted in Section I, survey responses about AI risk sometimes exhibit strong \u2018framing effects\u2019 i.e. their results are very sensitive to minor variations in the way a question is phrased.&nbsp;Recall, for example, the significant discrepancy (over 60 years) in responses to AI Impacts survey questions for \u2018high-level machine intelligence\u2019 vs \u2018full automation of labour\u2019, despite the similarity in their stipulated definitions.&nbsp;Results of this kind indicate low reliability of survey responses, giving us reason for pause when trying to draw conclusions from such sources.</p><h3><strong>Near-far distinctions</strong></h3><p>Robin Hanson, a prominent sceptic of short AI timelines who has questioned the credibility of many existing predictions, has written extensively on \u2018construal-level theory\u2019. <a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/near-far-summaryhtml\">This theory</a>&nbsp;seeks to describe an apparent phenomenon of social psychology in which people reason about the near-term and far-term future very differently. Hanson <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-robin-hanson/\">argues that</a>, when people make predictions of a certain level of AI capability emerging in several decades\u2019 time, they\u2019re typically in the \u2018far mode\u2019 of thinking:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cin the far mode where you\u2019re thinking abstractly and broadly, we tend to be more confident in simple, abstract theories that have simple predictions and you tend to neglect messy details. When you\u2019re in the near mode and focus on a particular thing, you see all the messy difficulties.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>As such, he argues that we should be sceptical about the quality of far mode predictions such as \u201cTAI will arrive within 40 years\u201d.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Difficulties_with_identifying_trends_\">Difficulties with identifying trends</h2><p>In the interests of epistemic honesty, I now ask: are people\u2019s AI timelines really shortening in a <i>significant</i>&nbsp;way, overall?</p><p>When I began reading on this subject and saw several recent examples of individuals updating their beliefs in the direction of shorter timelines, paired with the shifting results from aggregate forecasts, I had hoped I could find a nice, clean way to point towards a wider trend here. But the reality of the situation has been disappointing on that front; what presents itself is a messy picture which is difficult to interpret.</p><p>At this point, what seems clear is that within the past few years, the tide has been moving in a particular direction. It is at least true that, across many groups, predictions of the timeline to TAI are generally shorter today than they were a couple of years ago. Moreover, I have not found any notable examples of experts&nbsp;substantially&nbsp;updating their beliefs about timelines in the<i>&nbsp;other direction</i>&nbsp;over this time period.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref26\">But if we zoom out, away from the past few years, it is not obvious that there is any longer term&nbsp;trend&nbsp;of shortening AI timelines. Results <a href=\"#Aggregate_views\">we have already seen</a>&nbsp;such as the 2014 expert survey by M\u00fcller and Bostrom, with a median timeline prediction for HLMI that is sooner than many others seen in more recent years (for example, from the 2023 AI Impacts survey), suggest that the overall trendline&nbsp;is lumpy.&nbsp;And this lumpiness becomes more visible as we zoom out even further. Consider, for example, notable historic examples such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil\">Ray Kurzweil</a>\u2019s 2005 prediction, set out in his book <i>The Singularity</i>,&nbsp;that AI would surpass human intelligence in 2029.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"26\" data-footnote-id=\"2itzem9ylch\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2itzem9ylch\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2itzem9ylch\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>With this wider context in mind, how should we interpret the shortening of timeline predictions for TAI over the last few years? Does it actually mark a significant underlying change in opinion across the surveyed groups, or is it just noise that barely affects the overall landscape of timeline predictions over the past few decades?</p><p>And, to the extent that there has been an overall&nbsp;shortening of timelines in the last few years, will the current wave of opinion around timelines persist? Or is what we are witnessing merely a blip in the graph that we tend to see periodically, perhaps following any major series of developments in the AI field (possibly in accordance with a pattern of \u2018AI springs\u2019 and \u2018AI winters\u2019, as identified in the following subsection)?</p><p>I don\u2019t have good answers to these questions. Beginning to shed light on them would require a more extensive collection of sources than I have done in this article, extending further back into the past, with a closer analysis of the data points given.&nbsp;</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref27\">However, this elusive <i>overall picture</i>&nbsp;does not provide the only valuable perspective on the data. Taking a closer look source by source, it\u2019s clear that there have at least been meaningful <i>individual</i>&nbsp;shifts in opinion over the past few years, from several experts; generally, these personal updates have been conscious and well-motivated,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"27\" data-footnote-id=\"hbdl7mwrfyl\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhbdl7mwrfyl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhbdl7mwrfyl\">[27]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and perceived by the expert advancing them as a genuine adjustment to their beliefs. The fact that several specific experts have recently updated their opinions in this way is itself a noteworthy observation, even if wider trends are much harder to surmise.</p><p>Before moving on, let\u2019s note that the apparent lumpiness&nbsp;in timeline predictions is not the only feature of the overall landscape that makes it difficult to confidently extract trends.&nbsp;As previously mentioned, other forms of variability in data \u2013 such as the numerous different characterisations of advanced AI, and the fact that elicitations are made over different years and different percentile intervals&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;also make the sources somewhat resistant to comparison. This adds some further complexity to any attempts to draw out generalisations. However, these variations are not likely to lead to orders of magnitude of differences in predictions.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Some_specific_counterarguments_to_short_timelines\">Some specific counterarguments to short timelines</h2><p>Aside from these general issues associated with how we should interpret evidence, it\u2019s also worth noting that not everyone is sold on the idea that timelines to TAI are likely to fall within the next few decades (or sooner).</p><h3><strong>Cycles of spring and winter</strong></h3><p>The history of AI development has seen a repeated pattern of \u2018AI springs\u2019 and \u2018AI winters\u2019. Periods of fast progress and high expectations have eventually plateaued and been supplanted by a period of low confidence and disappointing results.</p><p>We are in an AI spring at the moment.&nbsp;The current zeitgeist has been accompanied by growing beliefs that we are fast approaching the threshold for TAI. In this article, we have seen that median timeline predictions within the next 10-40&nbsp;years are currently prevalent, with an increasing number of people in recent years making predictions weighted towards the lower end of this spectrum, and many assigning significant probabilities&nbsp;to timelines even shorter than this.</p><p>Sceptics of such timelines to TAI sometimes argue that the historical cycle is likely to continue. Perhaps an AI winter may soon befall us, preventing us from reaching TAI within the next few decades. Robin Hanson<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-robin-hanson/#:~:text=I%E2%80%99ve%20observed%20that,in%20the%20past%3F%E2%80%9D\">&nbsp;has gestured towards</a>&nbsp;this sort of outcome, noting that the current \u2018boom\u2019 of AI development does not seem to be in principle different from previous ones, which did not result in TAI.&nbsp;</p><p>Let\u2019s pause to reflect on <i>why</i>&nbsp;our current predictions may be overconfident.&nbsp;In \u2018<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.12871\">Why AI is harder than we think</a>\u2019, Melanie Mitchell argues that there are four key fallacies that beliefs in short timelines rest on. I outline these alleged fallacies briefly below.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Four fallacies of short timeline predictions, according to Melanie Mitchell</strong></h3><ol><li><i>The first step fallacy. </i>When an AI achieves something impressive&nbsp;in a narrow domain, we often assume that this indicates an important step towards general intelligence. Mitchell believes this does not typically hold true. She appeals to a quote from Hubert Dreyfus\u2019 brother&nbsp;here: this type of reasoning is \u201clike claiming that the first monkey that climbed a tree was making progress towards landing on the moon\u201d (p4).</li><li><i>Easy things are easy and hard things are hard. </i>We have erroneously expected that the hardest tasks for machines to achieve will roughly track those which are hardest for humans. This style of thinking makes feats like AlphaGo\u2019s ability at Go appear to be significant steps, indicative of the field being close to human-level intelligence. But there are tasks that are very easy for humans which will likely be quite difficult for machines (e.g. games like Charades). Such tasks will likely be the hardest bottlenecks for AI development, and take longer than we currently expect.</li><li><i>Wishful mnemonics. </i>We\u2019re already using terms associated with human intelligence, such as \u2018learning\u2019 and \u2018understanding\u2019 to describe machines. By doing this, Mitchell argues that we have created a misleading impression of how close machine capabilities are to genuinely emulating human intelligence.</li><li data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref28\"><i>Intelligence is all in the brain. </i>The assumption that human-level intelligence can, in principle, be disembodied has been encoded into most recent predictions of AI timelines which lean towards shorter timelines (as these do not generally imagine the need for TAI systems to have bodies when reasoning about timelines&nbsp;to TAI). Mitchell questions whether this assumption is true. She notes that there is some weight behind the idea of embodied cognition \u2013 the idea that the body is central to consciousness or intelligence \u2013 which might limit the level (or kind) of intelligence a disembodied AI system could achieve. This is not just an objection to the claims that timelines to human-level intelligence will be short; it indicates that there may be a reason to think we won\u2019t get to human-level intelligence <i>at all.</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"28\" data-footnote-id=\"mo7jfotu2o\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmo7jfotu2o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmo7jfotu2o\">[28]</a></sup></span><i>&nbsp;</i></li></ol><p>Mitchell\u2019s&nbsp;arguments seem to present us with some intuitive reasons to be sceptical of prevailing beliefs about AI timelines, and suspect&nbsp;many of the sources covered in this article to be somewhat overconfident in their predictions.</p><h3><strong>Reframing \u2018short timelines\u2019, slightly</strong></h3><p><a href=\"#Judgement_based_predictions\">Earlier</a>, I gave a rough first pass at characterising \u2018short timelines\u2019:</p><blockquote><p><i>I will loosely consider timelines of up to around 15 years from now as \u2018short\u2019 and say that someone \u2018takes short timelines seriously\u2019 if they explicitly or implicitly assign non-negligible&nbsp;probabilities (above, say, 5 or 10%) to the arrival of TAI within that time frame.</i></p></blockquote><p>Having surveyed the current landscape of predictions, I think that prominent sceptics who are resistant to the idea that AI timelines will be \u2018short\u2019 \u2013 people like Melanie Mitchell, Robin Hanson, and Yann LeCun \u2013 aren\u2019t <i>specifically</i>&nbsp;directing their objections at people who assign non-negligible probabilities to timelines of roughly under 15 years, or thereabouts. Instead, it seems that they probably mean to resist the current wave of popular opinion <i>more broadly</i>.</p><p>This \u2018current wave\u2019 may best be reflected by the large swathe of sources I have covered whose median predictions fall within the next four decades. Of course, the sceptics in this debate are <i>especially</i>&nbsp;critical of forecasts which assign significant weights to the lower end of that spectrum. In this sense, my initial stab at a range of \u201815 years and below\u2019 is still roughly relevant.&nbsp;But I think it\u2019s important to note that the people who would be most sensibly characterised as \u2018short timeline sceptics\u2019 in this debate would<i>&nbsp;also</i>&nbsp;resist timelines in the 25-35 year range, for example, on the basis of Platt\u2019s Law.</p><p>When wrapping up below, I use the term \u2018short timelines\u2019 in a broad sense. Very loosely, I\u2019m talking about any TAI timeline predictions falling on (or assigning significant probabilities to) the lower end of the 40 year spectrum of popular opinion. In a follow-up post, Convergence will dedicate more work to characterising \u2018short timelines\u2019 in a sense that is strategically relevant.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"VI__Conclusion\">VI. Conclusion</h1><p>Where does this all leave us?</p><p>I&nbsp;have mapped out a range of predictions on AI timelines from experts, forecasters, and the public \u2013 and I have elucidated some of the assumptions which often underpin such predictions through our examination of two specific forecast models. From this, I have observed some broad agreement over the prospect of TAI arriving within the next 10-40 years, as well as a (very) recent trend towards shortening AI timeline predictions.</p><p>Ultimately, it seems that the AI safety community should not put that much stock in any one <i>particular</i>&nbsp;date or probability distribution for the arrival of TAI, due to the fundamental limitations of forecasting such questions (as detailed in the previous section). Indeed, this is one of Convergence\u2019s <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tCq2fi6vhSsCDA5Js/scenario-planning-for-ai-x-risk#The_Problem_with_Forecasting\">motivations for proposing scenario planning</a>&nbsp;as an area of important research for AI x-risk.</p><p>It is wise to acknowledge these limitations, and thereby treat the results of each of the sources we have surveyed with some caution, avoiding making any important strategic decisions solely on the basis of an individual result. But it is at least clear that there is serious support behind the idea that timelines to TAI could be short. Over the past few years, it also appears that this support has been growing \u2013 though, as I have noted <a href=\"#V__How_seriously_should_we_take_these_results__\">in Section V</a>, it would require some evaluation of the historical data to establish how, exactly, this recent shortening of timeline predictions should be interpreted in the wider context.</p><p>There\u2019s some conceptual weight to the arguments behind short timelines, too. In particular, if the scaling hypothesis holds, TAI could emerge fairly quickly through increased computational power.&nbsp;However, this article has not directly explored arguments for and against the scaling hypothesis \u2013 or other possibly short routes to TAI \u2013 in any real depth. I have also noted (but not evaluated) several potential fallacies of reasoning which, according to Melanie Mitchell and other sceptics, may underlie some stipulations of short AI timelines. This possibly casts some doubt over the credibility of these beliefs.</p><p>Having paid appropriate dues to a host of concerns and caveats, I still believe that we are left with enough support behind the plausibility of short timelines \u2013 based on both the current climate of opinion and the conceptual weight behind the idea \u2013 to warrant further investigation&nbsp;and&nbsp;strategic preparation&nbsp;in this direction. The fact that many experts across different fields have come to the conclusion that short timelines are plausible (or, according to some, to be <i>expected</i>) is reason enough, in my opinion, to take this prospect very seriously.&nbsp;</p><p>But suppose, after all of these reflections, we\u2019re still highly sceptical of short timelines to TAI, or largely uncertain what to think about their plausibility.&nbsp;In that case, it makes sense&nbsp;from a strategic perspective to err slightly on the side of caution. That is: under uncertainty, we should take into account the possibility of scenarios with short timelines in our planning, and err on the side of affording higher importance to such scenarios when evaluating strategies. This is because, if timelines to TAI <i>ar</i>e short, (and we take the prospect of AI x-risk seriously) policy makers and the AI safety community will need to act quickly and decisively to address the associated risks, and substantial resources will need to be diverted towards doing so.</p><p>Despite the present uncertainty over the future and the variety of opinions we have seen, it is hard to deny that the&nbsp;needle of opinion is currently pointing in a particular direction&nbsp;\u2013 and it would be foolish not to take notice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>With this in mind, we intend to conduct a detailed exploration of short timelines to TAI.&nbsp;What, exactly, would a short timeline to TAI look like? What assumptions give rise to particularly short timelines? What would the route to TAI involve, and what would its consequences be? What are the relevant strategic considerations for such scenarios? How should we address them?&nbsp;These questions will be the subject of future posts, and will form a key subtopic of Convergence Analysis\u2019 </i>AI Clarity <i>programme.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h1><p><i>Thank you to Justin Bullock, Elliot Mckernon, David Kristoffersson, Corin Katzke, and Deric Cheng for feedback.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Appendix__Further_reading\">Appendix: Further reading</h1><p>As noted in the Introduction, this article is not intended to be a comprehensive review by any stretch of the imagination.</p><p>Here\u2019s a list&nbsp;of some other sources which I have not covered, but are likely of relevance to the work above.

This is especially common in Western democracies such as Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and the European Union. Perhaps because of pressure for governments to be perceived as more participatory, their use has become more prevalent over time (Kerley and Starr 2000). Additionally, they are often practised by sub jurisdictions within countries, such as states, provinces or cities.</p><p>The exact terminology used to refer to this process varies by region, but we will refer to this as \u201cconsultations\u201d for public consultations for those that are publicly accessible.</p><p>Many public consultations present an opportunity for the animal advocacy movement to influence policy, thereby benefiting the lives of animals. However, due to resource constraints, many impactful public consultations are missed by the movement.</p><p>This approach could involve establishing an organisation of just two or three people to a) build a database of jurisdictions around the world that regularly use public consultations, b) monitor upcoming consultations that could affect the lives of animals, c) write and make submissions to those consultations, and d) coordinate with animal advocates in particular jurisdictions to make similar submissions. This organisation could both prepare submissions itself and assist local organisations who may be unaware of the consultation or may not have the capacity to organise an independent response.</p><p>This is a form of government lobbying, but it is a unique one - the policy windows are open for a short but highly predictable time, it is very cheap and easy to make a submission, and governments are often required by law to consider the views expressed in submissions when developing the final policy. As such, our research on this approach builds on our previous report on the impact of lobbying - there we concluded that lobbying does influence policy at least some of the time (Springlea 2022).</p><p>Many obvious submissions do get attention from animal advocacy organisations. For example, large organisations like the RSPCA often coordinate responses to consultations involving farmed animal regulations, companion animal cruelty laws, wildlife management, and so on.</p><p>However, it is easy to miss opportunities in adjacent policy fields, even when the potential impacts on animals could be large. For example, there is often a profound effect on animals from biosecurity policies, non-welfare farming regulations, invasive species management, fisheries policy, many development/industry activities, and so on. It is particularly easy to miss consultations in smaller jurisdictions (e.g. states and districts), even if these consultations could affect the lives of thousands or millions of animals. Some past examples, which we chose arbitrarily from a quick online search, include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.shapeyourcityhalifax.ca/egg-laying-fowl\">A new by-law permitting hens to be kept in residential backyards \"for personal use and household food supply\" in Halifax, Canada</a></li><li><a href=\"https://engage.gov.bc.ca/govtogetherbc/engagement/food-security-task-force-results/\">The use of agricultural technology in British Columbia, Canada</a></li><li><a href=\"https://yoursay.sa.gov.au/minister-s-recreational-fishing-advisory-council\">The election of citizens to a new Recreational Fishing Advisory Council in South Australia</a></li><li><a href=\"https://engage.vic.gov.au/regulating-victorias-natural-environment\">Timber harvesting regulations in Victoria, Australia</a></li></ul><p>Of course, the animal advocacy movement would not have been able to influence all of these policies - but the movement could have influenced many. Particularly if one considers the multitude of national, state, and local governments that are holding public consultations at any given time, this could represent a major opportunity for the animal advocacy movement to sway many policies, thereby improving the lives of animals.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Theory_of_Change\"><strong>Theory of Change</strong></h2><p data-internal-id=\"Theory_of_Change\">&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:49.51%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dZQy4GMdkS4Y7id8B/q74kutelo7vyxqxpwym8\" alt=\"Theory of change\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dZQy4GMdkS4Y7id8B/kyf3wpeybbi3vpq9xvim 110w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dZQy4GMdkS4Y7id8B/tqq1l3w7acwewlvtxg1f 190w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dZQy4GMdkS4Y7id8B/ju3ttih7nqpcmffqi41j 270w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dZQy4GMdkS4Y7id8B/ygnt6rb4774hlr4wtcso 350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dZQy4GMdkS4Y7id8B/kskzcpfzpmty3wtmmsgr 430w\"></figure><h1 data-internal-id=\"WHAT_ARE_CONSULTATIONS_AND_WHERE_ARE_THEY_HELD_\">&nbsp;</h1><h1 data-internal-id=\"WHAT_ARE_CONSULTATIONS_AND_WHERE_ARE_THEY_HELD_\">WHAT ARE CONSULTATIONS AND WHERE ARE THEY HELD?</h1><p>The use of consultations is most common in wealthier and more democratic countries, such as countries in the OECD. In contrast, authoritarian governments are not bound to hold consultations as they are less accountable to public opinion more generally. Having said this, just as authoritarian governments may still hold elections in order to preserve a facade of democracy, they also sometimes engage in public consultations.</p><p>Consultations can be divided into formal and informal consultations.</p><ul><li>Informal consultations: Refers to \u201call forms of discretionary, ad hoc, and unstandardised contacts between regulators and interest groups\u201d (Delia Rodrigo, n.d.). &nbsp;They could resemble public officials contacting various interest groups that they have contact with or recognize as important for that decision at hand. Informal consultations are practised in virtually every OECD country (Delia Rodrigo, n.d.)&nbsp;and almost any country will do at least some form of limited consultation with stakeholders, even if it is especially informal.</li><li>Formal consultations: Refers to the standardised and regimented consultations. There will be clear rules for submissions as well as a defined notice period. These may be open to the public.</li></ul><p>It can be difficult to take advantage of informal consultations since by definition they are initiated by the government, and there is no open call that others can become aware of and respond to. By their nature, informal consultations will also be more difficult to study, but we suspect that because fewer groups may be reached out to in these cases, responding to informal consultations could be particularly high-impact.</p><p>There may be things that groups can do to be approached more often for informal consultations, such as networking with politicians. For example, Hermansson (Hermansson 2016)&nbsp;finds that in the context of EU lobbying, having an office in Brussels is predictive of success, as others have found having an office in Washington is predictive of success in US lobbying (Berry 2010).</p><p>A form of public consultation that we see more commonly in Europe is consultations regularly posted online to a regular web portal. For example, the European Commission maintains the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say_en\">Have Your Say</a>&nbsp;portal for this purpose.</p><p>The rest of this report will refer more to formal consultations since by their nature they are easier to study and they are open for many groups to respond to, so an analysis of their impact is substantially more valuable. However, we suspect that if you are approached for an informal consultation, it will be very worthwhile to respond to it.</p><p>One important way that groups may be able to have a lot of impact is by responding to consultations that few other groups are responding to. To the extent to which expertise is an important factor in responding to consultations, multiple responses by groups with the same concerns may be less valuable since there will typically be significant overlap in their responses. Additionally, large consultations with a great degree of public interest are harder to &nbsp;influence because various other interest groups are in competition for influence (Todorova 2020b). We would therefore not be surprised if a significant amount of the value generated by global groups working on this would be identifying and responding to more neglected consultations such as these.</p><p>One potential weakness of a centralised global organisation would be a lack of direct presence on the ground in key locations. This can enable networking which can provide an opportunity for organisations to be involved in consultations. Participation in informal consultations is helped by maintaining a local presence, such as an office in Brussels for EU lobbying organisations or an office in Washington for US lobbying organisations (Berry 2010; Hermansson 2016). &nbsp;</p><p>To get around this, an organisation could focus specifically on publicly accessible consultations or it could try to use the connections of local groups on the ground. They could instead be invited to these consultations and this global organisation could provide input to them. This would however require maintaining relationships with groups in many regions of the world, which could introduce some difficulties for a small organisation.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"h.gay2ojm10157\">&nbsp;</h1><h1 data-internal-id=\"LITERATURE_REVIEW\">LITERATURE REVIEW</h1><p>Consultations can be considered to be a specific type of lobbying (expert interview). In a <a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying\">previous report</a>&nbsp;we attempted to examine the impact of lobbying with an eye to finding out how likely it is for lobbying to succeed compared to the counterfactual. Unfortunately, we found that this question is a vexed one, and no such precise numerical estimate can be taken at face value. Nevertheless, we found that there are qualitative reasons to think that lobbying may be impactful, with no one in the literature seriously believing that it has no significant effect.</p><p>Much of the specific literature on public consultations analyses their effects on increasing democratic participation and the feeling of democratic legitimacy. This relates to the literature on lobbying in general, which has not paid careful attention to the actual policy influence of lobbying, perhaps because of difficulty studying the subject (Mahoney 2007). Having said that, literature does exist on the efficacy of consultations in driving policy change.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Do_responses_to_consultations_influence_policy_\"><strong>Do responses to consultations influence policy?</strong></h2><p>The general academic literature shows that making submissions in public consultations often affects policy, but not always. The effect, as in any instance of lobbying, depends on the context. Many relevant academic sources focus on consultations in the EU and its Member States.</p><p>Some governments have written explicit policies regarding how consultation should be carried out \u2013 and importantly for our purposes \u2013 how the feedback should be taken into consideration. The UK government\u2019s code of practice on consultations is one example of this.</p><p>Typically, the guidelines suggest that the government should be very responsive to the feedback. For example, the UK government lists criterion six of the consultation exercise as &nbsp;\u201cresponsiveness of consultation exercises\u201d and writes that \u201cAll responses (both written responses and those fed in through other channels such as discussion forums and public meetings) should be analysed carefully, using the expertise, experiences and views of respondents to develop a more effective and efficient policy\u201d (UK Government 2008).</p><p>However, we should expect some deviation from this in practice. This is particularly the case as these documents are published for public consumption and it would look bad for the government to admit any ways in which they are unresponsive to criticism or feedback.</p><p>Some key sources are:</p><ul><li>Ahteensuu and Siipi (Ahteensuu and Siipi 2009)&nbsp;examine public consultations on the topic of genetically modified organisms in the EU and its Member States, giving a somewhat pessimistic view of policy influence. The authors claim that, ideally, public consultation lets policy solutions be found by rational discussion and deliberation with no voting necessary (in practice, this is not how consultations typically work - discussed further below). The authors point out that in some cases, only specific types of information will be considered and can affect the final decision. For example, in Finland's consultations on scientific field trials, the only information that the government will consider is new information concerning the scientific risk assessment. The authors conclude: \"In these cases, the room left for effective comments is thus highly limited, if not totally absent in practice.\"</li><li>Quittkat and Kotzian (Quittkat and Kotzian 2011)&nbsp;give a systematic study of written consultations in the EU. The authors conclude that online consultations indeed \"capture the plurality of views and stakes in society\", implying that making submissions can influence policy. Of particular interest is their conclusion that participating in an online submission can lead to a longer-term relationship with policymakers: \"Participation in inclusive online consultations, often the starting point of a new policy-making cycle, increases participation in other, more exclusive consultation instruments, where participants are selected by the organisers\".</li><li>Todorova (Todorova 2020b)&nbsp;analyses online submission of interest group comments in EU open consultations, concluding that \u201cHigh degree of influence was only obtained when technical issue was at stake that did not touch or that was in line with core political intentions of the proposed document.\u201d Therefore, technical consultations of limited interest to other interest groups were the ones where the greatest influence could be achieved.</li><li>In a preprint analysing the effect of public consultations in Wales, Kaehne and Taylor (Kaehne and Taylor 2016)&nbsp;find that \u201cindividuals and organisations may struggle to effectively influence legislation.\u201d However, they do not clearly spell out their reasoning and evidence behind this claim.</li><li>Coleman (Coleman 2004)&nbsp;analyses two case studies of the use of the (then relatively novel) internet as a means of facilitating public consultations. They find that the participants had a number of difficulties surrounding knowledge and trust in the internet.&nbsp;Given the age of the study these findings may have little relevance today.</li><li>Chalmers (Chalmers 2020)&nbsp;provides a similar analysis, focusing on the finance industry in the EU. The author&nbsp;concludes that \"the vast majority of lobbying efforts end in failure\". Though we are unsure about how this result will generalise to animal welfare, we highlight this more pessimistic finding here to temper expectations.</li><li>Kerley and Starr (Kerley and Starr 2000)&nbsp;analyse public consultations and Australia. They claim that there have been few rigorous attempts to evaluate whether &nbsp;consultations of processes improve policy outcomes.</li><li>Innes and Booher (Innes and Booher 2004)&nbsp;make perhaps the boldest claim in the literature, arguing that, at least in the US, public consultations are, essentially, not listened to and do not substantially affect policy. They argue that, as practised, public consultations in the US are effectively counterproductive on their own terms: they do not change anything and they only sow mistrust among those attempting to utilise them for change. Worse, they argue that the consultations can pit activists against each other, as they must speak in a polarised way in responding to consultations, rather than through healthy dialogue. They believe that these problems are not fixed at all, but that there are a variety of significant reforms that would have to be implemented in order to allow for productive and effectual dialogue. It is unclear as to what extent the authors believe that this would apply to other countries.</li><li>In an analysis of 8000 policy recommendations from 693 stakeholders, Hermansson (Hermansson 2016), focusing on environmental consultations, asks: \"What determines whether a policy recommendation from stakeholders will be adopted by the European Commission?\" The author concludes that the information provided is indeed often incorporated in final policies. (We discuss further conclusions of this paper in the next section).</li><li>Conrad et al. (Conrad et al. 2011)&nbsp;analyses the case of public consultations in Malta, finding that they often <i>do</i>&nbsp;have an influence on decisions. Specifically, public concerns over land use in Malta seem to have had a significant influence through consultations, mostly \u201clarge-scale developments in sensitive sites\u201d, and public planners expressed cynicism regarding the public\u2019s engagement with consultations. Some of the public planners responded that public participation is largely done because it is a legal requirement, not because of &nbsp;a genuine desire to listen to what the public has to say. They described it as \u201cticking the box and saying, yes, we consulted the public\u201d. Other public planners responded that many of the public suggestions were absurd and uninformed and were often responding to consultation out of an illegitimate motivation such as \u201cjealousy, NIMBYism, personal vendettas\u201d. Others said that the public simply expects politicians to defer to them even though they lack basic technical knowledge and expertise to make that reasonable. Public consultations on planning in Malta may be particularly contentious, because the country is very small and densely populated, the hard choices have to be made with the placement of infrastructure such as power plants. Nevertheless, this paints a less than optimistic picture of the policy influence of consultations, even if they can have significant influence in some cases.</li></ul><h2 data-internal-id=\"Which_factors_are_predictive_of_influence_\"><strong>Which factors are predictive of influence?</strong></h2><p>Some studies have also specifically examined the question of whether the public's submissions influence the final policy.&nbsp;Ultimately the most important factor may be demonstrating expertise (Bernhagen, D\u00fcr, and Marshall 2015; Hermansson 2016).&nbsp;This can be done through demonstrating a command of the relevant literature, especially being aware of and responding to counterarguments against your position.</p><p>For consultations that may be difficult to push for based on pure animal welfare arguments, an approach of raising various concerns, (such as human health and environmental arguments) may be useful. This is particularly true in the case of consultations regarding insects and other invertebrates, when the welfare potential of these animals is not yet commonly considered.</p><p>The relative influence of different interest groups in their consultation lobbying has been relatively less studied. Despite this, the literature suggests that expertise and lobbying as a business (though some analyses suggest that this is mediated through expertise) are important success factors. This is consistent with the general literature success factors for lobbying in general (Bernhagen and Br\u00e4uninger 2005).</p><p>A contrasting role that consultations could be thought to play is allowing the government to identify important considerations that were missing in their analysis and to generally have their proposal critiqued. Governments may have limited capacity to identify all important considerations in advance and some people may have important information that is not widely available and would therefore be missed in any isolated attempt to answer the question. One expert we spoke with noted that the European Commission was particularly influenced by expertise in its submissions.</p><p>When a government is more motivated by this factor, the best way to do well in these consultations is to focus on rigorous submissions that put forward new arguments and considerations while demonstrating engagement with counter arguments. For demonstrating expertise, the raw number of submissions is not intrinsically important. Instead, they only play the role of allowing for more distinct considerations to be presented.</p><p>These submissions should display a command of relevant information, including all relevant political and technical knowledge, with technical knowledge being particularly valuable. They should demonstrate an understanding of all relevant considerations and anticipate potential counterarguments.</p><p>Some authors argue that the impact of other factors that appear to be significant on their own reduce down to expertise. For example, Todorova (Todorova 2020a)&nbsp;finds that businesses exert more influence on policy than do NGOs. They argue that this may be because businesses tend to have higher expertise, including greater understanding of the policy at hand, greater scientific knowledge, and greater technical knowledge.</p><p>Similarly, Yackee and Yackee (Yackee and Yackee 2006)&nbsp;found that businesses tended to exert more control over policy than do NGOs. This was the case because of the number of comments submitted by business interests and because of the greater expertise shown by business commenters. They found that business commenters showed a better understanding of the technical aspects of the consultation question and more often cited data and studies to back up their claims.</p><p>This \u2018finding the most expert argument tends to win\u2019 is in some ways a hopeful one. However, this should be understood in its proper context. There is still a great deal of variation or noise in the success of consultations, so even a response demonstrating a great deal of expertise may fail to influence. Additionally, even with strong moral arguments on their side, animal advocates may struggle to do better than businesses who can pay a premium to ensure expert submissions.</p><p>Fraussen (Fraussen, Albareda, and Braun 2020)&nbsp;describes another factor by which businesses may dominate consultations. This is the known issue in the literature on consultations that businesses tend to be more actively engaged than citizens or other groups such as NGOs in the process of public consultations. They find that businesses have less influence in closed consultations (consultations where the government just ask particular groups for input rather than having an open publicly accessible call for submissions).</p><p>It is unclear why this happens, though it could be because businesses are disproportionately likely to submit to these consultations, such that a selected sample of people who the government reaches out to is more representative because it avoids this bias caused by a disproportionate number of submissions by businesses.</p><p>Hermansson (Hermansson 2016)&nbsp;finds that \u201cwealthy business interests\u201d have a significant advantage in consultations put out by the European Commission. He finds that this holds even in cases where business organisations have little or no expertise, suggesting that there is some bias towards these organisations. He concludes that this influence is mediated through privileged access to the decision-makers. However, he concludes that expertise remains the more significant factor.</p><p>This is in line with Bernhagen (Bernhagen, D\u00fcr, and Marshall 2015)&nbsp;who find that having greater expertise and information is associated with better lobbying outcomes during consultations. They find that being better connected within a targeted institution is also helpful, but only insofar as it provides you with the opportunity to apply that expertise. In other words, this study finds that knowing the right person does not in itself mean you will be able to shape policy as a lobbyist.</p><p>Finally, another factor that several experts recommended as being particularly impactful in responding to consultations is demonstrating that you have the agreements of a variety of stakeholders such as being part of a broad coalition. They noted that demonstrating that you have the support of unexpected stakeholders is something that can make civil servants and politicians stand up and take notice. In the case of animal advocacy, this could include demonstrating that you have the support of farmers or others in the animal agriculture industry (expert interview).</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"CASE_STUDIES\">&nbsp;</h1><h1 data-internal-id=\"CASE_STUDIES\">CASE STUDIES</h1><p>Here, we examine six examples of government consultations that provide a concrete picture of how submissions can influence a final policy. We chose some of these examples due to our familiarity with them, but also to illustrate the vast variation in numbers of responses (~60,000 vs 6), the different approaches that governments use to incorporate the public responses in the final policy.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Revision_of_EU_animal_welfare_legislation\"><strong>Revision of EU animal welfare legislation</strong></h2><p>Between May 20, 2020 and July 29, 2020 the European Commission ran a consultation on its roadmap to revise animal welfare legislation. Following this, they ran a consultation on the final version between October 2021 and January 21, 2022 concerning a revision to many different pieces of EU animal welfare legislation (EC 2022). The goal was to improve animal welfare legislation, aligning it with current scientific evidence and public expectations. 59,281 respondents contributed. This included 537 submissions by businesses and 266 submissions by NGOs. There are also 116 submissions by academics and researchers.</p><p>49% of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that there is more uniform production of farmed animals across the EU compared to 25 years ago. However, 92% of respondents thought that this animal welfare legislation \u201cdoes not ensure adequate or uniform production of all animal species in need\u201d. Other responses on specific welfare reforms are broadly in line with this, with overwhelming support for various proposed reforms, such as phasing out cages, prohibiting tail docking, introducing maximum journey times, banning the export of live animals, banning electric water bath stunning of chickens, and banning chick maceration.</p><p>Following this, the European commission agreed to perhaps the most significant set of welfare reforms ever proposed, including phasing out cages for all farmed animals.</p><p>However, this was not realised. Details are still coming out, but it seems like a concerted lobbying effort by the meat industry may have been responsible for a last minute U-turn by the European Commission (Neslen 2023). All of the reforms, except for an animal in transit reform, have been punted to the next European Commission (and arguably abandoned outright). Large cost-of-living increases, caused in part by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, may have also contributed to a reluctance to risk any more increases (Katanich 2023).</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Animal_transport_in_the_UK\"><strong>Animal transport in the UK</strong></h2><p>The consultation <i>Improvements to animal welfare in transport</i>&nbsp;was opened for public comment by the UK Government in December 2020 (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 2020). 11,395 responses were received during the submission period, which lasted from 3 December to 25 February in the following year. A summary of these responses, and their effect on the final policy proposal, were published in August 2021 (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 2021). We focus here on the details of the public consultation and the government's response to it - the final details of the policy, as implemented in legislation, will still depend on a range of other factors as part of the last stages of the policymaking process.</p><p>Perhaps due to the large number of responses, the government's summary of responses made excessive use of vote-counting, i.e. \"X% of respondents agreed/disagreed with a particular proposal\". This suggests that the government places at least some emphasis on views that receive a large amount of stated support in submissions, independent of what those views actually are.</p><p>The 11,395 responses consisted of individual responses (from private citizens, industry bodies, businesses, animal welfare organisations, etc) as well as campaign responses: 7,445 identical responses that were coordinated by an RSPCA campaign; 184 responses coordinated by Animal Aid; and a single response from Compassion in World Farming that presented a petition with 111,295 signatures. Each of these three campaign responses were summarised in detail in their own box in the summary report.</p><p>The main structure of the summary document is essentially a point-by-point list that gives the percentage of people who agree or disagree with particular proposals.</p><p>We list two of these proposals in the table below: one for the proposed ban on live export, and one for the proposed maximum journey times.</p><p>The government's proposed ban on live export was well-supported, with 87% of respondents agreeing. Most of these respondents were associated with the RSPCA campaign. The government's final policy statement confirmed that this ban will go ahead. In other words, the initial proposal was kept unchanged, and this represents a win for animals. The campaign by the RSPCA appears to have played a large part in this decision.</p><p>The government's proposed new maximum journey times were polarising. Animal advocates argued for shorter maximum journey times, and industry members argued for longer maximum journey times. The government's final policy statement confirmed that new maximum journey times would still be introduced. The specific times were unchanged for all animals, <i>except</i>&nbsp;for: newly hatched broiler chickens, for whom the proposed 21 hours was increased to 24 hours; and newly weaned pigs, for whom the proposed 6 hours was increased to 12 hours. The fact that many of the proposed maximum journey times were kept could be seen as a win for animals, but the fact that some of the proposed times were increased can be seen as a loss for animals.</p><p>Some of the other key policy proposals that formed part of this consultation (e.g. space allowances, temperature limits) showed a similar result to that of the maximum journey times.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Proposed policy</strong></td><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Response</strong></td><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Final policy statement</strong></td><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Our comment</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\"[...] we are proposing to end the live export of livestock and horses going for slaughter and fattening travelling from or through England and Wales.\"</td><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\"87% of respondents agreed that livestock and horse export journeys for slaughter and fattening are unnecessary. 11% disagreed and 2% did not express a definitive opinion.

This is the public consultation on the Draft Recovery Plan for Eastern Osprey and White-bellied Sea Eagle in South Australia (Department of Environment and Water 2022). This consultation is not directly relevant to animal welfare, but it nevertheless provides some insight for our purposes.</p><p>In this consultation, only 26 submissions were made. Therefore, this consultation had a much, much smaller scale compared to the thousands of submissions made to the above UK consultation. Of the 26 submissions, 5 were specifically identified with non-profit organisations (e.g. environmental protection groups or birdwatching clubs).</p><p>It is noteworthy that the submission period lasted from 21 December 2021 to 28 January 2022. This is a period of just a few weeks, opening immediately before Christmas and closing not long after the holiday period. Though we are speculating here, we are aware of instances in South Australia where policymakers deliberately make the more unattractive policy announcements (such as those relating to the population decline of charismatic animal species) on days when people are busy or when media attention is focused elsewhere. Admittedly, the submission window in the above UK consultation was at a similar time of year, though a bit longer.</p><p>The government's summary of responses (Department of Environment and Water 2022)&nbsp;listed every point made by every person who made a submission. The plan was amended where a submission \"provided additional information of direct relevance to management\" or \"suggested an alternative approach that was considered more appropriate than that proposed in the draft plan\". In many cases, the plan was not amended (e.g. where a submission \"addressed issues beyond the scope of the plan\" or \"proposed an alternative approach but the recommendation of the draft plan was still considered the most appropriate option\"). Although these criteria give the government substantial latitude for exercising its own judgement, this demonstrates an openness and willingness to consider new information and alternative approaches to the specifics of a policy.</p><p>A number of amendments were made to the Plan, though most were very minor. We outline three amendments in the table below.</p><p>For two amendments, specific clauses were added to the plan in response to specific concerns raised in submissions. Four submissions raised concerns about the risks of eagles being killed by power lines; the government amended the plan to specify the development of a risk management and mitigation plan for electricity infrastructure. Seven submissions raised concerns about specific risks to eagles, such as driving on beaches and minimum flying heights for aircraft; the government amended the plan to specify the implementation of policies to afford greater protection to eagle-occupied sites.</p><p>The third amendment that we present here was slightly different - one submission requested that a particular clause in the Plan be amended to specifically name tourism as a threat to eagles. The government responded by amending the clause as requested. This suggests that making highly specific changes to clauses might be possible in some cases - in the context of animal welfare, this could be a useful way to tighten up the wording of regulations, specifically name some group of animals (e.g. fish) as being protected under a regulation, and so on.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Comment from submission</strong></td><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Number of submissions that made this comment</strong></td><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Response from government</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\"Recommends risk of electrocution be highlighted and/or urgent work be done with SA Power Networks and other infrastructure providers to provide a safe environment for the birds.\"</td><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">4 submissions</td><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\"Action 2.2.1 added to specify the development of a risk management and mitigation plan for electricity infrastructure for priority sites, along with a specific industry engagement plan for electricity providers.\"</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Recommends legislative change in relation to driving on headlands and beaches, the current lack of minimum flying heights over Wilderness Protection Areas, and several other specific risks</td><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">7 submissions</td><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\"Added additional action 1.1.4 Identify and implement legislative and/or policy or other mechanisms (e.g. formal protection) to afford greater protection to currently occupied sites and extend protection to formerly occupied sites.\"</td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\"Suggests that nature-based tourism and other tourism activities need to be specifically mentioned in Part D (threats) under point 1 (c).\"</td><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">1 submission</td><td style=\"padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">\"Nature-based tourism and other tourism activities explicitly included in Part D, 1: (c)\"</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2 data-internal-id=\"Human_consumption_of_insects_in_Singapore\">&nbsp;</h2><h2 data-internal-id=\"Human_consumption_of_insects_in_Singapore\"><strong>Human consumption of insects in Singapore</strong></h2><p>The government of Singapore held a public consultation from October 5, 2021 to December 4, 2022 to reconsider the Government\u2019s ban on the human consumption of insects. The consultation was opened following a review by the Singapore Food Agency (SFA 2021)&nbsp;which concluded that they should allow the import of insects and insect products for human consumption.</p><p>Following this consultation, 16 species of insects including crickets, silkworms, mealworms and grasshoppers will be allowed for human consumption in Singapore starting in the second half of 2023 (SFA 2022b).</p><p>Though the main driver of the edible insect industry is production to feed to other farmed animals, because of the huge numbers of insects that must be used, the human consumption of insects still remains a large source of suffering. This is because, though the consumption of some insects is practised in China and Malaysia and the predominant ethnicities in Singapore, the practice is still far from common (Tan 2023). Nevertheless, the legalisation of this also opens up a significant risk of the industry making the practice significantly popular through a marketing campaign.</p><p>This consultation includes some restrictions such as that:</p><ul><li>Insects for consumption are not harvested from the wild</li><li>\u201cManure, decomposing organic material and materials of ruminant origin are not used as feeding substrates\u201d</li></ul><p>In cases where it may be hard to argue for a full ban based on pure concern for animal welfare, focusing on health concerns such as these in consultation responses can be especially valuable. Even in more difficult cases such as this, it is plausible that with greater participation in the consultation there could have been additional restrictions that could have limited the industry and improved insect welfare, as well as human health and environmental outcomes. For example, the consumption of insects can trigger allergic reactions in people who are allergic to crustaceans and there could be more regulations surrounding this.</p><p>53 responses in total were received to this consultation. Some of the responses were just generally in favour, with some suggesting adding new species to the proposed list allowable for human consumption or questioning restrictions on life stages allowable for consumption. Other comments asked for clarification on different points. Finally some comments presented different concerns with human consumption ranging from simple disgust or finding it to be unnatural, to a variety of specific concerns including:</p><ul><li>Disease risk if wild insects are allowed for consumption</li><li>Food safety concerns and disease risk based on substrates used to feed the insects</li><li>Concern over human health effects from the consumption of chitin</li><li>Labelling requirements for products to less that they contain insects with</li></ul><p>(SFA 2022a)</p><p>In addition to this consultation, a<a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/danger-say-no-to-eating-insects\">&nbsp;petition</a>&nbsp;against lifting the ban received 1275 signatures. The petition mentions various human health concerns, but no animal welfare arguments.</p><p>We think that submissions to this consultation would have been particularly impactful. This is because of the great number of animals involved, the potential to halt the industry before it gets going, and the potential to set a precedent for other countries. This is a case where one group working on consultations globally might have been particularly helpful. As a small country in a generally neglected region, there is little animal advocacy done in Singapore &nbsp;from an impact focused perspective.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Maximum_nutrient_values_and_fish_feeds_in_Canada\"><strong>Maximum nutrient values and fish feeds in Canada</strong></h2><p>This was a consultation held by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency between February 23, 2018 to March 30, 2018 (Government of Canada, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and Animal Health Directorate 2019). Only six sets of written comments were received for this consultation. Of these, three were from individuals in the feed industry, two were from associations in the feed industry and one was from an academic institution.</p><p>This could be an opportunity to:</p><ul><li>Push the idea of greater plants and algae-based feeds for fish and push for favourable regulations for this</li><li>Push for consideration for more nutritious foods for fish (to increase their welfare)</li><li>Try to get the industry regulated more on its negative externalities</li></ul><p>In particular, pushing for lower fish meal and fish oil content and higher plant and algae content would have been particularly valuable, introducing the suffering of the many animals &nbsp;killed in fish meal production. There are significant environmental, as well as animal welfare arguments for this, and the former in particular could have motivated some improvement in the final policy.</p><p>The fact that only six responses were received to this consultation, and that none of them seem to be considering animal welfare, suggests that various points may have been missed.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Consultation_on_Animal_welfare_labelling_in_the_UK\"><strong>Consultation on Animal welfare labelling in the UK</strong></h2><p>DEFRA ran a consultation on the labelling of products in the UK according to animal welfare standards between September 13, 2021 and 6 December 2021 (DEFRA 2022). The proposal was for mandatory labelling of animal products in the UK according to welfare standards used in production.</p><p>There were 1,633 responses, 93% from individuals and 7% from organisations. Of this, a total of 14 charities responded. The public and civil society organisations favoured mandatory labelling while the industry favoured only an industry led labelling approach, with approximately one half opposing any reform. There was broad general support for mandatory labelling of imported products. Both the animal welfare benefits as well as the consumer information and freedom arguments were widely mentioned.</p><p>Ultimately, a plan for a further consultation on the subject, and ultimately the whole proposal, was dropped due to heavy criticism from a coalition of industry organisations. They argued that it would be significantly more costly but would not effectively educate consumers on the issues. Specifically they argued that it was possible to achieve high welfare in different production systems, some painting them with the broad brush associated with the production system which unfairly disadvantages them of these forms (Driver 2023).</p><p>This response is surprising given the overwhelming agreement with the proposal. What disagreement did exist came disproportionately from those in industry and largely took issue with specific aspects of the proposal, rather than the proposal as a whole. Nevertheless, along with several other proposed animal welfare amendments and reforms, all labelling requirements were dropped.</p><p>We think that marginal responses to this consultation would likely have lower value as compared to consultations to which fewer organisations responded. Additionally, &nbsp;the negative result seen here in the face of very high support for the reform, is an update away from the power of consultations.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"CRUCIAL_CONSIDERATIONS__\">&nbsp;</h1><h1 data-internal-id=\"CRUCIAL_CONSIDERATIONS__\">CRUCIAL CONSIDERATIONS &nbsp;</h1><p>There are two important considerations that will determine how impactful it would be to fund a small team of people focused on responding to consultations:</p><ul><li>How many missed opportunities for policy influence are there? We suspect that there are many across the various national, state, and local governments around the world. But the first step of this approach would be to confirm this suspicion. This could involve a review of all consultations in all jurisdictions over the past few years; an analysis of how many submissions those consultations received from <i>other</i>&nbsp;interest groups; and an analysis of how an animal advocacy organisation could have suggested policy alternatives to improve the lives of animals.</li><li>How often does the government incorporate proposals made in submissions? We know that the government incorporates proposals <i>sometimes</i>&nbsp;- that is, greater than 0% of the time, but less than 100% of the time. A quantitative analysis, ideally focusing on animal welfare-related consultations, would help refine this parameter and give a better estimate of how much policy influence we could expect to have. This analysis could be complemented by conducting interviews with government employees.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"CONCLUSION_AND_REMAINING_UNCERTAINTIES_\">CONCLUSION AND REMAINING UNCERTAINTIES</h1><p>Consultations provide one important avenue through which effective lobbying is possible. The public nature of them, as well as the focus on expertise provides an opportunity for a central organisation to work on this globally. A new organisation could provide value by identifying consultations that might otherwise be missed due to being in regions with few animal advocacy organisations, by being niche, or by requiring expertise not possessed by the organisations in that area. Additionally, existing organisations could consider responding to more of these consultations as they come up. The case studies section provides some examples of consultations such as these.</p><p>Best practices in responding to consultations centre around demonstrating expertise, with having the right connections also being important, especially to get your foot in the door. Business interests tend to have an advantage in consultations, though much of that advantage may be mediated through expertise and connections.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"APPENDIX__OTHER_ANALYSES_OF_CONSULTATIONS\">&nbsp;</h1><h1 data-internal-id=\"APPENDIX__OTHER_ANALYSES_OF_CONSULTATIONS\">APPENDIX: OTHER ANALYSES OF CONSULTATIONS</h1><p>A report by the European Court of Auditors (ECA 2019)&nbsp;analysed 26 public consultations &nbsp;that took place in the EU between 2016 and 2018. They carried out a survey of the participants in addition to consulting a panel of experts. Only 5.5% of people who had participated in one of these consultations were satisfied with the process. This was done to assess a number of things including how often the European Commission made use of contributions by citizens and stakeholders. They also concluded that the European Commission needed to be better at outreach to stakeholders to receive the contributions.</p><p>They note that between the years of 2015 and 2018 the European Commission conducted a total of 417 public consultations. The average number there is considerably lower: around 500 participants in each of 2015 and 2016 or 2000 participants in 2017 and 2018 (excluding the top consultation with the most contributors in each year as an outlier). There is a great deal of variation in how many responses consultations receive. One of these consultations &nbsp;with an outlier number of submissions took place in 2018, receiving 4.6 million responses. Though, to put this in perspective, this represents only about 1% of the EU population.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"h.kxx569etcshc\">&nbsp;</h1><h1 data-internal-id=\"BIBLIOGRAPHY________\">BIBLIOGRAPHY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1><p>Ahteensuu, Marko, and Helena Siipi. 2009. \u201cA Critical Assessment of Public Consultations on GMOs in the European Union.\u201d <i>Environmental Values</i>&nbsp;18 (2): 129\u201352.</p><p>Bernhagen, Patrick, and Thomas Br\u00e4uninger. 2005. \u201cStructural Power and Public Policy: A Signaling Model of Business Lobbying in Democratic Capitalism.\u201d <i>Political Studies</i>&nbsp;53 (1): 43\u201364.</p><p>Bernhagen, Patrick, Andreas D\u00fcr, and David Marshall. 2015. \u201cInformation or Context: What Accounts for Positional Proximity between the European Commission and Lobbyists?\u201d <i>Journal of European Public Policy</i>&nbsp;22 (4): 570\u201387.</p><p>Berry, Jeffrey M. 2010. <i>The New Liberalism: The Rising Power of Citizen Groups</i>.

Highly valanced states (both positive and negative) can decrease evolutionary fitness.</li><li>In a state of nature with a stable population, most species experience close to net zero utility.</li><li>Without significant genetic engineering or ecosystem redesign, the best (only?) way to achieve significant positive utility is through \u2018tricking\u2019 evolution by using contraception; which will ultimately result in animals living longer.</li></ol><p>I unpack these arguments below.</p><h1><strong>Pleasure and pain as a function of evolutionary fitness</strong></h1><p>Pleasure and pain are subjective experiences: I may feel pleasure at eating a brussels sprout, while someone else might find it painful. However, one strong theory explaining the origin and purpose of pleasure and pain is that they serve as a motivator for an organism to perform actions that increase evolutionary fitness and avoid those that decrease it. <a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a> Hence, most organisms seem to find activities like eating and mating pleasurable; while being too hot, cold, hungry or sick to be painful.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>The cost of pleasure and pain</strong></h1><p>Pleasure and pain serve a purpose, but they also have a cost. Producing hormonal signals takes biological resources. Probably more importantly, organisms that are experiencing extreme pleasure or extreme pain may well make worse decisions than they otherwise could. Consider the analogy of a rider (evolution) and a horse (individual organism). The rider can hit the horse with a stick (pain) to \u2018push\u2019 the horse forwards or change its direction, and can dangle a carrot (pleasure) in front of the horse to \u2018pull\u2019 it. But use of both the carrot and the stick costs some resources to the rider and distract the horse, so most of the time the rider lets the horse trot along, using pleasure and pain only sparingly. The costs of producing and experiencing pleasure and pain signals means that the default experience of a typical organism is close to zero.</p><p>Astute readers will notice my assumption: that the costs of producing &amp; experiencing pleasure and pain are roughly symmetrical. If, on the other hand, it was much easier and less biologically resource intensive to produce pain rather than pleasure \u2013 then we would expect the \u2018rider\u2019 to use the stick far more than the carrot. The \u2018default\u2019 state for the organism would then be one of mild pain, and the \u2018rider\u2019 would reward it for good decisions that increase evolutionary fitness by stopping the pain. Conversely, if it is easier to produce pleasure than pain, we would expect the organism\u2019s default state to be one of mild pleasure.</p><p>I have no empirical basis for this symmetry assumption. However, the case for contraception as a tool to improve WAW is even stronger if we believe that pain is easier to produce than pleasure; as contraception also reduces the overall population size. From a hedonistic utilitarian perspective, selective contraception would only be futile or harmful if it turned out that pleasure was much easier to produce than pain, and hence animals live on average joyful lives such that it is better to grow the population of animals substantially. This seems to me quite unlikely.</p><h1><strong>Most species experience close to net zero utility</strong></h1><p>Consider an organism\u2019s life as a graph, with the x-axis being their age, and the y-axis being their evolutionary fitness score at that point in time. For a sexually reproducing species with a stable population, each organism produces on average 2 offspring. Hence at birth, our \u2018mean\u2019 organism has an evolutionary fitness of 2. It makes a series of decisions, and experiences different factors which increase or decrease its fitness. The derivative of this graph is roughly the organism\u2019s current state of experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Organisms who produce more than 2 offspring are likely to have experienced a positive net utility in life: they have lived longer, eaten and mated more. Organisms who die before producing offspring are likely to have experienced a negative net utility. This means that the whole species has a net utility close to zero.&nbsp;</p><p>If this model is roughly accurate, it is an update in the positive direction: many EAs concerned about WAW assume that the natural world has a significant negative net utility. This is understandable when we consider that, for many species, the majority of individuals <a href=\"https://wildanimalsuffering.org/\">die a young and painful death</a>, before having reproduced. The <i>modal&nbsp;</i>and the <i>median</i> organism may well have a negative net utility, but the <i>mean</i> organism is close to zero because of a minority who do live long and successful lives.<a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]</a>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Contraception: tilting the scales towards pleasure</strong></h1><p>One of the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22325435/animal-welfare-wild-animals-movement\">main arguments</a> deployed against concern for WAW is that it seems there is little we can do to avert animal suffering. With our current level of scientific understanding, most people are understandably reticent to attempt major genetic re-engineering, for instance, to make lions vegetarian.&nbsp;</p><p>Consider short-term, technologically feasible and politically acceptable options. We can treat or provide food to individual animals, to help improve their lives. We can kill predators to temporarily improve the lives of prey animals (as controversially suggested by <a href=\"https://qz.com/497675/to-truly-end-animal-suffering-the-most-ethical-choice-is-to-kill-all-predators-especially-cecil-the-lion\">Will MacAskill</a>). But ultimately equilibrium effects will bring things back to square one. By helping one wildebeest with a broken leg to survive, I am taking food resources away from other hungry wildebeest. By killing one lion, I may save tens of individual wildebeest, but do not change the carrying capacity of the ecosystem \u2013 an equivalent number of wildebeest will die from other causes.&nbsp;</p><p>Even if we change the ecosystem substantially \u2013 for instance, by irrigating what was once a desert, to increase the wildebeest\u2019s food source \u2013 there will only be a short period of positive net utility, while the population grows. Once the population stabilizes again, it is back to net zero utility, and the larger number of animals is meaningless. Malthus was wrong about humans, but he was right about animals. The repugnant conclusion is a matter of speculation for humanity\u2019s future, but it is a present reality for most animals: their populations are as large as possible, while their welfare has been driven to zero.</p><p>But what if we gave animals the capacity to stabilise and control their reproduction rate? Contraception potentially enables us to trick evolution\u2019s pleasure-pain symmetry, driving up the net utility of some species even while their population remains stable.&nbsp;</p><p>For instance, consider a species with a population of a thousand males and a thousand females, which can live up to 10 years, and each mating pair produces one offspring every year. In the state of nature with stable population, there are a thousand births each year, which must be offset by a thousand deaths. Each individual lives, on average, 2 years. As argued above, the net utility is close to zero.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/ijhwrv4etisfzoqidvzs\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/kptimhr98vzan51703ly 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/ijdy2ycxvuqnbyrfmfoq 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/mc9ps7pqavparl1lt8x3 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/hjnxjyh23niu4bzffkng 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/tuz0mjkrblzpvcxa7zij 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/rgg4mab7cs8qkq9x8yix 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/vpqtcf5kh78wjpn6sozm 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/dsaclm9ci532ns37ci8k 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/em390ccc3kxereoonfky 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/ztcatfzcfjgnobrokqcg 924w\"></figure><p>Now suppose we sterilise half the females.<a href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]</a> The birth rate drops to 500 per year initially, while the death rate remains similar. The population drops, which soon improves the survival rate, as food becomes more abundant. The number of deaths drops (while lagging slightly behind the falling birth rate). The population ultimately stabilizes at half its initial size. The life expectancy doubles, which means that the lifetime fertility rate rebounds to 2.<a href=\"#_ftn4\">[4]</a>&nbsp;</p><p>As animals live longer lives, their net welfare increases because they are conducting more activities (eating, mating) which increase their evolutionary fitness. An organism that lives 4 years in the state of nature would have produced, on average, 4 offspring.&nbsp;The organism is thus likely to experience a positive net utility. <a href=\"#_ftn5\">[5]</a></p><h1><strong>A human analogy: the demographic transition</strong></h1><p>If this argument for contraception as a way to increase WAW seems surprising, consider the lived historical experience of human societies. Developed countries have undergone a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition\">demographic transition</a> from an equilibrium state with high birth and death rates, to one with low birth and death rates. The precise mechanisms driving the transition are debated, and may vary in different times and places, but the overall thrust is summarised here:</p><ul><li>The transition is initiated by improving healthcare and/or nutrition leading to a drop in death rates, resulting in rapid population growth (Stage 2 of diagram below).</li><li>There is then a time lag, as people realise that they no longer need to have four children in order for two to survive; now two will suffice. Hence they use contraception to lower the birth rate (Stage 3).</li><li>The birth rate stabilises to match the lower death rate, and population growth levels off (Stage 4).</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/xve89ub7ilrzk3aus9y3\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/ybcqtqbwlae6nhxdtp0x 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/lybvezmaaw673iyzaiik 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/pzwlxlfjycbjvwpg4aah 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/xpbwwbrmh12nv23fuwdk 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/ydsodnorpkoosvovbjoi 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/xqfebslk7hxmo9sltqpq 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/mv5rhm1hkmsomvjfnqlh 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/nylmdqax7zj4kcxupsxl 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/bknufpbhq6oeqrmfon0k 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LjKKDqHXbrjWcyEi7/ulyde3jdfrzckcmv31vi 915w\"></figure><p>You may have noticed the difference in causal order between the demographic transition in human societies and my proposal for wild animal sterilisation. In the demographic transition, drops in death rates increases demand for contraception, and leads to a drop in birth rates. Because the death rates fall first, with birth rates lagging, the population increases and reaches a higher new equilibrium. On the other hand, wild animal sterilisation leads to a drop in birth rates first, with death rates lagging: consequently, the population reaches a new equilibrium which is lower than the state of nature.</p><h1><strong>Comparison with Farmed Animal Interventions</strong></h1><p>Some interventions to improve the welfare of farmed animals seem staggeringly cost-effective, especially if we accept the headline figures of the <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/welfare-range-estimates#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20a%20cost-effectiveness%20analysis%2C%20a,provide%20%E2%80%9Cmoral%20weight%20discounts%E2%80%9D%20for%2011%20commercially-significant%20species.\">Moral Weights Project</a>: that welfare ranges of most farmed vertebrates are within an order of magnitude of humans, and the welfare ranges of invertebrates are within three orders of magnitude. While the Moral Weights Project focused specifically on animals that are farmed at large scale (or may be farmed in future), it is reasonable to assume that many wild animals which are biologically similar to their farmed counterparts have similar welfare ranges.</p><p>It\u2019s true that work on farmed animals has a big advantage over that on wild animals: because we more directly control the lives of farmed animals, it is easier to change their <i>living conditions</i> and their <i>manner of death</i>. However, the third category of intervention mentioned in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GqnD2tD6EBqPLauYz/saulius-s-shortform?commentId=FT2NhfhBjkCs292Fd\">this paper</a>, <i>population size</i>, is perhaps an area that is easier to work on wild animals. Interventions to reduce the population of farmed animals \u2013 such as a meat tax \u2013 would likely run into strong political opposition from both meat producers and consumers. In contrast, because there are no vested economic interests benefitting from wild animal suffering, interventions such as selective sterilisation are less likely to face strong political opposition.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Counterarguments</strong></h1><p>I acknowledge a major weakness in this article: I haven\u2019t considered crucial ecosystem-wide effects. For instance, if we selectively sterilise Species A, would they simply be out-competed into extinction by Species B, which occupies a similar ecological niche but we have not yet sterilised? Or what would the flow-on welfare effects be for Species C, which preys upon Species A? This would clearly need careful analysis before conducting any such intervention.</p><p>This article was written from the perspective of hedonistic utilitarianism. There are other philosophical perspectives in which animal contraception could be viewed as harmful, for instance:</p><ul><li>Eco-centric worldviews that emphasize the beauty of ecosystems in a \u2018state of nature\u2019 without human meddling.</li><li>Deontological worldviews which emphasize \u2018do-no-harm\u2019 and are thus averse to risky, uncertain interventions.</li><li>Rights-based worldviews that emphasize the right of individuals to not be forcibly sterilized without their consent. (how could an animal give this?)</li></ul><h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p>I\u2019ve argued that:</p><ul><li>Pleasure and pain are largely a reward/punishment mechanism for inducing organisms towards behaviours that increase their evolutionary fitness.</li><li>Because of the cost of producing and experiencing valanced states, the default instantaneous experience for most individuals is neutral. In a state of nature with stable population, many species have close to net zero welfare.</li><li>We could potentially increase welfare sustainably and systematically through sterilisation, which results in lower death rates and \u2018tricks evolution\u2019 to break the pleasure-pain symmetry.</li><li>A similar phenomenon has occurred in most human societies, which have transitioned from a high to low birth and death rates, and enjoyed higher life expectancy and an improved quality of life.</li></ul><p>Contraception is often mentioned as one of an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bh3EnQsAGreDvcnYi/strategic-considerations-for-effective-wild-animal-suffering#What_kind_of_research_is_needed_\">array of measures</a> to improve WAW, along with, for instance, vaccinations, protection from extreme weather events, and improving urban habitats for animals. However, I contend that, without contraception, these other well-intentioned actions are unlikely to make a significant net impact; as saving individual animals from one kind of painful death only increases population pressure and ensures a similar number of others die similarly painful deaths. Further, I believe that contraception can make a significant improvement in WAW even without these other well-intentioned actions, through the equilibrium effects described above.</p><p>I acknowledge that I have only surface-level knowledge of evolutionary biology and neurology, and that the models I\u2019ve discussed here are highly simplistic. So I look forward to hearing your thoughts and critiques!</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a> Here evolutionary fitness means the number of offspring an organism is expected to have over their lifetime.&nbsp;More precisely, evolutionary fitness is about the number of copies of that organism\u2019s genes in circulation into the long-term future. In other words, if Organism A produces 2 offspring which both die before reaching reproductive age, but Organism B produces 1 offspring that thrives and produces many descendants, then B is fitter than A.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]</a>&nbsp;Another way to think about this is that since we are concerned about utility over time, the individuals who live longer \u2018count for more\u2019. For instance, consider a simplified species in which 90% of organisms die as one-year-olds, and experience an average instantaneous utility of -1 unit throughout their short lives. Meanwhile 10% of organisms die as nine-year-olds, and experience an average instantaneous utility of +1 unit. The species still has zero net utility.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\">[3]</a>&nbsp;In reality, we would do this gradually to prevent significant population fluctuation. We would also need to continually sterilize a similar proportion each year.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref4\">[4]</a>&nbsp;In my over-simplified model, the death rate is proportional to population squared (reflecting the fact that competition for resources intensifies as population increases). In this model, if we sterilize a proportion, S, of the initial population P, then a new equilibrium is reached with population (1-S)*P. The life expectancy increases by a factor of 1/(1-S). The proportions would vary if we used more complex and realistic models, but the overall direction of the effect \u2013 sterilization leading to decreased population size and increased life expectancy \u2013 is robust.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref5\">[5]</a>&nbsp;The half who are not sterilized do indeed have 4 offspring on average; the half who are sterilized live otherwise identical lives but have 0 offspring. The net utility of both groups are positive; evolution has been \u2018tricked\u2019 into rewarding the population as if it is perpetually growing.</p>", "user": {"username": "Tom Delaney"}}, {"_id": "4s8kEwiWcwCWcr7tk", "title": "Very Accurate Ancestor Simulation", "postedAt": "2024-03-25T09:38:28.505Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Very Accurate Ancestor Simulation:</p><p>Practicality and Ethics</p><p>Thus far, philosophical discussion involving ancestor simulation has revolved around the likelihood that we are already in one. However, as a controversial sociologist once said, \u201cThe philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways. The point is to change it.\u201d</p><p>As such, it is my intent to demonstrate that highly accurate ancestor simulation is not only within the bounds of physical law, but also feasible. In order to do this, I will show that the human mind is computable, that it is possible to retrieve the minds of the dead, that simulating the Earth\u2019s past is technically feasible, and that it can be done in an ethical manner.</p><p>Computability of the Human Mind</p><p>Edit: This portion of my essay initially misinterpreted Penrose's argument. I have left it largely intact because others do use this line of reasoning as a proof for human noncomputability.</p><p>Many objections to the idea of consciousness uploading and simulation stem from Sir Roger Penrose\u2019s argument for human noncomputability. The popular interpretation is that because we can make logical proofs about noncomputable problems, our minds are noncomputable as well. There is a significant error with the argument\u2019s semiotics. It confuses knowledge about the characteristics of a noncomputable problem with knowledge of the solution. That these are not the same may be easily demonstrated.</p><p>Grahm\u2019s Number is an extremely large but still finite value that cannot be expressed in full except through Knuth arrow notation, as even a power tower meant to represent it would take up the volume of the observable universe. If the above argument were true and there was no distinction between the two kinds of knowledge, every mathematician who used Graham\u2019s Number in a proof would need brains of unimaginable size to store that knowledge. Incidentally, the same is true for any irrational number, as they have infinite decimal places, each containing significant information about the number\u2019s exact value. Imagine having one\u2019s skull implode into a black hole of infinite mass just because of using Pi or E to work something out! The very idea is absurd. (If one is dualist, there is the idea that such knowledge is not stored in a person\u2019s physical brain, but dualism is very discredited.)</p><p>What is happening when we think of noncomputable problems or very large or irrational numbers is much simpler: We use approximation to represent the things we cannot comprehend. Nobody knows all the digits of Pi, just the opening digits and a few essential properties. Likewise, nobody knows all the digits of Graham\u2019s Number, just the closing digits and the number\u2019s properties. There\u2019s nothing really noncomputable going on, just abstract representation of things that won\u2019t fit in our brains. There is, of course, another way to disprove this argument: Ask a mathematician to solve the Halting Problem by hand. After all, if no computers are involved and the human mind is noncomputable, this would be possible. However, it is not possible, and that is exactly what the mathematician would tell you.</p><p>Penrose's actual argument for human noncomputability is far more complicated, and from what I understand it relates to the philosophical question of what it actually means to understand truth. As nondeterministic phenomena such as particle decay do not seem to be important to the way our minds function, it seems reasonable to state that a sufficiently detailed simulation of a person's brain would be able to understand truth in the same way as the person themselves. (Here I assume a distinction between the simulation and the original person, but in practice I do not see such distinctions as important.) The only reason for there to be a meaningful difference would be some nonphysical phenomenon occurring in connection to an organic brain but not an identical simulation thereof. As such assertations are spiritual in nature, I will not dignify them with a response.</p><p>A more convincing argument might be that qualia themselves are noncomputable. While qualia are undoubtedly real but nonphysical phenomena (try finding a molecule of sensory experience!), this does not imply substrate dependance in the least. At the very most, it would imply that a nervous system would have to be simulated with perfect accuracy to host a consciousness, and a sufficiently large quantum computer could easily do this. After all, Feynman showed that any system may be quantum-simulated if the number of qubits in the simulator is similar to the number of particles in that system.</p><p>Other arguments that it is impossible to simulate the human mind claim that consciousness is quantum in nature, citing other phenomena such as photosynthesis and the magnetic sense used by some birds as evidence that such effects could be supported, even within a \u201cwarm, wet, and noisy\u201d environment such as a neuron\u2019s interior. Again, Feynman proved that a reasonably large quantum computer could simulate this. At most, quantum consciousness would prove that it would be unfeasible to simulate consciousness with a classical computer. A similar issue exists with the Quantum Hall Effect, which quantum computers can simulate in a practical manner.</p><p>Clearly, the use of quantum simulation solves these other objections.</p><p>Past Simulation and Retrieval of Connectomes</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref1\">The difficulty in resurrecting those who are long since dead cannot be overstated. Nonetheless, it is indeed possible due to the Second Law of Thermodynamics prohibiting the destruction of information. Information, of course, includes information about the contents of a person\u2019s brain. As such, the state of a person\u2019s mind as it was at any given point in their existence is retrievable. This isn\u2019t to say that such retrieval would be easy. Take, for example, the brain of someone who has been cremated. One would have to comb through the air, collect every particle of ash and gaseous byproducts, and work backwards against the actions of fire and time. Imagine trying to unscramble an egg- it is impossible for any human to do. Nonetheless, we have proof that it is possible in the form of a universal algorithm that reverses a quantum system to an arbitrary previous state<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"ll45ql15scb\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefll45ql15scb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnll45ql15scb\">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>To be clear, this universal time reversal algorithm does not violate thermodynamics. It is a very accurate forensic technique that will also be of use in checking for errors in large quantum simulations, but it is no more Laplace\u2019s Demon than a refrigerator is Maxwell\u2019s Demon. The amount of entropy in the universe will continue to increase.</p><p>This algorithm is technically of O(N) complexity when the system\u2019s current state is known and of&nbsp;</p><span><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"O(N^2)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em;

An operation could take a nanosecond or it could take a year, and the whole process would still seem as long to us, stretching well into what we would describe as the heat death of the universe. However, all hope is not lost. Assuming protons do not decay, all matter will collapse into iron, neutronium, and then black holes via macroscopic quantum mechanical effects. Freeman Dyson determines four possible universe lifetimes, depending on the minimum mass <img> <img style=\"width:2.78%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4s8kEwiWcwCWcr7tk/uwaepbw3lianecp6x9mw\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4s8kEwiWcwCWcr7tk/fokpad9oe9oogg20sus9 25w\"> necessary for a black hole to form: If arbitrarily small black holes can form, all matter is unstable, vanishing into black holes that then evaporate.

In case 2, any structure built to execute this algorithm must be composed of dustlike, self-repelling nanoparticles to avoid undergoing black hole formation. This situation is technically workable for cases 2, 3, and 4, assuming protons do not decay, and the universe does not undergo a violent end, but is completely unacceptable otherwise. In addition, massive objects that do not have event horizons may also undergo a form of gravitational decay. Clearly, the time must be shortened.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref3\">Fortunately, the algorithm\u2019s creators have already outlined one method to do this: Quantum parallelism, which it does not currently use. This would reduce the amount of logic gates required for the calculation, improving time complexity. There is also the possibility of devising an algorithm that has better time complexity even without the use of quantum parallelism as well as the fact that quantum computing, unlike classical computing, does not have a speed limit<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"ecze8rs4in\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefecze8rs4in\"><sup><a href=\"#fnecze8rs4in\">[3]</a></sup></span>. Other, less certain methods include CTC computing and the recursive creation of time-accelerated basement universes. Both are certainly discussed as possibilities in some scientific literature, but would require extensive spacetime engineering, which falls under the category of \u201csufficiently advanced technology\u201d. As such we will ignore them until we discover feasible ways of manipulating spacetime, if it is possible at all. Of the two, CTC computing seems the more plausible. Research on faster, more efficient quantum computers must be prioritized, but with billions of years to implement a solution, advances are almost guaranteed.</p><p>Having shown that the time reversal of a quantum simulation the size of the Earth is indeed possible, we must move on to estimating the technical requirements of such a project in order to determine its feasibility. The exact solution to the problem at hand is still unclear. However, any valid solution must include these elements:</p><ol><li>In order to resurrect every dead being who lived on Earth, it is necessary to disassemble the entire planet (or at least the atmosphere, crust and mantle) in such a way that information about its component particles may be recorded. It is also necessary to disassemble spacegoing habitats, as they will contain material from earth in the form of biomass.</li><li>We must engineer infrastructure capable of both storing this information and using it as an input to calculate past states. The infrastructure must also include a way to \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d. While the amount of hydrogen and helium escaping earth\u2019s atmosphere is relatively small, it is non-negligible. There is also the fate of various probes which have either left the Solar System or been disposed of in irretrievable ways, in the atmospheres of gas giants or within the sun itself for example.</li></ol><p>It will be necessary to not only build nanomachines capable of measuring the position and momentum of single atoms to within tolerances, but also to compensate for quantum uncertainty and solve for missing particles, like hydrogen atoms blown away from the Earth by solar wind. In addition, the disassembly of our former home (and any other worlds we may live and die on before implementing the process of resurrection) will not be instantaneous. Effects from both the measurement of the very first particles and the construction of measurement infrastructure will propagate throughout the entire system, affecting all measurements afterwards. This effect will repeat with each measurement taken. For this reason, information from the very last measurement will need to be processed in a way that compensates for the effects of all previous measurements. Said compensation, however, will resemble the past state calculation required in the second element of our solution. If the states of nanomachines and assorted infrastructure during measurement are also known, the compensation could be made easier.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref4\">The easiest way to measure the Earth\u2019s constituent particles would be to cool it to the cosmic background temperature to settle the atmosphere and oceans into more measurable states. This could be accomplished with the use of a reflective statite belt surrounding the sun on the orbital plane, blocking Earth\u2019s insolation. Then, as the Earth\u2019s crust is measured, it must be stripped away so that the mantle can cool to manageable temperatures via thermal radiation. This process would repeat until the core was exposed. While the measurement apparatus would of course be sourced from the Earth system being measured, it should be possible to fill in the missing pieces and/or construct equipment to measure the original apparatus from matter that has already been measured. One study shows that an altered quantum simulation can be self-healing to a certain extent, i.e., the butterfly effect does not exist on the quantum level.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"k4opnr6iqwi\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk4opnr6iqwi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk4opnr6iqwi\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This may make the process simpler.</p><p>This problem, while extremely difficult, can likely be solved. We have five billion years before Sol leaves the main sequence and engulfs Earth, and we can measure Earth before then while still developing ways to solve for missing particles. At the very least we can use this process in tandem with other forensic methods to find the Earth\u2019s most likely past.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref5\">The second element of successfully retrieving the minds of the dead is of the greatest importance to this endeavor. While quantum effects would make ordinary simulation extremely difficult, quantum systems may be simulated with quantum computers containing a similar number of qubits as particles in that system. NV centers such as the kind found in diamonds may be used for quantum computing. Assuming that we use nanodiamonds, each containing 80 carbon atoms and one NV qubit, it would be possible to simulate the entire Earth using a third of the mass of Jupiter. While this would not include other parts of the computer, it is still rather small for a stellar scale megastructure. As such, the engineering requirements are within the capacity of an advanced civilization. Networking the quantum computers will, of course, be necessary. Such a technology has been recently developed.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"5\" data-footnote-id=\"1ku9gmxdqph\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1ku9gmxdqph\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1ku9gmxdqph\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>Converting part of Jupiter\u2019s mass into carbon would require the use of self-replicating industrial fusion plants. However, it would be impossible to reach the temperatures and pressures required to break even on the energy requirement, except in the core of a massive star. As such, when fusing helium into carbon, the fusion plants would require a constant supply of power.</p><p>The computational infrastructure, power, and time requirements point towards the construction of one or more nested Dyson swarms as the optimal solution to meet the requirements of element two.</p><p>If we are to make our own heaven, it must be without end. Thus, the resurrection of the minds of the dead is merely one obstacle to us. The sun, like any other class G star, will eventually expand into a red giant, produce a planetary nebula, and slowly cool into a black dwarf over an interval best described as \u201cdeep time\u201d. Red and orange dwarfs will last for longer, but they too will burn out. Eventually all black holes will evaporate, and the universe will be at thermodynamic equilibrium, with no possibility of performing any kind of useful work. While in an open universe one could always find more matter to power fusion reactors, the universe\u2019s expansion will make it effectively closed due to a shrinking cosmological event horizon. It is possible that the universe will undergo the Big Rip before this, and any number of other events might pose a danger to the simulated paradise we construct. As such, we must engineer a way to escape the end of the universe if at all possible. This would also be useful in the event of extended computational time requirements.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref6\">Research into this field is very rare, but several promising methods have been presented<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"6\" data-footnote-id=\"i91lfanf5dk\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi91lfanf5dk\"><sup><a href=\"#fni91lfanf5dk\">[6]</a></sup></span>. In general, they involve either escaping the universe itself, using the end of the universe to perform computations in some way, or increasing the subjective time available to simulated beings until it reaches infinity. All such solutions are dependent on our knowledge of the laws of physics, so we must prioritize the research of physics and cosmology. Only when we have sufficient knowledge of the universe can we begin to engineer a way to escape its end. Again, we have billions of years to solve these problems, at the very least.</p><p>Moral Objections</p><p>Some may question the ethics of running a historical simulation full of sentient beings, as such beings would naturally experience any suffering they may have experienced in life. Some might argue that the suffering is a moot point, as it has already been experienced outside of the simulation. The ancestor simulation could also be run in reverse, meaning that the resurrected minds would be recovered at the very end of their life, when from their point of view the suffering was already over. As such they would likely have very little issue with having their past simulated in order to recover dead loved ones. Finally, even if the simulation couldn\u2019t be run in reverse and the suffering wasn\u2019t something that had already happened, it would still pale in comparison to the wellbeing of countless beings over a (hopefully) infinite timespan.</p><p>A responsible utilitarian hesitates to reduce such moral conundrums to mere trolley problems, as in a realistic scenario there are often more than two solutions: Choosing a lesser evil often leads one to overlook choices that don\u2019t require any evil at all. However, in this case such suffering would be necessary to resurrect the minds of the dead, allowing them a blissful eternity.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The very act of deconstructing the Earth would pose ethical difficulties, like any other large scale engineering project of this nature. Either we must wait 1.8 billion years for the sun\u2019s increased brightness to render Earth uninhabitable by multicellular life, or, and this is much more likely, we must upload all Earth lifeforms capable of experiencing suffering. Either way, the Earth and its contents must be frozen and deconstructed in a way that does not cause undue harm to sentient life.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another issue is the resurrection of those we consider to be morally reprehensible, and how to deal with them. Clearly, they must face consequences for their actions, but the typical solution many religions arrive at, i.e. eternal torture of some form or another, is unconscionable. Even if the vast majority of resurrected minds do not go to \u201chell\u201d, such that the net good of such a system still trends to positive infinity, certain individuals would still face infinite suffering. It is also a great evil to consign a person\u2019s mind to oblivion, whether by outright deletion or memory erasure. These options cannot be borne, as a utilitarian\u2019s duty is not to merely choose a lesser evil but to choose the least evil possible. Nobody deserves eternal suffering or the cessation of existence, no matter what they did in life.</p><p>How, then, do we deal with the resurrected minds of Hitler and his ilk? Probably the best solution is to give them a working conscience, a strong sense of empathy, and help them understand how their actions caused others to suffer. To those who would view it as torture, I will simply say that although nothing hurts like a guilty conscience, it is still fundamentally a learning experience. Though it is better to not have done anything to have a guilty conscience, you emerge all the wiser, with all the greater morality for experiencing that regret. Rather than mere academic knowledge of how to behave, you understand <i>why</i>&nbsp;to do so. Once the resurrected minds in question truly understand and regret their actions, in such a way that if they had a chance to relive their lives without consequence they would still not go through with their previous wrongdoing, they should be released and their consciences eased.</p><p>According to utilitarian values, morality can be defined as minimizing suffering while also maximizing wellbeing. As wellbeing and suffering are not subjective, neither is morality, and as such there must be a correct definition of how to behave towards others in a moral manner. We must not only embrace Presentism, but we must also acknowledge that many of our actions today will be considered reprehensible in the future. (Animal cruelty in the form of the meat industry comes to mind, at least until we can develop vat-grown varieties.) It is this correct definition of morality, when we determine it, that we must use when judging the minds of the dead (and ourselves).</p><p>Other Objections</p><p>There are some who might say this project is impossible due to the fact that Earth is not a completely closed system, as it is gradually losing part of its atmosphere. This is true. However, the vast majority of atmospheric loss is in the form of the two lightest gases, Hydrogen and Helium. Oxygen and Carbon almost always stay on Earth, and of course compared to the atmosphere\u2019s total mass losses are quite small. These will likely contain most of the important information. As we have billions of years to perfect techniques to compensate for atmospheric loss, it should be possible to fill in the missing pieces, especially because the very time reversal algorithm we propose using to resurrect dead minds can be used to check a quantum simulator\u2019s accuracy.</p><p>Space habitats are, by design, closed systems. As organic life is unsuitable for interstellar exploration (uploaded people being much easier to transport due to a lack of life support equipment), and no other body in the solar system is habitable for Terran life in the short term, there should be relatively little interaction between our biosphere (where almost all the information is) and celestial bodies other than Earth. We must restrict the scattering of ash on extraterrestrial bodies, as while we would only need to scan the areas where cremains have landed, it still adds processing time and complexity. Ash in sealed containers is more doable, but there must be a moratorium with regards to the disposal of bodies in gas giants or the Sun. Retrieving them would add catastrophic amounts of processing time to the resurrection project.</p><p>Towards Practicality</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref7\">The requirements for physically implementing this project will seem impossible to the average person. Indeed, they will require technology so advanced as to be indistinguishable from magic for many people. However, the basic technology to be used in this proposed process exists. A universal time reversal algorithm has been developed for use in quantum simulations of arbitrary size, molecular nanotechnology is plausible (as shown with the development of helicene-based molecular motors), and the measurement of single atoms has been performed with electron microscopy and X-rays<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"7\" data-footnote-id=\"7mt2uavzf7r\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7mt2uavzf7r\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7mt2uavzf7r\">[7]</a></sup></span>. As science and technology advance, we will find ways to improve the technology and solve the problems associated with this project. In the short term, we should encourage research into relevant fields of science and engineering, and raise awareness and scientific debate over the possibilities presented here.</p><p>In the long term, we hope that as Humanity and our descendants become more advanced and more focused on the long term, our idea will flourish and eventually be implemented. The time reversal algorithm for quantum computers is very useful in other ways (primarily error checking), and uploaded people will no doubt wish to be with their deceased loved ones, rather than mere approximations. It would be easy for more people to see how the algorithm can be used for that purpose. As such, there is reason to believe that even if this essay is forgotten, the central theme will prove perennial, independently thought of time after time. It may take millions of years before we see that day, and countless aeons before our goal of resurrecting the dead is accomplished, but eventually we can create our own paradise. Until then, we can only hope.</p><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"ll45ql15scb\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnll45ql15scb\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"ll45ql15scb\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefll45ql15scb\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2020-08-time-reversal-unknown-quantum-state.html\">https://phys.org/news/2020-08-time-reversal-unknown-quantum-state.html</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"87zfrh58t6\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn87zfrh58t6\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"87zfrh58t6\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref87zfrh58t6\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;Time without end: Physics and biology in an open universe, lecture II</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"ecze8rs4in\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnecze8rs4in\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"ecze8rs4in\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefecze8rs4in\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PhLA..382..477S/abstract\">https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PhLA..382..477S/abstract</a></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may overlap with the use of quantum parallelism.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"k4opnr6iqwi\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnk4opnr6iqwi\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"k4opnr6iqwi\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefk4opnr6iqwi\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2020-07-simulating-quantum-butterfly-effect-realm.html\">https://phys.org/news/2020-07-simulating-quantum-butterfly-effect-realm.html</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"5\" data-footnote-id=\"1ku9gmxdqph\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn1ku9gmxdqph\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"1ku9gmxdqph\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref1ku9gmxdqph\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-024-00803-2\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-024-00803-2</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"6\" data-footnote-id=\"i91lfanf5dk\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fni91lfanf5dk\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"i91lfanf5dk\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefi91lfanf5dk\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;See <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M4i83QAwcCJ2ppEfe/how-to-survive-the-end-of-the-universe\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M4i83QAwcCJ2ppEfe/how-to-survive-the-end-of-the-universe</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"7\" data-footnote-id=\"7mt2uavzf7r\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn7mt2uavzf7r\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"7mt2uavzf7r\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref7mt2uavzf7r\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06011-w\">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06011-w</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Mythopoeist"}}, {"_id": "YEkKJrvWXJBqDFkt3", "title": "Be skeptical of EAs giving advice on things they\u2019ve never actually been successful in themselves", "postedAt": "2024-03-25T00:01:35.320Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I think EAs spend a lot of time thinking about things.

\"pioneering and influential programs\" that \"represent the prevalent approaches to sexual violence prevention in a particular period of time.\"</p><p>The first is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1998-00238-005\"><u>Safe Dates</u></a>, which \"makes use of multiple strategies, including a play performed by students, a poster contest, and a ten-session curriculum.\" Safe Dates starts from the assumption that perpetration and victimization can be reduced by changing dating abuse norms and gender stereotypes, as well as improving communication skills, e.g. anger management and conflict resolution.</p><p>The second is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.2202/1949-6605.1684/html\"><u>Men's Program</u></a>, which aims to prevent sexual violence by men by increasing their empathy and support for victims of sexual violence, and by reducing their resistance to violence prevention programs. In its initial form, participants watched a 15-minute dramatization of a male police officer who was raped by two other men, and then dealt with the aftermath. Participants then learned that the perpetrators \u201cwere heterosexual and known to the victim, and attempted to draw connections between the male police officer\u2019s experience and common sexual violence experiences among women.\u201d Participants then learned \u201cstrategies for supporting a rape survivor; definitions of consent;\u201d how they might stop a peer from joking about rape or disrespecting women; and situations that were at high risk of sexual violence.</p><p>The third is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcop.20159\"><u>Bringing in the Bystander</u></a>, which centers on helping people in danger (e.g. separating a drunk friend from a risky situation) and speaking up against sexist ideas. These interventions shift the goalposts a bit from decreasing perpetration behavior to increasing bystander behavior. It also categorizes all people as potential interveners, rather than casting men as potential perpetrators and women as potential victims.</p><h3>Outcome measurement</h3><p>The vast majority of outcomes are self-reported. Perpetration and Victimization were measured with the <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2007.00385.x\">Sexual Experiences Survey</a> and ideas-based outcomes are typically measured with the <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/t09511-000\">Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale</a>.</p><p>Perpetration, victimization, and bystander behaviors have become more popular outcomes over time.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/spylvlbxn2frnntwolzv\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/qeybgyp8ihkaoj78siep 120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/ouchuhhreufdgfrsqy0f 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/zbmzaoimowxpgxi1nffz 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/ut0ec9psmspctcfvvt7y 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/ce4xudkewxes3ccqdrwt 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/ngcaf0vmei1tfgr5nkfk 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/a0n6rts4azezcktioqsq 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/awdlrfalwaim3xbonfqz 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/cba8dpzn4is6wt2jlvl9 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/zxbseluzob145cs6uggk 1188w\"></figure><h3>Ideas-based approaches are dominant</h3><p>Essentially every intervention we looked at tries to change <i>ideas</i> about sexual violence as a conduit towards reducing violence, and measures ideas as its main outcome.</p><p>The implicit model here is sometimes called KAP, or \"<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7750837/\">Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practice</a>.\" The typical measure of ideas is acceptance of rape myths (<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Ft09511-000\">Payne, Lonsway, &amp; Fitzgerald 1999</a>), which take four forms: \"disbelief of rape claims, the belief that victims are responsible for rape, that rape reports are manipulation, and that rape only happens to certain kinds of women.\"</p><p>One study tries to alter physical environments in addition to ideas. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23076726/\">Taylor et al. (2013)</a> deployed \"a building-level intervention that included building-based restraining orders (\u201cRespecting Boundaries Agreements\u201d), posters to increase awareness of dating violence and harassment, and increased presence of faculty or school security in 'hot spots' identified by students.\" They evaluated this alongside \"<a href=\"https://ecsa.lucyfaithfull.org/shifting-boundaries\">Shifting Boundaries</a>,\" a curriculum designed to reduce dating violence and sexual harassment among adolescents ages 11-13.</p><h2>Quantitative results</h2><p>All results are presented in terms of Glass's \u2206, an estimate of standardized mean difference. It takes the difference in average outcomes for the treatment and the control group and divides it by the standard deviation of the dependent variable for the control group. \u2206 = 1.0 corresponds to a change of 1 standard deviation in the outcome.&nbsp;</p><h3>An overall moderate effect</h3><p>Our random effects meta-analysis reveals an overall effect size of \u2206 = 0.28 (SE = 0.025). This effect is statistically significant at p &lt; 0.0001, and corresponds to a small to medium effect size by convention. We did not detect meaningful evidence of publication bias.</p><h3>Ideas are a lot easier to change than behaviors</h3><p>The overall effect size for ideas-based outcomes is \u2206 = 0.366 (SE = .031), p &lt; 0.0001; for behaviors, it's \u2206 = 0.071 (SE = 0.022), p = 0.0015.</p><p>Moreover, things look worse when we subdivide behaviors into their four constituent categories: perpetration, victimization, bystander behaviors, and involvement. (Involvement outcomes measure participants\u2019 interest in participating in sexual violence awareness and prevention activities.)</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>N (studies)</td><td>\u2206 (SE)</td></tr><tr><td>Perpetration</td><td>53</td><td>0.033 (0.020)</td></tr><tr><td>Victimization</td><td>40</td><td>&nbsp;0.046 (0.029)&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Bystander</td><td>23</td><td>&nbsp;0.129* (0.059)&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Involvement</td><td>9</td><td>0.236* (0.088)&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>Ideas-based</td><td>264</td><td>0.366*** (0.031)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><i>&nbsp;* p &lt; .05; ** p &lt; .01; *** p &lt; .001.</i></p><p>The effects on perpetration and victimization outcomes are neither clinically or statistically significant. In a forthcoming commentary to the paper, a leading scholar calls this a \"damning wake-up call.\"</p><h3>Bystander efforts are generally ineffective</h3><p>43 of 96 bystander studies measure behaviors. Twenty-two of those measured whether bystander interventions increase bystander behaviors, which they do to a modest extent \u2206 = 0.154 (SE = 0.056), p = 0.011. In our database, twenty bystander studies measure perpetration or victimization, and had null effects on both perpetration (\u2206 = 0.019, SE = 0.019, p = 0.329) and victimization (\u2206 = -0.009, SE = 0.041, p = 0.835). This suggests, unfortunately, that nearly 1 in 3 studies in our database is pursuing a theory of change that does not meaningfully reduce sexual violence.</p><h3>Attitude change does not predict behavior change</h3><p>Sixty-two studies measure both ideas-based and behavioral outcomes. For those studies, the pooled behavior change effect is \u2206 = 0.083 (SE = 0.029), p = 0.006, while the pooled idea change effect is \u2206 = 0.290 (SE = 0.039), p &lt;0.0001. Unfortunately, in these studies, we find a small, statistically non-significant correlation of r(60) = 0.136, p = 0.293 between changes in ideas and changes in behaviors. The relationship remains small and non-significant when looking solely at randomized evaluations (r = 0.138, p = 0.48). Basically, changing ideas does not appear sufficient for changing behaviors.&nbsp;</p><p>This figure displays this lack of relationship:&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/p8n4z8yfa3vfwmqis4r4\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/r8fm9zn5btvc7l7312sr 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/wz02smdse0ca5osq4ul6 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/obbjlutreqpvgiasvbnp 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/sw01uzysdanywidtsz51 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/ose8bkof6uysjwwiitmk 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/xzhsnxidspjsaqdph4zs 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/yuxja2ferpzlbozuc3vr 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/uksey2gfsczaghxukovp 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/easrot5paxzzdm8afvwh 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/uWh8N5DtbSLsuuTzL/e4ctf7aeczht78hvkzeh 982w\"></figure><p>Each point is a study that measures both ideas and behaviors, with the average effect size for ideas about sexual violence on the X axis and the average behavioral effect size on the Y axis. The dotted black line shows what a correlation of 1.0 would look like, and the dotted gray line shows the correlation that we actually observe. Studies are color-coded by design.</p><h2>Where do we go from here?</h2><h3>Environmental and structural theories of change are relatively untested</h3><p>From the paper:</p><blockquote><p>[W]e do not currently have many approaches that aim to solve the problem of sexual violence with interventions that target behavior change. Instead, we see predominantly efforts to change attitudes, beliefs, norms, and knowledge surrounding sexual violence with the assumption that behavior change will follow.</p><p>...Interventions that take a behavioral approach may do so by considering features of the environment. Physical spaces communicate local norms and expectations (<a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/17456916211030264\">Gantman &amp; Paluck, 2022;</a> <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/26320770221093641\">S. McMahon et al., 2022</a>) as well as make some behaviors easier than others to enact. Those features could be geographical configurations like a lack of common social space (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916211030264\">Gantman &amp; Paluck, 2022)</a>...Another idea that is more relevant to the college setting is based on the finding that college students do not have enough private spaces to interact that are not bedrooms (<a href=\"https://www.sexualcitizens.com/\">Hirsch &amp; Khan, 2020</a>). Therefore, future work could quantitatively evaluate the impact of introducing more public spaces to reduce sexual violence on campus. Interventions may also consider who is afforded power in a given situation: For example, who owns the physical space, who has more money, who is driving home, and how the physical space communicates who is valued (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/17456916211030264\">Gantman &amp; Paluck, 2022</a>). For example, fraternities with poorly kept women\u2019s restrooms were also places where sexual violence was more likely to occur (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/189830\">Boswell &amp; Spade, 1996</a>). We recommend a focus on geographical and other aspects of physical spaces as one untapped area for future theorizing and intervention programming that targets behavior change.</p></blockquote><p>The <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23076726/\">Taylor et al. (2013)</a> school-based intervention we mentioned earlier is one of the most effective interventions we looked at, and a great candidate for large-scale replication.</p><h3>A few interventions that aren't primary prevention efforts came out looking comparatively effective&nbsp;</h3><p><a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w25627/revisions/w25627.rev0.pdf\">Unconditional cash transfers to women meaningfully reduces sexual violence in rural Kenya.</a></p><p>So does decriminalizing sex work (in <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/restud/article-abstract/85/3/1683/4756165\">Rhode Island</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.20150299\">the Netherlands</a>).</p><p>Ditto for <a href=\"https://www.micaelasviatschi.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/sex_cr_5_27_20.pdf\">opening adult entertainment establishments in NYC</a>.</p><h3>Some recent methodological innovation in measurement</h3><p>We write:</p><blockquote><p>We suggest researchers attempt to triangulate on rates of perpetration and victimization through multiple avenues of measurement. When testing interventions conducted in a college campus, researchers can collect complaints filed with the University\u2019s Title IX offices, crime data observed by police on campus grounds, and self-reports of perpetration and victimization...</p><p>It is also possible to better assess the relationship between changing ideas about sexual violence and changing behavior. For example, <a href=\"https://www.povertyactionlab.org/sites/default/files/TSH_latest.pdf\">Sharma (2022)</a> tests a sexual harassment training aimed at men in India, and uses an innovative mix of women reporting on harassment behaviors of men in their class, trust games, direct questions and hypothetical scenarios to elicit opinions. Lastly, <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00224499.2022.2105290\">Schuster, Tomaszewska, and Krah \u0301e (2022)</a> combine self-reported behavioral data at multiple timepoints with \u201crisky sexual scripts\u201d and open-ended questions to provide a fuller picture of how and when ideas about sexual violence and sexual violence itself vary together.</p></blockquote><h3>There are not a lot of cost-benefit-analyses in this literature</h3><p>The one cost-benefit analysis that comes to mind is of the <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12916-014-0122-5\">SASA! program in Uganda</a>, which estimated they could <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-016-2883-6?fromPaywallRec=false\">prevent a single instance of IPV for $486 on average</a>. We do not place much credence in this finding because the study had just 4 clusters in treatment and 4 in control. However, for folks working in this field, this is probably a good baseline estimate.</p><p>If a funder asked us about best current opportunities, we would say we need more basic research, i.e. randomized evaluations of the sorts of behavioral interventions we propose.</p><h2>Further reading and supplementary materials</h2><p>I (Seth) got a lot out of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Sexual-Citizens-Landmark-Assault-Campus/dp/1324001704\">Sexual Citizens</a>, which is an anthropology of sexual violence at Columbia University and some promising solutions.

However, once a group of people believe your problem is important, <strong>education is the next step in empowering those people with the understanding of prior work in your field, and giving them the knowledge of further opportunities to work on your problem.</strong></p><p>Education (to me) is the act of collecting the knowledge that exists about your field into a sensible structure, and transmitting it to others in such a way that they can develop their own understanding.</p><p>In this post I describe how the AI Safety Fundamentals course helped to drive the fields of AI alignment and AI governance forward. I\u2019ll then draw on some more general lessons for other fields that may benefit from education, which you can skip straight to <a href=\"https://jamiebernardi.com/2024/03/20/how-educational-courses-help-build-fields-lessons-from-ai-safety-fundamentals/#generic-lessons\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>I don\u2019t expect much of what I say to be a surprise to passionate educators, but when I was starting out with BlueDot Impact I looked around for write-ups on the value of education and found them lacking. This might help others who are starting out with field building and are unsure about putting time into education work.</p><h1>Case study: The AI Safety Fundamentals Course</h1><h2>Running the AI Safety Fundamentals Course</h2><p>Before running the AI Safety Fundamentals course, I was running a casual reading group in Cambridge, on the topic of technical AI safety papers.</p><p>We had a problem with the reading group: lots of people wanted to join our reading group, would turn up, but would bounce because they didn\u2019t know what was going on. The space wasn\u2019t for them. Not only that, the experienced members in the group found themselves repeatedly explaining the same initial concepts to newcomers. The space wasn\u2019t delivering for experienced people, either.</p><p>It was therefore hard to get a community off the ground, as attendance at this reading group was low. Dewi (later, my co-founder) noticed this problem and got to work on a curriculum with Richard Ngo \u2013 then a PhD student at Cambridge working on the foundations of the alignment problem. As I recall it, their aim was to make an \u2018onboarding course for the Cambridge AI safety reading group\u2019. (In the end, the course far outgrew that remit!)</p><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:620px\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:calc(.5*var(--wp--custom--gap--vertical)) calc(.5*var(--wp--custom--gap--horizontal))\"><strong>Lesson 1: A space for everyone is a space for no-one.</strong><br>You should feel okay about being exclusive to specific audiences. Where you can, try to be inclusive by providing other options for audiences you\u2019re not focusing on. That could look like:<br>\u2013 To signal the event is for beginners, branding your event or discussion as \u201cintroductory\u201d.<br>\u2013 Set clear criteria for entry to help people self-assess, e.g. \u201cassumed knowledge: can code up a neural network using a library like Tensorflow/Pytorch\u201d.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3>There was no great way to learn about alignment, pre-2020</h3><p>To help expose some of the signs that a field is ready for educational materials to be produced, I\u2019ll briefly discuss how the AI alignment educational landscape looked before AISF.</p><p><strong>In 2020, the going advice for how to learn about AI Safety for the first time was:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Read everything on the alignment forum.</strong> I might not need to spell out the problem with this advice but:</li></ol><ul><li><strong>A list of blog posts is unstructured</strong>, so it\u2019s very hard to build up a picture of what\u2019s going on. Everyone was building their own mental framework for alignment from scratch.</li><li><strong>It\u2019s very hard for amateurs to discern material quality </strong>or pre-requisites, so a lot of time is wasted in identifying seminal pieces amongst half-baked ideas.</li></ul><ol><li><strong>Speak to AI safety researchers.</strong> There were two problems with this:</li></ol><ul><li><strong>That doesn\u2019t scale </strong>\u2013 it\u2019s super time-inefficient for researchers to explain basic concepts to every newcomer, and share the 3 best blog posts that come to their mind during the call.</li><li><strong>It selects against people who are less confident.</strong> Many people are afraid of looking foolish whilst asking basic questions from experts, or don\u2019t feel worth the experts\u2019 time, which would prevent them reaching out.</li></ul><p>I expect that most fields look like this at the beginning, and that might be acceptable whilst demand is small and niche.</p><p>However, there comes a time where the time inefficiency becomes unacceptable for learners (because there is more and more material to sift through) <i>and</i> experts (due to a high number of requests for 1-1s, and it being hard to discern which calls are worth it or not).<strong> </strong>It\u2019s unfortunately a little difficult to spot when the time to make a course comes.</p><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:620px\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:calc(.5*var(--wp--custom--gap--vertical)) calc(.5*var(--wp--custom--gap--horizontal))\"><strong>Lesson 2: A lot of the value in designing a course is curating the best materials that explain your field.</strong><br>\u2013 This helps to get everyone singing from the same hymn sheet. People will be able to converse and critique your field more easily if the existing ideas are exposed to them.<br>\u2013 Don\u2019t worry about getting it right the first time. Make sure you have a good way to collect feedback and keep speaking to practitioners about your course. You will be able to keep your material up to date.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3>Uncaptured interest in AI safety</h3><p>The Effective Altruism community had promoted AI safety as a <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\"><u>pressing problem</u></a> for some years by the time we made AISF. That was largely <i>because</i> the field was still very new \u2013 the claim was not enough people were focusing on the problem of AI safety relative to its potential scale. In turn, there was relatively little educational material or ways into the field.</p><p>This advocacy without concrete means of engagement meant there were a lot of people interested in AI safety without an outlet into which to put their motivation to learn about the field. It turns out, those were the ideal conditions under which to start a course (not that the extremity of this situation is required for <i>every</i> course that will follow).</p><p>The first time we opened the AISF course online was partly by accident. The course had been trialled with a couple of groups in Cambridge, and Dewi was gearing up for a larger course in Cambridge when the pandemic happened. Dewi therefore decided to open up applications online, and was (I believe) surprised that <i>230 people</i> from across the world applied to the second iteration of the course.</p><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:620px\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:calc(.5*var(--wp--custom--gap--vertical)) calc(.5*var(--wp--custom--gap--horizontal))\"><strong>Lesson 3: look out for signs of \u2019interest overhang\u2019</strong> \u2013 where there is more interest in your field than existing educational sources have capacity to absorb. This might be desirable because it can be a waste to put a lot of time into educational materials to find nobody was interested in working through them, and by the time people are, your field might have moved on.<br><strong>To discern current interest, you could:</strong><br>\u2013 <strong>Run online talks</strong> where you / a researcher explains the field. Advertise that talk within communities where you think there\u2019s interest. People who attend may be the early-adopters for your course.<br>\u2013 <strong>Distribute an interest form </strong>for your course, before you\u2019ve done the work to produce the course. Interest and the type of people who sign up will help you to discern how to design the course, and how much effort to put in.<br>\u2013 <strong>Conduct user interviews</strong> with people who you might suspect are in your target audience and figure out how they\u2019re currently learning about your topic.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3>Not everyone thought AISF was a good idea</h3><p>It\u2019s worth highlighting a couple of critiques we faced when we got started, to help address doubts you might face in building up your own educational materials. You might think these critiques are silly, especially in retrospect, but hear me out.</p><p><strong>Criticism 1: People could already learn about AI safety [from the source materials] without our course</strong></p><p>Many people already working in AI safety had got there by pouring through the materials themselves and building up their own models \u2013 indeed, it was the only way you <i>could</i> get involved. Therefore some of those people suspected that there was enough good material out there, organised in a reasonably fine way, for serious people to get involved with the field.</p><p>I do think it\u2019s plausible that the type of person that was willing to go through the source materials and understand the problem from first principles <i>was</i> likely to be a successful researcher. There was also little sense in putting <i>lots</i> of people through the course because there were few venues to support people\u2019s continued learning beyond AISF.</p><p>I still think running educational courses was valuable for the few folks who were in an <i>excellent position to contribute straight away</i> because:</p><ol><li><strong>Time efficiency. </strong>It\u2019s really hard to make and follow a curriculum by yourself, even if you\u2019re \u2018smart\u2019. This costs a lot of time \u2013 and the best people will have lots of ways they could spend their time.</li><li><strong>Visibility</strong>. If there\u2019s no course about something, it might be hard to draw attention to the best materials, therefore there\u2019s no guarantee these self-starters stumble upon the most important ideas in your field by trawling through fora.</li><li><strong>Numbers.</strong> Fields need lots of people to work on them, at some point, so it was helpful to build capacity into the field by making it easier to learn about, therefore inviting more people into it.</li><li><strong>Transparency.</strong> Seeing what exists gives others permission to contribute. They will either feel equipped to critique what you present them, or identify gaps that you didn\u2019t present to them.</li></ol><p><strong>Criticism 2: our course would raise too much attention to the concept of AGI</strong>,<strong> and inspire more people to advance AGI before safety techniques have been developed.</strong></p><p>I do think it was reasonable to be cautious of promoting the concept of AGI as a powerful technology at the time (pre-ChatGPT). Not many people had considered that something like AGI was in reach, and I do broadly believe in the concept of <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/The-Offense-Defense-Balance-of-Scientific-Knowledge.pdf\"><u>information hazards</u></a> and the possibility that our course might lead to more people working on developing AGI than trying to make it safe.</p><p>We addressed this concern in 2 ways, at the time:</p><ol><li><strong>Most applicants expressed a genuine interest in working on AI safety</strong> rather than simply learning about the capabilities of AGI systems.</li><li><strong>The landscape changed quite dramatically after ChatGPT was released</strong>, as everyone had heard about AGI and it was being discussed regularly in the news. This meant any additional attention our course would draw to AGI would likely be fairly minor by comparison.</li></ol><p>This didn\u2019t fully address everyone\u2019s concerns \u2013 indeed at some point you need to make <i>someone</i> unhappy to get things done. We felt it was justified to make this field more accessible by running this course, despite the risk of accelerating dangerous aspects of AI technology.</p><h3>The science of learning is useful to know for course design</h3><p>I could write a whole other blog post on the science of learning, and indeed others have. I\u2019ll quickly list off some recommendations here and not go into detail.</p><p>I want to use this space to flag that the science of learning will help you to design an excellent, engaging course. Some important concepts:</p><ul><li>Setting clear <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/learning-objective\"><u>learning objectives</u></a> for each class/module, and explicitly explaining how the resources you share relate to those learning objectives.</li><li>Using <a href=\"https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/blooms-taxonomy/\"><u>Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy</u></a> for understanding what level of complexity learners are ready for.</li><li>Using <a href=\"https://itali.uq.edu.au/teaching-guidance/teaching-practices/designing-learning-activities\"><u>learning activities</u></a> that get students using the skills you want them to learn.</li><li>Create opportunities to <a href=\"https://www.ctl.ox.ac.uk/giving-effective-feedback\"><u>give students feedback</u></a> on their exercises and ideas they share in classes. You could also facilitate peer-to-peer feedback, but feedback from an expert is best.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YepzavQDRvobANHYK/l32ab9r45tlqrfwxicum\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YepzavQDRvobANHYK/ik9jcmumlgf9zz46gmky 829w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YepzavQDRvobANHYK/v84uujiziufuksrdldty 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YepzavQDRvobANHYK/icfihxqjomhqmkylmrpo 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YepzavQDRvobANHYK/sm5sy01humbutusl5vzs 768w\"></p><p>A highly simplified model of the science of learning.</p><h2>Impact of the AI safety Fundamentals Course</h2><p>There are few concrete metrics to point to about the value of education. Universities and schools tend to point to what their alumni do next, as evidence that their educational services helped to prepare their students for that. It\u2019s no different for AISF; the best stat we could look for was how many of our alumni took next steps in the relevant field (be it employment, further learning or projects, etc).</p><p>Qualitatively, I felt I saw first-hand how the alignment field changed as a result of educating people about the bare basics of what was going on in the fields of AI alignment and governance. It helped bring policymakers up to speed on AI governance, and was the gateway into AI alignment for 1000s of technical people. We were regularly told it raised the bar on the level of conversations happening at job interviews at top alignment organisations.</p><p>I\u2019ve come to believe that, whilst hard to directly measure the impact, education is an essential component of field building, and a precursor that accelerates downstream, direct impact.</p><p>This won\u2019t come as news to anyone who is impassioned by education. I regularly met enthusiasts for education, and I wish I had known what they know much sooner.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:620px\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:calc(.5*var(--wp--custom--gap--vertical)) calc(.5*var(--wp--custom--gap--horizontal))\"><strong>Lesson 4: it\u2019s hard to measure the impact of education (and many other things, in general)</strong>.<br>\u2013 The impact of education is often far downstream of the course experience.<br>\u2013 Furthermore, people take your course because they\u2019re already interested in the topic \u2013 so you\u2019ll never know the counterfactual of which steps they took because of your course.However, the more specific you are about the aims of your course, the more concretely you can measure that. For example, we would measure how many people completed an upskilling (or similar) project that builds towards their career in AI safety.<br>\u2013 Otherwise, you can measure how successful your <i>education</i> was by assessing participants with tests or coursework (sound familiar?).</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h1>Generic lessons for education</h1><h2>How education helps build fields</h2><p>A field is built when people are collectively thinking about a problem or topic, broadly oriented around the same framework. A course is an excellent way to make this happen.</p><p>By creating a curriculum you are essentially framing the problems in your field as you see them, and helping others download your model of \u2018what\u2019s going on\u2019 more quickly. This can often be a clarifying experience for <i>you</i> too; explaining ideas to others is often a great way to make progress on your own understanding.</p><p>It\u2019s quite likely that different people will explain your field in different ways \u2013 it\u2019s not necessary (and in fact impossible) to achieve <i>total</i> consensus about your curriculum. However, by laying a stake in the ground you\u2019re helping <i>everyone</i> to make progress. After all, if someone critiques your curriculum, you have generated more engagement.</p><h2>Benefits of designing courses</h2><p>In this section I spell out some of the specific benefits of designing and running courses, to you as the designer:</p><ol><li><strong>Recruitment</strong> \u2013 if you are looking to hire, a course is a great way to:<ol><li><i>Generate</i> strong candidates by providing knowledge to the people with the right skills, but lack of background or motivation, to apply to your jobs.</li><li><i>Discover</i> good candidates by getting to know your participants through your course, and gaining more information about whether working together would be a good fit (for example, by setting assignments as mini work tests \u2013 though you should likely be transparent if that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing).</li></ol></li><li><strong>Generating knowledge and useful critiques.</strong> People who choose to engage with your course will often have useful, existing expertise. During the course, they will likely provide you with useful critiques through discussion, feedback and project submissions.</li><li><strong>Learning more about the material yourself.</strong> Teaching others is an excellent way to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0361476X13000209?via%3Dihub\"><u>learn more about a topic yourself</u></a>. If you\u2019re still in the process of exploring or figuring out all the details of a topic, creating and teaching a course could benefit you.</li><li><strong>Scoping and discovering important materials that need to be created to explain your field.</strong> Often when designing curricula, we would find that no paper exists explaining the concept we wanted to put across in our course. Mapping out your curriculum helps to identify and scope documents you wish existed, which you could send to people about your field and include in your course.</li><li><strong>Saving your time. </strong>It\u2019s likely that if you\u2019re in a good position to start a course, you are finding yourself having lots of 1-1s where you\u2019re explaining many of the same concepts. A course is a great way to scale knowledge about your field without using up a bunch of your time. To save time, you can forward people who you would otherwise have to speak to 1-1 to your educational materials.</li><li><strong>Community building.</strong> Courses are also a great way to help people find each other. I\u2019ll discuss that in the next section.</li></ol><p>There are of course other benefits to participants, namely feeling more knowledgeable and more empowered to contribute to something they care about..</p><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:620px\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:calc(.5*var(--wp--custom--gap--vertical)) calc(.5*var(--wp--custom--gap--horizontal))\"><strong>Questions to consider: signs you\u2019re ready to run a course.</strong><br>\u2013 Some people have the skills necessary to contribute to your field, and there isn\u2019t a default venue for them to go to already to learn or contribute(or isn\u2019t one that does the job well).<br>\u2013 There is <i>some</i> amount of maturity in the basic ideas behind your field, which you could explain to someone if you had 30-60 minutes.<br>\u2013 It\u2019s taking you too long to explain what your field is about to all the people who are interested in learning about it.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Building Community and Engagement</h2><p>Running a course rarely stops at putting together materials and publishing them on the internet. In fact, if you do that, it\u2019s quite likely nobody will come across the materials, less still get through them all, and your efforts will be wasted. As a reference, the completion rate for Massively Online Open Courses (MOOCs) is around 20%, whilst for AISF it was closer to 80% (though <i>absolute</i> numbers are important to consider, too).</p><p>A good educational course also includes <i>community building </i>and engagement work, for the following reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Social contagion</strong> for your course<strong>.</strong> People who go through the AISF curriculum in their own time online likely heard about the curriculum from <a href=\"https://wdmchamber.org/change-how-to-make-big-things-happen-summary#:~:text=behaviors%20spread%20faster%20when%20multiple%20social%20contacts%20adopt%20them\"><u>more than one peer</u></a>, who each told them it was worth their time to take it. That can only happen if a group of people in a similar network have been through the materials. Engaging with existing communities is a good way to ensure you have a critical mass of early advocates for your course.</li><li><strong>Social and </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_learning\"><strong><u>peer learning</u></strong></a><strong> opportunities. </strong>It\u2019s important that people have someone to discuss the things they\u2019re learning with others. Furthermore, doing a course as part of a group leads to higher completion rates, through setting a social norm to keep going.</li><li><strong>Building networks for next steps.</strong> If your field is at an early stage, it\u2019s likely that there aren\u2019t predefined next steps for people to go onto. Building strong networks of interested people is therefore important because:<ul><li>It supports people in leveraging their existing position to continue to contribute to your field (e.g. a PhD student is able to collaborate with someone they met on the course, even if their professor doesn\u2019t have expertise in your area).</li><li>It may be important later, because when opportunities <i>do</i> emerge there\u2019s a natural network with which to share that, and people can let each other know about opportunities and keep each other informed about the latest in the field.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Setting cultural norms. </strong>If there are cultural norms around your course that are beneficial to set, this can be done best through face-to-face engagement (e.g. being sensitive about information hazards, adopting a growth mindset, being truth-seeking, etc).</li></ul><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:620px\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:calc(.5*var(--wp--custom--gap--vertical)) calc(.5*var(--wp--custom--gap--horizontal))\"><strong>Questions to consider if you\u2019re running a course:</strong><br>\u2013 How can you build a community around your course? Can you: connect people virtually; organise an in-person meetup at the start, middle or end of the course; set the first session as icebreakers/getting to know each other, to make people feel safe before launching into education?<br>\u2013 How can you create social momentum around your course? Can you: get people to post their output on social media; get people to produce materials that they publish and others engage with, which tie back to the course; publish your curriculum online, openly?</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Limitations of field building via educational courses</h2><h3>Imparting fundamental skills takes time</h3><p>It\u2019s likely that the best way you can contribute if you\u2019ve read this far <i>won\u2019t</i> be to teach people the fundamental skills necessary to contribute to your field (e.g. Machine Learning expertise for AI safety, or international relations for certain parts of AI governance, and so on). Teaching machine learning is a full time job for weeks or months, while AISF was 5 hours / week for 8 weeks.</p><p>It\u2019s likely more efficient for you to <i>think hard about your target audience</i> and the requirements for your course. (Remember lesson 1: a space for everyone is a space for no-one). If your course is open to anyone and an undergrad without the necessary skills to contribute takes your course, they still won\u2019t have the skills at the end of the course.</p><p>You could potentially use your course to help people identify their skill-gaps and explicitly motivate or support people in taking next steps to close those gaps at the end of the course.</p><h3>Courses themselves are unlikely to generate interest</h3><p>People will only apply and invest time in your course if they\u2019re <i>already</i> motivated to learn about the topic.</p><p>If there isn\u2019t much interest or basic understanding about your field, it may be better to focus on advocacy first. For example, writing a blog post motivating your field, or giving interesting (but shallow) talks about your field. As an example, most people who took the AISF course had read a book or a few blog posts about AI safety before applying to the course.</p><h3>Online courses are easy to drop out of</h3><p>If you run a course online, be aware that they\u2019re easy to drop out of. The completion rate at BlueDot Impact averaged out at about 75%, but for coursera courses it\u2019s often as low as 20%. In all cases, participants get out what they put into the course, and when courses are online it\u2019s easy to take it less seriously or skip bits that seem optional but to you as the course designer, are important (e.g. the exercises).</p><p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></p><p>Thanks to Adam Jones (BlueDot Impact) and Chiara Gerosa (Impact Academy) for feedback on a draft of this post.</p>", "user": {"username": "j_bernardi"}}, {"_id": "MT89SGdRGESGJXoYK", "title": "EA Donations Experiment Funding", "postedAt": "2024-03-25T09:38:48.348Z", "htmlBody": "<p>TL;DR: I am looking for funding of around $1,000 to complete an effective altruism donations experiment with real money. I think this experiment has implications on how to best spread EA ideas. I am posting on the EA forum to get feedback on the idea and to discover potential funding opportunities.</p><p>As far as I'm aware, not much research has been done on the psychology of effective altruism. A lot of psychology literature focuses on the psychological factors behind charitable giving (see <i>Small et al. - Sympathy and callousness: The impact of deliberative thought on donations to identifiable and statistical victims </i>as an example). I am interested in understanding how <strong>exposure to</strong> <strong>effective altruist thinking impacts actual donations</strong> in a psychological experiment. This would be completed as my master's dissertation at the London School of Economics.</p><h2>Research Implications</h2><p>I believe<strong> the results of this experiment may have implications on how to do the most good</strong>. In Small et al.'s experiment among others, findings show that being made to think analytically about donations reduces donation amounts. If this result holds when considering charity cost effectiveness, <strong>this means that effective giving could backfire</strong>. If this is true, I think it is important to be aware of this when spreading effective altruist ideas, especially to non-typical effective altruist audiences.</p><h2>Experimental Design</h2><p>This is the rough idea for the experiment, however the practicalities (including if any moderating/mediating variables are included) are likely to change through fine tuning with my supervisor.</p><p>The experiment would follow a 2x2 design:</p><ul><li>The first factor would be <strong>effectiveness</strong>, each participant would receive either a cost ineffective charity or a cost effective charity, although effectiveness information would not be present.</li><li>The second factor would be an <strong>EA intervention</strong>, half of the participants would read an effective altruist vignette discussing cost effectiveness, and the other half would receive no intervention.</li></ul><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>Effective</td><td>Ineffective</td></tr><tr><td>No Intervention</td><td><i>\"Any money that you donate will go to the Against Malaria Foundation.

Effective altruists use evidence to find the best ways of doing good, and try to do the most good that they can.</i></p><p><i>Effective altruists are particularly concerned with charitable donations, and claim that we should donate to cost effective charities which save the most lives per dollar. For example, providing malaria bed nets is one of the most effective causes, with an estimated cost of $4,500 to save one life. 'Cause here' is an example of an ineffective cause, with an estimated cost of 'cost here' to save one life.\"</i></p><h2>Prediction</h2><p>Two hypotheses would be tested:</p><ul><li><strong>Hypothesis 1:&nbsp;</strong>Considering the cost effectiveness of giving should <strong>reduce</strong> giving to an <strong>ineffective charity</strong></li><li><strong>Hypothesis 2:&nbsp;</strong>Considering the cost effectiveness of giving should <strong>have no effect</strong> on giving to an <strong>effective charity</strong>.</li></ul><p>These predictions follow from psychological literature on the effect that analytical thinking has on donations (see Small et al.). Of course, it is quite possible that the experimental result differs from the hypotheses, which would nevertheless be useful information.</p><h2>Procedure</h2><p>150 US participants would be recruited from Prolific (preliminary power calculations predict that n=150 would be more than sufficient to detect the same effect size as found in Small et al.). Each participant would be paid $2 for participating in a short unrelated survey. Upon completion, participants will be given a $5 bonus - they will be told that researchers are raising funds for charity, and they will be given of the option of donating a proportion of their bonus to the charity in their experimental condition.</p><h2>What I Need</h2><p><strong>Psychological experiments on donations</strong> <strong>work best with real money</strong>. I doubt I would observe an effect measuring donation intentions given the intention behaviour gap. <strong>I am therefore seeking funding of~$1,000 to complete this experiment</strong> with real money. To reiterate, I think the results of this experiment could have implications on how best to spread EA ideas, and therefore the small cost of this experiment is more than worth it on balance. As such, I am seeking <strong>recommendations for small grants </strong>to apply for. I am considering the EA infrastructure fund but I'm not quite sure that this fits.</p><p><strong>I am also seeking thoughts and feedback on this idea</strong>. I'm an inexperienced researcher, so I'm quite aware that the structure of the experiment could be improved. I'm also interested to know if you disagree with my predictions or if you think the implications aren't as meaningful as I propose. I may also have missed some previous discussions on the same problem.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I am aware of the limitation that I'm only really testing one shot, one option donation decisions, and not <strong>donation reallocation</strong>. However, I propose that the experiment is still meaningful as non-typical EA audiences are less likely to spend time or effort researching charity effectiveness and reallocating donations. Exposure to EA ideas may therefore mean that:</p><ul><li>Present non-effective donations are reduced or cancelled without being reallocated to a more effective cause.</li><li>Future ad-hoc giving opportunities are passed up on due to being 'cost ineffective', but money that would have been given is not allocated to a more effective cause.</li></ul><p>Donation allocation could be tested by offering the choice between two charities in another experiment - however this may require more funding. I am, of course, also interested in hearing your thoughts on this.</p>", "user": {"username": "benmurphy263"}}, {"_id": "4xwWDLfMenw48TR8c", "title": "Long Reflection Reading List", "postedAt": "2024-03-24T16:27:03.242Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This is a reading list on the long reflection and the closely related, more recently coined notions of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forethought.org/ra-exa#:~:text=We%20can%20call%20work,work%20on%20AI%20alignment.\"><u>ASI governance</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TmPSYEdQ6Mrb9oMLA/ai-strategy-given-the-need-for-good-reflection#:~:text=Getting%20to%20the%20basin%20of%20good%20reflective%20governance%20may%20be%20tricky%20(humanity%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20seem%20to%20have%20managed%20it%20to%20date%2C%20at%20least%20in%20anything%20like%20a%20robust%20way).%20It%E2%80%99s%20possible%20that%20AI%20capabilities%20coming%20online%20could%20help%20this%2C%20in%20strategically%20important%20ways.\"><u>reflective governance</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TeBBvwQH7KFwLT7w5/william_macaskill-s-shortform#:~:text=Most%20effort%20to,under%20those%20conditions.\"><u>grand challenges</u></a>.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref1\">I claim that this area outscores regular AI safety on importance<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"afukylc9l0g\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefafukylc9l0g\"><sup><a href=\"#fnafukylc9l0g\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;while being significantly more neglected (and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4rGpNNoHxxNyEHde3/most-problems-fall-within-a-100x-tractability-range-under\">roughly the same in terms of tractability</a>), making it perhaps the highest priority EA cause area.</p><p>I don\u2019t claim to be the ideal person to have made this reading list.

In this article is presented a model of the change of the probability of the global catastrophic risks in the world with exponentially evolving technologies. Increasingly cheaper technologies become accessible to a larger number of agents. Also, the technologies become more capable to cause a global catastrophe. Examples of such dangerous technologies are artificial viruses constructed by the means of synthetic biology, non-aligned AI and, to less extent, nanotech and nuclear proliferation. The model shows at least double exponential growth of the probability of the global catastrophe which means that the accumulated probability of the catastrophe will grow from negligible to overwhelming at the period of a few&nbsp;doubling times of the technological capabilities<a href=\"#_msocom_1\">[1]</a>. For biotech and AI, such doubling time roughly corresponds to the doubling period of Moore\u2019s law and its analogues in other technologies and is around 2 years. Thus the global catastrophe in the exponential technologies world will most likely happen during a \u201cdangerous decade\u201d. Such a dangerous decade could start as early as in the 2020s.

Some of them are natural, others are anthropogenic (Bostrom, 2002; Turchin, 2015). Between the anthropogenic risks, there is a cluster of the global risks connected with quickly evolving new technologies, like biotech and AI. Advances of these technologies result in their democratization, as their price is dropping, and the number of the potentially dangerous individual or organizations which may have access to them (which we will call \u201cagents\u201d) is growing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These \u201cdoomsday agents\u201d or \u201comnicidal agents\u201d were analyzed by Phil Torres (Torres, 2016). Here we will ignore their motivational structure and assume that if an agent has access to a dangerous technology, there is some small probability that the agent will use it in a dangerous way. Torres analyzed the growth of the number of entities capable of creating global risks in Section 2.1 of (Torres, 2018). As the efficiency of any given technology is growing, it is also becoming more capable to cause an accident or to be misused by an \u201comnicidal agent\u201d. However, the most dangerous is \u201crational risk-taking\u201d where adversarial effects are underestimated by the perpetrator.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Sotos suggested a model in which dangerous biotechnologies are an explanation of the Great Filter in the Fermi paradox (Sotos, 2017). In his model, the number of agents, capable to cause a global catastrophe is constant as well as the uniform probability per annum per agent to cause the catastrophe. He used these assumptions to calculate the median life expectancy of a civilization, which happens to be from hundreds to thousand years. But the assumption of the non-progress and stable number of agents is unfounded as technological civilizations tend to quickly evolve \u2013 or, if they fail to evolve new technologies, they will be stuck by resource depletion. Turchin et al suggested in the article about multipandemic (Turchin, Green, &amp; Denkenberger, 2017) that a global catastrophe could happen from the actions of many agents which release simultaneously many non-catastrophic viruses, if the number of agents will increase very quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bostrom recently wrote about \u201cVulnerable world hypothesis\u201d, where the catastrophe is a \u201cblack ball\u201d which an unlucky civilization gets as a result of unexpected technological development (Bostrom, 2018). Manhiem suggested that not a single black ball, but the accumulation of \u201cgrey balls\u201d may result into the existential catastrophe (Manheim, 2018b).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kurzweil wrote that exponential progress in the new technologies is driven by the \u201claw of the accelerating returns\u201d (Kurzweil, 2006), and the whole group of NBIC (nano-info-bio-cogno) technologies is developing at the speed close to Moore\u2019s law with doubling time around 2 years. The progress in the biotech could be measured by lowering the prices of DNA sequencing which even outperform Moore\u2019s law (Honorof, 2013). The progress in the computation and miniaturization is fueling the growth of all NBIC sector.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The doubling period in electronics has declined from 3 years at the beginning of the 20th century to 2 years in the middle of the 20th century, which may be evidence of the double exponential nature of Moore's law at longer distances&nbsp;(Korotayev, 2018). While original semiconductor-related Moore\u2019s law may soon hit the wall in the chip lithographic technologies, the advances of computational hardware is continuing via appearing of specialized chips for AI (Graphcore, 2017). This AI-related hardware is claimed to accelerate above Moore\u2019s law according to the newly coined Huang law which imply 4-10 improvement in GPU in 1 year (Perry, 2018). We could assume that the technological progress in AI and biotech will continue for at least a few decades from now based on a large number of unexplored technological opportunities connected with miniaturization, genetic experiments and AI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The large number of possible technological risks in combination with exponential technological growth suggests that some catastrophe could happen in a relatively short timescale, even before the \u201ctechnological singularity\u201d which appears in some models of the future. In this article, we create a general model of growth of the catastrophe\u2019s probability with the technological progress (section 2), apply it to actually existing risks to get some probable time estimates (Section 3), explore the chance that the global risk could be self-limiting (Section 4) and discuss the ways to escape the technological explosion curse via adequate control systems in the Section 5.</p><h1>2 The model of the catastrophe depending on the number of agents and the speed of the technological progress</h1><h2>2.1 A case of just one dangerous technology and no technological progress</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine a world where a few groups of individuals have access to some potentially dangerous technology.

Pareto distribution is a power law with some coefficient <i>alpha</i>. For US now, the coefficient is around 1.59 (Vermeulen, 2018).

But on early stages exponential growth of the risk of the technology may be always unnoticeable \u2013 or there will be an incentive for an agent to take the risk, even if the agent knows about it, as the agent expects to get an advantage over rivals or have other egoistic cost-effective calculations. For example, when the first nuclear bomb was detonated, there was some probability estimations that it will start the nuclear chain reaction in the atmosphere, but the scientists decided to proceed anyway, as they concluded that Soviets will do the same experiments eventually. &nbsp;</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>P<sub>cat&nbsp;</sub>(T)</i> =<img> <img><a href=\"#_msocom_6\">[6]</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"#_msocom_7\">[XX7]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Figure 3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1-(1\\ -0.0001e^{0.5e^x})^{xe^{0.5x}}</i></p><p><i>Here we see that the catastrophe becomes almost inevitable in just one doubling.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>2.4 A case where technological progress is accelerating</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As we mentioned above, the doubling period is also compressing due to technological acceleration. The Moore\u2019s law has been accelerating from a doubling time of 3 years at the beginning of the 20th century to 1 year for progress in neural nets in the 2010s and DNA sequencing price in 2000s, implying even quicker growth. The growth in compute for neural nets has now doubling time of 3.5 months, implying order of magnitude growth in a year, and NVIDIA CEO Huang declared \u201cHuang\u2019s law\u201d (Perry, 2018) according to which the performance of Graphics Processor Units will from 4-10 times a year, but this law is not taking into account the price performance.&nbsp;</p><h2>2.5 A case where the number of the types of possible catastrophic risks is growing</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Another factor which should be included in the model is the exponential growth of the number of types of possible global risk\u2014the first plausible idea of the technological catastrophe appeared during the dawn of nuclear age, currently we know around 10 main types of hypothetical existential risks, each have a few subtypes, and the number of known risks is only growing. This means that many equations like (2) should be calculated simultaneously for each risk and then aggregated.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If we assume that risks are not mutually exclusive, it simplifies the equation. In that case, the total probability of survival of several independent risks (like nano, bio, nukes, AI) will be:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>P<sub>cat&nbsp;</sub>(T)</i> =<img> <img><a href=\"#_msocom_8\">[8]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is sum enough? Or we need (1- product)?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Different such risks may have different parameters of the speed of growth, for example, nuclear technology is growing slower. If we assume that all risks have the same growth parameters when each year only the number of risks will be growing, this simplifies the equation:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>????</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We also didn\u2019t include in the model the possibility of the risk interactions, which were described by Baum (Baum, Maher, &amp; Haqq-Misra, 2013) and Tonn (Tonn &amp; and MacGregor, 2009) and Hanson (Hanson, 2008). NBIC-convergence also means that the technological progress in different technologies is fueling one another, as, e.g. progress in biotech allows better nanotech in form of, say DNA-origami, and the progress in AI allows quicker progress in all other technologies as it accelerates the speed of the technological discoveries.</p><h2>2.6 Exploring the properties of the model</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The main feature of the equation (2) is that it grows very quickly from just above 0 to almost 1. Even if some exponential assumptions are wrong and are better modelled by linear terms, the probability will still grow very quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In practice, this means that the situation of almost no risk to almost inevitable catastrophe in just a few doublings of exponential growth. An example of such quick growth is the history of computer viruses in the 80s which become almost ubiquitous just in a few years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now let\u2019s look at the behavior of our equations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Table 1.

negligible to inevitable in just 10 years if Moore\u2019s law doubling remains 2 years (other initial conditions define the moment of the start of the quick growth). This means that all catastrophic risks condense into one \u201cdangerous decade\u201d. Equation 2\u2019 gives even a quicker growth with step-like function, where a jump of probability happens in only one doubling or 2 years.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, another double exponential process is human aging described by Gompertz curve <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_function\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gompertz_function</a> This should not be surprising as it has approximately the same dynamics: an exponentially growing number of possible diseases each of which is becoming more exponentially more dangerous in time because of the weakening of the body defense systems.</p><h1>3 Applying the model to the currently existing technologies</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Above, we look at the model on the purely theoretical grounds, but there two main technologies which are currently growing with Moore\u2019s law-like speed and could present global catastrophic risks. It is biotech and AI research. (There are other exponential technologies, which could present global risk, but currently they are relatively weak compared to these two. These other technologies may include nanotech and hypothetical \u201ccheap nukes\u201d.)</p><h2>3.1 Democratization of synthetic biology</h2><p>There is a growing movement of the biohackers who are experimenting with changing the DNA of living organisms. DIY packages for genetic modification are available as well as many other ingredients, information and service which could be ordered from the internet. There is a growing trend of merging between computers and home biolabs (e.g. digital to biological converter by Craig Venter (Boles et al., 2017)).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The progress in biotech is even quicker than Moore\u2019s law. In two decades, the price of genome sequencing failed tens millions of times. The availability of knowledge and instruments, as well as the demand for illicit drugs or self-augmentation, may fuel the biohackers movement similar to the computers hackers who appeared in 1980s and eventually started to create computer viruses \u2013 first for experimenting and later for revenge and income. The number of computer viruses grew 1000 times in the 1980s starting from one in a year, and continue to grow with a million pieces of malware a day 2010s (Harrison &amp; Pagliery, 2015).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The most possible biological catastrophes are not extinction risks but smaller catastrophes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>3.2 Creation of non-aligned AI</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The number of people enrolling in machine learning courses is growing approximately 10 times a year from 2015. The field is advancing and more powerful computers are available individually or for rent. Currently, most AIs are narrow and non-agential, but soon the boom in robotic minds will start, fueled by home robotics, drones and self-driving cars. This increases chances that someone will create self-improving AI, which quickly gains capabilities and may have non-human-aligned goals. The probability of such an event may be distributed unevenly between actors.&nbsp;</p><h1>4 Could smaller catastrophes prevent the large one?</h1><p>The model presented above suggest that there are a few main ways to prevent a global catastrophe:&nbsp;</p><p>- stop the technological progress&nbsp;</p><p>- lower the number of independent agents</p><p>- lower the access of the potentially dangerous agents to the dangerous technologies via some drastic control measures.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>W. Wells (Wells, 2009) suggested that smaller catastrophes are more probable that larger ones approximately 2-3 times and thus non-extinction level catastrophe is the more probable outcome of the civilizational development.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We will define here \u201csmaller global catastrophe\u201d as the one which is capable of stopping technological progress, but not cause human extinction. Similar catastrophes were called \u201cW-risks\u201d by Nell Watson (Watson, 2018), as the civilization may not be capable to restart because of lack of easily accessible resources. In our case, it doesn\u2019t matter if the civilization will be able to rebuild itself or not. We look at the catastrophes that are capable of stopping quick technological progress for a considerable amount of time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The self-limiting factors were explored in case of a pandemic, where increase distancing and death of super-spreaders could limit the impact (Manheim, 2018a).&nbsp;</p><h1>5 Global control system for the prevention of the risks\u2019 explosion&nbsp;</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The obvious way to prevent the catastrophic outcome according to the model is to lower the number of the potentially dangerous agents which have access to the risky technology as well to lower the risks presented by any separate piece of technology.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To lower the number of agents and to increase the safety of technology, some form of a <i>global control system</i> is needed, which will license only a finite number of agents the access to the dangerous technology and ensure that these agents are using the technology according to the established safety protocols, or not using it at all. Such control system needs to be:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Global</i> \u2013 that is, to cover all the surface or the earth and all human space colonies if any appear, without any \u201cexcluded territory\u201d, as such territory would attract potentially dangerous research.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Intelligent</i> \u2013 the system should be able to establish the best safety rules, and also able to recognize any potentially dangerous activity on early stages.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Powerful</i> \u2013 the system should include some law enforcement agency.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There are three hypothetical ways how such a global control system could appear:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1. But the best candidate for such control system is Superintelligent AI based Singleton. However, the creation of the first AGI and establishment of its global domination come with its own significant risks. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Some national states are able to provide the needed level of control inside their border. UN, if it becomes more powerful, could work as a \u201cglobal state\u201d. This could happen if smaller catastrophes will demonstrate the risks of the uncontrollable supertechnologies and different counties delegate their power to something like \u201cglobal risk prevention committee\u201d.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Also, one country could get a decisive strategic advantage over other counties using the fruits of some of the supertechnologies, and establish its global rule which will also include control over possible risks. Such domination may be based on narrow AI advantage, on biotech or nuclear power, but the process of the establishment may look like a world war with all its moral costs and global risks.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What else?</p><h1>References</h1><p>Baum, S.

That led to people thinking about how to make a community one that you want to be a part of, and one in which people feel happy and safe - including, sometimes, wanting some people to leave or change how they interact with the community.&nbsp;</p><p>How to make sure a community thrives seems difficult. For other types of entities, there are clearly defined interventions. A company has a clear mandate to fire people who act against its interests and it\u2019s clear that that mandate should be carried out by managers at that company. Communities are in a pretty different situation.&nbsp;</p><p>There are some community cases which seem reasonably clear - for example, people organising community events should take some care to exclude people who are likely to cause harm at those events. But there are also questions around whether communities should try to take more generalisable action against particular individuals, in the sense of trying to encourage everyone to stop associating with them.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of the discussions I\u2019ve seen around negative events in the community have at least implicitly pushed for coordinated action. Sometimes that\u2019s been in a backward looking way, like wishing SBF had been excluded from the EA community long ago. Sometimes it\u2019s been in a forward looking way: \u2018Are certain types of finance just inherently shady? Should we avoid associating with anyone working in those?\u2019.</p><p>I\u2019ve been feeling kind of angsty about engaging in conversations around this, and have so far had trouble pinning down why. I often think more clearly by writing, which is why I wrote this. I also thought others might have experienced similar internal tension, and if so maybe hearing someone else\u2019s reflection on it could be useful.&nbsp;</p><p>After thinking about it some, I realised that I think the discomfort is coming from the fact that what\u2019s sometimes going on in questions like the above is implicitly \u201cat what point does morality get to tell you to break off a friendship?\u201d.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"slckbajk2h\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefslckbajk2h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnslckbajk2h\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I think I intuitively hate that question. It seems important to me that who I spend non-work time with to be \u2018out of morality\u2019s reach\u2019 \u2013 I think it gets into the domain of what you might call&nbsp; 'sacred values'.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"vvgn596ab5s\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvvgn596ab5s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvvgn596ab5s\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>What do I mean by sacred values?</h3><p>It often feels kind of hard to know what the scope of effective altruism should be, because it feels like nothing is ever enough. But for most people it\u2019s not sustainable to be always optimising every part of life for helping others more.&nbsp;</p><p>A friend of mine resolves that tension by using the idea of \u2018sacred values\u2019. Deciding that something is a \u2018sacred value\u2019 for you means treating that part of your life as something you\u2019re clearly permitted to have, regardless of whether foregoing it would allow you to help others more.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"tunln2ttx09\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftunln2ttx09\"><sup><a href=\"#fntunln2ttx09\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>I don\u2019t think \u2018sacred values\u2019 should be taken too literally. They\u2019re more of a useful cognitive manoeuvre for helping us deal with the weight of morality and how many different ways there are of helping others. Having sacred values might be a way of allowing yourself to dive into doing good effectively in a sustainable rather than overwhelming way. Periodically, in cool moments, you pick which areas to optimise in and which to keep for yourself. Then day to day you don\u2019t have to stress over every possible way of helping others more.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"87thcvdqfm2\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref87thcvdqfm2\"><sup><a href=\"#fn87thcvdqfm2\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p>Sacred values differ between people. For one person, having children might be a sacred value - they simply plan to have children, regardless of whether they could help others more if they didn\u2019t. Another person might feel fine doing a careful calculation of how costly to the world them having children is likely to be, and make the decision about having kids based on the outcome.&nbsp;</p><p>The kinds of things you might take into account when deciding which things you should treat as your sacred values are:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Which things feel most important to you having a flourishing life, or most painful to give up? If you love to travel, and feel like a better person when you\u2019ve learned more by directly exploring other cultures, you might treat \u2018getting to travel\u2019 as a sacred value.&nbsp;</li><li>How much does treating a particular thing as a sacred value trade against your endorsed values? When I was at university I really liked the idea of becoming a librarian. But how I spend the time in my career is likely to make a huge difference to how much I help people over my lifetime, so \u2018choosing my profession just by enjoyment\u2019 doesn\u2019t seem like a good candidate for me to hold as a sacred value.</li></ul><p>Thinking of some things as \u2018sacred values\u2019 has been useful for me in taking the edge off effective altruism seeming to always imply I should be doing more good than I am. One case that has been particularly significant is my diet. I spent quite a few years trying and failing to become vegetarian, and getting very stressed about it. That got much better when one of my vegan friends donated to Animal Charity Evaluators on my behalf with the admonition \u2018now stop worrying about that and do work instead\u2019. It turns out I find eating kind of fraught, and so it\u2019s very helpful for me to mostly put what I eat outside the domain of what I\u2019m morally trying to optimise.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, people are malleable. What feels unacceptable or way too difficult for you this year may not in a decade\u2019s time. I don\u2019t think considering something as a \u2018sacred value\u2019 for you needs to imply it will always be one. Over the long run we might aim to reduce the number of sacred values we have. Maybe someday eating will feel less fraught, and I\u2019ll try to become a vegetarian again.</p><p>Saying that something is a sacred value for you might seem to imply that for that domain, morality won\u2019t be in any way relevant. That doesn\u2019t seem quite right to me - I think it\u2019s more about not needing to optimise. For example, I treat \u2018bringing up my son to thrive\u2019 as a sacred value to me. That means even though it might be better for the world overall for me to try to make sure he grows up to be as altruistic and effective as possible, I don\u2019t aim for that. On the other hand, that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t morally care at all about how he grows up. I\u2019m bringing him up to be happy and kind. I care about whether he seems to care about other people, and try to help them. But I\u2019m thinking about my time spent with him as in a different domain than the one in which I\u2019m striving to maximise impact.&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Friendship</h3><p>Like the other things mentioned above, there are lots of ways your friendships can be better or worse for the world. For example:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Your friends might encourage you in good or bad habits</li><li>A friendship might be particularly supportive&nbsp;</li><li>You might have a bad dynamic that leads to one or both of you being less happy</li><li>You might learn from each other</li><li>People might assume good or bad things about you based on your friend (since people tend to like their friends, be similar to them and support them in conflicts)</li><li>Being friends with a particular person might be beneficial or harmful to your other friends if they\u2019re going to overlap because that person is particularly interesting / kind / obnoxious</li><li>Being friends with someone might make it more likely you end up working together (eg because you know when they\u2019re looking for work, and know what types of jobs they\u2019d be suited for)<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The benefits or harms you might get from a friendship are often going to be predictable rather than surprising. In some cases you\u2019ll be able to tell before you befriend someone whether they have the kinds of values that will likely rub off positively or negatively on you. In other cases you might notice as you spend time together that you keep getting into arguments and it doesn\u2019t seem to be benefiting either of you.&nbsp;</p><p>So like travel / diet etc, friendships do seem to be the kind of thing that morality has things to say about. If you were doing all you could to increase positive consequences and decrease negative ones, you could choose which friendships to take up / nourish / drop based on which were going to have better rather than worse consequences.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Why friendship is a sacred value for me</h3><p>In trying to figure out why I was feeling fraught about questions surrounding \u2018in light of events like the FTX crash, should we consider which people we shouldn\u2019t associate with?\u2019, I\u2019ve been realising how important it feels for me to treat friendship as a sacred value.&nbsp;</p><p>In thinking through why that is, I think it\u2019s relevant how large a part friendship plays in my wellbeing. I expected to spend fairly little time with friends when I had a family, but in fact I\u2019ve instead realised that I very much care about continuing to see my friends despite having a kid. In particular, it matters to me to have close, long run friendships. That makes the idea of allowing consequentialist morality to comment on my friendships feel threatening, as it would if it commented on how to bring up my son.</p><p>I think it\u2019s possible that in some ways it\u2019s a bit less costly for me than typical to have this as a sacred value. The reason is that I find it easier than some people do to separate out my different relationships with people. For example, it\u2019s historically been possible (though still decidedly challenging) to be working closely with someone and for our working relationship to be going pretty badly, but for us to continue being close friends who care about each other and enjoy spending non-work time together.&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Implications</h3><p>You might think that if I weren\u2019t allowing morality to comment on my friendships, you should expect me to have friends with values totally dissimilar to mine, who encouraged me in bad habits etc. That\u2019s not actually the case, and I don\u2019t expect it to become more true over time. \u2018Not intentionally optimising my friendships based on values\u2019 is pretty different from \u2018my friendships have no correlation with my values\u2019. In fact, I don\u2019t feel drawn to hanging out with people who seem mean. I find it interesting talking to people who have useful insights for my work. And I often kind of like having friendships that draw me towards good habits.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, some things affecting my friendships have nothing to do with my values. I form and keep some friendships based on shared hobbies, or having similar dispositions that aren\u2019t related to my values. Other dispositions that draw me to (or repel me from) people are related to my values, but not in ways I particularly endorse. For example, I feel intuitively particularly badly towards people who are callous towards people in their care or who are their subordinates. The&nbsp;<i>extent</i> to which I feel that isn\u2019t in line with my endorsed view of \u2018how people should act\u2019 in terms of how much time people should spend fixing that flaw, or how bad it is compared to other ways one might act badly. Whereas I feel totally unfazed by someone choosing to have a job they don\u2019t think will help others, even though it feels important to me to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>A caveat to all this is that I think that having friendship as a sacred value should be basically about who I personally spend time with and support through difficulties. I do think I should pay careful attention to which people are going to be bad for others in my life. I wouldn\u2019t want to cause people to spend time with others they don\u2019t want to (for example by inviting them to the same gathering). That ends up not being a big issue for me, because I prefer spending time with fewer people at a time.</p><p>The concrete implication of this for my action is that I basically shouldn\u2019t be asking myself \u2018is it moral to continue being friends with this person?\u2019, just like I shouldn\u2019t ask myself \u2018is this a good way to ensure my son becomes an EA?\u2019. That\u2019s so, even though both are valid and important questions.&nbsp;</p><p>I expect this policy to have some personal costs. For instance, maintaining some friendships might make people think I\u2019m too trusting. I also expect it could have some broader costs. It\u2019s plausible that it might be useful for the community to systematically exclude people, not just in the sense of not working at particular companies or coming to professional events, but also in the sense of being ostracised by individual members of the community. I expect not to contribute much towards that because my decisions about people to spend leisure time with won\u2019t be optimised for impact.&nbsp;</p><p>These costs seem worth it to me. I\u2019ve previously been too slow to notice some of my sacred values. I think that\u2019s not just been sad for me but has also sometimes gotten in the way of my helping others as much as I can.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"5\" data-footnote-id=\"iu3ogsr6yil\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefiu3ogsr6yil\"><sup><a href=\"#fniu3ogsr6yil\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If I\u2019m representative in that, it may be helpful for the community to be one where people get to figure out their own limits and what\u2019s sustainable for them in the long term. \u200b\u200bFor me, that includes treating friendship very differently from how I treat how I spend my work time, or allocate my donations.&nbsp;</p><p><br>If this post resonated with you, you might enjoy the book I\u2019m reading at the moment:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Other-Significant-Others-Reimagining-Friendship/dp/1250280915\"><u>The Other Significant Others: Reimagining Life with Friendship at the Center</u></a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"slckbajk2h\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnslckbajk2h\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"slckbajk2h\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefslckbajk2h\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>To be clear, no-one has explicitly suggested to me breaking off a friendship for this reason.

So while our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\"><u>top charities</u></a> list is still what we're best known for, it's only part of our impact; we also dedicate substantial funding and research effort to opportunities beyond top charities.</p><p>In 2022, 71% of the funds we directed supported our four current top charities, and 29% were directed to other programs.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"9suz66hiidh\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9suz66hiidh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9suz66hiidh\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, most of our research capacity goes toward programs other than our top charities.

We believe this is an area in which donations can be especially cost-effective.</p><p>Much of our funding goes to health programs, especially programs that reduce deaths from infectious diseases among young children living in low- and middle-income countries. We've found donations to such programs can make a particularly large impact; babies and young children are much more susceptible to infectious disease than adults, and diseases like malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia can be prevented fairly cheaply. The evidence for health programs is often strong relative to other areas, and it's more likely to generalize from one context to another.</p><p>While the majority of our funding goes to programs that support child health, that isn't our exclusive focus. For example, we also consider programs that aim to improve household income or consumption, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/one-acre-fund-tree-rct-january-2023\"><u>One Acre Fund's tree program</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/bridges-to-prosperity-trailbridge-building-rwanda-may-2022\"><u>Bridges to Prosperity</u></a>. In addition, many of the child health programs we support may also have other benefits, like reducing medical costs, increasing later-in-life income, or improving adult health.</p><p><strong>Why make grants outside top charities?</strong></p><p>Our top charities continue to be our top recommendations for donors who prioritize confidence in their giving. They have strong track records of delivering programs at large scale and the capacity to absorb more funding, and we've followed their work for years.</p><p>We have such&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/criteria#Additional_Criteria_for_Top_Charities\"><u>strict criteria</u></a> for top charities that we'd be limiting our impact if we only recommended funding to them. Some highly cost-effective programs might not meet those criteria, and we don't want to artificially constrain the impact we can have. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/rice-kangaroo-mother-care-november-2022\"><u>r.i.ce.'s kangaroo mother care program</u></a> isn't operating at a large enough scale and we haven't funded it long enough for it to be a top charity. However, we think the program will cost-effectively improve the lives of low-birthweight babies, so we made a grant to support it.</p><p>Initially, our non-top charity grantmaking was confined to incubating new top charities. We had some success with that strategy; for example, we made&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/new-incentives#Our_review_process\"><u>seven \"incubation grants</u></a>\" to support New Incentives earlier in its development before ultimately naming it a top charity. Some of the other programs we fund now might become top charities in the future. But, many of the grants we recommend are outstanding opportunities that we don't necessarily believe will ever become top charities. This might be because the benefits of the program are too uncertain (e.g., deworming) or because the program can't be scaled flexibly enough (e.g., technical assistance provided to governments to support high-quality program implementation until governments can maintain it on their own). We want to support those avenues for impact too!</p><p><strong>The spectrum of opportunities we fund</strong></p><p>Below, we highlight some of the types of opportunities we've supported. These categories aren't mutually exclusive or comprehensive, but give a broad sense of opportunities we recommend.</p><p>Some of our funding goes to interventions or organizations that are newer to us in areas we're already familiar with. For example, two of our top charities (the Against Malaria Foundation and Malaria Consortium's seasonal malaria chemoprevention program) focus on malaria prevention, but we are also reviewing and funding other tactics for preventing malaria, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/PATH-perennial-malaria-chemoprevention-pilot-democratic-republic-of-congo-november-2022\"><u>perennial malaria chemoprevention</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/PATH-malaria-vaccines-January-2022\"><u>vaccines</u></a>. Other funding goes to areas that we haven't been researching as long, like water quality (<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/evidence-action-ILC-july-2022\"><u>here</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/evidence-action-dispensers-for-safe-water-January-2022\"><u>here</u></a>) or maternal and neonatal health (<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/university-college-london-participatory-learning-and-action-january-2023\"><u>here</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/rice-kangaroo-mother-care-november-2022\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p><strong>Incubating new programs</strong></p><p>Sometimes, we read about programs in the academic literature that seem potentially cost-effective but that aren't currently being implemented at scale. With highly aligned partner organizations, we can scope exciting opportunities together, then these partners can pilot and scale the most promising ones.</p><p>We've funded two of these partnerships:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/Evidence-Action-Accelerator-renewal-march-2022\"><u>Evidence Action's Accelerator</u></a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/Clinton-Health-Access-Initiative-Incubator-August-2022\"><u>Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI)'s Incubator</u></a>. We're considering a variety of potential programs across these two partnerships. So far, we've made two grants to Evidence Action for a syphilis screening and treatment program that started within the Accelerator (see grant pages&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/evidence-action-syphilis-july-2022\"><u>here</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/incubation-grants/Evidence-Action-syphilis-aug-2020\"><u>here</u></a>). We've also made&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/clinton-health-access-initiative-oral-rehydration-solution-zinc-bauchi-nigeria-september-2023\"><u>one grant</u></a> to CHAI for a program that distributes oral rehydration solution and zinc for diarrhea treatment; that grant will also support a randomized controlled trial to assess the program's impact.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Funding programs with high expected value but more uncertainty</strong></p><p>Some programs may be as cost-effective as our top charities, or even more cost-effective, but they aren't backed by strong enough evidence for us to list them as top charities (see the second criterion&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/criteria#Additional_Criteria_for_Top_Charities\"><u>here</u></a>).</p><p>For example, we've supported deworming programs for many years, and we estimate them to be highly cost-effective: deworming programs are very inexpensive, and we think there\u2019s a small chance&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming#Developmentalimpacts\"><u>they may lead to large income gains later in life</u></a>. So, we&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/sightsavers-drc-april-2023\"><u>continue to fund deworming programs</u></a> where they look competitively cost-effective, despite our uncertainty about the impact (as described in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2016/12/06/why-i-mostly-believe-in-worms/\"><u>this 2016 blog post</u></a>).</p><p><strong>Strengthening organizations</strong></p><p>It can be hard for nonprofits to raise enough unrestricted funding. We're open to supporting particularly promising organizations to strengthen their own operations (rather than just to carry out specific programs), thus enabling them to have more impact over the long term.</p><p>In April 2023, we recommended a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/ird-global-organizational-support-april-2023\"><u>grant</u></a> to IRD Global for organizational support. We hope this funding will enable IRD to address organizational challenges and propose more work we're excited to fund (we're already funding IRD's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/IRD-global-mCCTs-for-immunizations-february-2023\"><u>program</u></a> to promote childhood vaccination in Pakistan). We similarly recommended an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/incubation-grants/march-2019-evidence-action\"><u>unrestricted grant</u></a> to Evidence Action in 2019, and we've funded several of its programs since then, including the Accelerator and water chlorination programs mentioned above.</p><p><strong>Seizing outstanding one-off opportunities</strong></p><p>Sometimes we make grants to support relatively low-cost opportunities that seem plausibly high-impact but that we haven't investigated as deeply. Our senior grantmakers can collectively recommend a total of up to $10 million in \"small discretionary grants\" each year (more details&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/small-discretionary-grantmaking\"><u>here</u></a>). The case for these grants is often primarily qualitative, like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/oxford-university-spillover-effects-June-2021\"><u>this grant</u></a> for research on the potential spillover effects from unconditional cash transfers or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/agency-fund-fellowships-january-2023\"><u>this grant</u></a> for youth empowerment fellowships.</p><p><strong>Supporting government partnerships</strong></p><p>Some of the opportunities we fund are for technical assistance, in which an organization works closely with the government to support the high-quality implementation of a government-run program. Many of the organizations we fund\u2014including all of our top charities\u2014work with governments in some capacity; but that collaboration is the core of technical assistance programs.</p><p>We've recommended two grants to Evidence Action for a program supporting syphilis screening and treatment in Liberia, Cameroon, and Zambia (see grant pages&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/evidence-action-syphilis-july-2022\"><u>here</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/incubation-grants/Evidence-Action-syphilis-aug-2020\"><u>here</u></a>). Evidence Action works with governments to switch from HIV-only tests to dual HIV-syphilis tests as part of routine antenatal care, and to reliably provide antibiotic treatment when people test positive.&nbsp;</p><p>Switching to a dual test and providing penicillin might seem relatively straightforward, but there are many parts to the process. For example, substantial logistical coordination is required before penicillin can be administered to patients:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The government needs to purchase penicillin from manufacturers.</li><li>The penicillin needs to be shipped to the country, then timely transportation to individual health centers is required to limit stockouts.&nbsp;</li><li>Staff at the health centers need to be trained to educate patients and administer the medication.&nbsp;</li><li>And, finally, patients need to be willing to accept the treatment.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Ministries of Health are often constrained by lack of funding and staff capacity, such that support from partners like Evidence Action is valuable.</p><p><strong>Learning more about programs</strong></p><p>We sometimes make grants in order to learn more about a particular health program. When we find a promising new program, we investigate it before making a grant, but we don't aim to definitively answer every open question; that wouldn't be feasible. Moreover, some programs may be fairly new, may have been implemented only on a small scale, or may have a comparatively thin base of evidence supporting their effectiveness. In such cases, our grants may be aimed at learning more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><i>Funding monitoring and evaluation</i></p><p>In 2023, we recommended a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/miraclefeet-clubfoot-treatment-january-2023\"><u>grant</u></a> to MiracleFeet to implement its clubfoot program. This program is different from most others we fund\u2014it's a health program, but it's for treatment rather than prevention, and clubfoot is a disability rather than a potentially fatal disease. At the time we made the grant, we estimated that MiracleFeet's programs were close to but slightly below our standard cost-effectiveness bar. But we thought that we could learn more as we followed along after making a grant. We wanted to see how many additional children received treatment as a result of the program, so we funded&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/miraclefeet-monitoring-and-evaluation-may-2023\"><u>a monitoring and evaluation grant</u></a> along with the implementation grant in order to specifically address that question.</p><p><i>Funding rigorous trials</i></p><p>In other cases, we fund research, often but not exclusively randomized controlled trials, to generate additional academic evidence about a program. That research can be valuable to us in more confidently deciding which opportunities to recommend in the future, and it also adds to the scholarly literature available on the program.</p><p>For example, in 2023 we supported a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/clinton-health-access-initiative-oral-rehydration-solution-zinc-bauchi-nigeria-september-2023#Learning_value_from_an_RCT\"><u>randomized controlled trial</u></a> to measure how much the use of oral rehydration solution (ORS) and zinc increases when they are provided free to households. We think providing ORS and zinc is a promising way to reduce childhood mortality from diarrhea, but we aren't yet sure how effectively we can increase usage. So, in addition to funding the Clinton Health Access Initiative to implement this program in Bauchi, Nigeria, we're funding an independent evaluation to measure its effects on usage so that we can form a stronger view on the program's cost-effectiveness and consider whether to extend and scale our support.</p><p>***</p><p>For a full view of grants we've recommended, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://airtable.com/appGuFtOIb1eodoBu/shr1EzngorAlEzziP/tblG72bMUu36lrWsr/viwJScgH8B6uRwJ8C?blocks=hide\"><u>this table</u></a>, which is updated as we publish grant pages.</p><p>If you're excited to support programs like these, we recommend our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/all-grants-fund\"><u>All Grants Fund</u></a>, which goes to the opportunities we think are most impactful, regardless of program or location.</p><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"9suz66hiidh\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn9suz66hiidh\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"9suz66hiidh\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref9suz66hiidh\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>This is based on the funding we directly recommended or granted to other organizations from February 1, 2022, to January 31, 2023, as well as funding that we believe was influenced primarily by our research and recommendations.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"sdfsorgs76r\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnsdfsorgs76r\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"sdfsorgs76r\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefsdfsorgs76r\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>See pages 15 and 16 of our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://files.givewell.org/files/GiveWell_Metrics_Report_2022.pdf\"><u>2022 metrics report</u></a>.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "GiveWell"}}, {"_id": "EanypTxCSHhk6Qeup", "title": "What if doing the most good = benevolent AI takeover and human extinction?", "postedAt": "2024-03-22T19:56:36.798Z", "htmlBody": "<p>In the spirit of \u201cDraft Amnesty Week\u201d which I unfortunately missed due to work, I just wanted to post some quick 80/20 thoughts/questions.</p><p>\u201cAI alignment\u201d seems to be the leading Effective Altruism cause area. AI alignment seems to equate to something like \u201cmake sure that we can control AGI/superintelligence completely, that the right people control it, and that we align it with the right/best values, once we determine what those are.\u201d In practice, it seems like we mostly focus on getting AI to reliably do what we want it to do.&nbsp;</p><p>The rationale for this seems to be that AI may be so powerful that it determines the future fate of the world and possibly the universe. If misaligned AI takes over, it may fill the universe with something undesirable, whereas if we build aligned AI, humans can decide what values we want to govern our future and potentially spread across the universe.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, this is \u201cEffective\u201d because even a small chance of success creates tremendous value, and it is \u201cAltruistic\u201d because we are trying to create as much good (i.e. aligned value) as possible.</p><p>The underlying assumption seems to be that aligned means \u201chuman-aligned\u201d, and that human values are good and hence aligning AI to human values (or at least some subset of human values) is a good enough rough proxy for maximizing altruistic value in the universe.</p><p>But what if current human values are in some objective sense extremely sub-optimal? If we were born a few hundred years ago, then we might try to optimize something to do with religious values, and we would use AI to permanently lock in a state where these values could continually be perpetuated throughout the universe. Are we certain that our values now don\u2019t contain similar distortions?</p><p>On a deeper level, due to our evolutionary past, we have a lot of things we value presumably because historically those things were instrumentally biologically valuable for our survival and reproduction as a social species (family, friends, status, things related to sex and sexuality, agency, purpose, etc.); whereas it is possible that if we were able to experience the entirety of qualia-moments in each possible universe in the entire possibility-space of universes in our future light-cone, and then order our preferences from best to worst universe, it seems entirely plausible that the very best universes would be ones which consist entirely in experiences of pure ecstasy across the whole future universe, essentially <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/hedonium\">hedonium</a> (or some other form of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/utilitronium\">utilitronium</a>) tiling the whole universe. Such a universe may have many orders of magnitude<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"9l10fj7yb\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9l10fj7yb\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9l10fj7yb\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;more value than the alternatives, as current human values, and perhaps even values that we can easily evolve to from our current state, may include preferences for certain idiosyncratic features which result in only a tiny fraction of this value being realized.</p><p>So my dilemma is this; if aligning AI means aligning it to our human values and preventing AI from ever completely taking over and maximizing some specific value, then maybe the Effective Altruism mission to \u201cdo as much good as possible\u201d is in direct conflict with AI alignment. AI alignment has a goal of aligning AI with human values. Perhaps the actual Effective Altruism goal should be something like \u201cbuild an EA AI (EAAI), or Utilitarian AI (UAI), designed to maximize good or utilitarian value in the universe.\u201d (I am assuming a utilitarian framework, I am not sure how this would work if you hold a different ethical framework). I suppose that both AI alignment and utilitarian AI still share the preliminary goal of controlling advanced AI, so the difference is not as substantial as it first seems. HOWEVER, I believe this difference may have substantial bearing on HOW AI is controlled. Additionally, these two groups (which may split into yet more subgroups), may feel they are in direct competition to control the AI.</p><p>Another difference seems to be some essential supplemental goals of UAI, namely building a science of qualia and a process for creating hedonium/utilitronium and self-replicating robots to tile the universe, possibly with the help of AI.</p><p>As mentioned in the title, this benevolent UAI would then convert all matter in the universe into hedonium/utilitronium, presumably including humanity, as it would not make sense to leave any value on the table, or risk the possibility that humanity might find a way to reverse the process.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, it is quite possible that this is actually the \u201cbest\u201d possible scenario from a true EA perspective, which seeks to do as much good as possible, even if it challenges us emotionally or leads to surprising and difficult conclusions. EA is the project of doing the most good we can do, using our rationality to figure out what that is and take action to make it happen. This is depressing and frustrating as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ugdFidDgGnD46bkwd/jordan-arel-s-quick-takes?commentId=tuxuo5zhwkGLj9ovo\">I recently vented</a>. &nbsp;I don\u2019t really want to tile universe with hedonium/utilitronium. It doesn\u2019t make me feel good and it is in direct opposition to most of my values. But there is something that is more important to me than my short term desires. It is more important than feeling good or things that are instrumentally, temporarily, or personally valuable. Above all else, I value doing as much good as I can, creating the best possible universe with the most happiness/goodness/love/etc.; with the most flourishing beings, with the best possible outcome from an objective perspective; a universe which if I were to blindly exist at any point in that universe for a given period of time, on average, I would be the most happy that this was the universe that I was born into, and the most grateful to whoever it is that was responsible for creating this universe. Even if I don\u2019t like the immediate consequences, even if it requires me making sacrifices, and even if my parochial values are in contradiction to it, I still want to do as much as I can do, so if this ends up being the correct conclusion, so be it.</p><p>Wondering if others have thought about this problem; what are your thoughts and responses?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"9l10fj7yb\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn9l10fj7yb\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"9l10fj7yb\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref9l10fj7yb\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>One estimate I gave stated that this might be <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ugdFidDgGnD46bkwd/jordan-s-shortforms?commentId=PpBxgExgYMzQSwFz4\">as much as 1 million</a> times as much happiness or value as we ordinarily experience. However, I did not consider future qualia engineering possibilities, nor optimization of utility per unit of matter, which may both be precluded by current human values, and so it is possible that these types of optimization might lead to far greater than six orders of magnitude value more than non-optimized experience.&nbsp;</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Jordan Arel"}}, {"_id": "bRqfjANSmheoAbNaw", "title": "Why The Insects Scream\n", "postedAt": "2024-03-22T19:40:42.232Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Crossposted on <a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/why-the-insects-scream\">my blog</a>. &nbsp;This article was written about the general apathy towards insect suffering, and farming especially, so many of the statements about general indifference are not as applicable to those reading on the EA forum. &nbsp;</p><h1>1 Beneath the giants\u2019 heels</h1><p>The giants ruled the world and</p><p>They reshaped it a lot</p><p>Nature warped beneath their hands</p><p>Vast palaces were built, but not</p><p>Much heed was paid to those below</p><p>Those trampled by their feet</p><p>They didn\u2019t really care to know</p><p>What those tiny beings could be</p><p>One day some giant scientists performed some basic tests</p><p>On those tiny little creatures, who got crushed and squashed and bled</p><p>It turned out those little guys, by the word human, that were addressed</p><p>Could feel, and laugh, and love, and yet their blood was flowing red</p><p>A few especially caring giants wondered what to do</p><p>For these beings that they killed and maimed</p><p>Were, as they said, \u201cjust like me and you.\u201d</p><p>And were screaming out in pain</p><p>They hoped and prayed that this would change</p><p>The way that things were done</p><p>That they could mitigate the insane</p><p>Destruction wrought upon the tiny screaming ones</p><p>They asked those advocating change for giants ill-treated</p><p>If they\u2019d support reshaping</p><p>The practices done to these creatures</p><p>That they were mercilessly razing</p><p>But those progressive giants shook their head</p><p>And in their heels dug</p><p>For though these creatures became dead</p><p>Nothing should be done</p><p>And though the science did suggest</p><p>That they could feel all</p><p>Could morality need one acquiesce</p><p>To the demands of one so small</p><p>Meanwhile, many miles below, the little humans screamed</p><p>They wished that they\u2019d have respite from</p><p>The giant torturous fiends</p><p>\u2014A poem broadly inspired by <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.substack.com/p/killing-the-ants\"><u>this article</u></a>.</p><h1>2 Reasons to care</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Soon, trillions of insects will starve.</p><p>This article is about the mistreatment of insects. I write this knowing that virtually no one cares about insects being mistreated, however badly. I am going to try very hard to get you to care about these creatures that matter, that cry out in agony by the trillions. Yet I recognize most of you will continue to be indifferent.</p><p>Caring about insects is treated as so manifestly absurd that people reject any view implying we should do it, however otherwise plausible. Bryan Caplan thinks we shouldn\u2019t care about animals because if we do, we\u2019d have to care about insects, and that\u2019s clearly crazy (<a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/contra-caplan-on-animals\"><u>his argument is wrong</u></a>).</p><p>And yet the evidence is mounting that <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/welfare-considerations-for-farmed-black-soldier-flies-hermetia-illucens\"><u>insects can feel pain</u></a>, just as non-insects can. The <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/welfare-range-estimates\"><u>most detailed report</u></a> on insect sentience concludes that the ones I discuss in this article, called black soldier flies, feel pain around 1.3% as intently as us. This means that a hundred insects in pain will feel around as much pain as a single human in a similar amount of pain.</p><p>Pain is a bad thing, as anyone who has experienced it knows. Its badness resides not in other things it causes or in one\u2019s higher-order thoughts about it but instead in the raw feel of the experience. Though an insect cannot think about the cosmic injustice of its mistreatment, neither can a baby or a person with a severe mental disability. Yet it is bad when babies and the mentally enfeebled are mistreated, for they can suffer.</p><p>Bentham famously said \u201cThe question is not, Can they reason?, nor Can they talk? but, Can they suffer? Why should the law refuse its protection to any sensitive being?\u201d Insects can neither speak nor reason, yet it\u2019s likely that they can suffer. Thus, as long as one thinks that suffering is a bad thing, they must think there\u2019s at least a reasonable probability that something unspeakable is being done to insects.</p><p>One\u2019s cognitive capacities have nothing to do with the badness of their suffering. If you became very stupid before being tortured, that would not reduce the badness of the torture. Consequently, it would be wrong to ignore the plight of the insects simply because of their lack of intelligence.</p><p>Because of their sheer numbers\u2014<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/how-many-wild-animals-are-there/\"><u>maybe 100 quadrillion earthworms alone</u></a>\u2014if insects can suffer, most of the suffering on earth probably happens to these creatures. Caring about insects, then, isn\u2019t so extreme. It says we should consider most suffering on earth to matter! It says we should think twice before dishing out immense suffering on scores of potentially feeling creatures.</p><p>Caring about insects is inconvenient. It\u2019s a test of how much we care. It\u2019s easy to take morality seriously occasionally, moralizing about those you don\u2019t like mistreating those you can empathize with. Yet insects pose a deep challenge to our morality: are we willing to do the right thing even when it sounds weird, when others make fun of us for doing so, when doing so is inconvenient?</p><p>We mustn\u2019t be blinded to the immensity of a grave horror simply because taking it seriously would require we live differently and would potentially implicate much of our lifestyle. Just as we wouldn\u2019t fry an insect with a magnifying glass or microwave them, we must be sensitive to other ways we harm them. As <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.substack.com/p/killing-the-ants\"><u>Joe Carlsmith says</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Indeed, threatened by the burdens of new obligations, it\u2019s possible greet reductios of this kind with a type of relief. On the topic of the ants, for example, I noticed some sort of relief in relation to the idea that I was already killing bugs when I drove or walked on grass: \u201cNo one\u2019s going to say we should stop driving or walking on grass, right? So killing these ants must be OK, too.\u201d If a candidate norm is seen as <a href=\"https://handsandcities.com/2020/12/12/wholeheartedness-and-morality-as-taxes/\"><u>externally imposed, rather than grounded in something one cares about wholeheartedly</u></a>, one greets evidence that abiding by the norm is impossible or extremely burdensome with enthusiasm, rather than sadness.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>V. If dust-mites were different</strong></h3><p>Imagine a world in which humans were the only macroscopically visible species. For centuries, these humans lived wonderful lives; dancing in the grass, cooking delicious meals over open fires, playing music together \u2014 all under the assumption that they were the only sentient creatures in existence.</p><p>Then one day, a scientist invents a microscope, and begins examining the world with it. She finds, to her surprise, that the surface of everything is covered with a thin film \u2014 invisible to the naked eye \u2014 of something that looks like a civilization all unto itself. The creatures in this civilization are made of a type of intricate slime, but their nervous systems are incredibly complex \u2014 much more complex, indeed, than human nervous systems, and made of superior materials. These slime, it seems, have a kind of art, language, and religion; they, too, engage in a type of dancing. And they do much else besides, which human scientists cannot, at present, understand (let\u2019s imagine that communication remains, for now, impossible).</p><p>What\u2019s more, the humans realize, whenever humans walk or dance on the grass, they crush this slime civilization under their feet; whenever they make an open fire, the slime civilization burns; whenever they pluck the strings of a guitar, slime creatures are thrown into the air and killed. For centuries, they realize, they have been devastating a sophisticated and invisible civilization; with no knowledge that they were doing so.</p><p>What, then, do they do? Do they argue that the slime civilization can\u2019t be worthy of care, because changing practices of dancing, cooking, music-making, etc would be too demanding? Do they start looking for ways to protect and understand the slime? Do they start wondering about future conflicts with the slime? If there was a pill they could take, that would allow them to forget about the slime, and go back to how things were before they had microscopes, would they take it?</p><p>The point of the set-up here is not to force or pressure the humans to give up their beautiful lives, on pain of being bad. They\u2019ve learned something new about the world they\u2019re living in, and the consequences of their actions, but it\u2019s up to them how to respond. The point is that the real world \u2014 the world they\u2019ve always been living in \u2014 stays real regardless. Whatever the truth was about slime art, and religion, and music \u2014 and about the damage that dancing and fires and guitars do \u2014 that truth stays true.</p></blockquote><p>We must not be like the giants.</p><h1>3 The insects are screaming</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don\u2019t know how to help most insects, though I know how to help some. I wish I did.</p><p>Everything we do kills insects. Yet we can\u2019t just do nothing. And it\u2019s not at all obvious if killing insects is bad for them. Insects left alive bring scores of new insects into the world, brought into a world where everything can kill them, where they only survive a few hours or days before <a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/an-open-letter-to-tree-huggers\"><u>dying a painful death</u></a>. For this reason, I, like Brian Tomasik, imagine that humans have, on net, <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/humanitys-net-impact-on-wild-animal-suffering/\"><u>reduced animal suffering and that the typical human reduces animal suffering</u></a>.</p><p>Yet there is one practice humans are currently carrying out that will be bad for insects almost certainly\u2014many trillions of them. And yet no one seems to care much about this.</p><p>The insect farming industry is ramping up, growing in size. To feed farmed fish, we currently farm a few hundred billion black soldier flies. <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/welfare-considerations-for-farmed-black-soldier-flies-hermetia-illucens\"><u>There are around</u></a> 8-16 billion farmed black soldier flies alive at any time. And yet in the coming decades, many tens of trillions of black soldier flies will be brought into existence, farmed, and killed to feed to fish in ghastly, <a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/underwater-torture-chambers\"><u>underwater torture chambers</u></a>. As Barrett reports \u201cEven if only 25% of fishmeal was replaced by insect protein, this represents <i>tens of trillions</i> of additional farmed-insect lives and deaths annually (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ruFmR5oBgqLgTcp2b/insects-raised-for-food-and-feed-global-scale-practices-and\"><u>Rowe 2020</u></a>).\u201d</p><p>Given that trillions of lives are on the line, it\u2019s worth seriously considering how we\u2019re treating those creatures. Tragically though, we treat them basically as expendable byproducts without an ounce of moral consideration. Barret\u2019s report notes:</p><blockquote><p>BSF larvae are reared either in large troughs (of tens to hundreds of thousands of individuals) or, more frequently, in small plastic pans of a few thousand individuals.</p></blockquote><p>Sometimes, little kids mistreat insects in fairly grotesque ways. They microwave them or burn them with a magnifying glass or do something else of similar malevolence. We regard this as quite immoral. And yet this will be the fate of trillions of insects, not fried by a single sadist but instead fried by a sadistic industry.</p><p>The insects are mistreated in exactly the ways a sadistic child might torment an insect. Imagine the horror of a child putting an insect in the microwave and turning the microwave on, so that the insect slowly burns to death. Yet <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/welfare-considerations-for-farmed-black-soldier-flies-hermetia-illucens\"><u>microwaving live insects</u></a> is common. And they\u2019re killed in a lot of other equally cruel ways including \u201cboiling/blanching, oven heating, sand roasting, roasting in sunshine, liquid nitrogen freezing, air freezing, asphyxiation, and shredding/grinding.\u201d</p><p>Imagine what it feels like to be roasted alive in a microwave, your insides heating up, the heat slowly killing you. Or of being ground up alive, a large object beating you against some surface, taking a few times before it kills you, while you\u2019re in the worst agony of your life, all of your organs crushed. This is the fate of trillions of insects. And while they might not be smart, while they might not feel pain as intensely as us, the experience of being microwaved is similarly unpleasant.</p><p>We don\u2019t know exactly what these creatures feel. But that means we should use the precautionary principle. If you don\u2019t know what some being\u2019s experiences are like, you shouldn\u2019t kill trillions of them by putting them in the fucking microwave, to provide food for more tortured beings.</p><p>Oh, and we also starve them.</p><p>An oft-repeated falsehood about black soldier flies is that the adults don\u2019t eat. The industry sure acts like they don\u2019t in that they don\u2019t feed them. So every black soldier fly undergoes a lengthy period of starvation before being killed. Barrett thus notes \u201cCurrent industry practice violates the principle of freedom from hunger, and denies BSFs the opportunity to engage in natural foraging behaviors.\u201d</p><p>Prior to reaching their adult stage, these creatures are fed a horrible, unhealthy diet that makes them sick. Additionally, they\u2019re stuffed in high-density meshed wire. They have minimal ability to move or practice their natural behaviors. Because of these terrible conditions, black soldier flies develop diseases at high rates. They additionally might be genetically modified to be in constant agony in the future.</p><p>Suppose that the earlier estimate is right, that black soldier flies feel pain about 1% as intensely as humans. Assume additionally that half of the suffering\u2014which is a bit broader than pain and means any unpleasant experience\u2014of a person being burned to death comes from the raw agony, and half of it comes from fear, sadness, and so on. Well then, an insect being burned to death or microwaved causes about 1/200th as much agony as a human being burned to death. This means that that ~30 trillion insects being killed annually causes around as much suffering as if 150 billion humans were killed every year. Insect farming, which is done for the sake of propping up a deeply immoral industry, thus causes about as much agony as if every 20 days, every human on earth had the experience of being burned alive. And these are quite conservative estimates.</p><p>If that\u2019s weird to care about, then I\u2019ll take being weird! If snickers of suspicion and people making snide jokes dissuades us from caring about an amount of suffering equivalent to everyone burning to death every 3 weeks, we don\u2019t give a shit about morality. Instead, we care about social norms that we can use to shame other people, masquerading under the banner of morality.</p><h1>4 What to do?</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, what can you do? One thing: donate <a href=\"https://www.insectinstitute.org/\"><u>here</u></a>\u2014these guys are working to stop insect farming (conflict of interest alert: I\u2019m friends with <a href=\"https://dustincrummett.com/\"><u>Dustin</u></a>, who works there). You can also try to get a job working for <a href=\"https://www.insectinstitute.org/careers\"><u>them</u></a>\u2014they\u2019re hiring.</p><p>Insects matter. They matter because they can and do suffer. The fact that they\u2019re not smart, not responsive to morality, and are small and weird-looking doesn\u2019t make any difference to their moral worth. For we are like that to the giants, and yet it would be wrong of them to squash us underfoot.</p><p>Oftentimes, doing the right thing is emotionally salient. When one sees children starving to death, they can see that something deeply wrong is going on. Othertimes, however, doing the right thing isn\u2019t emotionally salient. Other people don\u2019t recognize that doing the right thing isright, perhaps even dismissing it as weird. The good states of affairs being brought about aren\u2019t obviously good, for the creatures being mistreated are too different from us for us to feel much empathy.</p><p>I sometimes hear Christians confidently proclaim that those who don\u2019t believe in Jesus in life will suffer forever in hell. I\u2019m appalled by their jarring absence of moral concern. Can they not see that even those who don\u2019t believe in Jesus matter.</p><p>Yet they have excluded non-Christians from their circle of concern and become mostly indifferent to their plight. Their ingroup is so small it doesn\u2019t even contain most of the human race. Yet most of us are like that. We ignore the majority of beings and the majority of suffering on the planet, for the suffering beings are too different from us for us to feel much empathy.</p><p>Scanlon famously thought that morality was about what rules would have to be reasonably accepted. It\u2019s wrong to kill and maim others, for that rule couldn\u2019t be justified to them. Yet we couldn\u2019t justify ourselves to the insects\u2014those we starve, freeze, and burn, all for minuscule benefit. If, in the afterlife, we are confronted by those insects and asked why we mistreat them so, there is no good answer we will be able to give.</p><p>The screaming insects haunt my dreams. For they scream because of us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Omnizoid"}}, {"_id": "d3BfKtcsjiNzoKYHY", "title": "[Linkpost] Vague Verbiage in Forecasting", "postedAt": "2024-03-22T18:05:54.377Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "trevorw96"}}, {"_id": "As6pjALWyteCjSJu7", "title": "Video and transcript of presentation on Scheming AIs", "postedAt": "2024-03-22T15:56:41.279Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Joe_Carlsmith"}}, {"_id": "fCcSyuEeWnNGHmmnG", "title": "American Acceleration vs Development", "postedAt": "2024-03-22T13:04:56.271Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Progress studies and metascience focus on reforms which will accelerate growth in the US. The US is a small portion of the world\u2019s population and these few are already the world\u2019s most prosperous. Development economics and effective altruism put more effort into <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/social-returns-to-productivity-growth/\"><u>health and growth interventions</u></a> in the developing world.</p><p>There is enough <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/26/nyregion/albert-einstein-college-medicine-bronx-donation.html\"><u>mistargeted philanthropy and state capacity</u></a> to increase the resources committed to both progress studies and EA, so we don\u2019t have to pick just one. But there are always tradeoffs eventually and the comparison is interesting. <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-health-development/\"><u>Global health interventions</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DUlYQTrsOs\"><u>catchup growth in the developing world</u></a> have precisely measured huge benefits. So what justifies the focus on getting the rich richer by accelerating American innovation when there are others who are far more in need?</p><h2>Impact</h2><p>The local benefits of accelerating growth in America are large. Tens of millions of people would directly benefit from cheaper rent and higher wages if we <a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/\"><u>deregulated housing</u></a> in American cities, for example. These large benefits go to people who already have lots of resources, though, so dollar-for-dollar they aren\u2019t as impactful as cash transfers to the developing world. But that\u2019s just the local benefits. Increasing American growth has massive positive externalities on the rest of the world.</p><p>Even small accelerations in frontier growth compounds into large amounts of wealth and resources. Profit seeking investment sends large quantities of this wealth to the developing world. More American growth means more of this investment.&nbsp;From 1982 to 2022 the amount of <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/data/intl-trade-investment/direct-investment-country-and-industry\"><u>direct investment from the US to other countries</u></a> increased by ~30x from 207 billion to 6.5 trillion. The amount of direct investment from the US to India increased 170x over the same period. This is mostly due to the fraction of foreign investment flowing from a larger pool of wealth but <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/BM.KLT.DINV.WD.GD.ZS?locations=US\"><u>investment outflows as a percent of GDP</u></a> also grew from .2 to 1.7%.</p><p>In addition to profit seeking investment, American growth is the largest source of funding for <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.hudson.org/files/publications/201703IndexofGlobalPhilanthropyandRemittances2016.pdf\"><u>philanthropy</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/45472e20-en/index.html?itemId=/content/component/5e331623-en&amp;_csp_=b14d4f60505d057b456dd1730d8fcea3&amp;itemIGO=oecd&amp;itemContentType=chapter\"><u>international aid</u></a>. Frontier growth pays for <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about-us/#:~:text=Our%20main%20funders%20are%20Cari,between%20GiveWell%20and%20Good%20Ventures.\"><u>Open Philanthropy</u></a>, the <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2012/07/26/getting_to_know_theworldbank#:~:text=The%20Bank's%20financial%20reserves%20come,they%20pay%20back%20their%20loans.\"><u>World Bank</u></a>, the <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Where-the-IMF-Gets-Its-Money\"><u>IMF</u></a>, and the <a href=\"https://mptf.undp.org/page/how-united-nations-funded#:~:text=Funding%20sources%20for%20the%20UN,that%20are%20OECD%2DDAC%20members.\"><u>UN</u></a>. If these philanthropic contributions are a constant fraction of GDP, then increasing the US growth rate from 2% to 3% would double the amount that Americans commit to these efforts in 20 years.</p><p>Reforms which increase growth and innovation in the developed world also lead to technological advances that quickly diffuse around the world. The internet, vaccines, automobiles, solar energy, fertilizer synthesis etc. These and other technologies, which were created in the richest countries in the world, are responsible for the lion\u2019s share of welfare gains in the developing world. Accelerating this innovation is a high leverage way to improve lives around the world.</p><p>The paradigmatic examples of the positive externalities of American growth are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox#Costs_and_benefits\"><u>smallpox eradication</u></a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Revolution#:~:text=The%20Green%20Revolution%2C%20or%20the,globally%20till%20the%20late%201980s.\"><u>Green Revolution</u></a>. Both relied heavily on American innovations in medicine or agriculture. Both were funded primarily by the US either through international organizations like the WHO or philanthropies like the Rockefeller foundation. Both of them also required thousands of dedicated people working on development and global health, so a singular focus on American growth would not have been sufficient. But motivation to improve the world by diffusing new medicines and agricultural techniques was not and is not the binding constraint. The binding constraint was the <i>existence</i> of new medicines, agricultural techniques, and the resources required to manufacture them. American growth was and is the best way to address these constraints.</p><p>Interventions in the developing world and US-focused progress studies or metascience do not necessarily trade off with one another. In fact, the great advantage of new institutions, cultural movements, and innovations in the US is that they produce huge positive spillovers to developing countries and the organizations which try to help them.</p><h2>Tractability and Neglectedness</h2><p>Even if American growth is more impactful, it might still be worth focusing on global health and development if these are much easier to improve on the margin.</p><p>Direct interventions like cash transfers or malaria vaccination definitely have an advantage in tractability. These are reliable and precisely measurable ways to save lives and improve the world. Improving long-term economic growth rates, institutions, or innovative capacity in the developing world is far less tractable.</p><p>Accelerating American growth through policy change seems low on tractability and neglectedness. It looks better when you consider that most of the investment in policy changes currently is a zero-sum tug-of-war along one left-right ideological dimension. The recommendations of progress studies and metascience aren\u2019t very correlated with left-right tug of war and can make big changes by \u201c<a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/policy_tugowarhtml\"><u>pulling the rope sideways.</u></a>\u201d The group of researchers and policy advocates pulling in this direction is small.</p><p>Improving growth rates is hard in general, but the tractability of getting more frontier growth and the positive externalities that come with it looks higher in the US than anywhere else in the world for two reasons. First, the US has high state capacity/rule of law so on-paper institutional reforms are likely to be followed and implemented if they can be passed. Second, institutional reforms are sufficient for accelerating growth in the US. Raising the H1-B cap or removing housing regulations in the US, for example, would lead to an instant inflow of skilled workers and a construction boom that would quickly translate into new technologies and productivity growth. Better regulations in Bulgaria or Botswana wouldn\u2019t have the same effect because the demand to move or build there isn\u2019t that high to begin with.</p><h2>Counterarguments</h2><p>Reverse feedback loops</p><p>Frontier growth has big spillovers to the developing world, but there might be big spillovers in the other direction too. Development can create new frontier leading countries and discover new technologies e.g Japan. Although again perhaps the best way to help Japan develop was to make the US powerful and innovative since Japan relied on American power to invest, diffuse tech, and enforce good institutions. It\u2019s also not clear how successful these countries have been in maintaining a world-leading innovation ecosystem. <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/briefing/2023/05/30/its-not-just-a-fiscal-fiasco-greying-economies-also-innovate-less\"><u>Japan\u2019s patenting rate</u></a> has been declining for three decades. There are lots of wealthy, developed countries with little innovative capacity.</p><p>The importance of this counterargument depends on how you think innovation arises. If it\u2019s just about getting the institutions right and starting up feedback loops, then spreading the right institutions and conditions for economic growth around the world is really important. If innovation arises from a rarer, more path dependent combination of institutions, culture, history, geography, etc. then feeding the flame that\u2019s already lit is the best way to improve the world.</p><p>Population growth</p><p>The developed world is aging. Population is the most important input into innovation in our <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/emptyplanet.pdf\"><u>best models of economic growth</u></a>. <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gdp-per-capita-worldbank?tab=chart&amp;country=JPN~ITA~USA\"><u>Japan and Italy</u></a>\u2019s stagnating populations and economies are foreshadowing. Unless fertility trends reverse or AI obviates population as an input into innovation, most of the world\u2019s potential for growth lies in India and Africa rather than in the developed world. This counterargument pulls at least as strongly towards more immigration into the developed world as to development effort in the original countries though.</p><p>The direct focus of progress studies and metascience is almost exclusively on the US, even though the majority of the world\u2019s people and the vast majority of the world\u2019s poverty exists outside of it. This is not due to a narrow moral circle which excludes the rest of the world. A close focus on the institutions and culture of the US is justified even under a wide moral circle because the positive spillovers from increased frontier growth and innovation are so large and the potential for this growth resides primarily in America.</p>", "user": {"username": "Maxwell Tabarrok"}}, {"_id": "Xxo8r7SNXXPvWLmFj", "title": "EA Sweden\u2019s Impact 2023, Plans for 2024, and Current Funding Gap", "postedAt": "2024-03-25T07:26:51.411Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This post draws on insights from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.effektivaltruism.org/our-impact-report\"><u>EA Sweden\u2019s 2023 Impact Report</u></a>, which we&nbsp;encourage the interested reader to read&nbsp;in its full length.&nbsp;The purpose of the report, and this post, is to&nbsp;share and reflect on:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The current state of the Swedish EA community&nbsp;</li><li>EA Sweden\u2019s activities, impact and learnings during 2023</li><li>Our plans for 2024 and current funding gap to realize these plans</li></ul><p>We believe that this post has the most value for 1) People in the Swedish EA community, 2) Other EA community building groups, 3) Grantmakers and individuals who seek to financially support the development of EA community building.</p><h1>Introduction to EA Sweden</h1><p>EA Sweden acts as an umbrella organization for the Swedish EA community, and consists of a 4 people team (3.25 FTEs). We are mostly active in Sweden since we have our comparative advantage here, but act with a&nbsp;<strong>global impact</strong> in mind, which we do in three main ways:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Building a thriving and inclusive community</strong> of epistemically humble people who are ambitious in their altruistic pursuit.&nbsp;We enhance engagement with EA by raising public awareness, ensuring our active presence in spaces where like-minded individuals gather, and organizing events and conferences. Additionally, we maintain a vibrant online presence through our website and Slack workspace, while also providing resources, encouragement, and opportunities for networking.</li><li><strong>Supporting individuals to realize their full impact potential</strong>, mainly through their careers. We do that by providing individual career counseling, in-depth career courses, resources about how one can have an impactful and fulfilling career depending on personal skills and experiences, sharing open high impact opportunities and personal job recommendations as well as supporting people through the job switching process.</li><li><strong>Supporting promising projects to increase their impact</strong>. We do that by providing support with funding applications, fiscal sponsorship and employer of record services, office space alongside other EAs, and strategic and operational support tailored to each project\u2019s or organization\u2019s needs, often crafting a robust theory of change and a structure for goal setting and impact evaluation.</li></ol><p>A visual version of our current theory of change (ToC) can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVN5T4YDA=/\"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>State of the Swedish EA community</h2><p>Below are some of the most noteworthy data points of the current state of the Swedish EA community.

Multiple people in the course took significant steps toward increased impact in their career and, given the promising results, another round of the course started in March 2024, with 25 participants, chosen from 40 applicants.&nbsp;</li><li>The Nordic groups started to&nbsp;<strong>host joint virtual events</strong>, with rotating responsibilities for organizing. In total, 5 such talks and seminars were organized.</li><li>Finally, like in 2022, EA Sweden organized a&nbsp;<strong>3-day retreat for group organizers</strong> based in the Nordics and Baltics. The main objective was to equip the groups with a robust strategy for the year and foster collaborative efforts. A significant highlight of the retreat was the<strong> conceptualization and initial networking for the AI Safety Nordics initiative</strong>, which has since facilitated AI Safety Fundamentals courses for more than 100 individuals and grown to include more than 50 AIS field builders. Additionally, the retreat led to increased collaboration between groups, and laid the groundwork for the coordination calls for the Swedish groups format and accountability sessions rolled out later in the year.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Scaling up our individual career support</h2><ul><li>The number of formal 1-1 sessions held increased from 52 to 96, with 52 unique individuals and 44 follow up sessions. Of these,&nbsp;<strong>at least three people changed jobs to something we deem significantly more impactful</strong>, three people were accepted into impactful programs (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.successif.org/our-work\"><u>SuccessIf</u></a>), and around 50% of the coachees made significant updates in their career plans,&nbsp;<strong>as a result of the counseling</strong>.</li><li>The average&nbsp;<strong>cost per session was reduced by 52%</strong> compared to 2022.&nbsp;</li><li>We implemented a new process for&nbsp;<strong>recommending jobs and program/fellowship opportunities</strong> to individuals we believe are extra well-placed to make a significant positive impact. As this recently was implemented, it\u2019s too early to evaluate the impact of the initiative.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Identifying a model of supporting promising projects</h2><ul><li>After intensive research and conducting small experiments, we have identified a seemingly good model for project support, resulting in:<ul><li>10&nbsp;<strong>funding applications&nbsp;</strong>submitted for promising individuals and projects, of which 3 were successful.</li><li>3 new people using our&nbsp;<strong>Employer of Record services&nbsp;</strong>and 2 projects using our<strong> fiscal sponsorship services.</strong> More have joined at the beginning of 2024.</li><li><strong>Strategic advice</strong> (e.g. theory of change, M&amp;E and goal setting) for ~10 projects, including one new tuberculosis foundation, one Effective Giving initiative, one new Nordic-wide Biosecurity group and one Europe-wide AI Safety initiative.</li><li>15 EA-aligned people are using our&nbsp;<strong>co-working space&nbsp;</strong>at least 2 days a week on average.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><h1>What we are less satisfied with</h1><h2>Gender diversity</h2><p>Even if the inflow of women and non-binary individuals was larger than the inflow of men (64%), and their experience at EA Sweden\u2019s events improved compared to 2022, we still see significant gaps between the genders on both metrics (62/38% men/women and non-binary people in the community and 89/62% feeling&nbsp;<strong>strongly</strong> welcome and comfortable at our events). We think decreasing these gaps would lead to:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>A more&nbsp;<strong>thriving environment</strong> where more people are excited to join and participate in the community.</li><li>More&nbsp;<strong>diverse perspectives</strong> in discussions and projects, especially in heavily male dominated cause areas like AI Safety.</li><li><strong>Reducing the unrealized impact</strong> from women and non-binary that chose to not engage.</li></ol><h2>Our outreach efforts</h2><p>We believe that more effectively reaching people with the will and potential to do a lot of is one of the current main bottlenecks to scale up our impact, including two complementary approaches:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Broad outreach</strong> (e.g. being featured in podcasts and newspapers). This would in the best case lead to both a higher awareness of, and positive attitudes towards, EA among the general public, and make people who feel aligned with EA principles approach the community to engage.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Targeted outreach</strong> (e.g. attending fairs for the relevant target group; partnering with institutions and organizations with the relevant group). While this would not significantly affect the general public\u2019s awareness about EA, or significantly grow the EA community in Sweden, this approach could lead to more people with the potential to do a lot of good to take direct and concrete steps to do so. The heavy tail distribution of impact is an argument for this approach.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>This is something we think we should have invested more resources into during 2023.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Plans for 2024&nbsp;</h1><p>Considering the progress and rooms for improvement mentioned above, we plan to, in addition to continuously improving our core activities, put extra effort into the following four areas:&nbsp;</p><h2>Engaging more women and non-binary individuals&nbsp;</h2><p>With a first strategy in place, and some initial positive results, we will keep investing resources in engaging more women and non-binary individuals and making keep improving their experience of the Swedish EA community. As mentioned above, some planned activities are:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Creating more&nbsp;<strong>comfortable spaces</strong> by hosting meetups exclusive to women and non-binary individuals.</li><li>Actively&nbsp;<strong>highlighting more women who are doing impressive and impactful work.&nbsp;</strong></li><li>More strongly emphasizing our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qUI45mwvAi1ugZ1RYPRBKhcdxff6AmuT/view?usp=sharing\"><strong><u>Code of Conduct</u></strong></a><strong> and</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/14RYQKvpd3zz7VTpZGTemCtOm8W0VA84E/view?usp=sharing\"><strong><u>Speaker Guidelines</u></strong></a> at events and retreats.</li></ol><p>Independently of how significant the results will be, we believe the learnings from these interventions will be valuable for other EA organizations as well. We also plan to keep doing in-depth research of the root causes of the gender imbalance in the community to better understand the problems and update our strategy accordingly.&nbsp;</p><h2>Crafting a high-quality outreach strategy</h2><p>Our current outreach efforts are not based on a thoroughly crafted strategy, which we think is one of the main limiting factors for scaling up our impact. Creating such a strategy \u2013 including how to balance broad and targeted outreach, digital versus in-person activities, and mapping potential strategic partnerships \u2013 will therefore be a key priority in 2024.&nbsp;</p><h2>Scaling up our project support</h2><p>One of our milestones in 2023 was identifying how we can support promising projects in a valuable and effective way. With a seemingly good model in place, we\u2019d like to scale up this support, including:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Reaching more individuals and organizations in need of&nbsp;<strong>employing people on record</strong> in Sweden.</li><li>Reaching more people and projects in need for&nbsp;<strong>fiscal sponsorship</strong>.</li><li>Reaching more Stockholm-based EAs working on independent projects or remotely for an international organization who would benefit from&nbsp;<strong>working from a central co-working space with other EAs</strong>.</li><li>Providing more&nbsp;<strong>strategic or operational support&nbsp;</strong>to promising projects in the Nordics and Baltics (e.g. theory of change, M&amp;E, risk management and setting up processes, systems and organizational structure).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Since most of these aspects are limited by the awareness of promising people and projects and their needs \u2013 or their awareness of the services we provide \u2013&nbsp;<strong>we would greatly appreciate your help</strong> by&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:emil@effektivaltruism.org\"><u>connecting us</u></a> to people and projects you think could benefit from receiving EA Sweden\u2019s support.</p><h2>Increasing our altruistic ambitions&nbsp;</h2><p>While we are proud of our progress in 2023, we believe we could accomplish (a lot) more by being more ambitious. With a good foundation and infrastructure in place and core activities running well, we are excited to explore projects that are at the end of the heavy-tail impact distribution. That is, projects that could have significantly higher impact than our core activities (at least an order of magnitude), even if the projects have a low chance of succeeding. An example of such a project is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://impactacademy.org/future-academy/\"><u>Future Academy</u></a>, which was successfully launched by EA Sweden in 2022. The initiative is now a part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://impactacademy.org/\"><u>Impact Academy</u></a>, co-founded by EA Sweden\u2019s former ED Vilhelm Skoglund. More than increasing EA Sweden\u2019s expected overall impact, exploring other heavy tail projects would also provide valuable learnings for the wider EA community, especially other community building organizations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Funding gap&nbsp;</h1><p>With our current plans, and after implementing reasonable cost-saving measures, we face a <strong>funding gap of \u20ac65,000 (685,000 SEK)</strong>. This gap originates partly from reduced available central funding in the community, and partly from increasingly ambitious plans.&nbsp;</p><p>We believe that we probably can increase our total impact slightly in 2024 (10-20%), even without the additional funding, thanks to a more experienced team and more efficient processes. However, closing the funding gap would allow us to scale up the activities we believe have the most impact (e.g. project and individual career support), significantly improve our strategic foundation (e.g. crafting a superb outreach strategy), and allow us to explore new heavy tail projects.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you\u2019re interested in financially contributing</strong> to realizing this impact, please reach out to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:emil@effektivaltruism.org\"><u>emil@effektivaltruism.org</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We also want to highlight that we are not the only EA meta organization that is in need of additional funding.

In our&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tCq2fi6vhSsCDA5Js/scenario-planning-for-ai-x-risk\"><i><u>previous post</u></i></a><i>, Corin Katzke reviewed methods for applying scenario planning methods to AI existential risk strategy. In this post, we want to provide the motivation for our focus on&nbsp;</i>transformative AI.&nbsp;</p><h1>Overview</h1><p>We argue that \u201cTransformative AI\u201d (TAI) is a useful key milestone to consider for&nbsp;<i>AI scenario analysis</i>; it places the focus on the socio-technical&nbsp;<i>impact</i> of AI and is both widely used and well-defined within the existing AI literature. We briefly explore the literature and provide a definition of TAI. From here we examine TAI as a revolutionary, general purpose technology that could likely be achieved with \u201ccompetent\u201d AGI. We highlight the use of the Task Automation Benchmark as a common indicator of TAI. Finally, we note that there are significant uncertainties on the time differences between when TAI is&nbsp;<i>created</i>, when it is&nbsp;<i>deployed</i>, and when it&nbsp;<i>transforms society</i>.&nbsp;</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>The development of artificial intelligence has been accelerating, and in the last few years we\u2019ve seen a surge of shockingly powerful AI tools that can outperform the most capable humans at many tasks, including cutting-edge scientific challenges such as predicting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/one-of-the-biggest-problems-in-biology-has-finally-been-solved/\"><u>how proteins will fold</u></a>. While the future of AI development is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tCq2fi6vhSsCDA5Js/scenario-planning-for-ai-x-risk\"><u>inherently difficult to predict</u></a>, we can say that if AI development continues at its current pace, we\u2019ll soon face AI powerful enough to fundamentally transform society.&nbsp;</p><p>In response, our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.convergenceanalysis.org/programs/scenario-research\"><u>AI Clarity team</u></a> at Convergence Analysis recently launched a project focused on analyzing and strategizing for scenarios in which such transformative AI emerges within the next few years. We believe this threshold of transformative AI (TAI) is a very useful milestone for exploring AI scenarios. This is due to TAI\u2019s:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Wide but well-defined scope;</li><li>Focus on societal impacts of advanced AI;</li><li>Lack of dependence on any specific form of AI.</li></ul><p>We don\u2019t know what form TAI systems will take, but we can analyze which scenarios are most likely and which strategies are most effective across them. This analysis is important for AI safety. The timelines to TAI should determine our research priorities: if TAI is a century away, we have a lot of time to research and prepare for it. If it\u2019s two years away, we may need immediate and drastic global action to prevent calamity.&nbsp;</p><h1>What is TAI?</h1><p>We\u2019ll start by consulting the existing AI literature to explore various definitions of TAI.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1912/1912.00747.pdf\"><u>Gruetzemacher and Whittlestone (2019)</u></a> identify TAI as a useful milestone for discussing AI policy, pointing out that \u201cthe notion of transformative AI (TAI) has begun to receive traction among some scholars (Karnofsky 2016; Dafoe 2018)\u201d. They argue that the term reflects \u201cthe possibility that advanced AI systems could have very large impacts on society without reaching human-level cognitive abilities.\u201d They do point out that the term is, or at least was, under-specified: \u201cTo be most useful, however, more analysis of what it means for AI to be \u2018transformative\u2019 is needed\u201d. In particular, they define TAI as \u201cAny AI technology or application with potential to lead to practically irreversible change that is broad enough to impact most important aspects of life and society\u201d.</p><p>Similarly,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/where-ai-forecasting-stands-today/\"><u>Karnofsky (2021)</u></a> defines TAI as \u201cAI powerful enough to bring us into a new, qualitatively different future, and in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/direct-approach-interactive-model\"><u>The Direct Approach</u></a> framework developed by the Epoch team, they define TAI as \u201cAI that if deployed widely, would precipitate a change comparable to the industrial revolution\u201d.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K32e2yiSd868e2xd21dWhr3JCEsDMKE9YFSpgDuSQ4A/edit\"><u>Maas (2023)</u></a> surveys the literature more broadly, exploring various approaches for defining advanced AI. Maas identifies four general approaches: 1) form and architecture of advanced AI, 2) pathways towards advanced AI, 3) general societal impacts of advanced AI, and 4) critical capabilities of particular advanced AI systems. For our scenario analysis, we are interested in both the pathways towards advanced AI (which help us understand key variables for scenario planning) and the general societal impacts of advanced AI. Of course, the form of advanced AI and its capabilities will also be relevant to our overall analysis. You can explore Maas\u2019 overview for a comprehensive high-level take on these general approaches.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the approach of understanding the general societal impact of advanced AI, Maas identifies uses of the term \u201cTAI\u201d in influential reports across AI safety and AI Governance. For example, he finds that TAI is the favored term in recent reports from Open Philanthropy and Epoch, as noted above. Maas describes TAI as a definition based on socio-technical change, focusing more on the societal impacts of advanced AI and less on the specific architecture of AI or philosophical questions around AI.&nbsp;</p><p>Maas identifies selected themes and patterns in defining TAI. These include:</p><ul><li>Significant, irreversible changes broad enough to impact all of society; possibly precipitates a qualitatively different future</li><li>Transition comparable with the agricultural or industrial revolutions&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Building on Maas\u2019 themes here, and using the agricultural and industrial revolutions as our loose benchmarks for what would be considered transformative, we define TAI in the following way:</p><p><strong>Transformative</strong> <strong>AI (TAI) is AI that causes significant, irreversible changes broad enough to impact all of society.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This threshold of TAI is related to, but distinct from, other thresholds like artificial superintelligence (commonly ASI) or other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02462\"><u>levels of Artificial General Intelligence,</u></a> AGI. These thresholds generally refer to&nbsp;<i>capabilities</i> of specific AI systems that surpass human capability in most domains, if not all. However, AI could still transform society without reaching those specific milestones. Here are a few examples of transformative AI scenarios that do not require a high level AGI (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02462.pdf\"><u>say level 4 or level 5 as DeepMind defines it</u></a>) or ASI:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>AI automates a large fraction of current tasks, leading to mass unemployment and possible economic chaos.</li><li>Narrow AI revolutionizes energy production and distribution, resulting in an end to scarcity and poverty.&nbsp;</li><li>A totalitarian state uses AI to defeat rivals and maintain an extremely stable dystopian regime.&nbsp;</li><li>A malicious actor uses advanced AI to develop and distribute an incredibly virulent virus, killing nearly all humans.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>These examples don\u2019t require general or super intelligence, but they\u2019re still revolutionary. In summary, AI can be societally transformative without crossing the thresholds of AGI or ASI..</p><h1>Revolutions, Competency, and the Automation Benchmark</h1><p>Above, we\u2019ve focused on various definitions of TAI from the literature. However, there are several related concepts that help further illustrate what TAI is and how we might know when it has arrived. In this section, we\u2019ll explore Garfinkel\u2019s notion of revolutionary technologies, a threshold for TAI identified by Deepmind, and a brief discussion on the most favored benchmark for when TAI will have arrived.&nbsp;</p><h2>Revolutionary Technology</h2><p>What constitutes a&nbsp;<i>revolutionary technology</i>? Garfinkel\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/41989/chapter-abstract/386766686?redirectedFrom=fulltext\"><u>The Impact of Artificial Intelligence: A Historical Perspective (2022)</u></a> considers \u201crevolutionary technologies\u201d to be a subset of the broader category of \u201cgeneral purpose technologies\u201d. For Garfinkel, general-purpose technologies are \u201cdistinguished by their unusually pervasive use, their tendency to spawn complementary innovations, and their large inherent potential for technical improvement\u201d, while revolutionary technologies are general purpose technologies that \u201c[support] an especially fundamental transformation in the nature of economic production.\u201d Garfinkel lists domesticated crops and the steam engine as two particularly noteworthy revolutionary technologies helping to trigger the neolithic and industrial revolutions respectively.</p><p>Garfinkel argues that AI may be revolutionary through task automation, and suggests \u201cnear-complete automation\u201d as a benchmark for when AI would have revolutionized society. Indeed, this threshold is common in surveys of the public and expert opinion. These surveys often frame TAI-arrival questions as something like \u201cWhen do you think AI will be as good as humans at X% of tasks?\u201d, with X ranging between 80 and 100%.&nbsp;</p><h2>Competent AGI</h2><p>We like \u201cTAI\u201d due to its focus on socio-technical impact rather than pure capability thresholds, but measuring capability is still relevant to TAI scenario analysis, especially when AI capabilities are measured in comparison to human performance and societal automation. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02462.pdf\"><u>DeepMind recently provided a useful classification of AGI</u></a> in terms of generality and performance. In particular, they divide AI capability into six levels (and provide narrow and general examples of each, which we\u2019ll omit):</p><ul><li>Level 0: No AI.</li><li>Level 1: Emerging - performing equal to or slightly better than an unskilled person.</li><li>Level 2: Competent - performing better than at least 50% of skilled adults.</li><li>Level 3: Expert - performing better than at least 90% of skilled adults.&nbsp;</li><li>Level 4: Virtuoso - performing better than at least 99% of skilled people.</li><li>Level 5: Superhuman - outperforming everyone.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The DeepMind team write that:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The \"Competent AGI\" level, which has not been achieved by any public systems at the time of writing, best corresponds to many prior conceptions of AGI, and may precipitate rapid social change once achieved.</p></blockquote><p>While the DeepMind team keeps their focus on AGI, they seem to believe that \"rapid social change\" would be precipitated somewhere around the level of \"competent AGI\". This plausibly corresponds to a threshold for TAI. Interestingly, for the DeepMind team, this threshold is not \u201cnear total automation\u201d but rather \u201cperforming better than at least 50% of skilled adults.\u201d</p><h2>The Task Automation Benchmark</h2><p>In our current context, advanced AI systems are becoming increasingly general, capable, and autonomous in ways that are already changing the tasks that are of value for humans to complete. In the past, this change in the nature of task completion precipitated transformative change. It seems natural that TAI will bring about its transformation through the same general mechanism of task automation.</p><p>While neither Garfinkel nor the DeepMind team are explicitly using the term TAI, they are both pointing at AI systems that would be revolutionary and precipitate rapid social change. To assess the presence of this sort of AI system, they both suggest (as did we earlier in this post) task automation as a measuring stick. For Garfinkel this is \u201cnear total automation\u201d and for DeepMind it\u2019s \u201cperforming better than at 50% of skilled adults\u201d which implies significant task automation. For our part, we suggest that TAI could transform society when \u201cAI automates a large fraction of current tasks.\u201d</p><p>Note that the agricultural and industrial revolutions - our guiding historic examples of societal transformation - were both also precipitated by the use of new technology to change the tasks that are of value to complete in the economy. In the agricultural revolution humans began to make use of simple farming tools, often with the aid of energy provided by \u201cbeasts of burden.\u201d The industrial revolution shifted a major source of power and energy away from humans and various land animals to steam and electric powered machines, which mechanically automated swaths of economically productive tasks and generated countless new ones as well.&nbsp;</p><h1>The date that TAI is developed is not the date TAI transforms society, but it may happen fast</h1><p>The date of development of TAI is not the date TAI transforms society, just as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JPan54R525D68NoEt/the-date-of-ai-takeover-is-not-the-day-the-ai-takes-over\"><u>The date of AI Takeover is not the day AI takes over</u></a>\u201d. AI frontier systems are created through a research and development process. With LLMs, this process includes things like gathering, cleaning, and preparing data for training, conducting the training run, fine tuning, narrow beta release, feedback, wide release, then iterating. Frontier systems then serve as a core component to a wide range of applications. These applications are then deployed and used by organizations and individuals, and&nbsp;<i>with time</i>, they change how tasks are performed.</p><p>For AI scenario planning, this&nbsp;<i>with time</i> part is an important component for understanding which particular scenarios may be most likely. In the next post in this series, our colleague&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:zershaaneh.qureshi@convergenceanalysis.org\"><u>Zershaaneh Qureshi</u></a> will explore the literature on the date of arrival of TAI. This literature is, generally speaking, exploring when TAI will be developed. However, the date of development of TAI is not the date TAI transforms society. But, it may happen fast.&nbsp;</p><p><i>It may happen fast because the speed of technological adoption is increasing.</i></p><p>In the past, it has often taken significant time for a new technology to: 1) be widely adopted and 2) become the norm for widespread task completion. For example, here\u2019s a classic S-shaped curve for PC, Internet, and Smartphone adoption from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/groveventures/technologys-favorite-curve-the-s-curve-and-why-it-matters-to-you-249367792bd7\"><u>Medium</u></a>:</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:599px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/asfqtMijjTjggedyD/sbxngjdc81adz5f7ydem\"></figure><p>However, the timeline from when a new AI technology is first developed, then deployed, and then adopted for widespread significant use may be measured in months to a couple of years. For example, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/\"><u>ChatGPT, the popular chatbot from OpenAI, is estimated to have reached 100 million monthly active users in January, just two months after launch, making it the fastest-growing consumer application in history.</u></a>\u201d 100 million users remains a small percentage of people in a world of 8 billion humans, but the adoption line is steep.</p><p><i>It may happen fast because TAI comes in the form of AGI agent(s)</i></p><p>As we have emphasized throughout, TAI may arise without the development of AGI or AGI agents. It may be the case that TAI is achieved through very capable narrow AI systems or various sets of comprehensive AI services. In these cases we might expect fast adoption as with ChatGPT, but with TAI in the form of powerful AGI agent(s) \u201cadoption\u201d is the wrong lens. If TAI comes in the form of AGI agent(s) then the pace of transformation is likely to be a function of the AGI agent\u2019s motivations and capabilities. What does the AGI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/rwkkcgSpnAyE8oNo3/alexander-and-yudkowsky-on-agi-goals\"><u>want</u></a>? What capabilities does it have? Is it capable of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tjH8XPxAnr6JRbh7k/hard-takeoff\"><u>recursive self improvement and resource acquisition</u></a>?&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<i>with time</i> part does matter, but time may be short in the age of TAI.</p><h1>Looking ahead</h1><p>In our team\u2019s next two posts, we tackle these topics in more detail. First, Zershaaneh Qureshi will provide a detailed overview of <i>timelines to TAI</i>. This post will primarily explore the question: when could TAI emerge? Following this,&nbsp;<u>Corin Katzke</u> will explore the topic of AI <i>agency</i>. That is, should we expect TAI to be <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/agency\">agentic</a>?

Our mission is to have a more just, prosperous and supportive society, against the current structure that exploits and alienates our people. We seek transformation through communication, cultural change, political articulation, economic model of cooperatives, intentional communities. We seek to connect and strengthen any and all movements/actions that promote the end of poverty and the progress of humanity.</p><p>Values<br>Individual and collective improvement;<br>Solidarity and cooperation;<br>Science;<br>Freedom;<br>Empathy;<br>Humility;<br>Equity and social justice.</p><p><br>Keep in mind that:</p><p><br>Solidarism is not something to be imposed; instead, it invites those who genuinely identify with and want to participate voluntarily. Selfish individuals who are not committed to cooperation and honesty have no place in the movement.</p><p>As our group grows and our actions advance other groups, companies, institutions, coercive and socially inefficient ideas lose space for our more socially efficient projects.</p><p>We need to organize ourselves, form groups to unite and suppress people's belonging, combat hatred, misery, alienation. Despite appearing to be a reformist movement, this is a transitional ideology, its peak will create the conditions allowed for the elaboration of a future system that could replace capitalism.</p><p>The value of freedom that we defend is a guarantee of coming and going, freedom of expression (which does not imply crimes of racism, hate speech, persecution, etc.), of being able to express your identity, religiosity. We focus on the ideas and objectives that unite us, small differences (of ideas and philosophies) should not undermine our organization, we need to focus on the practical and what is possible.</p><p>Instead of a revolution by force, our strategy is to grow within the current political/economic/social system.</p><p>This is not the elaboration of a perfect solution, but of progress and a possible transition.</p><p>Solidarism is focused on happiness and prosperity, capitalism is focused on greed and accumulation - it is the system that does little for the poor, that exhausts people emotionally and spreads depression.</p><p>Advertising</p><p>One of the most impactful aspects of the capitalist system is the persuasive power of its propaganda. It is notable how most advertising messages directly seek to stir people's emotions, leading them to a state of desire and impulse to consume. Gradually, this constant exposure to advertising influences the way people see the world, making them believe that social status and happiness are intrinsically linked to the act of consuming.</p><p>Advertising has skillfully constructed narratives that urge us to seek personal satisfaction and fulfillment through the acquisition of material goods. It bombards us with messages that associate products and services with positive emotions, such as love, success, belonging, pleasure. This strategy aims to create an emotional bond between consumers and brands, driving a constant cycle of purchase and consumption.</p><p>However, this excessive approach to consumption ends up molding individuals into an individualistic mentality, in which the search for one's own benefit takes precedence over consideration for others and even for one's own emotional health and well-being. Society becomes immersed in a culture of unbridled competition, in which people are encouraged to exploit others and themselves in search of personal advantages, often leading a person to stress, burnout and even depression. This individualistic behavior is harmful both to interpersonal relationships and to society as a whole. The distancing of empathy and cooperation leads to social fragmentation, increasing inequalities and undermining the need for solidarity to face collective challenges.</p><p>We recognize the power of advertising as a tool of influence and communication. However, we try to use it in a completely different way than it is traditionally used. Advertising in our context is a tool to disseminate fundamental values, such as empathy, cooperation, search for the common good, conscious consumption and humility.</p><p>Philosophy<br>Solidarism has a philosophical basis that goes beyond denouncing oppression, social exclusion, imperialism and planned obsolescence. We also seek pervasive philosophies, values and worldviews that encourage a community engaged with diversity, tolerance (within the context of the tolerance paradox), transparency, solidarity, equity.</p><p>Capitalism and its propaganda, as already explained in the previous chapter, promotes an individualistic and oppressive worldview, which values</p>", "user": {"username": "Neimar"}}, {"_id": "agynLdbnurzJ9xsLr", "title": "AI Model Registries: A Regulatory Review", "postedAt": "2024-03-22T16:01:51.865Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This article is the third in a series of ~10 posts comprising a&nbsp;<strong>2024 State of the AI Regulatory Landscape Review</strong>, conducted by the&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.convergenceanalysis.org/programs/governance-research\"><i><strong><u>Governance Recommendations Research Program</u></strong></i></a><i> at&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.convergenceanalysis.org/\"><i><strong><u>Convergence Analysis</u></strong></i></a><i>.

We\u2019ll publish individual posts on our website and release a comprehensive report at the end of this series.</i></p><h2>What are model registries? Why do they matter?</h2><p><i>Note: The phrase \u201cmodel registry\u201d may also often be used to refer to a (typically)&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.phdata.io/blog/what-is-a-model-registry/\"><i><u>private database of trained ML models</u></i></a><i>, often used as a version control system for developers to compare different training runs. This is a separate topic from model registries for AI governance.</i></p><p>Model registries, in the context of AI regulation, are centralized governance databases of AI models intended to track and monitor AI systems usually in real-world use. These registries typically mandate the submission of a new algorithm or AI model to a governmental body prior to public release.&nbsp;</p><p>Such registries will usually require basic information about each model, such as their purpose or primary functions, their computational size, and features of their underlying algorithms. In certain cases, they may request more detailed information, such as the model\u2019s performance under particular benchmarks, a description of potential risks or hazards that could be caused by the model, or safety assessments designed to prove that the model will not cause harm.</p><p>Model registries allow governmental bodies to keep track of the AI industry, providing an overview of key models currently available to the public. Such registries also function as a foundational tool for AI governance - enabling future legislation targeted at specific AI models.&nbsp;</p><p>These registries adhere to the governance model of \u201calgorithms as an entry point\u201d, allowing governments to focus their regulations on individual algorithms or AI models rather than regulating the entire corporation, access to compute resources, or creating targeted regulations for specific algorithmic use cases.&nbsp;</p><p>As these model registries are an emerging form of AI governance with no direct precedents, the requirements, methods of reporting, and thresholds vary wildly between implementations. Some registries may be publicly accessible, providing greater accountability and transparency, whereas others may be limited to regulatory use only. Some may enforce reporting of certain classes of AI algorithms (such as China), whereas others may only require leading AI models with high compute requirements (such as the US).&nbsp;</p><h2>What are some precedents for mandatory government registries?&nbsp;</h2><p>While algorithm and AI model registries are a new domain, many precedent policies exist for tracking the development and public release of novel public products. For example, reporting requirements for pharmaceuticals is a well-established and regulated process, as monitored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in the EU. Such registries typically require:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Basic information, such as active ingredients, method of administration, recommended dosage, adverse effects, and contraindications.</li><li>Mandatory clinical testing demonstrating drug safety and efficacy before public release.</li><li>Postmarket surveillance, including requirements around incident reporting, potential investigations, and methods for drug recalls or relabeling.</li></ul><p>Many of these structural requirements will transfer over directly to model reporting, including a focus on transparent reporting, pre-deployment safety testing by unbiased third-parties, and postmarket surveillance.&nbsp;</p><h2>What are current regulatory policies around model registries?</h2><h3>China</h3><p>The People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) announced the earliest and still the most comprehensive algorithm registry requirements in 2021, as part of its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-internet-information-service-algorithmic-recommendation-management-provisions-effective-march-1-2022/\"><u>Algorithmic Recommendation Provisions</u></a>. It has gone on to extend the scope of this registry, as its subsequent regulations covering deep synthesis and generative AI also require developers to register their AI models.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-internet-information-service-algorithmic-recommendation-management-provisions-effective-march-1-2022/\"><strong><u>Algorithmic Recommendation Provisions</u></strong></a><strong>:</strong> The PRC requires that algorithms with \u201cpublic opinion properties or having social mobilization capabilities\u201d shall report basic data such as the provider\u2019s name, domain of application, and a self-assessment report to an algorithm registry within 10 days of publication. This requirement was primarily aimed at recommendation algorithms such as those used in TikTok or Instagram, but has later been expanded to include many different definitions of \u201calgorithms\u201d, including modern AI models.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/deep-synthesis/\"><strong><u>Deep Synthesis Provisions</u></strong></a><strong>, Article 19:</strong> The PRC additionally requires that algorithms that synthetically generate novel content such as voice, text, image, or video content must be similarly filed to the new algorithm registry.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/generative-ai-interim/\"><strong><u>Interim Generative AI Measures</u></strong></a><strong>, Article 17:</strong> the PRC additionally requires that generative AI algorithms such as LLMs must be similarly filed to the new algorithm registry.&nbsp;<ul><li>Of note, most of the algorithms regulated here were already covered by the 2022 deep synthesis provisions, but the new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/07/10/china-s-ai-regulations-and-how-they-get-made-pub-90117\"><u>Generative AI Measures more specifically target LLMs and allows for the regulation of services that operate offline</u></a>.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>The EU</h3><p>Via the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.euaiact.com/\"><u>EU AI Act</u></a>, the EU has opted to categorize AI systems into tiers of risk by their use cases, notably splitting permitted AI systems into&nbsp;<a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai#:~:text=encourages%20dangerous%20behaviour.-,High%20risk,-AI%20systems%20identified\"><u>\u201chigh-risk\u201d and \u201climited-risk\u201d</u></a> categorizations. In particular, it requires that \u201chigh-risk\u201d AI systems must be entered into an EU database for tracking.</p><ul><li>As specified in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.euaiact.com/article/60\"><u>Article 60</u></a> &amp;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.euaiact.com/annex/8\"><u>Annex VIII</u></a>, this database is intended to be maintained by the European Commission and should contain primarily basic information such as the contact information for representatives for said AI system. It constitutes a fairly lightweight layer of tracking, and appears intended to be used primarily as a contact directory alongside other, much more extensive regulatory requirements for \u201chigh-risk\u201d AI systems.</li></ul><h3>The US</h3><p>The US has chosen to actively pursue \u201ccompute governance as an entry point\u201d - that is, it focuses on categorizing and regulating AI models by the compute power necessary to train them, rather than by the use-case of the AI model.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>In particular, it has concentrated its binding AI regulations around restricting the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/choking-chinas-access-future-ai\"><u>export of high-end AI chips to China</u></a> in preparation for a geopolitical AI arms race.&nbsp;</li><li>As of Biden\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uc7OIykD7hfouFgU4OLcq_L8LBqUuI5c0in3B-6JIG4/edit#heading=h.y9ubn165jrve\"><u>Executive Order on AI</u></a>, there is now a set of preliminary rules requiring the registration of models meeting a certain criteria of compute power. However, this threshold has currently been set beyond the compute power of any existing models, and as such is likely only to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/6330652/biden-ai-order/\"><u>take impact in the next generation of LLMs</u></a>.<ul><li><strong>Section 4.2.b&nbsp;</strong>specifies that the reporting requirements are enforced for models trained with greater than 10<sup>26</sup> floating-point operations, or computing clusters with a theoretical maximum computing capacity of 10<sup>20</sup> floating-point operations per second.&nbsp;<ul><li>For comparison, GPT-4, one of today\u2019s most advanced models, was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.05924.pdf\"><u>likely trained with approximately 10</u><sup><u>25</u></sup><u> floating-point operations</u></a>.</li></ul></li><li>Reporting requirements seem intentionally broad and extensive, specifying that qualifying companies must report on an ongoing basis:&nbsp;<ul><li><strong>Section 4.2.i.a:</strong> Any ongoing or planned activities related to training, developing, or producing dual-use foundation models, including the physical and cybersecurity protections taken to assure the integrity of that training process against sophisticated threats.</li><li><strong>Section 4.2.i.b:&nbsp;</strong>The ownership and possession of the model weights of any dual-use foundation models, and the physical and cybersecurity measures taken to protect those model weights.</li><li><strong>Section 4.2.i.c:&nbsp;</strong>The results of any developed dual-use foundation model\u2019s performance in relevant AI red-team testing.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>How will model registries be used in the near-term future?</h2><p><strong>Model registries appear to be a critical tool for governments to proactively enforce long-term control over AI development.</strong></p><ul><li>All leading governmental bodies have now incorporated some form of a model registry as a supplement to their existing regulatory portfolio.</li><li>In particular, the types of models that each governmental body requires to be registered is a clear indicator of its longer-term priorities when it comes to AI regulation.</li><li>We should expect that additional safety assessments and recurring monitoring reports will be required for models from leading governmental bodies as AI capabilities accelerate.</li></ul><p><strong>The US, EU, and China are pursuing substantially differing goals in their approaches to model registries as an entry point to regulation.</strong></p><ul><li>In China, the model registry appears to be first and foremost a tool for aligning algorithms with the political and social agendas of the Chinese Communist Party. It\u2019s focused largely on tracking algorithmic use cases that involve recommending and generating novel content to Chinese users, particularly those with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/2023/07/10/china-s-ai-regulations-and-how-they-get-made-pub-90117\"><u>\u201cpublic opinion properties\u201d or \u201csocial mobilization capabilities</u></a>\u201d.&nbsp;</li><li>In the EU, AI legislation is preoccupied primarily with protecting the rights and freedoms of its citizens. As a result, the \u201chigh-risk\u201d AI systems for which it requires registration are confined primarily to use cases deemed dangerous in terms of reducing equity, justice, or access to basic resources such as healthcare or education.&nbsp;</li><li>The US government appears to have two primary goals: to control the potential risks and distribution of frontier AI models, and to avoid limiting the current rate of AI development.&nbsp;<ul><li>In particular, it has decided to require registration for cutting-edge LLMs solely based on their raw performance metrics, rather than considering any specific use case, in contrast to both China and the EU.&nbsp;</li><li>Additionally, it appears to be placing a priority on protecting these models from external cybersecurity threats, requiring that organizations report the measures it has taken to protect these models from being accessed or stolen. Given its current position on the export of high-end AI chips and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/chinese-hackers-are-stealing-us-defense-secrets-here-how-stop-them\"><u>its long history with military IP theft</u></a>, it\u2019s clear that the US views the protection of cutting-edge AI models as a national security threat.</li><li>Finally, none of these model registry requirements will come into effect until the next generation of frontier AI models is released sometime in 2024 or 2025. To this point, the Biden administration has cautiously avoided creating any binding regulations that might impede the rate of AI capabilities development among leading American AI labs.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Model registries will serve as a foundational tool for governments to enact additional regulations around AI development.</strong></p><ul><li>Much in the same way drug registries are used as a foundational tool for the FDA to control the development and public usage of pharmaceuticals, model registries will be a critical component for governments to control public AI model usage.</li><li>Model registries will enable the creation and improved enforcement of regulations such as:&nbsp;<ul><li>Mandating specific sets of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/i66PmFYKs9M4fuh6G/ai-regulatory-landscape-review-ai-safety-evaluation\"><u>pre-deployment safety assessment</u></a>s, or certification by certain organizations before public deployment</li><li>Transparency requirements for AI models such as disclosures</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/h48HkP2k9xo8PceZ6/current-regulations-on-incident-reporting\"><u>Incident reporting&nbsp;</u></a>involving specific models and civil liabilities for damages caused by specific AI models</li><li>Postmarket surveillance such as post-deployment evaluations, regulatory investigations, and the potential disabling of non-compliant or risky models</li></ul></li></ul>", "user": {"username": "Deric Cheng"}}, {"_id": "zDfu8biKczyf2QYhW", "title": "Posts from 2023 you thought were valuable (and underrated)", "postedAt": "2024-03-21T23:34:30.065Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I\u2019m sharing:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>a list of posts that were marked as \u201c<strong>most valuable</strong>\u201d by the most people (who marked posts as \u201cmost valuable\u201d in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/eHKhrvBexNtj6ahj2/your-ea-forum-2023-wrapped\">Forum Wrapped 2023</a>), and</li><li>a list of posts that were <strong>most underrated</strong>&nbsp;by karma relative to the number of \u201cmost valuable\u201d votes.</li></ul><p><strong>These lists are not objective or \u201ctrue\u201d collections of the most valuable and underrated posts from 2023</strong>.

Much historical research, whether in academic or judicial contexts, relies on public records, including mundane items like old newspapers.</p><p>Previously, altering records required expensive forgery and was time consuming. Now, AI enables a single individual with malicious intent and access to falsify data easily, especially data that is infrequently used, generally uninteresting, and poorly secured due to funding shortages, often stored by a single entity like a state library.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, Vanuatu\u2014a small island nation affected by climate change\u2014is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/climate/united-nations-vanuatu.html\">pursuing climate justice</a> at the International Court of Justice. The case partially relies on the analysis of old media, newspapers and archival records from the US and other high-emission countries to demonstrate awareness of the changing climate and knowledge of the consequences. This is not to say that in this particular case anything was altered, or that solving climate change in court is the best approach; rather, the point is that establishing some form of truth and reaching an agreement in any framework requires trustworthy data.</p><p>EA, with its research-informed giving strategies, also relies on such data sources. While not always necessary, assessing any historical perspective crucially depends on understanding social discourse. If the underlying data is discredited, many research methods may become obsolete due to the inability to build sufficient trust in the data.</p><p>There is a significant difference between a professional researcher trusting their data source and the end user's trust. Today, trust varies significantly among people with different belief systems and backgrounds. While a researcher, with a likely <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-022-01382-3\">liberal bias</a>, might maintain trust in institutions like libraries, others might be more skeptical. With the prevalence of AI, critics of any study could argue for potential forgeries in raw data by the state or others.</p><p>Decentralization appears to be a modern solution to this problem. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_ledger\">Distributed ledger</a> technology, which is based on mathematics, could serve not only as a means to safeguard data but also to build trust in it. Mathematics, arguably one of the least politicized and most trustworthy sciences, offers a reservoir of public trust we can tap into. While the contemporary world with its digital-first nature, large volumes, and significant noise (already largely driven by AI) may be hopeless to preserve in real time in a trustworthy manner, old records can still be preserved in their current digital form, already collected and partially digitized by libraries and states.</p><p>Examining the feasibility of a decentralized approach, taking the Library of Congress in the US as an example, would require distributing <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/programs/digital-collections-management/about-this-program/frequently-asked-questions/\">21 petabytes</a>. This could be achieved with 20,000-30,000 people with 10TB drives (assuming 10x redundancy), costing $10-20 million for hard drives to start ($50-100 per TB), and then $1-2 million per year (assuming a 10-year lifespan for a hard drive). However, this is just one library in one country.</p><p>While a \"citizen librarian\" model, analogous to citizen science, would be ideal from a decentralization perspective (and have Fahrenheit 451 vibes), it may be unrealistic to expect enough people with the necessary hardware to participate. However, it is not impossible as there are movements that store large databases of books on <a href=\"https://annas-archive.org/torrents\">torrents</a>. An alternative could involve a few hundred diverse institutions: universities, schools, private companies, and possibly even churches and hospitals, specifically chosen to cover the widest range of trust systems.</p><p>The challenge extends beyond merely preserving historical digital materials. It is essential to maintain public trust in their authenticity. While costly, there is still a feasible opportunity to address this issue; otherwise, doubt will always linger regarding the authenticity of what we are looking at.</p><p>I look forward to hearing your perspectives on this matter!</p>", "user": {"username": "Sasha"}}, {"_id": "KufkTYjBDd324XFRS", "title": "Videos on the world\u2019s most pressing problems, by 80,000 Hours", "postedAt": "2024-03-21T20:18:45.105Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Recently, 80,000 Hours has made two ~10-minute videos aiming to introduce viewers to our perspective on two pressing global problems \u2014 risks from advanced artificial intelligence and risks from catastrophic pandemics.</p><p>The videos are available to watch on YouTube:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/qzyEgZwfkKY\">Could AI wipe out humanity? | Most Pressing Problems</a></li><li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/9ZDk0pUkeDg\">The next Black Death (or worse) | Most Pressing Problems</a></li></ul><p>In this post, I\u2019ll explain a little bit about what we did, how we did it, and why.

Our focus is the prevention of deaths of young children from diarrhoea, an illness that kills approximately <a href=\"https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/diarrhoeal-disease/\">444,000 children under-5</a>&nbsp;every year. &nbsp;</p><p>From December 2023 to February 2024, we ran a pilot distribution of low-cost, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2845864/\">highly effective</a>&nbsp;treatments for diarrhoea, oral rehydration solution and zinc (ORSZ) in Kano, Nigeria, with implementation partner iDevPro Africa. We estimate having reached ~6900 children under-5. The intervention, based upon a randomised controlled trial in Uganda (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6345441/\">Wagner et al, 2019</a>), provides free co-packaged ORS and zinc (\u201cco-packs\u201d) door-to-door to all households with children under 5 years old. The distribution is performed by local Community Health Workers (CHWs), who provide guidance and printed instructions on ORSZ usage during the visit.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GqRMqAJFwtTQjDtye/qozdr0ofeb7jmqs8m6ev\"></p><p>We surveyed communities pre- and post-intervention, allowing 6 weeks between ORSZ distribution and follow-up surveys for diarrhoea cases to accumulate. At these survey rounds, we recorded the timing of the child\u2019s last diarrhoea episode (if applicable) and how they were treated (if at all). Our primary outcome measure is the change in ORSZ usage rates pre-to-post intervention, though also we collected extensive contextual data to monitor operations and guide program improvements.</p><p>This post summarises our preliminary analysis and conclusions. A more detailed report is available <a href=\"https://www.clearsolutions.global/pilot\">on our website here</a>. We were kindly supported by knowledgeable advisors, but did not have an academic partnership, nor has this analysis been peer-reviewed. Nonetheless, we believe there is value in sharing our results and learnings with this community.</p><p><strong>Results in brief</strong>: Across 4 wards (geographic areas) of differing rurality, baseline usage rates for under-5s\u2019 last diarrhoea episode in the preceding 4 weeks were reported at a range across wards of 44.7% - 50.9% for ORS and 11.1% - 26.7% for ORS<i>+zinc</i>&nbsp;when asked directly. &nbsp;At follow-up post-intervention, the usage rate for the preceding 4-weeks was reported at a range across wards of 90.0 - 97.7% for ORS and 88.2% - 94.1% for ORSZ. (95% margins of error&nbsp;up to 10pp and are not shown here for readability; see Results&nbsp;for details.)</p><p>Superficially, this indicates a change of 42.0 - 52.8 percentage points (pp) in ORS use and 61.5 - 83.0pp for ORSZ. However, we treat this result with caution, with specific concerns such as social desirability bias in survey responses inflating true values. We discuss more in Limitations below.</p><p><strong>Conclusions in brief</strong>: We consider this to be a solid result in favour of the intervention having a strong potential to prevent deaths in a cost-effective manner in the Nigerian context. (We do not estimate cost-effectiveness in this report, but will be working on a follow-up with that). There are, however, clear limitations in the pilot that warrant considerable down-weighting of our results, though we do not expect this to change the conclusions qualitatively.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Introducing_Clear_Solutions\">Introducing Clear Solutions</h1><p><a href=\"http://www.clearsolutions.global\">Clear Solutions</a>&nbsp;was founded in September 2023 with the support of Charity Entrepreneurship (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cpuFnLtppbsLKcbbq/ambitious-impact-aim-a-new-brand-for-charity#:~:text=TLDR%3A%20Given%20Charity%20Entrepreneurship's%20recent,%2C%20research%2C%20and%20effective%20giving.\">now AIM</a>).

For example, efforts have been made to improve the market dynamics for ORS and zinc, enable health workers, and increase demand from caregivers (<a href=\"https://www.childhealthtaskforce.org/resources/report/2016/progress-over-decade-zinc-and-ors-scale-nancy-goh-joseph-addo-yobo-clinton\">Goh &amp; Yobo, 2016</a>). However, about <a href=\"https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-health/diarrhoeal-disease/\">444,000 children </a>under-5&nbsp;still die from diarrhoea each year, with sub-Saharan Africa suffering a disproportionate burden.</p><p>A 2019 randomised controlled trial in Uganda provided inspiration for our approach as a new organisation in this historied domain. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6345441/\">Wagner et al. 2019</a>&nbsp;found a &gt;30%&nbsp;(19 percentage points) increase in ORSZ usage in communities where ORSZ was provided free door-to-door by Community Health Workers (CHWs), compared to a control of CHWs\u2019 normal mode which included selling ORSZ. Importantly, the ORSZ was provided <strong>free</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>preemptively</strong>&nbsp;(ie, for caregivers to retain for immediate availability when a child suffers diarrhoea). Some earlier academic literature (eg. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3700033/\">Zwisler et al, 2013</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5032344/\">Digre et al, 2016</a>) indicated caregivers were sceptical towards ORS, perceiving it as less like \u201creal medicine\u201d than injections or tablets.</p><p>Cost-effectiveness analyses by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://9475dbf4-555e-4808-9886-5f8ee815cc82.usrfiles.com/ugd/9475db_61985f93081447ad8f3eb28844256696.pdf\">Charity Entrepreneurship</a>,&nbsp;and later GiveWell&nbsp;in their August 2023 <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/oral-rehydration-solution-zinc\">ORSZ Program report</a>, modelled free pre-emptive community distribution. Givewell estimated $2.6K per death averted in Nigeria, with Charity Entrepreneurship ranging as low as $2.1K in Chad and $6.9K average over 8 high burden SSA countries.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Geographic_selection_and_contextual_learning\">Geographic selection and contextual learning</h1><p>Diarrhoeal mortality and existing ORSZ usage rates are major determinants of our impact potential. 5-10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa have the combination of high mortality rates, low ORSZ usage, and large enough population to make sense for our first intervention. After initial exploration of implementing in Ethiopia, Madagascar and Nigeria, we ultimately decided to focus first on Nigeria for reasons of scale, language and partner networks.</p><p>Within Nigeria, we were again guided by mortality and ORSZ usage data at a state level, and applied more practical considerations, with an initial plan to execute \u2018micropilots\u2019 in up to 3 of our shortlisted states, Enugu, Federal Capital Territory, Gombe, and Kano. Our November 2023 visits involved meeting potential partner teams and Ministry of Health representatives to secure support for the intervention and plan for implementation.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GqRMqAJFwtTQjDtye/tsrewxioljalxulfurkr\"></p><p>During visits to Gombe and Kano, we performed focus groups and individual interviews with key stakeholders including caregivers, community leaders, community health workers, and facility health workers. These were valuable in understanding the local context: awareness of, and demand for, ORS was relatively high (contrary to our initial impression from some literature, but possibly as a result of subsequent global health initiatives), but the cost of the ORS itself was cited as significant barriers to regular use. Some participants also indicated that ORS distributed for free may be \u2018diverted\u2019 outside of our intended under-5s usage groups, with demand existing across the full range of age groups.</p><p>We were pleasantly surprised to find that the partner in Kano, <a href=\"https://idevproafrica.org/\">iDevPro Africa</a>, had a window to secure governmental approvals and execute very quickly at a larger scale during December 2023. Thus our plan pivoted to capitalise on this opportunity and we proceeded with the pilot as outlined below.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Pilot_overview\">Pilot overview</h1><p>Six months into this journey, we have preliminary results from our pilot of community distribution of co-packaged oral rehydration solution and zinc (ORSZ) diarrhoea treatments in Kano, Nigeria.</p><p>The pilot ran from December 2023 to February 2024, with ORSZ distributions in 20 communities across 4 wards in 2 Local Government Areas. We estimate having reached ~6900 children under-5, based on distribution and procurement records. Survey staff were deployed before, immediately after, and 6 weeks after distribution to gather operational learnings and enable evaluation of the intervention impact.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/GqRMqAJFwtTQjDtye/tu2aa1cewcfwnmswtsqg\"></p><p>Community Health Workers (CHWs) from the National Primary Healthcare&nbsp;Development Agency <a href=\"https://nphcda.gov.ng/chips/\">CHIPS</a>&nbsp;(Community Health Influencers, Promoters &amp; Services) program - and Volunteer Community Mobilisers, one of its predecessors - performed the ORSZ distribution. The CHIPS agents and VCMs are a volunteer cadre within the overall primary healthcare system and are well known within their communities.</p><p>Over a period of 3-5 days, each CHW visited households in their community and, if they had children under-5 and a caregiver present, the CHW talked them through an ORSZ instructions sheet and gave one ORSZ co-pack (2 ORS sachets, 10 zinc tablets) per child under-5. Households were marked with chalk to help with later identification by survey staff. Paper distribution tracking sheets were used to monitor progress.</p><p>Survey staff visited a random sample of households at Baseline (before CHW visits), without prior knowledge of whether under-5s were present, and later used the CHIPS/VCMs\u2019 chalk markings to identify eligible households for Spotcheck and Follow-Up surveys. A smartphone survey app (SurveyCTO Collect) was used to capture survey results.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Preliminary_analysis_and_results_\">Preliminary analysis and results</h1><p>We performed the following analysis on operational data from the intervention and surveys. Given the absence of peer review or academic partnership, we present just summary-level highlights to avoid implying levels of precision or rigour beyond the practical reality. We calculated our 95% confidence intervals using z-scores (with combined variances for the difference in proportions calculations).</p><p>Operationally, surveys and distribution were divided into 2 stages by location, with work in Ward 1 (Urban Slum) preceding Wards 2-4 (Urban, Peri-Urban, Rural) by approximately 2 weeks to enable operational learnings to be incorporated.</p><p>Data collection was focussed on a primary outcome of change in ORSZ usage rate. We also collected other contextual data, inspired by comparable datasets such as the Demographic Health Survey (DHS) and our benchmark study, Wagner et al. 2019 in Uganda.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Diarrhoea_Prevalence\">Diarrhoea Prevalence</h2><p>One of the first data points we ascertained was the timing of the last episode of diarrhoea suffered by each child under 5 as reported by the caregiver.

Our pilot data seems consistent with our community members' focus groups, in which awareness and usage of zinc were markedly low. It is plausible that differences in the chance of sampling explain the slightly lower zinc usage rates seen in the urban, urban-slum, and peri-urban wards. The significant drop in this rate for the rural ward may be indicative of the impact of rurality on zinc usage.</p><p data-internal-id=\"Wagner_et_al_2019__Uganda_RCT_2019_\"><strong>Wagner et al 2019 (Uganda RCT 2019)</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30677019/\">Wagner et al. 2019</a>&nbsp;study in Uganda captured data for a time block of 4 weeks and is the main benchmark study for our analysis. This study compared four different ORS distribution methods: our comparisons of interest are the \u201cfree and convenient \u201d and control groups.</p><p>The free and convenient group closely reflects our pilot intervention group, with CHWs delivering ORSZ co-packs door-to-door for free prior to a child being ill. The control group differs slightly in that in the Wagner et al 2019 study, this was the \u2018status quo\u2019 where the CHWs sell ORS, zinc and other health products door-to-door once per month. In practice, only a minority of homes were visited each month. Similar services are not present in our pilot setting to the best of our knowledge, though there was some overlap with another free distribution program, <a href=\"https://anrin.org.ng/\">ANRiN</a>, which is currently winding down. We consider the implication of this in the next section.</p><p>The relevant Wagner results are as follows (copied from the abstract):</p><p>\u201cDuring follow-up, \u2026 share of cases treated with ORS was\u2026 <strong>77% (448/584) in the free and convenient group</strong>,... <strong>56% (335/597) in the control group</strong>\u2026 After adjusting for potential confounders, instructing CHWs to provide free and convenient distribution <strong>increased ORS coverage by 19 percentage points</strong>&nbsp;relative to the control group (95% CI 13\u201326; P &lt; 0.001)...\u201d</p><p>In our pilot data, the most conservative increase in ORS usage rate was <strong>43 pp </strong>(unadjusted), a remarkably high value compared to the Wagner et al. 2019 study of <strong>19 pp</strong>&nbsp;(21 pp unadjusted). The Wagner study noted that \u201cthe intervention had a stronger effect among villages with particularly low ORS use at baseline\u201d, and our pilot had a lower baseline (47% - 51%) compared to the Wagner study (56%). However, the magnitude of the difference is too large to be explained by this alone.</p><p>If our results approximate the realities in Nigeria, this is a significant opportunity with the potential for a very cost-effective intervention. However, we carefully consider the limitations&nbsp;of our pilot in a later section and how \u2018discounts\u2019 might be applied to the apparent effect size.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Overlap_with_another_ORSZ_distribution_program\">Overlap with another ORSZ distribution program</h2><p>A nutrition project, ANRiN, also distributed ORSZ within Kano in a period overlapping with our pilot. Upon further analysis,&nbsp;6.5% of the households in our pilot had interaction with both interventions. The urban ward only had one household reporting an ANRiN visit so we excluded this ward from the following analysis. We examined the difference in the proportion of ORS usage (for direct questions) grouped by whether the caregiver reported ANRiN interaction during the 6-week follow-up period.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"background-color:#d9d9d9;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Used ORS</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#d9d9d9;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Did not use ORS</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#d9d9d9;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Proportion using ORS</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#efefef;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Did not interact with ANRiN</td><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">&nbsp;922</td><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">&nbsp;69</td><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><p>93.04%</p><p>&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#efefef;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">Interacted with ANRiN</td><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">&nbsp;90</td><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">1</td><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\">98.90%</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>We performed a chi-squared test on this contingency table which returned a p-value of 0.05075. &nbsp;We do not want to assert any strong statistical conclusions from this given the numerous limitations described in a later section.

This data was collected at the end of the survey. Approximately 2000 ORS sachets were reported used during the 6-week period.</i></p><p>The proportion of \u2018intended\u2019 usage for children under 5 was 79-87%, whilst the \u2018diversion\u2019 rate was 13-21%.</p><p>An ORS sachet or co-pack used for an older child or adult is one that is <i>not</i>&nbsp;available to treat an ill under-5, our target population. &nbsp;The primary basis for our impact evaluation is mortality aversion in the under-5 population. Thus, it is important to understand what proportion of our ORS is reaching that population, the distribution size and frequency necessary to provide good under-5 coverage, and the associated cost-effectiveness impact of the diversion.</p><p>We suspect that the 13-21% diversion rate observed here is likely to be an underestimation&nbsp;of the true rate because the importance of retaining and using the co-packs specifically for children under 5 was emphasised during distribution. Thus, we believe that caregivers were subject to social desirability bias (see \u201cLimitations\u201d section) which may yield an inflated proportion of the socially \u2018correct\u2019 answer, ie. under 5s, not other groups.</p><p>We think it is possible to influence this diversion rate with targeted behaviour change methods, perhaps modifying the CHW messaging or product packaging. This is something we will explore in our future programs.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Limitations\">Limitations</h1><p>There are several limitations, beyond those already described in the body, to the pilot program that are important to keep in mind as we interpret these data.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"Generalisability\">Generalisability</h3><p>Though we examined wards of differing ruralities, this represents a small geographic sample of the state of Kano. Thus, generalisability at a wider level (state, federal) could be limited. Furthermore, we only present summary-level data that are not adjusted for potential confounders.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"Social_Desirability_Bias\">Social Desirability Bias</h3><p>A challenge in evaluating the ORSZ distribution intervention is that we are not able to directly observe treatment taking place, instead providing instruction and later capturing respondents\u2019 treatment reports.</p><p>During follow-up surveys, when a caregiver is asked whether ORSZ was used for the child\u2019s diarrhoea, the response can be subject to social desirability bias as caregivers may be tempted to provide answers they believe will be viewed favourably by others. Furthermore, caregivers may also believe that saying they have used our ORSZ will lead to more being given, or if not used, it may be taken away. We tried to mitigate this through a clear and repeated disclaimer that their response would not change how they are treated in the intervention.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"Repeated_sampling_of_the_population\">Repeated sampling&nbsp;of the population</h3><p>Survey respondents experienced between 1 and 4 interactions with staff from our pilot program (1 CHW and sampling in up to 3 survey rounds), which may have accentuated the social desirability bias. We have tried to mitigate this by not emphasising our origin and purpose of visits, but our data enumeration team found that many caregivers seemed to recognise the enumerators during follow-ups. We believe that this could bias the results more towards giving a \u201cyes, I used ORS\u201d response as caregivers may want to appear appreciative of the organisation that distributed and educated them on the benefits of this product.</p><p>This challenge can be meaningfully mitigated as our scale of operation becomes larger allowing us to sample a smaller number of participants from each community. Ideally, we would run a quasi-randomised design which can provide a more confident result than a pre-post comparison.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"Statistical_Assumptions_Non_adherence\">Statistical Assumptions Non-adherence</h3><p>Our statistical tests are limited by the fact that the survey data does not adhere to the assumption of independent samples. We did not have distinct households in both pre and post-surveys, rather they overlap meaningfully given our high sampling rates. Furthermore, there are inherent correlations of population within the same communities. These factors could lead us to underestimate the true variance of our effect size estimates, resulting in unduly narrow confidence intervals.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"Assumptions_of_pre_post_comparison\">Assumptions of pre/post comparison</h3><p>The nature of the pre/post-test we conducted comes with many underlying assumptions. We elaborate on two assumptions that may be particularly applicable in our context.</p><p>The first assumption is that by attributing all the changes between our pre-group and post-group solely to our intervention, we are implying that no other factors played a role that may have influenced the ORSZ usage rate. The 6-week interval between the two surveys could be considered a relatively short time for major external changes that may impact our outcome. However, one clear example where this assumption does not hold is the overlap with the ANRiN program as mentioned earlier.</p><p>The second assumption is that the activity of the pre-survey would not have impacted the outcome of the post-survey. However, in our context, it seems plausible that more interaction with the program staff (including data enumerators) may act as a behaviour-changing activity. For example, by&nbsp;helping caregivers remember and believe the importance of ORSZ usage for children\u2019s diarrhoea, we might assert additional&nbsp;influence upon the post-survey usage rates for those who were exposed to the pre-survey.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Factors_supporting_a_large_effect_size\">Factors supporting a large effect size</h2><p>We outline above why our results may overestimate the intervention impact and it will be important to generously discount our effect size as a result. However, we also want to provide an alternative perspective that may support the genuineness of our large effect size.</p><p>It was often thought that one of the challenges of improving ORS uptake is people often do not see ORS as of \u2018medicinal value\u2019 and thus limiting its uptake. However, our formative research indicated that the communities we interviewed had positive attitudes towards ORS - so much so that adults would also use this product for various reasons beyond diarrhoea such as for strength, weakness, and dehydration. However, it was also noted that price was the main barrier to using ORS.</p><p>Whilst the above finding raised concerns regarding the potential diversion of our freely provided ORSZ co-packs, this also points to the fact that once the price barrier is removed, a very high usage rate of these products may not seem too far-fetched.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Learning_and_Conclusions\">Learning and Conclusions</h1><p>We are positively surprised by the apparent effect size of the intervention and the operational success that delivered it. We are very aware of the risks that come with surveys as a measure of reality, given recall bias, social desirability bias, and other errors that are impossible to fully remove. Nonetheless, we conclude that the intervention was successful in increasing ORSZ treatment of children under-5, with a \u201cleast favourable\u201d result of 43pp increase (urban ward, high baseline ORS usage), and larger apparent effects in the other wards, for zinc, and for ORS and zinc in combination.</p><p>Diversion of co-packs to other age groups <i>was</i>&nbsp;reported and we consider this an area warranting further analysis and possibly dedicated research. At a reported 79+% of our ORS sachets used for under-5s, the loss would not impact cost-effectiveness unduly; but we must take care to establish a reliable signal for this, given the social factors at play in caregivers admitting usage outside of the target group. We explore possible options in the next section.</p><p>It is also likely that the initially high effect size we observe at the beginning of the program will diminish over time. This could be due to recall, as the novelty wears off, or just a natural phenomenon of behaviour change interventions. Thus, it will be important to understand the frequency and the number of co-packs that need to be distributed to sustain the program.</p><p>We have not yet performed a detailed cost-effectiveness analysis of the pilot: we will cover that in a later post. In the meantime, our general sense is that the pilot was lower cost per co-pack delivered than initially expected given our limited economies of scale. The total program cost (ie. excluding \u201cHQ costs\u201d, mostly co-founder salaries) of the pilot was approximately US$10,000. This includes a disproportionate spend (~50%) on surveying at much higher sampling rates than would be likely at scale.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Next_steps\">Next steps</h1><p>With such promising pilot results, we plan to take measured steps to scale-up, <i>and</i>&nbsp;build upon the learnings to date with operational variants aimed at improving the core intervention.</p><p>An important consideration for our 12-18 month plan is the <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/clinton-health-access-initiative-oral-rehydration-solution-zinc-bauchi-nigeria-september-2023\">GiveWell grant to CHAI</a>&nbsp;for ORSZ distribution and RCT in Bauchi state. With coincidental proximity in timing and geography (neither we nor CHAI knew of each other\u2019s plans until late 2023), we see a great opportunity to bring agility and innovation to optimise intervention cost-effectiveness (we discuss potential avenues below), in parallel to CHAI\u2019s work on proving the foundation with the large-scale RCT. &nbsp;We are optimistic for a fruitful collaboration that increases our collective impact significantly.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"Operational_variants_and_studies_under_consideration\">Operational variants and studies under consideration</h3><p>As we plan for the remainder of 2024, we have ideas for operational variants or studies to improve cost-effectiveness or strengthen impact evaluation.

One aspect of fish welfare involves stunning fish prior to slaughter. The feasibility of stunning depends on the species of fish and physical farm characteristics. In this article, we provide an overview of stunning before slaughter in European sea bass and sea bream aquaculture, one of the largest finfish farming industries in the developed world that does not yet stun most of its production. Sea bass and sea bream stunning necessitates the use of electrical stunning equipment aboard harvest vessels, often a significant distance from the shoreline; this presents an interesting engineering and policy challenge. Together, T\u00fcrkiye, Greece, Spain, and Italy produced over 400,000 t of sea bass and sea bream in 2020. In T\u00fcrkiye and Greece, farms are numerous and located very close to the shoreline. In Spain and Italy, farms are few and located far from the shoreline. The highest average production is found in farms from T\u00fcrkiye (1,000 t) and Spain (1,300 t, and lower average production is found in Greece (300 t) and Italy (350 t). Producer progress towards the installation of electrical stunning appears comparatively well-developed for T\u00fcrkiye, Spain, and Greece, though we emphasise that producers and other stakeholders require continued support to realise this opportunity. Producers in Italy appear slower to make progress on this aspect of animal welfare and may require additional support.</p><h1><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h1><p>The concept of animal welfare is emerging as an increasingly important aspect of sustainable food systems (United Nations Environment Programme, 2019; Coghlan et al., 2021). In many countries, increasing consumer concern for animal welfare is driving retailer commitments and government legislation that aim to improve the lives of animals farmed for food (Alonso et al., 2020; Albalat et al., 2022; Wahltinez et al., 2022; Wickens, 2022). These policies are increasingly targeted at aquatic animals in particular (Ashley, 2007; Stien et al., 2020; Crump et al., 2022). By scale, fish constitute one of the most numerous groups of farmed animals, exceeding even the number of farmed chickens and pigs and behind only farmed invertebrates (Romero Waldhorn and Autric, 2022; Klaura et al., 2023; Mood et al., 2023). As such, initiatives that aim to improve the lives of farmed fish can cause large overall benefits in the lives of animals.</p><p>Fish welfare interventions typically target one of three periods during the lives of farmed fish. Interventions can target the welfare of fish during breeding (the breeding stock or the juveniles) (Grimsrud et al., 2013; T\u00f8rud et al., 2019), the welfare of fish on-farm during the grow-out period (Pettersen et al., 2014; Stien et al., 2020), or the welfare of fish at slaughter (Lines and Spence, 2012; European Commission, 2017; Clemente et al., 2023).</p><p>One tractable way to improve the welfare of fish at slaughter is to stun fish before slaughter. Stunning involves rendering fish insensible, thus reducing the amount of suffering experienced by the fish when killed (Lines and Spence, 2012). Fish farming industries in many countries have made progress in implementing stunning before slaughter. However, one of the largest finfish farming industries that has not yet made significant progress in implementing stunning before slaughter is the European sea bass and sea bream farming industry.</p><p>In Europe, sea bass and sea bream are farmed along the Mediterranean coast. The countries with the highest production of sea bass and sea bream are T\u00fcrkiye, Greece, Spain, and Italy (Table 1). T\u00fcrkiye and Greece each have several hundred farms, while Spain and Italy have only 24 farms each. The farms in T\u00fcrkiye and Spain tend to have larger production volumes per farm, while the industries in Greece and Italy tend to be dispersed with farms having smaller production volumes.</p><p>Before turning to the details of humane slaughter, it helps to give a brief overview of the industry structure in these four countries. In T\u00fcrkiye, 257,000 t of sea bass and sea bream are produced by 237 mostly large-scale sea cage farms and 173 mostly small-scale earthen pond farms (\u00c7oban et al., 2020). In T\u00fcrkiye, there are fish farms along the western and southern coastlines with the Mediterranean and the northern coastline with the Black Sea. In Greece, 100,000 t of sea bass and sea bream are produced by 347 sea cage farms (European Commission, n.d.). The eastern coastline appears to be more important, with many farms clustered within just a few hundred kilometres of Athens. Sea bass and sea bream farms in Greece are farmed using inshore floating sea cages (Pavlidis and Mylonas, 2011). In Spain and Italy, the farms are located along the length of the countries' coastlines with the Mediterranean. In Spain, 35,000 t of sea bass and sea bream are produced by 24 sea cage farms (Fishcount, 2017; Nielsen et al., 2021).&nbsp; In Italy, 14,000 t of sea bass and sea bream are produced by 24 sea cage farms. This equates to an average production per farm of 250 t (Italy - Eurofish.dk, n.d.; Hofherr et al., 2015; WWF, 2021). Spanish and Italian farms also mostly use floating sea cages, though a minority of production takes place in wetlands/brackish water (Nielsen et al., 2021).</p><p>When it comes to distance from shore, these four countries can be divided into two pairs (Figure 1A). Greece and T\u00fcrkiye tend to have fish farms very close to the shoreline. Half of Greece's fish farms are located within 170 metres of the shoreline, while half of T\u00fcrkiye's fish farms are located within 180 metres of the coastline (Hofherr et al., 2015). In contrast, Italy and Spain tend to have fish farms much further from the shoreline. Half of all fish farms in Italy are located within 990 metres from the coastline, while half of Spain's fish farms are located within 1,600 metres of the shoreline (Hofherr et al., 2015). The distance from shoreline determines the geographical and wave dynamics of farms, which in turn influences the technology and equipment that farmers can adopt.

Humane slaughter of sea bass and sea bream</strong></h1><h2><i>2.1 Electrical stunning before slaughter</i></h2><p>Today, almost all sea bass and sea bream are slaughtered by live chilling in ice or ice slurry, followed by a gill cut (European Commission, 2017). During live chilling, fish generally remain conscious for between 5 and 40 minutes and display signs of suffering, including vigorous escape attempts (Van De Vis et al., 2003; Simitzis et al., 2013; Zampacavallo et al., 2015; de la Rosa et al., 2021). Brain activity continues even after fish become immobile (Lines and Spence, 2012).</p><p>During slaughter, animal welfare can be improved by stunning. Electrical stunning involves rendering fish unconscious using an electric current. Studies indicate that electrical stunning causes sea bass and sea bream to immediately become unconscious and lose sensibility (Giuffrida et al., 2007; Lambooij et al., 2007; Zampacavallo et al., 2015) (Panel on Animal Health and Welfare, 2009). It is important that stunning parameters (e.g. current and duration) are carefully selected, especially with reference to the method of electrical stunning, the handling method, and the subsequent killing method. Greater efficacy is generally achieved with higher currents and a longer duration (Robb et al., 2002; Lines et al., 2003; Jung-Schroers et al., 2020).</p><p>Electrical stunning can involve one of two methods: in-water and in-air. For in-water electrical stunning, fish are transported to a tank in batches using brailing and then exposed to the electrical field. Alternatively, fish can be captured using a pump and passed along a channel through which an electrical current is generated (Lines et al., 2003). In-air stunning is also possible but introduces the requirement to dewater the fish prior to stunning. Currently, producers of electrical stunning equipment for sea bass and sea bream include the UK-based company Ace Aquatec (in-water stunning), the Norway-based company Optimar (dry stunning), and the T\u00fcrkiye-based company Smilefish.</p><p>The other major category of fish stunning is percussive slaughter. Percussive slaughter is not recommended for small fish, which includes sea bass and sea bream. This is because percussive stunning requires accuracy to be consistently maintained over time, which is difficult for small fish in a commercial setting (de la Rosa et al., 2021).</p><h2><i>2.2 Current uptake of humane slaughter</i></h2><p>Many Mediterranean sea bass and sea bream producers have expressed an interest in implementing electrical stunning. Currently, progress appears relatively promising in Spain, Greece, and T\u00fcrkiye, with Italy appearing less promising.</p><p>In Spain and Greece, the major producer Avramar intends to implement electrical stunning this decade. Specifically, Avramar has publicly committed to implementing, by 2027, electrical stunning for 100% of its production in Spain and 50% of its production in Greece. Currently, Avramar has electrical stunning installed on two of its farms in Greece (Avramar, 2023). Likewise, the producer Philosofish has begun installing on its harvest vessels electrical stunners produced by Ace Aquatec (The Fish Site, 2023).</p><p>In T\u00fcrkiye, a study conducted by the NGO Future for Fish provides insight into the status of electrical stunning at Turkish fish farms (Future for Fish, 2023). In collaboration with academic advisors, Future for Fish contacted and visited numerous aquaculture companies, accounting for 76% of sea bass and sea bream production in T\u00fcrkiye. A key finding showed that the majority (90 percent) of Turkish aquaculture companies already have electrical stunning systems. Companies with electrical stunning systems do not always use those systems; only around 40% of companies use electrical stunning for over 95% of the harvesting process. The primary driver of Turkish farmers' adoption of electrical stunning systems is demand from customers (e.g. retailers in the UK and the Netherlands). Turkish fish farmers tend to use electrical stunning systems that are produced and sold in T\u00fcrkiye, by companies such as Smilefish. Such systems have not been evaluated scientifically for their efficacy in successfully and consistently stunning fish.</p><p>In Italy, a survey of 21 sea bass and sea bream farms found that none of the surveyed farms have adopted electrical stunning (Clemente et al., 2023). The slaughter methods used by the surveyed farms were \"thermal shock\" (20 farms) and \"asphyxia in air\" (one farm).</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mLeqZy9uX6fTogmXL/w6b1vob59r8p4eeageiq\"></p><p><i>Figure 1.

Industry perspectives and implementation of humane slaughter</strong></h1><h2><i>3.1 Industry perspectives</i></h2><p>The most detailed information about industry perspectives on humane fish slaughter in T\u00fcrkiye comes from the recent stakeholder survey conducted by Future for Fish (Future for Fish, 2023). The main challenge with electrical stunning systems in T\u00fcrkiye is the initial installation aboard harvest vessels. The research also found other valuable insights. Implementing electrical stunning in operations leads to a decrease in labour due to \u201cbetter organisation and occupational safety on harvest ships\u201d, better product quality, and possibly a longer shelf life. Fish producers believe that electrical stunning is more challenging for sea bass in particular, due to the fish getting stuck in the fish pumps leading to haemorrhages on their skin. A similar survey was conducted in Italy, but the negligible uptake of electrical stunning in the Italian sea bass and sea bream industry means that the survey did not produce detailed information about farmers' views on those species (Clemente et al., 2023).</p><h2><i>3.2 Economic costs and funding</i></h2><p>To our knowledge, there are three main manufacturers of electrical stunning equipment for European aquaculture: Ace Aquatec (United Kingdom), Optimar (Norway), and Smilefish (T\u00fcrkiye). Surveys of manufacturers reveal that installing an in-water electrical stunner aboard a harvest vessel would cost a farmer somewhere in the vicinity of 150,000 \u20ac, though stunners produced by Smilefish may cost a different amount (European Commission, 2017). This cost excludes expenses associated with any necessary modification to ships.</p><p>When it comes to making the investment necessary to purchase electrical stunning equipment, company size emerges as a critical factor (European Commission, 2017). Larger enterprises, with more resources, may integrate stunning equipment more seamlessly, while smaller companies might face greater challenges, indicating a need for tailored strategies. A stakeholder consultation conducted by the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Fisheries found that European fish farmers most often mention investment funds as the main obstacle to adopting new techniques, followed by justification of need (Pavlidis et al., 2023). Direct funding is mentioned as one of the most useful tools for mitigating potential impacts when transitioning to new fish welfare requirements..</p><p>Funding through the European Maritime Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund offers support, with specific budgets allocated for animal health and welfare improvements (e.g. 4M \u20ac for Italy, 8M \u20ac for Spain, and 560,000 \u20ac for Greece). A considerable portion of the funds allocated during the 2014 - 2020 period for aquaculture innovation remained unused. A lack of transparency in grants hitherto makes it difficult to assess how much money was used on animal welfare improvements. There are however known examples of the previous budget being used for a sea bream and sea bass stunning pilot in Spain. In general, transparency in funding allocation is a concern, with unclear information on recipients and purposes.&nbsp;</p><h2><i>3.3 Engineering aspects</i></h2><p>The physical, economic, and geographical details of sea bass and sea bream farms vary by country (Figure 1). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that some countries will have an easier time than others in implementing electrical stunning. Spain in particular appears to have farms located in areas of the ocean with large waves, which could mean that air entering the fish pumps could be an engineering challenge in that country (Figure 1B). Size differences of fish can also cause the design sizes of pumps to be exceeded, likely leading to fish suffering and damaged product (Future for Fish, 2023).</p><p>The difficulty of installing new stunning equipment onboard vessels depends on the space available on the vessel, the type of vessel, and the installation requirements for the stunning equipment. Research and data on the types of vessels being used is scarce. Vessel types include platforms, workboats, and larger wellboats. All vessel types have been observed used for harvesting operations. Platforms are floating barges equipped with outboard engines and a crane. Workboats are larger, better equipped vessels ranging from 12 to 30 metres (Paleo et al., 2000). For larger, workboat-type vessels, installation of stunning equipment and fish pumps should not pose large problems. Equipment can be installed on deck or, for in-water stunners beneath deck. For smaller platform vessels, the limited deck space and the lack of below-deck area pose problems for installing a stunner and pump system. The pre-existing power on smaller vessels might not be enough to power both the crane and stunning system.</p><p>The study by Future for Fish found that 60% of interviewed farmers mentioned that stunning works faster than live chilling, meaning that stunning equipment may actually offer advantages for the harvest rate and associated labour requirements (Future for Fish, 2023). For some types of systems adding electrical stunning led to a slower harvest. Other technical obstacles include malfunctions in the equipment, long waiting times for spare parts and increased operating costs.</p><h1><strong>4. Discussion</strong></h1><p>As consumers develop an appreciation for animal welfare and its role as a component of sustainable food production, the priority placed on animal welfare by producers will only increase. In this report, we have examined the trajectory towards stunning before slaughter in European sea bass and sea bream aquaculture. The current progress towards installing electrical stunners aboard harvest vessels provides optimism, but succeeding in this policy goal will require concerted action by stakeholders throughout the supply chain (McAfee et al., 2019).</p><p>Sea bass and sea bream producers have expressed an interest in installing electrical stunners where this is economically attractive, and some producers have begun to do so (Avramar, 2023; Future for Fish, 2023; The Fish Site, 2023). However, success is greatest when there is a clear demand from retailers for stunned fish (Future for Fish, 2023). This mirrors the dynamic in other agricultural sectors like poultry and pork, where demand from retailers drives improvements in on-farm practices (Scrinis et al., 2017; Peacock and Mendez, 2020). As such, retailers have an important responsibility to ensure that their procurement policies account for consumers' increasing demand for animal welfare.</p><p>Likewise, producers are likely to respond to clear signals from government, whether at the national or the EU level. The EU is home to some of the world's most progressive pieces of animal welfare legislation, though legislation for the welfare of fish specifically has been lagging behind (McCulloch, 2018; Gim\u00e9nez-Candela et al., 2020). Nevertheless, the EU has expressed interest in legislation that would make stunning before slaughter mandatory for fish farmers (Dullaghan, 2023). The EU is also exploring the possibility of applying EU farm animal welfare legislation to imported meat products, which could have important repercussions for producers in T\u00fcrkiye who export their product to EU Member States (Dullaghan, 2023). When particular higher-welfare practices become mandatory, this can help ensure that all producers within a country have access to the same markets (Carey et al., 2017, 2020; Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2017). It can be useful for governments or other stakeholders to support farmers in the transition to higher-welfare practices by providing funding and other support, a strategy used successfully when installing CCTV in slaughterhouses in Great Britain (Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2017; Springlea, 2022). As such, support from stakeholders throughout the supply chain can drive collective action to improve the lives of animals used for food.</p><h1><strong>Acknowledgements</strong></h1><p>Figure 1B is generated using Copernicus Climate Change Service information.

Most of their conversation is about practical ethics, including the ethics of suicide, abortion, and war, and quite a lengthy discussion of karma/nirvana. It also made me think about how a greater appreciation of Buddhist ideas could be beneficial for the EA community.&nbsp;</p><p>My main points from this are:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Buddhists practice specific techniques (e.g. metta meditation) for extending our empathy to all sentient beings. The same techniques have helped me empasized with beings like insects or digital minds.&nbsp;</li><li>Principles such as the illusion of self could help us avoid hubris, and suggest that&nbsp;concepts like \u201chigh impact individuals\u201d rest on psychological delusions</li><li>The \u2018problem of moral obligation\u2019 doesn\u2019t seem to be comprehensible under a Buddhist ethical framework</li></ol><p>Prior to this, I have had some exposure with Buddhism, and lived at Tibetan Buddhist Meditation Centre. However, I have not engaged at all with the primary Buddhist Pali texts, so I'm uncertain if my interpretations of Buddhism here are accurate. This isn\u2019t a general overview of the philosophical differences/similarities between EA and Buddhism \u2013 for this purpose,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://philarchive.org/archive/BAKBAE-6#:~:text=For%20regardless%20of%20the%20short,to%20the%20preponderance%20of%20duh.\"><u>I recommend this&nbsp;</u></a>\u2013 or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XiYh7D9sJsjq324J8/buddha-was-an-effective-altruist#2__Delusions_are_inexhaustible__I_vow_to_transform_them_\"><u>whether the Buddha would have been an EA</u></a>. I\u2019m skeptical. I also don\u2019t go much into the (personal) psychological benefits of meditation.&nbsp;Thank you Gabriel for reading through this.</p><h1>Feeling Radical Empathy&nbsp;</h1><p>In Buddhism, Bodhisattvas are enlightened people who choose not to achieve nirvana, because they want to continue to work to relieve the suffering of all sentient beings.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XiYh7D9sJsjq324J8/buddha-was-an-effective-altruist\"><u>As noted elsewhere</u></a>, the \u2018<i>Bodhisattva path' </i>\u2013 which is particularly prominent in some Buddhist traditions&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"ie2u5vuyyhi\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefie2u5vuyyhi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnie2u5vuyyhi\">[1]</a></sup></span>\u2013 has a fair bit of overlap with the ~EA principle of radical empathy. Buddhist teachings give concrete advice for how we can extend our moral circle on an emotional level.&nbsp;</p><p>Buddhists give concrete insights about how to extend our empathy to other sentient beings \u2013 including those for whom it is difficult to extend our empathy towards. Take&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S03Q-M63Yt4\"><u>Metta Bhavana&nbsp;</u></a>(loving-kindness) meditation: traditionally, this practice begins with directing metta towards oneself, a close friend/relative, a neutral person, a difficult person, and eventually all sentient beings. I have found this practice beneficial for my personal wellbeing, as have other EAs I know. But, in addition, I have found this practice has enabled me to begin to sense the possibility of feeling empathy for beings I have a lot of trouble empathizing with: including insects, or future digital minds.&nbsp;</p><p>(This is not to suggest that the&nbsp;<i>Bodhisattva path&nbsp;</i>is an ideal for secular people, or should be accepted without question. I have come across Buddhists who have taken Bodhisattva vows and think the best way of improving the world is spending most of their life alone on meditation retreats.)&nbsp;</p><h1>Becoming Less Self-Centered&nbsp;</h1><p>Another key principle in Buddhism is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81#:~:text=In%20Mah%C4%81y%C4%81na%20Buddhism%2C%20%C5%9B%C5%ABnyat%C4%81%20refers,Dzogchen%2C%20Shentong%2C%20or%20Chan.\"><i><strong><u>\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i>or emptiness:&nbsp;the idea that all things are empty of intrinsic existence and nature. The principle that humans have no self is called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatt%C4%81#:~:text=In%20Buddhism%2C%20the%20term%20anatt%C4%81,be%20found%20in%20any%20phenomenon.\"><i><u>Anatt\u0101</u></i></a><i>.</i> Whilst I don\u2019t claim to have had any special personal experiences with either principle, my impression is that, within Buddhism, the experience of \u2018self\u2019 is not an on/off experience \u2013&nbsp;there are degrees of self/clinging to experience, and through meditation we can become less self-obsessed.&nbsp;</p><p>Why is this principle useful, in particular, for EAs?&nbsp;In the most obvious way, reduced self-concern makes people happier. In addition, reduced self-concern helps us be kinder people. My personal experience is through practicing loving-kindness meditation, I have fewer self-obsessive thoughts, and generally feel more positive about other people.&nbsp;</p><p>(It\u2019s important to note there are many pitfalls here \u2013 and I remember reading somewhere that spiritual people are more self-obsessed, on average. Buddhists call this problem&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritual_materialism#:~:text=Spiritual%20materialism%20is%20the%20belief,out%20or%20a%20euphoric%20state.\"><u>spiritual materialism</u></a>. I suspect everyone has met a spiritual narcissist at some point or another).&nbsp;</p><p>By practicing meditation, and hopefully avoiding spiritual materialism, Buddhism can help us become more self-centered in our acts of altruism, as Chao-Hwei describes.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"s064p4aqzb\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs064p4aqzb\"><sup><a href=\"#fns064p4aqzb\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Reduced self-concern links to another Buddhist concept,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da\"><span><u>Prat\u012btyasamutp\u0101da</u></span></a><span> or&nbsp;</span>codependent origination \u2013&nbsp;the observation that all things arise depend upon other things.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bbMMTFa3HN2SPApLC/critique-of-the-notion-that-impact-follows-a-power-law\"><u>Sarah Weiler has recently written</u></a> about the problem of hubris from beliefs that certain individuals are \u2018higher impact\u2019 than others. A Buddhist approach might be to recognise that \u2018individuals\u2019 don\u2019t exist in a fundamental sense; highly impactful actions depend on countless prior causes; and thus, hubris about \u201chigh impact individuals\u201d rests on a deluded sense of personhood.&nbsp;</p><h1>How Problematic is the Problem of Moral Obligation?</h1><p>As far as I can tell, this problem describes how moral properties can both (I) exist in the natural world, and (II) give normative reasons (\u2018oughts\u2019) for our actions. From this, JL Mackie argued that if moral facts existed, they would be \u2018queer\u2019 entities, unlike anything else in the natural world; so, a thorough-going empiricism should lead us to believe that all moral statements are false.&nbsp;</p><p>Singer sets out this problem using two different framings, both of which Chao-Hwei doesn\u2019t seem to understand. In Chapter 2, Singer describes the 'is-ought\u2019 problem: \u201cSome philosophers argue that you can\u2019t just move from the fact that this is in our nature to the moral judgment that this is what we ought to do ... If we cannot simply appeal to nature, how do we reach the judgment that we endorse compassion for those beings who are suffering, but we refuse to endorse hatred of outsiders?\u201d Singer describes his current position as follows: \u201cwe have to say that there is something like a self-evident perception, or perhaps \u201cintuition\u201d (that is the word that Henry Sidgwick uses) that enables us to see that relieving suffering is good and increasing suffering is bad. \u201d Chao-Hwei seems to interpret this question as a psychological one about how emotions and rationality interact: e.g. \u201camong will and reason and passion, which one is more dominant?\u201d</p><p>\u200b\u200bA similar interaction happens later on in the Chapter. Singer describes Plato\u2019s \u201cRing of Gyges\u201d, and asks \u201cWhat do we say to people whose attitude to others in need is \u201cI just don\u2019t care about them; they have nothing to do with me\u201d? How would you respond to that question from a Buddhist perspective?\u201d Again, Chao-Hwei seems to interpret this as a practical question \u2013 and recapitulates the question as, \u201chow do we persuade people to act altruistically toward strangers?\u201d.</p><p>In both cases Chao-Hwei didn\u2019t seem to understand what Singer is getting at.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps this is because Buddhists don't have a strong sense of moral \"obligation\":&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-indian-buddhism/\"><u>one article suggests that</u></a> \"it\u2019s not clear that Buddhist thinkers have a concept of moral obligation at all.\" This vibes with my personal experience with Buddhism. One Tibetan lama encouraged me against thinking in terms of \"should\" or \"ought\"s, and that, instead, a better psychological framing for my day-to-day actions is \"would like\".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This reminded me of other cases where common concepts to Westerners just failed to land amongst Buddhists \u2013 e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jackkornfield.com/self-hatred/\"><u>there is a story of the Dalai Lama</u></a> failing to understand how one of his students could have the emotion of \u201cself-hatred\u201d. It seems like there just wasn\u2019t a Tibetan translation for this. Perhaps \"moral obligation\" has a specific legalistic/Christian etymology. I\u2019d be interested to hear peoples\u2019 thoughts on this.&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"ie2u5vuyyhi\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnie2u5vuyyhi\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"ie2u5vuyyhi\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefie2u5vuyyhi\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;This ideal is particularly emphasized in Mahayana Buddhism, relative to Theravada Buddhism: as Chao-Hwei explains, practitioners in the latter tradition focus on personal liberation; those in the former tradition also want to attain enlightenment for the sake of others.

Sorry if it's not so great in English]</p><p>Ancient Stoics, such as the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and the former slave Epictetus, had a mental exercise called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/stoicism-philosophy-as-a-way-of-life/lets-talk-about-the-premeditation-of-adversity-2f7d40fbb7d0\"><i>premeditatio malorum</i></a> \u2013 the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visualiza%C3%A7%C3%A3o_negativa\">negative visualization</a>, or \"anticipation of adversity.\" It's about reflecting on what we fear may happen, such as illness, suffering, the death of loved ones, etc. For these philosophers, in addition to preparing for the worst, this allows us to focus on what is most relevant and that has value even if our fears materialize. Also, it would help to see that even in the worst situations, we still have control over our thoughts and attitudes, being able to act in accordance with virtue \u2013 which, for them, is what really matters.</p><p>I wonder if this practice would still be recommendable for the present day. Even if our lives are, on average, significantly better than those of Ancient Rome, it's plausible that this exercise tends to evoke more anxiety than serenity. A Roman citizen usually feared dishonor, slavery, or even the destruction of his city (and these risks were very concrete). In such cases, another exercise recommended by the Stoics is to take a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stoichandbook.co/cosmic-perspective/\">cosmopolitan, or even \"cosmic\" perspective</a>, seeing ourselves and our surroundings as part of a larger whole (of the human species and of a world that persists after we\u2019ve passed away) thus diminishing the relative importance of these fears. But the idea of a well-ordered universe of ancient philosophy has been&nbsp;<a href=\"https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/author/mpigliucci/#:~:text=That%20idea%20stemmed,to%20eating%20habits.\">buried by modern science</a>, and today any of us can conceive of what Prof.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCGa6uvO0_8\">Alexey Dodsworth</a>, following Hans Jonas, calls&nbsp;<a href=\"https://filosofia.fflch.usp.br/sites/filosofia.fflch.usp.br/files/posgraduacao/defesas/2019_docs/2019_Tese_Alexey%20Dodsworth%20Magnavita%20de%20Carvalho.pdf\"><i>sumum malum</i></a><i>,&nbsp;</i>the very collapse of civilization and the extinction of mankind \u2013 like the simple-minded fisherman played by Max von Sydow in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luz_de_Inverno\"><i>Winterlight</i></a>, who despairs at the possibility of nuclear war. We don't even need to see a Bergman movie to have a similar existential crisis; many have experienced something like this during the recent pandemic, and others have a similar sentiment about the looming climate catastrophe (like Jonathan Franzen\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/what-if-we-stopped-pretending\"><i>What if we stopped pretending?</i></a>). Even more dramatic scenarios are shown in&nbsp; recent <i>pop</i> TV shows, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_%26_the_End_of_the_World\"><i>Carol and the End of the World</i></a> and the long-awaited&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_Body_Problem_(s%C3%A9rie_de_TV)\"><i>The Three-Body Problem</i></a>.</p><p>Rather than offering solace, contemporary philosophers point out that we have even more to lose than the billions of lives that would be destroyed. In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_We_Owe_the_Future\"><i>What We Owe the Future</i></a>, Will MacAskill teaches that we would also lose all the potential value of the future of human civilization \u2013 the countless lives that could exist, in situations as different from ours as we are today different from the ancient Romans. Samuel Scheffler, in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Scheffler#:~:text=most%20recent%20book%2C-,Death%20and%20the%20Afterlife,-%2C%20based%20on\"><i>Death and the Afterlife</i></a>, argues that since much of the value of our lives depends on things that will occur after our deaths, the prospect of future extinction would rob us of that value. Imagining that other humans will still be around after I am gone allows me to give relatively less importance to my own limited individual existence, and more to what is \"beyond myself\" \u2013 which comforts me about my mortality, and makes me want to be remembered in a positive way by future generations. That would be lost if it turned out that we are the last generation.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, as everyone (Stoic or not) would agree, thinking seriously about the worst can help one avoid it. Before joining wealthy survivalists in New Zealand (as described by Evan Osnos\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich\"><i>Doomsday Prep for the Super-Rich</i></a>), it might be interesting to discuss the subject with risk-management bureaucrats. In the U.S., since a year ago, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/117/bills/hr7776/BILLS-117hr7776enr.pdf#page=1290\">law</a> has required the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency to systematically analyze&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risco_catastr%C3%B3fico_global\">global catastrophic risks</a>. Similarly, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/governance/toolkit-on-risk-governance/goodpractices/page/theuksnationalriskassessmentnra.htm\">UK's National Risk Assessment</a> also includes some of these threats, however unlikely they may be.&nbsp; In Brazil, we could reflect on the issue in discussions on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.br/mcti/pt-br/acompanhe-o-mcti/noticias/2024/01/grupo-de-trabalho-interministerial-debate-estrategia-geral-para-plano-clima-adaptacao\">Climate Plan</a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pndc.com.br/\">National Plan for Civil Protection and Defense</a>, and we could take advantage of the G20 meetings and, next year, COP-30 to address the issue with other countries.</p><p>In addition, a cooler assessment allows us to measure how unlikely societal collapse and extinction really are. In most catastrophic scenarios, despite all the suffering, there would still be people with lives worth living (at least from their perspective \u2013 many of us are too accustomed to the comforts of modern civilization to appreciate the <i>Mad Max</i>-like post-apocalyptic routine). This suggests the importance of preserving some aspects of our culture that can positively affect the future trajectory of society \u2013 such as biodiversity, natural resources, technologies, and even ideas and cultural goods.</p><p>Even our extinction does not necessarily imply the destruction of all intelligent life; if life exists on other planets, it would likely not be affected. This has been pointed out as the main reason for extraplanetary expansion: to create space colonies as a \"plan B\". However, in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com.br/City-Mars-Settle-Thought-Through/dp/1984881728\"><i>A City on Mars</i></a>, the <i>geek&nbsp;</i>couple Zach and Kelly Weinersmith argue that, despite all the <i>hype</i>, early expansion could carry more risks than advantages \u2014 especially if, for instance, it increased the chances of global conflict. For quite a while, there shall be no \"Planet B\" for us.</p><p>But now consider&nbsp;<a href=\"https://brasilescola.uol.com.br/geografia/paradoxo-de-fermi.htm\">Fermi\u2019s paradox</a>: if the galaxy has been around for so long, and if there are so many stars and planets out there, it's likely that life has arisen elsewhere, and that it has expanded; but then, why haven't we found a sign of it? One possibility, explored&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/O_Problema_dos_Tr%C3%AAs_Corpos_(romance)\">in the books</a> that gave rise to Netflix\u2019s <i>Three-body problem,&nbsp;</i>is that the universe is a dangerous place; sooner or later, advanced species would be struck by what astrobiologists call the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.astronomy.com/science/the-great-filter-a-possible-solution-to-the-fermi-paradox/\">Great Filter</a>. Perhaps intelligent life is something fragile, or it has a tendency to self-destruct; this is what we could conclude if we found evidence of an extinct non-human civilization. Therefore, <i>if</i> (or rather, <i>when</i>) we ever go extinct, it would be interesting that some human records survive - so that if at some point there is another intelligent life in the universe, it would have a chance of finding them. In that case, such records would be the last (and perhaps most important) impact humanity would have on the universe, conveying, however implicitly, a benevolent warning: \"We existed, and we perished; it may have happened to others, and someday it may happen to you.\" This thought makes me want to look at the stars more often.</p><p>Finally, I wish to remark that I sympathize with those pragmatic minds who might feel some aversion to the speculative character of these reflections; if you are one of them, I thank you for your patience in reading me to the end. These people are protected from the anxiety that this exercise can generate; on the other hand, they may be more susceptible to despair or confusion when the next \"imponderable\" occurs, like von Sydow's fisherman. I certainly wouldn't want everyone to think the same way; but if at least those in power seriously considered (or listened to those who do) the risk of global catastrophes, we could feel safer \u2013 and perhaps even less divided. And this I grant to the Stoics: I feel great admiration, even envy, for the <i>sane person&nbsp;</i>who can seriously contemplate the possibility that the world will end, without feeling regrets \u2013 knowing that even this does not subtract from the value of their actions.</p>", "user": {"username": "Ramiro"}}, {"_id": "Gazt9dKDD4isGcupy", "title": "Helping animals or saving human lives in high income countries is arguably better than saving human lives in low income countries?", "postedAt": "2024-03-21T09:05:12.294Z", "htmlBody": "<h1 data-internal-id=\"Summary\">Summary</h1><ul><li>I think the following will tend to be the best to maximise the cost-effectiveness of saving a human life:<ul><li>Accounting solely for the benefits to the person saved, saving human lives in countries with low, but not too low, real gross domestic product (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_gross_domestic_product\">real GDP</a>) per capita.

So it increases animal suffering nearterm, but makes it peak and end earlier, such that there is an overall reduction of:</p><ul><li>For an advancement, \u201ccurrent annual animal suffering\u201d*\u201cadvancement in years\u201d (top left graph).</li><li>For a speed-up, \u201cmean annual animal suffering until it ends\u201d*(1 - 1/\u201cspeed-up factor\u201d)*\u201ctime until animal suffering ends in years\u201d (bottom left graph).</li></ul><p>Consequently, it appears that saving human lives will tend to decrease animal suffering if it increases economic growth. Likewise for other interventions. Furthermore, the above expressions suggest the reduction in animal suffering is larger for greater \u201ccurrent annual animal suffering\u201d. Since higher real GDP per capita <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/meat-consumption-vs-gdp-per-capita\">is</a>&nbsp;associated with greater consumption of animals, and this is linked to greater animal suffering, saving human lives in higher income countries will tend to decrease animal suffering more.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref15\">Nevertheless, greater economic growth does not necessarily lead to less animal suffering (nor <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/differential-progress\">differential&nbsp;progress</a>). I guess it does <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/expected-value\">in expectation</a>, but there is lots of uncertainty, and work explicitly focussed on improving animal welfare is still very much worth it. Michael St. Jules commented, rightly in my view, that<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"15\" data-footnote-id=\"a5jdigw6ey\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa5jdigw6ey\"><sup><a href=\"#fna5jdigw6ey\">[15]</a></sup></span>:</p><blockquote><p>It\u2019s worth pointing out that it\u2019s largely due to the work of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/effective-animal-advocacy\">effective animal advocacy</a>&nbsp;[EAA] that animal suffering is being reduced. This hasn\u2019t happened for free or by default; we\u2019re paying for it.</p><p>Some EAAs are interested in slowing the growth of factory farming or worst practices (like cages) and possibly even preventing it where it\u2019s not yet very established and animal product consumption remains low, including in parts of Africa (see work supported by the <a href=\"https://openwingalliance.org/\">Open Wing Alliance</a>, the <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/animal-welfare\">EA Animal Welfare Fund</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacyafrica.org/\">Animal Advocacy Africa</a>,&nbsp;like <a href=\"https://www.utunziafrica.org/\">Utunzi Animal Welfare Organization</a>).

So saving human lives will tend to decrease animal suffering if this follows from boosting economic growth.</p><p>Here is the answer from ChatGPT 4 to the question just above (with minor changes to the text format):</p><blockquote><p>The question of whether saving human lives increases economic growth is multifaceted and involves understanding the complex interplay between health and economic development. There are several key aspects to consider:</p><ul><li>Workforce Productivity. Improved health typically leads to increased productivity. Healthy individuals can work more effectively, take fewer sick days, and contribute more actively to the economy. This increase in productivity can lead to higher economic output.</li><li>Demographic Changes. Saving human lives, especially in younger populations, can contribute to a demographic dividend. This term refers to the economic growth potential that can result from shifts in a population's age structure, mainly when the working-age population grows larger relative to the number of dependents.</li><li>Human Capital Development. Health is a component of human capital. When people live longer and healthier human lives, they can invest more in education and skill development, enhancing their employability and potential for innovation, which is vital for economic growth.</li><li>Healthcare Costs. On the flip side, increasing life expectancy can raise healthcare costs, especially in ageing populations. This scenario can strain public health systems and divert resources from other economic activities.</li><li>Dependency Ratio. If life-saving measures primarily extend the human lives of the elderly, this could increase the dependency ratio (the ratio of non-working-age to working-age people). A higher dependency ratio can place a financial burden on the working population, potentially slowing economic growth.</li><li>Empirical Evidence. Studies have shown a positive correlation between health improvements and economic growth. For example, research by the World Health Organization and others suggests that investments in health lead to economic growth by improving productivity, reducing healthcare costs, and enhancing the quality of human capital.</li><li>Long-Term Perspective. The impact of saving human lives on economic growth may vary in the short term versus the long term. In the short term, rapid population growth due to decreased mortality can strain resources, but in the long term, it can lead to a more skilled and productive workforce.</li></ul><p>In summary, while saving human lives can certainly contribute to economic growth, the exact nature of this relationship depends on various factors, including the age distribution of those whose human lives are saved, the overall health of the population, and the capacity of the economy to absorb and utilise a growing workforce.</p><p>See also:</p><p>\ud83d\udcc8 <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=impact+of+healthcare+on+economic+growth\">Economic impact of healthcare</a>&nbsp;to explore how health improvements can drive economic growth.</p><p>\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83c\udfeb <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=human+capital+theory+in+economics\">Human capital theory</a>&nbsp;for understanding the role of health in human capital development.</p><p>You may also enjoy:</p><p>\ud83c\udf0f <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=global+health+initiatives+and+their+impact\">Global Health Initiatives</a>&nbsp;to see how worldwide health programs affect various economies.</p><p>\ud83d\udcca <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=demographic+dividend\">Demographic dividend</a>&nbsp;for insights into how population dynamics influence economic growth.</p></blockquote><h2 data-internal-id=\"Eating_less_animals_and_more_whole_food_plant_based_increases_economic_growth\">Eating less animals and more whole-food plant-based&nbsp;increases economic growth</h2><p>Economic growth may increase animal suffering nearterm via resulting in greater consumption of animals.

As with the EAT-Lancet diet, adopting healthy global diets would imply a major reduction in the consumption of animals. \u201cThe HGD diet included (per day) a minimum of five portions of fruits and vegetables (16), fewer than 50 g of sugar (16), a maximum of 43 g of red meat (28), and an energy content of 2,200\u20132,300 kcal, depending on the age and sex composition of the population (29)\u201d.</li><li>\u201cThe last two scenarios also assume a healthy energy intake but based on observed vegetarian diets (30, 31), either including eggs and dairy [lacto-ovo vegetarian (VGT)] or completely plant-based [vegan (VGN)]\u201d. I think this means the vegetarian and vegan diets are not optimised for health. They just correspond to the diets vegetarians and vegans actually follow in the real world.</li></ul></li></ul><h1 data-internal-id=\"My_overall_view\">My overall view</h1><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref19\">If improving nearterm welfare is the best proxy to increase future welfare, helping animals is arguably better than saving human lives in low income countries.
